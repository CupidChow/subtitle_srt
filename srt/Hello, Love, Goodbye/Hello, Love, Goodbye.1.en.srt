1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>Some places we stay in forever.</i>

2
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>Some places are mere stopovers.</i>

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>Just like Hong Kong.</i>

4
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>Two years here if you have a contract.</i>

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,649
<i>Then you leave.</i>

6
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>Here in Hong Kong, time is gold.</i>

7
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,176
<i>Good morning, fellow Filipinos!</i>

8
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,931
Faster! She'll be late!

9
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,477
Too cold!

10
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,896
Too hot!

11
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,817
One, two, three.

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,194
I told you to chew 15 times.

13
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,948
-OK.
-Fifteen times!

14
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,453
<i>Here in Hong Kong,</i>
<i>as long as you're moving,</i>

15
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>you'll live.</i>

16
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,959
<i>Once you stop, you'll starve.</i>

17
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,710
<i>So, you can't slow down.</i>

18
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,136
<i>You have to keep moving.</i>

19
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,852
How much is this?

20
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,521
-For my goddaughter!
-Thank you.

21
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,285
Too spicy!

22
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,244
I know!

23
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,288
I'm doing my very best! I'm trying!

24
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,915
Damn it!

25
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,921
JOY, MY BOSS SAID YES. YOU CAN
START NEXT WEEK. ARE YOU IN?

26
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,552
<i>But one day,</i>

27
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,096
<i>in the middle of all the noise and chaos…</i>

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,639
Stop!

29
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>…in a place where no one stays still…</i>

30
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,758
Cousin Joy!

31
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,426
Mary Dale!

32
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,347
My gosh, Joy! Everything's confusing here.

33
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,932
Good thing you picked me up!

34
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,726
You're lucky it's Sunday,
the day off for all domestic helpers.

35
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,603
So, I'll see your mom!

36
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,481
Your dad wants to give her a gift.

37
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,982
She doesn't come here anymore.

38
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,442
Oh, why?

39
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,532
Hey, Joy!

40
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,243
Joy, you need to send anything?

41
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,911
No, not now.

42
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,454
But there's still so much space!

43
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,165
You know Sally is so good at packing!

44
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,717
Wow! It's like they have
their own apartments.

45
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
Hey, there's free space here!

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,681
Yeah, but that's reserved.

47
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,599
And we respect that
and stay on our own turf.

48
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,892
Everyone has their space.

49
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,437
The Kapampangans. The Bisayas.
The Ilonggas. The Warays.

50
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,231
-Excuse me.
-It's so fun here!

51
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,193
Yeah, it's like a big feast here
every Sunday!

52
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,612
There are Filipinos having fun
from here to there!

53
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,032
Good thing the Chinese don't reprimand us
for blocking the way.

54
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,785
Well, there are over 200,000
Filipino workers here.

55
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,912
So, the Chinese let us have Central
once a week!

56
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,164
You jerk!
I've been slaving like hell here,

57
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,543
and you're burning all our money
on gambling and on some slut!

58
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,505
I'm going home!
I'm gonna kill you and your mistress!

59
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,509
I told you a million times already.

60
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,052
Open an online bank account

61
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,722
so you can monitor every transaction!

62
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,473
You're so stubborn!

63
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,310
Remember, Mary Dale,
be smart with your money.

64
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,228
As soon as you get your salary,

65
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,023
withdraw, then deposit it
in your local account.

66
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,524
Then split it up.

67
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,110
For your mom, your dad,
your sister, your brother.

68
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:23,072
For whatever bill, budget well.
And track your remittances, too.

69
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,826
Most importantly, Mary Dale, save well.

70
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,828
So, in case of any emergency,
you'll be ready.

71
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,748
Yes! It's so hard
to earn Hong Kong dollars!

72
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,749
OK.

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,752
Joy, your dad sent this over for your mom.

74
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,129
Joy!

75
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,590
Oh! Sis! Wait!

76
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,887
Happy birthday, sis!

77
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,555
Thank you.

78
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,932
Silly! It's not her birthday.

79
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,350
We greet customers that way

80
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,686
so it's not obvious
we're selling on the side.

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,854
It's not for free?

82
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,190
Nothing's free anymore!
Everything costs money.

83
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,108
We gotta earn more, although it's illegal.

84
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
Why is it illegal?

85
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,822
Well, when you have this code on your ID,

86
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,909
it means that you can only work
as a domestic helper.

87
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,911
Unless, of course, you're a resident here,

88
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,789
or you marry a Chinese or a resident.

89
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,832
Here, once a domestic helper,

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,251
-always a domestic helper.
-A domestic helper.

91
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,461
Is that what I ordered?

92
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,797
Even if I graduated
with a degree in Education,

93
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,299
I'm not allowed to teach?
I can't apply here?

94
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,426
Joy is a nursing graduate.

95
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,596
She can't be a nurse here,
even though she's brilliant?

96
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,640
That's why she's flying off to Canada!

97
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,016
She's going to Canada?

98
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,643
Yep! In Canada, she can be a nurse.

99
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,729
She can earn four times more
than she's earning here.

100
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,190
She can also petition
so her family can all live there.

101
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,984
Plus, her dad can get
free medical treatment.

102
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,569
You need to pay for that.

103
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,613
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

104
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,907
I will leave you the money.
Keep it for your bills.

105
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,612
How much do you have?

106
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,244
It's the police!

107
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,123
-Oh! Girl, put a headband on me.
-What's happening?

108
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,333
-That'll look good in you.
-You're so annoying.

109
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,502
Remember, any extra gigs are prohibited.

110
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,716
Joy. You need a side job?

111
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,843
Alice! Joy's contract is almost ending.

112
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,262
Don't get her into trouble now.

113
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,930
Don't worry about it!

114
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,642
This is it.

115
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,938
-Don't look over there.
-Yeah, you're right, we might get lost.

116
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,110
This place is nicer
than my employers' house.

117
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,532
I think those are your employers.

118
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,700
They're fighting!

119
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,329
They're not fighting.
That's just how they talk.

120
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,539
-I want to go home.
-You'll get used to it.

121
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,083
Anything they say, just let it pass.

122
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,919
Two years will go by fast.
You can do this.

123
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,129
It's OK, Mary Dale.

124
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,714
Go, Mary Dale!

125
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,641
-Just like me when I was young.
-That's a very long time ago!

126
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,850
Shut up!

127
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,270
I wore an off-shoulder blouse
so I'd look younger.

128
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,289
Ma'am, have you eaten already?

129
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,083
I'm OK. Joy?

130
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,767
I can't afford to pay you anymore.

131
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,063
<i>If it's expensive, don't buy it.</i>

132
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,774
But, Dad, if I don't have
the complete uniform,

133
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,192
they'll mark me absent.

134
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,987
<i>And my old shoes really don't fit anymore.</i>

135
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,822
<i>I'm sorry, Joy.</i>

136
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,907
I can buy it.

137
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,036
Joy, my basketball shoes
also have holes in them.

138
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,706
<i>Joey, don't add to your sister's expenses!</i>

139
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,917
<i>The cheap ones will do, Dad.</i>

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,293
It's OK, Dad.

141
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:15,716
Your rubber shoes,
let's buy them in Canada. OK?

142
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,636
We'll buy them in Hong Kong
when we get there.

143
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,972
OK. Wherever.

144
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,558
<i>Right! Yours can wait,</i>
<i>they're just a luxury anyway.</i>

145
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,685
<i>-That's harsh.</i>
<i>-Mine is for school!</i>

146
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,188
-Bought it, Liezel.
<i>-Really?</i>

147
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>Thank you, Joy! Love you!</i>

148
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,573
<i>-Take care, my daughter!</i>
<i>-Bye, I love you.</i>

149
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,574
<i>Love you, Joy!</i>

150
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,592
JOY, MY BOSS SAID YES. YOU CAN
START NEXT WEEK. ARE YOU IN?

151
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:14,108
YES, ALICE. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

152
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,707
-And always remember to…?
-Smile!

153
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,086
Now, go invite customers,
but not the police.

154
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,046
We don't want a random check. OK, go!

155
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,927
Can we get three martinis,
please, charged to you?

156
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,845
Joy!

157
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,931
Hey. Mary Dale, what are you doing here?

158
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,684
Relax, I picked her up.
I'll bring her home.

159
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,853
All she does is sob and complain
in the group chat!

160
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,646
I wanted to cheer her up, Joy!

161
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,899
We were taking her
to the "alley-alley" bars,

162
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,775
but she wanted to see you first.

163
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,197
We told her we couldn't afford drinks
here, so we're not staying.

164
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,990
Look at that American!

165
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,368
But that Arab's more perfect for me.

166
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,747
-Pick Mary Dale! Wow! Tall and handsome!
-Hey! She's still a virgin.

167
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,415
Even better!

168
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,336
Instead of slumming
with the very few Filipinos here,

169
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,796
you can reject them!

170
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,259
So, that's why I didn't see
many guys at Central.

171
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,763
Yes! Filipino men are so few here
that somehow they all become handsome.

172
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,973
Especially to the eyes
of lonely women, right?

173
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,434
I don't want hookups.

174
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,978
What I'm looking for is love!

175
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,274
What good is love when you know it's
going to end after your contract's up?

176
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,902
Wait. Why so bitter?

177
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,529
This is all JM's fault!

178
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,030
Who's JM?

179
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,074
LDR. It didn't work.

180
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh, that's why.

181
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,579
Take her home.
She's only been here a week.

182
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,748
-What will your employers say?
-Oh, come on, Joy!

183
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,083
-Here, Joy.
-For whom?

184
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,209
For you.

185
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,587
-From whom?
-Don't ask. Just drink it.

186
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,382
We're really going
to have some fun tonight!

187
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,841
Joy, this is it!

188
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,177
I'll drink it if you don't want it!
It looks expensive!

189
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,971
Let me have some.

190
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,184
Just smell. Don't drink.

191
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,855
Who is it from?

192
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,703
Here comes love!

193
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,793
Joy, they might check you!

194
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,170
Joy, run! Joy!

195
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,171
Go run, Joy!

196
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,381
Joy, don't run!

197
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,742
Let's go this way.

198
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,059
Stop.

199
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,673
Joy Marie Fabregas.

200
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,152
Comrade!

201
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,116
Why didn't you even try
those drinks I made for you?

202
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,539
Ouch! That hurts!

203
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,383
I don't see her.

204
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,136
That girl runs so fast.

205
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,394
Hey, wait. Joy Marie! My name is--

206
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>-Where are you? Customers are waiting!</i>
-I'm on my way back.

207
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,119
Thank you, Sally,
for bringing Mary Dale home.

208
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,996
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:16,011
JOY, MY BOSS SAID DON'T COME BACK.
HE MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE. SORRY.

210
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,367
I need a job, not a friend.

211
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,707
Four months to go, Joy.

212
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,753
Just four months.

213
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,923
<i>Joy Marie Fabregas.</i>

214
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,008
Which spot is she gonna take
in your calendar?

215
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,846
Your Thursdays are still free.

216
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,806
Just drink this.

217
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,349
What's this?

218
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,188
Oh! Nice!

219
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,528
This is competition-worthy.

220
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,988
-Manager, taste it.
-Let me try.

221
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,365
You should join.
I'll register you in the contest.

222
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,784
-Pass.
-Again?

223
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,580
Bro, if you join and win,
you'll be famous.

224
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,624
Once you're famous,
you can put up your own bar!

225
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,711
-I'm going to register you!
-Where is that competition?

226
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,045
In the US, Manager.

227
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,299
Ethan Del Rosario!

228
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,138
Stay away from my girlfriend!

229
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,183
Was that the husband of Miss Tuesday 2017?

230
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,893
I'm OK. He only got my arm.

231
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,896
Or Miss Wednesday 2019's husband?

232
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,481
That's long over.

233
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,859
How many more times
will this happen, Ethan?

234
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,112
You know my job's on the line
whenever I cover for you.

235
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,156
I'm already turning over a new leaf.

236
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,408
I've heard that a million times.

237
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,119
If only you'd take
your job here seriously,

238
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,038
you would be the manager now, not me!

239
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,664
Nice.

240
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,335
You keep on job-hopping.
Girlfriend-hopping.

241
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,046
One day, you'll meet your match.

242
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,990
<i>Good morning to everyone</i>
<i>except Joy Marie Fabregas.</i>

243
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,409
<i>Yes, you, Joy Marie Fabregas!</i>

244
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,746
<i>Ethan Del Rosario is looking for you</i>

245
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,706
<i>because you stole a kiss</i>
<i>from him last night!</i>

246
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,793
<i>Please return it. Have mercy on him.</i>

247
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,046
<i>He will wait for you tonight</i>
<i>at the crime scene.</i>

248
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>Will Joy show up and return the kiss?</i>

249
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,469
Kiss?

250
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,765
Kiss? Keys!

251
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,726
Annie in Tagalog, you say it as <i>susi.</i>

252
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,607
She's lying.

253
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,409
-WHO'S ETHAN?
-KISS? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

254
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,786
-OMG COUSIN! IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?
-HOW WAS THE KISS?

255
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,871
-HEARD YOUR NAME ON THE RADIO!
-I WANNA MEET HIM!

256
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,790
-SPILL THE BEANS!
-YOU VIXEN! WINNER!

257
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,129
What is this news that is rocking

258
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,964
the whole DH community
in all of Hong Kong?

259
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,674
I'm so giddy!

260
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,259
-Come on!
-Joy!

261
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:46,638
Silly girl! I told you to run, not flirt!

262
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,890
But, hey, happy flirting, sis!

263
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,603
-I'm so excited for you, cousin!
-Let's go. I'll take you home.

264
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,563
Let's go.

265
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,733
Find a regular vendor. That way,
if you make a mistake, you can return it.

266
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,068
What about Ethan's kiss?
Will you be returning it?

267
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,654
We're already online friends.
How about you?

268
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,242
<i>Hello, Joy? This is Ethan.</i>

269
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,369
How did you get my number?

270
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,664
<i>-When are you going to return the kiss?</i>
-It wasn't me.

271
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,625
I think I gave it to him.

272
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,961
Hey, good one, girl.

273
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,653
I'm working. Stop bothering me.

274
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,989
You're the one bothering me
because of that kiss.

275
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,201
So, I will wait for you tonight, OK?

276
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,795
That kiss meant nothing! OK?

277
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,468
<i>Come here, please!</i>

278
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,555
-What happened?
<i>-Come, please.</i>

279
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,474
OK, Mom, I'm coming.

280
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,739
-Big sis!
-Where's Mom?

281
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,450
-Joy?
-Mom!

282
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:34,204
See? If I don't sound like I'm in trouble,
you won't come and visit.

283
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,581
Fix your toys.

284
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,875
So hot!

285
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,589
That's new.

286
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,343
I just bumped myself.

287
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,387
I'm not stupid.

288
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,306
A normal lovers' quarrel.

289
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,975
You just don't get it.

290
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,978
Besides, he makes it up to me.

291
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,187
Gorgeous, right?

292
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,107
Dad also has a gift for you.

293
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,191
Here.

294
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,532
How nice. Do you want it?

295
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,327
Go on, take it.

296
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,084
I got the job in Canada, Mom.

297
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,503
I've already paid for the work permit.

298
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,088
I'm just coming up with the balance.

299
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,049
Once I get there,
I'm going to petition for you to join me.

300
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,013
But in six months,

301
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,265
Wayne and I will have been married
for seven years.

302
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,475
I'll be a resident by then.

303
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,895
I can get your brother and sister.

304
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,273
In six months, you are divorcing Wayne.

305
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,152
But who will take care of Wayne?

306
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,447
What about us?

307
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,783
What about Papa?

308
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,374
We're leaving Hong Kong, Mom!

309
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,563
Joy!

310
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,108
So, did your mom like the bag?

311
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,278
Super! But I stole it from her.

312
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,822
<i>Oh, no. She took it from Mom.</i>

313
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,242
She's using it now.

314
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,036
Next time, you should give it
to Mom yourself, Dad!

315
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,871
<i>You know what, Joy?</i>

316
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,915
<i>Dad is already counting down the days</i>

317
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,833
<i>until he sees Mom again.</i>

318
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,835
<i>I really miss your mom!</i>

319
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,171
<i>How sweet!</i>

320
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,715
Dad, I'll just take you all to Canada.

321
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,384
Canada, again?

322
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,887
I don't like it there. Why bother?

323
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,853
I have a friend there, Dad.
She used to work here.

324
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,815
She says the benefits
are so much better in Canada.

325
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,442
Joy, your mom and I have been planning--

326
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,569
We'll be a complete family in Canada.

327
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,904
In Hong Kong, too!

328
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:22,789
But how sure are you
that Mom will divorce her husband?

329
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,208
Did she say she won't?

330
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,421
<i>Your mom loves me!</i>

331
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,507
<i>She only married that Chinese employer</i>

332
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,343
<i>so she could become</i>
<i>a permanent resident there.</i>

333
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,887
<i>Once she is,</i>
<i>she'll petition for me to join her.</i>

334
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:43,393
<i>I'll only believe what you're saying</i>
<i>if your mom tells me herself!</i>

335
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,021
But until she does,

336
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,398
we're all going to Hong Kong!

337
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,942
Dad!

338
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,500
How are you?

339
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,299
Joy, this is Janet. My wife.

340
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,139
What's up?

341
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,974
-On vacation?
-Honeymoon.

342
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,852
Actually, it's a late honeymoon.

343
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,730
This is a trip that's long overdue.
It was a gift for our wedding.

344
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,566
We finally got this chance,
since our contract ended in…

345
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,151
-Dubai. Yes.
-Dubai! Yes.

346
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,112
Still working there?

347
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,406
We'll go home to the Philippines
after this trip.

348
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,658
We already bought a house in Cavite.

349
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,662
Great!

350
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,706
You?

351
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,416
Also on vacation?

352
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,835
No.

353
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,383
Which hospital? In the ER?

354
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,096
No.

355
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,351
I'm a DH here.

356
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,444
I ended up just like my mom.

357
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,717
You've been hogging the bathroom too long!

358
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,386
Are you there? OK.

359
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,763
-I'm coming.
-What are you saying?

360
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,891
I'll go ahead. Enjoy.

361
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,269
Yes, babe. OK.

362
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,645
I'm going down.

363
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,605
You there already?

364
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,152
-Should I meet you in our spot?
-OK, yeah. See you.

365
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,445
I'm on my way.

366
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,918
Annie.

367
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,173
Annie!

368
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,843
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,264
How could you forget the time?
What if she'd walked by herself?

370
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,099
What if she'd gotten hit by a car?

371
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,773
Too loud! Too noisy! Too hungry!

372
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,107
Mom, not now!

373
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,211
You don't! You were careless!

374
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,104
We have a deal!

375
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,509
I'M JUST HERE.

376
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,773
Are you ready to return it now?

377
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,401
Let's go.

378
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,182
Here.

379
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,810
Thought you might be hungry
'cause I'm starving.

380
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:31,240
Actually, I just wanted to know
if my body odor is that bad,

381
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,368
that it made you burst into tears?

382
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,286
I'm not that kind of girl.

383
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,707
I'm just going through something.

384
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,501
I needed to let off some steam.

385
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,714
So, you just used me?

386
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,227
Joke! Just joking! You're too serious.

387
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,520
It's fine, I don't mind!

388
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,610
You're not new here in Hong Kong.

389
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,284
So, you're a resident.
You have a comfortable life.

390
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,120
And a lot of time to fool around.

391
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,254
My father's the resident.

392
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,425
The one fooling around is me.

393
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,552
Still waiting to become a resident.

394
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,473
So, you're used to it?

395
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,643
You know the drill, right?

396
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,147
What happened earlier meant nothing.
It ends there.

397
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,107
I'm clearing that up now.

398
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,902
This is new.

399
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,072
Usually, I say those lines to girls.

400
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,950
So, this is how it feels

401
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,412
Does it hurt?

402
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,206
It makes me…

403
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,666
want to know you more.

404
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,423
Now I know why girls won't leave
when I tell them it's just sex.

405
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,135
Because it's more intriguing
when someone pushes you away.

406
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,096
So, next time,

407
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,308
when I don't like a girl, after sex,

408
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,644
I should tell her, "I love you,"
so she'll freak out and leave.

409
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,984
But I like you.

410
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,950
Aha!

411
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,368
Gotcha!

412
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,537
You're the one scared of love!

413
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:43,956
Why?

414
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,424
Don't worry, it won't happen ever again.

415
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,762
Why? What really happened, anyway?

416
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,139
You're the expert, right?
Why do you do it?

417
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,517
For me, it's just plain sex.

418
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,895
Sometimes out of loneliness,
sometimes out of boredom. But…

419
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,146
definitely no feelings.

420
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,108
But you…

421
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,527
You had so many emotions back there.

422
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,447
In all those feelings you had,

423
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,326
I was wondering
if there were also any feelings for me.

424
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,662
No to love.

425
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,996
It's a waste of time.

426
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,585
So, you've been brokenhearted?

427
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,504
Come on.

428
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,881
Tell me what happened.

429
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,883
Let it out.

430
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,309
You know,

431
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,771
they say it's easier to open up
to a stranger

432
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,690
because with them, you can be honest.

433
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,365
Fine, I'll start.

434
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,327
I have two younger brothers.

435
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,414
I'm the eldest, but I'm also the dumbest.

436
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,500
See this tattoo?

437
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,839
This is the eternal proof
of my foolishness when it comes to love.

438
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,465
See that?

439
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,554
"Tanga." (Stupid)

440
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,182
That's "Tanya."

441
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,225
That's a Y, not a G.

442
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,479
I wanted to have it erased,
but I just covered it up.

443
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,235
I just keep covering it up.

444
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,447
Some people call me…

445
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,450
a loser.

446
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,703
So, I just live up to that name, a jerk.

447
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,139
Sometimes I just want to be selfish

448
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,486
That I need to do this
because I need a job.

449
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,114
Because we don't have money,
and my family needs it.

450
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,201
So, even if I don't like it,

451
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,536
I just have to do it.

452
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,625
Choice is only for the rich.

453
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,513
I want to tell everyone, "Screw you!"

454
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,276
I love you all, but damn!

455
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,568
What about me?

456
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,240
Do you know what I go through in this job,
just so I can support everyone?

457
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,743
I'm a college graduate. But what do I do?

458
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,245
I clean toilets.

459
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,375
You can call me ambitious,

460
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,836
but I have dreams bigger than this!

461
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,599
Is that wrong?

462
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,525
Well, at least you know what you want.

463
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,529
Me? Even at my age, not a clue.

464
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,326
I am useless.

465
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,875
So, you're not useless.

466
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,512
Because you bring joy to a person like me.

467
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,979
I can't see it.

468
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,233
Where is that joy?

469
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,368
In four months.

470
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,332
Joy isn't there.

471
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,886
A little smile. See!

472
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,350
In Canada.

473
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,060
Then, in America.

474
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,231
Hong Kong is not so different
from those places.

475
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:06,320
There, people like us have a choice.

476
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,571
There…

477
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,367
For my family.

478
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,369
Do you know that feeling?

479
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,547
I don't have extra time for you.

480
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,132
I'm chasing after my future.

481
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,466
Wait.

482
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,010
The future is a long time from now.

483
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,068
Hey! Wait! Easy, hey! Joy!

484
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,696
I need to go home before my ward wakes up!

485
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,947
Can I see you again?

486
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,920
Hurry up and leave. I'm tired.

487
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,755
I'll sleep here, too.

488
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,674
You were just lying like a starfish!

489
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,593
I did all the work a while ago.

490
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,845
When can I see you again?

491
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,056
Go back to work. OK, hurry.

492
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,059
Hey, you have a letter
from the US embassy.

493
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,227
It looks important.

494
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,080
Still Joy?

495
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,166
I thought she was just for one day?

496
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,133
I thought her name was Joy?

497
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,093
Maybe it's her surname?

498
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,271
Good morning, grandmother.

499
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,315
Too late!

500
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,192
Sorry.

501
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,824
I can't sleep because you're not here.

502
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,512
Too lucky!

503
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,578
What a pest!

504
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,752
<i>Remember, fellow Filipinos!</i>

505
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,589
<i>The Miss Central 2019 pageant</i>
<i>is a couple of Sundays away!</i>

506
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,548
I'm joining!

507
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,801
<i>Organizers are calling for participants,</i>
<i>as big prizes await the winners.</i>

508
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,720
Please hurry. I'm at the meetup place.

509
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,763
<i>-OK.</i>
-OK.

510
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,474
-He sounds like a monkey mascot.
-Joy!

511
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,727
Joy, did you hear the radio announcement?

512
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,062
You should join the pageant
for extra money!

513
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,565
Even if Joy desperately needs money,

514
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,609
you'll never ever see her dance,

515
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,861
nor sing, nor walk the catwalk.

516
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,237
It's impossible!

517
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,615
As impossible as her having a boyfriend!

518
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,367
Nothing is impossible
for someone who believes!

519
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,122
What are you doing here?

520
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,876
I told you last night,
I want more time with you.

521
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,127
Last night?

522
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,379
Oh my God, Joy, you went to him!

523
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,423
Go home. I'm meeting a customer.

524
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,938
I'm here! Where's my power bank?

525
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,156
Payment?

526
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,368
-Funny.
-My change?

527
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,828
His change!

528
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,164
Give him his change!

529
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,833
Where are you? I'm here.

530
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,210
Yes! One down.

531
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,053
I don't have time for you.

532
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,930
You're wasting your time.

533
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,558
-Let's go. It's curfew.
-Joy, come on.

534
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,353
Go ahead, I still have an hour. Go, go.

535
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,146
Come, Mary Dale, I'll take you home.

536
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,232
I don't want to go home.
It's miserable there.

537
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,942
There she goes again with the whining!

538
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,861
Mary Dale, let's go. Suck it up.
We used to be just like you.

539
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,779
I don't want to.

540
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,073
Joy, come on. Let's go home, Joy.

541
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,324
Joy! Let's go.

542
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,785
I still have to sell what's left.

543
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,663
He bought everything. We're sold out.

544
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,086
So you can have time to rest.

545
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,397
You never run out of things to do?

546
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,984
And you don't have anything to do?

547
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,695
I plan to get your "yes"!

548
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,239
Are you deaf? Or do you have amnesia?

549
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,074
I told you already,

550
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,452
I'm leaving Hong Kong soon.

551
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,662
Perfect!

552
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:51,623
I don't like long-term relationships,
and you're leaving.

553
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,500
We're perfect for each other.

554
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,878
When you leave, then we're over.

555
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,050
I'm not going anywhere.

556
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,933
Wait! I'm still eating!

557
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,269
Wait!

558
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,397
Hold on! We haven't paid yet!

559
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,664
<i>Eleven.</i>

560
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,792
Twelve, thirteen,

561
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,837
fourteen, fifteen!

562
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,883
I'm sorry.

563
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:58,190
BE CAREFUL, A MAGICAL WIND MIGHT
TURN THAT "I LOVE YOU" FOR REAL.

564
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,157
Too hot!

565
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,476
<i>Thank God it's Friday, fellow Filipinos!</i>

566
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,521
<i>But for Ethan, it's thank God for Joy!</i>

567
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,110
-I can't understand her.
<i>-How special!</i>

568
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,197
Looks like she's turning into
your Miss Everyday.

569
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,701
Does she have other female friends?

570
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,035
Maybe we can meet them.

571
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,955
So handsome!

572
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,083
-You look hot with the camera.
-Yes.

573
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,961
So, if I were you, I'd buy the phone.
I also sell power banks!

574
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,921
Wait, why are you selling to me?

575
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,507
You earn three times more
than us domestic helpers!

576
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,842
-Jane!
-He earns times ten.

577
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,511
Who owes Ethan more?

578
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,430
Come on.

579
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,308
Cousin? Nephew?

580
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,476
-Joy.
-No? It's OK.

581
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,062
Joy, you're sold out!

582
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,858
All good.

583
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,484
You have time now.

584
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,403
Let's eat?

585
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,491
This is mine.

586
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,598
Hey! Wait!

587
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,141
-What's the rush?
-Joy, umbrella?

588
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,769
-No, thanks.
-What's the hurry?

589
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,438
If you really want more time with Joy,

590
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,857
Why don't you just hire her
back at the bar?

591
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,568
It's risky.

592
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,861
She can stay at the back.

593
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,446
Do you know how to wash dishes, Joy?

594
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,824
Yes! Pots, pans, I can wash anything.

595
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,202
Good plan right? Right?

596
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,203
Yes!

597
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,871
Yes? I'm the manager, right?

598
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:20,374
Shouldn't you be asking me first?

599
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,714
He's Woo, his assistant.

600
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,925
Joy, your throne.

601
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,052
So? Can you do it?

602
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,220
Definitely.

603
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,138
Just stay here. Don't go out.

604
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,890
There could be a random check anytime.

605
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,601
Now you're nervous?

606
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,896
Of course. He wants Joy here, too.

607
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,316
Will you be OK here?

608
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,279
Playing games?

609
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,864
No.

610
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,783
It's better to have Joy here.

611
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,827
At least I know
where she spends the night.

612
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,745
I can make sure she's safe.

613
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,540
What a hero!

614
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,499
Shut up!

615
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,848
I need to get something.

616
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,849
OK.

617
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,894
-I'll just get it.
-OK.

618
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,862
My turn.

619
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,530
Let me get it for you.

620
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,865
Thank you.

621
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,392
Oh!

622
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,978
You guys stuck?

623
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,689
It's OK. This is the "stuck-room" anyway.

624
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,279
You should've put up
a "Do Not Disturb" sign.

625
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,073
-All you do is disturb.
-Is this how it feels?

626
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,867
Your breath stinks!

627
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,828
The best bartender in town.

628
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,544
Go!

629
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,547
Yeah!

630
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,429
Did you see the best bartender in town?

631
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,640
Everyone was going wild for Ethan!

632
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,309
You know, he should really join
the bartending tournaments.

633
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,602
When he wins,

634
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,859
Oh, no. He's back.

635
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,237
He's gonna cause a scene again.

636
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,951
You're killing my buzz.

637
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,204
I want my brother to serve.

638
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,669
I want you all to meet my big brother.

639
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,361
-Don't!
-It's OK.

640
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,113
It's OK. I got this.

641
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,371
Nicer!

642
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,373
Smarter!

643
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,708
More obedient!

644
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,003
I'm younger, but I have direction in life.

645
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,630
I don't abandon people!

646
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,593
I've never wasted our dad's sacrifice
just to get the whole family here.

647
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,721
I obviously care about Dad more.

648
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,392
I took care of him when he got sick,
even though I also had school!

649
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:11,563
I am the one fulfilling your promise
to our younger brother!

650
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,524
And you? You're a loser!

651
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,821
-Let's go home.
-Then you run back home?

652
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,907
Because that girl left you?

653
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,283
Don't touch me!

654
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,855
Hurry, please.

655
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,360
OK.

656
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,740
It's only two years more.

657
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,037
<i>Are your employers more important</i>
<i>than your own family?</i>

658
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,539
-Next time. Go!
-Fine, I'll go home.

659
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,334
-Then what? We'll starve!
<i>-Come home.</i>

660
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,047
I haven't seen him.

661
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,217
Hey, Sally!

662
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,929
He hasn't been here.
We haven't heard from him.

663
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,056
He's in hibernation mode.

664
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,104
Boss, do you have any idea where he'd be?

665
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,192
Joy's not coming.

666
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,402
Neither is Mary Dale.

667
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,908
-Let's just stare at each other.
-Let's just stare at each other.

668
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,994
Thank you.

669
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,562
-Dad.
-Yes?

670
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,398
This is Joy, my workmate.

671
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,568
-Good morning, sir!
-Good morning to you, too!

672
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,695
This is Edward.

673
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,447
My brother.

674
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:35,934
I'll do it.

675
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,897
Joy? Is it Joy?

676
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,148
Yes.

677
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,360
Do you mind turning around?

678
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,655
You caught me bottomless.
It's embarrassing.

679
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,663
Don't be embarrassed, sir.

680
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,916
Someone once told me

681
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:04,045
that we should never be embarrassed
around strangers.

682
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,966
Because whatever they find out about us…

683
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:20,019
My mom and dad were bandmates
back in the '80s here in Hong Kong.

684
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,772
They worked hard
so that they could be residents.

685
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,776
Before my mom died,

686
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,405
my dad promised her

687
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,033
that he'd bring her three sons here
to become residents.

688
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,537
You know, to experience a better life.

689
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,875
I was 17 when I was petitioned to go here.

690
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,502
At 21,

691
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,963
I went mad.

692
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,017
She was a princess at Disneyland.

693
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,480
She wanted to go to the US
because she felt

694
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,274
that Hong Kong was too small for her.

695
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,484
She told me:

696
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,032
Of course you went with her.

697
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,369
I'm stupid, remember?

698
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,333
I was only three years short
of my residency then,

699
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,751
but I didn't care.

700
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,923
I know how much
I disappointed my dad then.

701
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:37,013
They were relying on me
to send our youngest brother to school.

702
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:41,976
But no,

703
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,270
I only thought of Tanya.

704
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,315
All I knew was…

705
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,404
You love too much.

706
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,616
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

707
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,160
When you love,

708
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,412
it's all or nothing.

709
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,042
If you hold back, then why love at all?

710
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,756
But I failed in the US.

711
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,883
It wasn't for me,

712
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,677
so she broke up with me.

713
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,220
She told me…

714
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,602
I lost myself and lost my self-esteem.

715
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,690
Even to her, I was worthless.

716
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,572
And at 24, I was caught for overstaying.

717
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:37,991
I was deported.

718
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,577
I was blacklisted.

719
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,082
When I returned here,

720
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,418
everybody had moved on.

721
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,628
I was back to zero.

722
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,006
But that's OK. I can accept that.

723
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,884
That's what I risked
when I left Hong Kong.

724
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,931
But what's really hard

725
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,851
is how much I disappointed my family.

726
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,980
Especially Edward.

727
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,285
I just wish I could make it all up to them

728
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,203
and atone for all my bad decisions.

729
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,628
I hope that this time

730
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,922
I can show my dad
that I am there for them.

731
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,427
And then, three more years.

732
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,390
Only three years left
until I become a resident.

733
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,313
So, I can't leave Hong Kong again.

734
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,327
don't go to Canada or America.

735
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,329
They won't let me in there.

736
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,296
Life doesn't stop there.

737
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,716
Whatever you want to do,

738
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,551
you can still do it.

739
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,680
It's not too late.

740
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,434
You think so?

741
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,900
Even to you?

742
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,121
<i>-Joy where are you? Your client is here.</i>
-She's on the way?

743
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,414
<i>She's already here!</i>

744
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,624
-Are you meeting someone?
<i>-Where are you anyway?</i>

745
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,168
You need the money. Go.

746
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,588
<i>Hey, Joy! Hey!</i>

747
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,465
<i>-Joy?</i>
-OK.

748
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,264
When will I see you again?

749
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,350
Wow, do you miss me already?

750
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,811
It's Jhim!

751
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,063
He's working alone at the bar. Poor guy.

752
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:34,751
Good, morning, fellow Filipinos!

753
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:39,046
We welcome you to Miss Central 2019!

754
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,841
Jhim! I think your Miss Monday, Tuesday,

755
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,427
Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday are all here!

756
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,971
Why are we here on a Sunday anyway?

757
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,808
Because Ethan's meeting
his Miss Everyday here!

758
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,976
Here?

759
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,394
In this crowd?

760
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,482
-Mary Dale, where's your cousin, Joy?
-I told her to meet us here.

761
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,858
Where's the other candidate?

762
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,486
Here! I'm the candidate!

763
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,112
You're joining?

764
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,990
I guess you really do need the money.

765
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,664
I am Alice May Dizon.

766
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,042
What's this? The bloated division?

767
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,603
Hey, it's Joy!

768
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,939
So, that's why she asked you to come here!

769
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,732
Beautiful!

770
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,526
Smart!

771
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,027
Hardworking!

772
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,280
And most of all… loving!

773
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:50,660
Standing in front of you
is the Joy of Marinduque!

774
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,079
What a beautiful life!

775
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,421
Just like in videoke,
follow the bouncing ball.

776
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,632
And round, and round!

777
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,384
And split!

778
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,986
I already got the…

779
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,195
Mom?

780
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,115
Mom? Mom!

781
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,910
I brought home some broccoli and noodles!

782
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:36,622
Mom!

783
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,937
This hidden talent
should've stayed hidden.

784
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,231
Keep it hidden!

785
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:41,228
Who do you think will win Miss Central?

786
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,288
She's gorgeous!

787
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,998
She's like a real queen!

788
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,166
Right?

789
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,503
And we're so proud because she
used to live in Hong Kong, too.

790
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,813
Good day, fellow Filipinos!

791
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,567
Ladies, I'll keep it short.

792
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,156
The world is just waiting for you

793
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,244
to show everyone what you can do.

794
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,418
Is she talking to you?

795
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,545
What a cruel friend.

796
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:55,845
Our Miss Central second runner up is…

797
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:06,480
Finally! She's been joining
the contest for ten years.

798
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,667
-Imagine, with that voice…
-She still won!

799
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:31,047
Our 2019 Miss Central is…

800
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,144
Mom! Can you see me?
I'm a beauty queen here!

801
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,984
-Hey, congrats! Good job!
-Thank you!

802
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,570
-Hey, thank you!
-Congratulations.

803
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,864
I didn't know
you had such a beautiful voice.

804
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:58,991
-You were great.
-I told you!

805
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,497
Picture, please!

806
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,208
You're my idol right now!

807
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:13,214
I hope I can be as successful as you are
when I get to Canada.

808
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,633
Oh.

809
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:24,850
So long.

810
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,688
You haven't changed, right?

811
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,734
Oh, there have been many after you!

812
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,581
Sorry, I can't.

813
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,083
I'm bringing them home.

814
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,042
No need.

815
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,089
We won't fit in the taxi.

816
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,425
-Come on.
-Bye, Ethan!

817
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,136
We're taking a cab?

818
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,387
No.

819
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,765
Smart!

820
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:07,143
Rich!

821
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:11,105
Will Ethan stay out with his ex?

822
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:14,191
We will find out tomorrow!

823
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,904
Yeah. You're nice, too.

824
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,699
Well, why didn't you let Ethan
bring us home?

825
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,492
He didn't have to stay with her.

826
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,954
I know why. You're jealous!

827
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,456
-Who's jealous? Joy?
-Yes!

828
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,833
She can't be jealous.

829
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,751
She's not his girlfriend, right?

830
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,837
She can't be his girlfriend.

831
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,131
You're still going to Canada, right?

832
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:39,341
So, what's their relationship status?

833
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,968
What are you two anyway?

834
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,435
-How unbelievable!
-How unbelievable!

835
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:04,867
Are you wearing makeup?

836
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,744
Joy, the strainer.

837
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,707
You're wearing makeup.

838
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,001
May I see?

839
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,212
Look at me.

840
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:19,256
Hey.

841
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,010
-Why can't you look at me?
-Stop it, Joy!

842
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:26,263
I mean, Ethan! We're at work.

843
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:32,519
Are you jealous?

844
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,570
It's bad to hide your feelings.

845
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,823
You can admit it, Joy.

846
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:53,791
Joy, you don't need to be jealous.

847
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,460
We just ate and talked. Then we left.

848
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:57,795
I didn't even bring her home.

849
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,675
Tanya and I are over.

850
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,134
Way over.

851
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,056
There can never be an "us."

852
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,224
Why not?

853
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,892
I already have so much on my plate.

854
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,936
I can't add you
to my list of responsibilities!

855
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,604
I won't be a burden. I'll help you!

856
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,690
I will leave Hong Kong soon.

857
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,108
Joy, you're still here.

858
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,234
Ethan, I'm leaving.

859
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,738
I'll love you
for as long as time will allow us

860
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,657
to love each other.

861
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,118
-I can't love you.
-But you already love me.

862
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,705
That "I love you" is real.

863
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:39,962
But, sorry, Joy.

864
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:49,054
Is that for real, too?

865
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,258
Faster! I can't be late for my meetup.

866
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,427
Slow down, Joy, this is so heavy!

867
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,471
You're such a workaholic!

868
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,806
If she could date her job,
she'd make it her boyfriend!

869
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,849
Hurry up, Gina!

870
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:37,394
Oh, so it's him!

871
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,229
Boyfriend?

872
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,731
Yes! Because…

873
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,900
Her job can't hug her but I can.

874
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,612
She has a boyfriend!

875
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,739
A boyfriend!

876
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:49,740
Hey!

877
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:52,326
Geez! Calm down, woman!
You're too excited!

878
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,496
Hey, where are you going?

879
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,540
Hey, Ethan,
two beers for table number five.

880
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,668
-Mark!
-I need a beer!

881
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:05,422
Alice, hurry up. For table number five.

882
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:07,925
That's for table four.

883
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,718
Hurry! Customers are waiting!

884
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,186
You're sweating.

885
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,274
Are you tired?

886
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,402
Not anymore.

887
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:31,115
Love fools!

888
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,117
You'll break up soon!

889
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,035
You're just jealous you don't have Joy.

890
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:40,040
-Hey! Give us some!
-Have you guys talked to Mary Dale?

891
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:43,168
All she says is,
"Boo-hoo, I can't take this anymore."

892
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,463
I told her, "Ha-ha, you can do it!"

893
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,757
Anyway, Joy, here are the products
you have to sell.

894
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,884
Wait! Hold on! Stop.

895
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,386
No more stress from work.

896
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,304
Are you buying everything again?

897
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,389
He's buying it all.

898
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,765
Not anymore.

899
01:13:58,642 --> 01:13:59,643
Then give it back.

900
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,898
So you won't have to do anything
illegal anymore.

901
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,154
On Sundays,
I just want you to rest like princesses.

902
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,490
More scoops, please!

903
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,582
It's delicious.

904
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:37,389
Oh, my gosh!

905
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,731
She has a boyfriend!

906
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,526
Hey, Joy, when you leave, I get Ethan, OK?

907
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,909
Are you giving me away?

908
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,162
Not yet…

909
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,788
OK.

910
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,082
-Let's share him!
-I get the…

911
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,375
-Let's share him!
-Let's go.

912
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,127
I get the…

913
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,378
Thank you.

914
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,429
You're putting up your own bar?

915
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,099
You think I can do it?

916
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,143
Of course!

917
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,811
I'll be your first customer.

918
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,107
Promise?

919
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,193
Do you drink?

920
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,992
The Canadians are so lucky.

921
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,869
They're getting a great nurse.

922
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,246
Right!

923
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,415
I hope my future patients
will be as sweet as you.

924
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,794
There's something wrong with your ring.

925
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,296
It should be gold. With a diamond.

926
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,339
Right, son?

927
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:57,052
-Dad.
-Good haul at work?

928
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,178
Not bad.

929
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,223
Come on, Dad, I'll take you home.
Time for your meds.

930
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,267
My nurse already gave me my meds!

931
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,476
She's great, right?

932
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:08,063
You flatter me too much, thank you.

933
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,277
OK, Dad, I'll go to bed.

934
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:17,906
Next time give us a discount, please.

935
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,825
Sure! Just leave good feedback
on the site.

936
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:20,742
Definitely!

937
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,246
Joy!

938
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,586
Here.

939
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,131
Almost there!

940
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:37,843
-Almost there, Canada!
-Great. Almost there.

941
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,973
Almost there.

942
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:50,522
You're resigning?
I thought you needed money?

943
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,568
If I scrimp on my salary this month,
I can make it.

944
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,612
Besides,
there might be more random checks.

945
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,780
I don't want you to be at risk anymore.

946
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,199
We'll miss you.

947
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,744
-But he'll miss you more.
-Right!

948
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,461
Thank you so much for all your help.

949
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:17,716
Bros, I'm planning
to apply for a bank loan.

950
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,427
Wow! Already?

951
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,179
Yes. But the processing takes forever.

952
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:25,307
And the loan is not enough
for the capital I need.

953
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,600
I know where this is going.

954
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,686
Come on!

955
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,522
You guys.

956
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:35,734
I just need some help with the capital.
Just to get me started.

957
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,487
I'll pay you back
as soon as I start earning.

958
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:41,323
I've also talked
to other potential investors.

959
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:42,783
Not the triad, right?

960
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:44,534
Of course not.

961
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,746
Come here.
I won't borrow from you. Don't worry.

962
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,623
-No? OK.
-No.

963
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,918
Ethan, why are you rushing this?

964
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,753
Starting a business is serious.

965
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,464
If that fails, you'll drown in debt.

966
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,926
I'll work hard. For the future.

967
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,386
Future with whom?

968
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:06,765
Bro, let me remind you,

969
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,934
Joy is leaving.

970
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,602
And you can't follow her.

971
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:12,813
But what if she stays?

972
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,899
What if I show her that
she doesn't have to go to Canada

973
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:17,317
to have a good life?

974
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,486
That I can give her
everything she needs here.

975
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,488
Bro…

976
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,657
I'll fight for this.

977
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:30,956
I'm here.

978
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:44,970
What floor is it?

979
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,307
This is exhausting.

980
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,287
More steps to come.

981
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,848
-Come here.
-What's up?

982
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:31,683
Take my hand.

983
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:50,952
It's beautiful.

984
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,373
Good morning!

985
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,591
Ma'am, noodles?

986
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,555
I'll take that.

987
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:16,102
Scram!

988
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,438
I'll pay you on payday.

989
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,606
Cheapskate!

990
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:22,192
-I hope you guys fall…
-What?

991
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,027
For each other!

992
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:25,987
What's this?

993
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,368
For our first anniversary, I promise

994
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,203
we'll be in my actual resto-bar.

995
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,080
But, for now,

996
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:39,584
it's a special soft opening
for my number one investor.

997
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:40,794
Me?

998
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,797
What did I invest?

999
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,800
Your love and faith in me.

1000
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,645
Wherever you want.

1001
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,504
And I hope she won't leave anymore.

1002
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:28,717
Just a wish.

1003
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,331
I already took out a loan for the bar.

1004
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:02,500
I'm fixing the location,
then the construction.

1005
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,503
Then I'll figure out the menu.
The permits are also in process.

1006
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,339
I'll start the marketing plan, too.

1007
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,178
If she agrees.

1008
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,848
Hopefully.

1009
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,224
Gosh.

1010
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,689
No, Edward. This bar is also for us.

1011
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,068
You go crazy over a girl

1012
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,278
and then you say it's for all of us.

1013
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,782
But in the end, instead of helping us,

1014
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,992
you make everything worse.

1015
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:38,495
-Edward.
-Joy is different.

1016
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:42,374
Joy isn't the problem, you are!

1017
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,209
What happens if you're abandoned again?

1018
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:46,169
You'll lose your head again.

1019
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,588
You'll lose all your money. Then what?

1020
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,800
Who has to pay for all your loans?

1021
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:52,884
Me?

1022
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:54,970
-I'll save you again--
-No, Edward.

1023
01:22:57,097 --> 01:23:00,475
I will save myself this time.

1024
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,561
I know I've hurt you,

1025
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,690
and I'm not asking you to forgive me now.

1026
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,610
But don't take away my chance
of making it up to you.

1027
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,199
I just need you to trust me.

1028
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,535
Even a little.

1029
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,366
I just got my visa.

1030
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,370
Can I talk to you?

1031
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:06,458
-I'll come over.
<i>-Don't come over!</i>

1032
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,210
<i>I'm at the grocery.</i>

1033
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,047
I really need someone to talk to, Mom.

1034
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:15,050
Which grocery is it? I'll go there.

1035
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,763
<i>Oh, don't. No! Don't come because--</i>

1036
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:20,889
-<i>Ouch! It hurts!</i>
<i>-</i>Mom?

1037
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:24,059
<i>Don't move. The needle might break.</i>

1038
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:44,746
Damn you!

1039
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,544
Wayne was kind enough to rush me here.

1040
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,671
Stop defending him, Mom!

1041
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,344
What is she saying?

1042
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,429
Can you excuse us for a minute?

1043
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:02,889
No, Mom!

1044
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:05,100
-Tell him the truth!
-Go!

1045
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:09,229
Tell him that this madness stops now! That
you are going home to your real family!

1046
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,855
I'm staying here.

1047
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,108
Mom, my visa was just released.

1048
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,193
You don't need to be a resident
here anymore.

1049
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,861
You'll go back to the Philippines,

1050
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,863
while I arrange for all of us
to live in Canada.

1051
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,283
I'm not going with you.

1052
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,578
Wayne is my husband now.

1053
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:30,917
What about Dad?

1054
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,923
Do you know how much he loves you?

1055
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:40,885
Is that so?

1056
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,264
He loves me?

1057
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,349
Is that why he gave me away?

1058
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,686
You're the one who wanted
to marry Wayne, Mom!

1059
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:51,104
That's what you all think!

1060
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,149
But that's not the truth.

1061
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,319
Right from the start,

1062
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,740
your dad knew that Wayne liked me.

1063
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,745
When he offered to marry me,

1064
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:09,747
I said no.

1065
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,334
What did your dad say?

1066
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:15,920
"Do it.

1067
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,798
For the kids."

1068
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,470
You could've said no.

1069
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:28,600
If I had, I'd have had to go home.

1070
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:33,813
We'd all have starved to death.

1071
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:44,157
I loathed myself.

1072
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,707
And I was in that situation

1073
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,753
because of your dad.

1074
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,507
So, all the love that I had for him…

1075
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,012
turned to hate.

1076
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:14,854
We needed it at that time,
but it doesn't mean that I wanted it.

1077
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:19,192
You think it's easy for me,
knowing that every day

1078
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:21,611
she's with someone else?

1079
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,405
That every night, she's in bed with him?

1080
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,742
But, Joy,

1081
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:30,662
I had an accident.

1082
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,081
<i>I went blind.</i>

1083
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,334
<i>I had no way to provide for the family.</i>

1084
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,712
I did what I thought was right

1085
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:42,507
for the family to survive then.

1086
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,637
So, what now?

1087
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:52,183
How will we become a complete family?

1088
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,269
We won't be.

1089
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,898
If your mom doesn't want us,
we can't do anything about it.

1090
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:17,166
Joy, wait.

1091
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,428
Dad doesn't want to go to Canada.

1092
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:35,226
All the dreams I've been building

1093
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,854
are going poof!

1094
01:28:40,606 --> 01:28:42,483
It's slowly falling apart.

1095
01:28:47,947 --> 01:28:50,491
Maybe the world is trying
to tell you something.

1096
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,913
Maybe it's saying,

1097
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,849
But I don't like my job here anymore.

1098
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,024
Then don't go back to your employer.

1099
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:32,825
Don't worry.
You don't need to shell out anything.

1100
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,160
I'll take care of everything!

1101
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,960
-the embassy will do a background check--
-Wait…

1102
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,755
Joy, you don't even have to worry
about Immigration.

1103
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:47,173
I'll figure that out.

1104
01:29:47,256 --> 01:29:49,217
What's important is
for you to come back here.

1105
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,265
What kind of person would that make me?

1106
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:59,393
An investor without any investment.

1107
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:03,564
That'll seem like I just used you.

1108
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,441
-I don't want that, Ethan.
-Joy, no.

1109
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:10,321
I'm happy to help you.

1110
01:30:10,404 --> 01:30:12,907
I'm happy to give you everything you need.

1111
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,244
As long as we're together.

1112
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:17,745
As long as you're beside me.

1113
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:26,587
Don't you want us to be together?

1114
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:28,714
I do.

1115
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:33,219
You love me, right?

1116
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:36,305
-That's not the question.
-Do you love me?

1117
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:39,684
Yes.

1118
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,230
In three years, I'll be a resident.

1119
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:45,815
We can get married.

1120
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:48,192
After that, you can do whatever you want.

1121
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,361
Do you want to bring
your whole family here?

1122
01:30:51,445 --> 01:30:52,989
You can work wherever you like.

1123
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:10,673
Why?

1124
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,515
I wonder where I fit in all those plans.

1125
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,350
Everything is for you!

1126
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,938
All your plans are for me,

1127
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,567
but you never asked what I wanted.

1128
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,152
What I needed.

1129
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,199
Why? What do you need?

1130
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:44,248
To achieve all my dreams for myself.

1131
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,250
The dreams I've always wanted.

1132
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,797
Isn't that selfish?

1133
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,933
But what about me? Us?

1134
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:07,855
You knew from the start
that I was going to leave.

1135
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:11,359
I never hid that from you. Right?

1136
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:14,153
So, I'm not enough to change your mind?

1137
01:32:16,656 --> 01:32:20,159
we'll love for as long as time allows us
to be together, right?

1138
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,370
So, no matter what I do for our love…

1139
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:27,959
No matter what I give you,
it's not enough to make you stay?

1140
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,090
So, you did all those things…

1141
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,719
just so I'd choose you?

1142
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:44,475
If you love me,
why are you making me choose?

1143
01:32:44,558 --> 01:32:47,228
If you love me,
why can't you choose me, Joy?

1144
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:52,108
Ethan, this is the first time
I'm choosing myself.

1145
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,112
I have to try.

1146
01:32:58,572 --> 01:33:00,700
I promise I'll come back.

1147
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:05,246
What if with that chance, I lose you?

1148
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,295
I'm scared to love that way again.

1149
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,174
I'm scared of the days

1150
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,593
that I won't be able to touch you.

1151
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,887
Every day I'll wonder what you're doing,

1152
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,347
who you're talking to,

1153
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:24,348
and who you're with.

1154
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,226
What if you meet someone
and that someone likes you?

1155
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,978
What if you like him back?

1156
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:43,617
Joy, I'm scared to love
only to be left behind again.

1157
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:58,090
I love you so much.

1158
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,177
I hope you believe that.

1159
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,349
But there are questions inside me

1160
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,226
that only I can answer.

1161
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:14,023
There's a part of me missing

1162
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:17,485
that can't be filled.

1163
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,533
Even by your love.

1164
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:00,444
I really want to say,

1165
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,614
"Yes, I'll stay here.

1166
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:08,369
I won't leave anymore
because I love you so much."

1167
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,375
But I can't promise

1168
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,670
that I won't be sad.

1169
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:23,175
That not a day will go by
without me thinking:

1170
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,181
That I won't resent you.

1171
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:33,227
That I won't have any regrets
for all the things I wasn't able to do

1172
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,438
because we loved each other.

1173
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:19,815
Let me guess.

1174
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,203
I saw Eric's itinerary.

1175
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:37,208
It'll be enrollment soon.

1176
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:38,751
When do you plan to send him home?

1177
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:44,256
Ethan, I can't afford it.

1178
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,884
-We have too many bills--
-I'll take care of everything.

1179
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:52,097
I'm keeping my promise
that we will all be together here.

1180
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:04,151
You'll have your own bar soon.

1181
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,281
Do I get a discount?

1182
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:37,601
Eric!

1183
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:39,520
Ethan!

1184
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:03,961
Someone is applying to be your nurse.

1185
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,094
Dad!

1186
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:18,058
My son!

1187
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:30,195
-Oh, Eric.
-Bro!

1188
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,697
You've grown!

1189
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:36,493
So? Are you just going to stand there?

1190
01:38:45,794 --> 01:38:47,004
Thank you, Ethan.

1191
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:53,218
your mom is looking down on us,
filled with joy.

1192
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:55,596
Her boys are finally all together.

1193
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:35,969
<i>It's been three days.</i>

1194
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:39,848
<i>She's been missing</i>
<i>and she hasn't gone home.</i>

1195
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:42,434
<i>She went to the market</i>
<i>and never came back.</i>

1196
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:45,312
<i>To our fellow Filipino,</i>
<i>Mary Dale Fabregas,</i>

1197
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,315
<i>if you can hear this,</i>
<i>your cousin Joy is worried.</i>

1198
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,317
Just text me right away if you see her.

1199
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:54,571
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Please, let us know where you are.</i>

1200
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:58,659
<i>Please come back home.</i>
<i>Many loved ones are worried about you.</i>

1201
01:40:02,496 --> 01:40:06,166
<i>I hope every time you drink,</i>

1202
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,127
<i>while you suck on your cigarette,</i>

1203
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,921
<i>while you waste all the money I've sent,</i>

1204
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,507
<i>I hope you think about</i>

1205
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:16,635
<i>how many meals I've skipped</i>

1206
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,430
<i>just to be able to send you</i>
<i>that huge amount.</i>

1207
01:40:22,891 --> 01:40:26,562
When a woman gives too much, she's stupid.

1208
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:29,606
But when she prioritizes herself,
she's bad.

1209
01:40:31,024 --> 01:40:34,236
Where do we need to place ourselves,
Ms. Vilma?

1210
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:35,612
I don't know anymore.

1211
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:41,368
Is love only expressed through sacrifice?

1212
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:46,248
Joy.

1213
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,251
Joy.

1214
01:40:49,334 --> 01:40:50,669
Mary Dale.

1215
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,337
I'm sorry.

1216
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:53,589
I'm really sorry.

1217
01:40:55,048 --> 01:40:59,094
I didn't know what to do anymore,
so I left.

1218
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:03,807
Hong Kong isn't for me.

1219
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,559
I'll just go home.

1220
01:41:05,642 --> 01:41:08,312
They'll sue you, Mary Dale.

1221
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:11,231
I'll talk to her employer.

1222
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:23,660
Sally said you're really leaving.

1223
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:32,795
What's your plan?

1224
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:35,839
The bar.

1225
01:41:36,548 --> 01:41:37,841
I'll push through with it.

1226
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:42,346
When I come back, I'll visit.

1227
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:54,483
I thought…

1228
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:59,613
it was better to talk to strangers
so there'd be no judgment?

1229
01:42:04,117 --> 01:42:07,079
Why? Do you need to tell me anything
that needs no judgment?

1230
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:21,426
Ethan, I love you.

1231
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:27,349
But for now, I love myself more.

1232
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:36,400
-I hope you can forgive me.
-Joy.

1233
01:42:39,444 --> 01:42:41,113
just because you have a dream.

1234
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:46,368
I hope you can forgive me.

1235
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:15,772
to deserve the chance you've given me.

1236
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:49,765
Someday,
our future selves will meet again.

1237
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:51,516
Right?

1238
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:54,306
So, are you ready for your three days,
two nights, Hong Kong tour,

1239
01:45:54,389 --> 01:45:57,976
all-expenses-paid
memories you'll bring with you to Canada?

1240
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:43,415
Let me see.

1241
01:48:12,777 --> 01:48:14,237
What's at the top?

1242
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:15,906
Trust me.

1243
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:53,151
The world is so big.

1244
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:02,118
I'm scared.

1245
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:05,247
You can do it.

1246
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:22,180
I'll come back, OK?

1247
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:27,852
I'll wait for you.

1248
01:50:06,224 --> 01:50:08,560
<i>Some places we stay in forever.</i>
