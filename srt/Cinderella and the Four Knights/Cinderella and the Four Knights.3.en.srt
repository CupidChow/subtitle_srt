1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,440
Cinderella and Four Knights

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,800
Jung Il Woo

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,640
Ahn Jae Hyeon

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,730
Park So Dam

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,480
Lee Jung Shin

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,980
Choi Min

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,900
Son Na Eun

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,130
Cinderella and Four Knights

9
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,657
Let's go.

10
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,848
Why are you acting like this over some damn urn?

11
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:36,917
You don't even appreciate what it's taken to raise you all this time

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,069
and your lying and efforts to alienate everyone?

13
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,613
I should have never raised someone else's child.

14
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,573
Everything will be fine once you're gone.

15
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:47,601
I'm... not your real daughter?

16
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:52,306
Your mother had you with someone else!

17
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,723
All right.

18
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:29,869
I'll make a special announcement from the chairman now.

19
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:33,330
From this day on, Ha Won will be living

20
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,990
with you all in the Haneul House.

21
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,685
What?

22
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,087
She's going to live here?

23
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:41,414
Really? For real? Why, though?

24
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,266
This is crazy.

25
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,247
When you said "everyone" before, does that include Kang Ji Woon?

26
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:50,448
Yeah.

27
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:52,584
Ridiculous.

28
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:56,254
Why bring back someone who said he didn't want to live here?

29
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:59,448
It also doesn't make sense to force a cheating playboy and his fiancee to live in the same house either

30
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:01,701
Here you guys go again.

31
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,378
This is something that the chairman decided.

32
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,954
Wow, this is ridiculous.

33
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:07,632
How are we supposed to live with a girl? It'll be so uncomfortable!

34
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,318
What is Grandfather thinking?

35
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,921
Well, I'm sure he has a plan.

36
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:14,623
- But he might not.
- He doesn't.

37
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:17,700
But, there's just one rule.

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,704
Dating is forbidden within Haneul House.

39
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,455
What do you mean by that?

40
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:25,491
Isn't she Kang Hyeon Min's girlfriend? So, what do you mean, "no dating"?

41
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,593
It's not like Kang Hyeon Min has only one girlfriend.

42
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:30,079
Well, duh.

43
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,748
Actually, Hyeon Min and Ms. Ha Won—

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Hyung! Wait!

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,470
Come with me.

46
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,134
Hyung, what's happening?

47
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,829
Let's be honest with everyone.

48
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,647
Wait, wait!

49
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:49,791
I thought you said we're forbidden to date her.

50
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,500
Think about it carefully.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,021
Wouldn't it be safer if we just let them believe that she's my fiancee?

52
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,197
Just look at them.

53
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,816
Don't you know that they'd go crazy for anything in a dress?

54
00:03:58,816 --> 00:03:59,617
Isn't that you?

55
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:03,512
You don't know it, do you? They're no joke.

56
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,175
Let's reveal the truth.

57
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,495
Come on, Hyung!! Can't you just go along?

58
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,530
I promise I can stop all of them from breaking the rule!

59
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:24,576
If anything should still happen, I'll give up all my credit cards. Deal?

60
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:26,194
You better keep your word.

61
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,246
Of course, I will! Hurry, let's go!

62
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,071
Where's Ji Woon?

63
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,606
He left. You know how he is.

64
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,777
At any rate, as long as Ms. Ha Won is here

65
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:45,421
dating within Haneul House is strictly forbidden.

66
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,340
Does that mean you have to break your engagement?

67
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm an exception.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,460
You're the most dangerous one of all.

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,071
You, in particular, be careful.

70
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:57,541
You heard him, right? I'm an exception. Ex-cep-tion!

71
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:11,441
Mom, stay here for just a bit.

72
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:14,844
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:25,087
Don't worry. I'll be just fine here until Dad isn't mad anymore.

74
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:17,540
You've now chosen to live as Kang Ji Woon.

75
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,877
It wasn't a choice. It was coerced.

76
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:30,878
I only came here because there's something I want to know.

77
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,083
Why are you trying so hard to get rid of "Han Ji Woon"?

78
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:44,100
What sort of man was my father that he abandoned my mother and me?

79
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,261
And why I was forced to live as Han Ji Woon.

80
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:51,391
I need to find all of this out for myself.

81
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:55,761
Sure, try and find out for yourself.

82
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,848
However, as long as you live under this roof,

83
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:01,575
don't try to oppose the chairman.

84
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,551
Why is there such a big dining room table when only three people live here?

85
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,932
Who are you?

86
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:38,521
Oh, um... I was hungry.

87
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:42,400
If you're new here you should've come and said hello first.

88
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,405
Why are you sneaking around like a stray cat?

89
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:51,726
Gosh, things have really gone downhill around here ever since Butler Kim left!

90
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:54,487
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,776
What's your name? How old are you?

92
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:03,329
My name is Eun Ha Won, and I'm twenty years old.

93
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:06,375
Call me Ms. Beolgyo.

94
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:11,196
Because I'm from Beolgyo, in the south. Do you know where that is?

95
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:12,830
Um, yes!

96
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,166
- It's famous for cockles.
- Yes.

97
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:20,897
You'll have a hard time if the young masters see you here.

98
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,623
Follow me.

99
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,230
Why are you so slow? Did you eat a turtle or something?

100
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,099
Hurry up!

101
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,110
Um, where are we going?

102
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,870
Shush! I told you, we'll be in trouble if we're caught!

103
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,326
All right, you can stay here from now on

104
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,528
so don't you dare move, and just stay here.

105
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,564
Honestly, I like it here much better!

106
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:50,210
Of course, you do. I'll bet you love it!

107
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,058
Why are you here, Miss?

108
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,184
Mister!

109
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,870
Oh, have you two already been introduced?

110
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,064
This young one will be working with us now--

111
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,116
She's not here to work.

112
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:07,460
What? What are you talking about?

113
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,363
She's the Chairman's special guest. Please mind your manners.

114
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:14,259
What? The Chairman's special guest?

115
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,094
Oh my, forgive me!

116
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:19,922
Oh, it's okay! I'm just here as a part-timer.

117
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,634
I'm not a special guest!

118
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:26,454
Oh my, it seems like I've made a terrible mistake.

119
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:29,415
Please forgive me.

120
00:10:29,415 --> 00:10:31,443
You should've said something sooner, Miss!

121
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,177
Let's go.

122
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:41,369
It's really okay. Don't worry at all, okay?

123
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,787
Bye!

124
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,580
Goodbye, Miss!

125
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:49,778
Weren't you being a bit much?

126
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:52,096
She's a lot older than me, too!

127
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:53,598
And yet, you were all like, "Please mind your manners."

128
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:55,625
That's not very nice!

129
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,545
All the employees in this estate must treat you with respect.

130
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:01,106
I'm just a fellow employee!

131
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:02,599
So people don't need to give me special treatment—

132
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,017
It's the chairman's command.

133
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:05,885
But still, she's much older than I am—

134
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:07,145
It's the chairman's command.

135
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,622
But still, it's not polite!

136
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,249
It's the chairman's command.

137
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:20,399
You haven't eaten yet?

138
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:05,712
Thank you for the meal!

139
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,080
Oh.

140
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,817
Would you like to have some with me?

141
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,316
What is it?

142
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:57,188
Hey, we're still "engaged," okay?

143
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:01,192
Stop talking nonsense.

144
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
You really have no fear as the only girl living in a house full of guys.

145
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,041
It'll be safer for you to live here as my fiancee.

146
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,226
How about you just back off?

147
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,946
Are you going to tell everyone that you put on that act for money?

148
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:17,858
It doesn't matter. It's what I chose to do back then, anyway.

149
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:21,104
Also, didn't you hear what Ajussi said before?

150
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,973
Dating is forbidden!

151
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:27,594
I'm not asking you to date me. Just pretend that you're my fiancee.

152
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:30,296
And why do you need me to do that, exactly?

153
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,300
Is this because I never paid you for the last time? Want me to pay you more?

154
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,178
I told you, I don't need your money!

155
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,938
Then you're going to do it for free?

156
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,625
Did you manage to fall for me in this short amount of time?

157
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,137
Put your hands up.

158
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,538
Okay.

159
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,119
Higher.

160
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,654
Even higher.

161
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:09,852
I said I'd protect you.

162
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,074
And I told you not to talk nonsense.

163
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,248
Hey! Thanks, girlfriend!

164
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,399
How much money did you get this time?

165
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,564
How much money did you get this time?

166
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:05,984
Kang Ji Woon, that loser!

167
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:11,206
Kang Seo Woo makes me feel at ease, though.

168
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,432
But Kang Hyeon Min is...

169
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,887
Ugh, what a player!

170
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:25,011
From this point on, dating within Haneul House is strictly forbidden.

171
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:29,541
Keep in mind that dating within the house can get you kicked out.

172
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,361
It's not like I'm crazy! Why would I ever date any of them?

173
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:35,181
Let's continue living separate lives okay?

174
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,299
And not bother each other.

175
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,690
What are you doing?

176
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,725
I thought you said you weren't coming back.

177
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,664
Let's try to see as little of each other as possible.

178
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:53,908
I want that too. Honestly, I'd love it if you would just ignore me.

179
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:59,172
But seriously, why did you come back?

180
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,159
Mind your own business.

181
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,090
♫  Don't come any closer. ♫

182
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,330
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

183
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,640
♫  Go far away. ♫

184
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,220
♫  A sad dream always ♫

185
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,040
It hasn't changed a bit.

186
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,260
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

187
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:08,790
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

188
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,000
♫ like a strong wind blowing ♫

189
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:21,510
♫  Even each moment I take a breath hurts ♫

190
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:28,110
♫  My love cannot be stopped. ♫

191
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,984
But seriously, why did you come back?

192
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:40,056
I have to find out why I was forced to live as Han Ji Woon!

193
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,950
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

194
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,260
What is it?

195
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,690
Gosh. Ow!

196
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,754
Ow, my head! My head.

197
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:27,879
That's right. I slept here last night.

198
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:43,186
Good morning, Nation's Jackpot Girl! Did anything happen after yesterday?

199
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:48,340
I moved into Haneul House. I'll tell you everything later.

200
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,488
Wow! That's insane! Send me a pic! Send me a pic!

201
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:55,189
A photo?

202
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,545
One, two, three.

203
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,137
What the heck? You can totally see into my room!

204
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:19,914
What the heck!

205
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,919
And what about...

206
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:30,617
Oh my gosh!

207
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,514
What the heck? Who is that?

208
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:43,888
Hey! I'm not exactly appropriately dressed right now.

209
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:47,250
I understand that you want to see me, but let's see each other later!

210
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,929
That's... his room?

211
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:56,952
My room... What the hell?

212
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:59,921
They're so close! You can see straight into my room!

213
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,414
Oh no!

214
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:05,393
Then, whose room is that over there?

215
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:12,075
Who is it? Who is it?

216
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:16,337
Why are you looking into someone else's room?

217
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,757
Um, it's not like that...

218
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,349
Then get lost.

219
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:34,572
That's my room.

220
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:38,577
That's Kang Hyeon Min's room.

221
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:42,263
That's Kang Ji Woon's room.

222
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:46,918
What? I'm surrounded on all sides!

223
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:16,072
Put the vegetables and other things like that on top, and the seafood...

224
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:28,584
Wow. This is crazy.

225
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:40,230
Why aren't you eating?

226
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,591
I feel kind of bad, eating before anyone else.

227
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:46,519
Don't worry and eat. None of them will come.

228
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,288
Why not?

229
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:52,767
Because the three of them have yet to sit down for a meal together.

230
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:57,580
Not even once? What do you do with all of this, then?

231
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,400
We have our way of taking care of it.

232
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,653
Wow, what a waste!

233
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,730
So eat as much as you want.

234
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,446
It's the chairman.

235
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:16,332
Aloha!

236
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:17,917
Hello, Chairman!

237
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:22,046
So, how was your first night at Haneul House?

238
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:25,775
Um, I'm not sure yet.

239
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:30,305
I see. All right, then. Try having a meal with all of them.

240
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:31,689
What?

241
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,659
Eat with them?

242
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,304
That's your first mission.

243
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,983
Well, I'll be in touch! Aloha!

244
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,898
Contract

245
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,526
What is this?

246
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:55,129
It's a contract that the chairman had prepared.

247
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:56,523
A contract?

248
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:59,784
Yes. I'll explain it to you briefly.

249
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:01,353
You'll be provided with a bonus

250
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,380
every time you successfully complete one of the chairman's missions.

251
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,423
A bonus?

252
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:06,041
Yes.

253
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:09,052
The reward will be proportional to the difficulty of the mission.

254
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:12,129
- What?
- But if you fail the mission

255
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:14,273
you must leave Haneul House.

256
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:15,616
Oh.

257
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,654
And as I told you yesterday, dating is strictly forbidden.

258
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:24,125
All you have to do is refrain from dating anyone.

259
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,994
All right.

260
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:33,977
- Oh, about her...
- Huh?

261
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:35,712
About that girl, Ha Won.

262
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:39,674
I'm sure she won't last a week and will crawl back here.

263
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:42,902
Don't you dare let her back in.

264
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,472
Of course not!

265
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,158
But, um... Honey.

266
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:52,245
Did your past wife really cheat on you, and...

267
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:56,057
Don't ever bring that up again!

268
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:58,409
Oh, okay. Sure.

269
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,196
Yoo Na! Dad's leaving!

270
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,048
It's fine. Don't wake her up.

271
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:07,585
This time, I'm working on constructing an apartment, so it may take a while.

272
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:09,462
I'll call you later.

273
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:12,331
All right. Be careful!

274
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,301
Yes.

275
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,021
Oh, are you calling because you saw the flyer?

276
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:28,248
Looking for Mr. Kang Yeong Jin, who lived at Yeongak Apartment, Unit 308

277
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:31,576
You used to live at Yeongak Apartment ten years ago?

278
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:37,165
Did you know Mr. Kang Yeong Jin, who lived in Unit 308?

279
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:39,659
Yes! He used to be a Taekwondo master.

280
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,844
Do you know him?

281
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:45,882
Yes! Yes! Where are you now?

282
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:53,548
Haneul Group.

283
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:57,393
Wait, Haneul Group?

284
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,822
What are you doing? Who is this?

285
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:04,859
Is it okay if I take Ms. Eun Ha Won's belongings?

286
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:13,151
Please, have some tea.

287
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,969
No, thank you.

288
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,930
Oh. All right.

289
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:23,019
But how did our Ha Won come to live at Haneul House?

290
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,364
She received an invitation to do so from Chairman Kang Jong Du.

291
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:29,484
She was invited by the chairman?

292
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:32,512
- But, why?
- You mean that girl, Eun Ha Won did?

293
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:34,881
I will provide you with the details at a later time.

294
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,808
I'll be leaving now.

295
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:38,710
Wait, already?

296
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:44,290
Wait. Yoo Na! Give him a proper farewell.

297
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,993
He's the General Secretary for Haneul Group!

298
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:50,304
Oh. Goodbye!

299
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:53,349
Oh, yes. Did her father go somewhere?

300
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,222
I feel like I'm doing something really important right now.

301
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:12,310
Shall I get started now, then?

302
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:25,031
What's so hard about getting them to eat a meal together?

303
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:26,315
Yeah!

304
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:35,700
How is there not a single family photo in such a huge house?

305
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:41,598
Hey, Ms. Celebrity! I picked this up at the hotel.

306
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,749
Oh, really?

307
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,077
I was looking for this for a really long time!

308
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:57,638
But, did something happen last night?

309
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:00,524
Why?

310
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:04,945
You seemed like you were crying.

311
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:08,733
Oh. I wasn't crying.

312
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,319
It's just because I got caught in the rain.

313
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh! I see.

314
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:19,619
I thought that something happened with your family or something.

315
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:23,323
Why did you think that?

316
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:25,525
Huh?

317
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:31,055
Oh, um, just because.

318
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:34,818
Yeah. Just because.

319
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:39,171
Deleting my texts wasn't an accident, was it?

320
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:42,918
Of course, it was an accident!

321
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:48,231
Were those texts that bad?

322
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:51,551
Huh?

323
00:28:55,956 --> 00:29:00,084
Yeah. I deleted them because I thought they would hurt your feelings.

324
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:04,681
I mean, is that Yoo Na or whoever really a part of your family?

325
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,725
It's the first time I've seen sisters who had such a bad relationship!

326
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:11,488
Our relationship isn't as bad as your relationship with your cousins, though.

327
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,323
What are you talking about?

328
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:15,800
I heard that the three of you have never even eaten together.

329
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,145
What kind of family is that?

330
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:21,848
I still ate with my family every day even if it was only for appearance's sake.

331
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,336
You're such a kind person.

332
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:30,614
Speaking of which, how about we all eat together?

333
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:36,379
What the hell are you looking at?

334
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:43,494
You saw that, right? He definitely won't eat with us.

335
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,338
Huh? What is that?

336
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
This is Lee Yoon Seong.

337
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,060
Yes, I understand.

338
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,155
Is it a hobby of yours to invade other people's personal space?

339
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:59,445
Why do you keep hanging around me? You shouldn't be here.

340
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:03,407
What's so special about this place?

341
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,029
Are you out of your mind?

342
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:09,389
What?

343
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:10,899
What made you think it would be okay to live here?

344
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:12,292
I have my reasons.

345
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,519
Living here won't be as simple as you may think.

346
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,687
I know that.

347
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,163
No, I don't think you do.

348
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,075
I came here to protect something that's important to me.

349
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,026
What's important to you is money, isn't it?

350
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,678
I told you, it's not like that!

351
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:26,189
What, then? Are you going to try to seduce me or something?

352
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:29,667
You really must be out of your mind.

353
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,499
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:31:45,141 --> 00:31:47,985
Didn't I tell you never to touch me again?

355
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,456
Oh no! What do I do?

356
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,590
♫  Stranger who is crossing my mind ♫

357
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,650
♫  I can't take my eyes off of you. ♫

358
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,850
♫  Whisper which is heard by my close mind ♫

359
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,900
♫  Softly melts me. ♫

360
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,960
♫  My Shining Destiny ♫

361
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,346
This is the reality of my life, huh?

362
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,800
♫  My dream's Romeo ♫

363
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:59,691
♫  I felt the love I had been waiting for ♫

364
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:02,818
What's that girl doing over there?

365
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:08,020
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

366
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,371
♫  Baby take me take me take me away ♫

367
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,307
Hey, Ms. Celebrity! What are you doing over there?

368
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:20,603
Hey, are you crazy? Do you enjoy taking cold baths?

369
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:22,464
And what's with all this garbage?

370
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:25,767
It's not garbage. This is all my stuff.

371
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:27,035
This stuff?

372
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:30,530
Hey, you're going to catch a cold! Can't you just throw these things away?

373
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,700
Why would I throw my stuff away? Go back inside, you two.

374
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,740
Gosh. How ridiculous.

375
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,271
♫  My paradise is wherever you are. ♫

376
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:39,772
Hold on!

377
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,980
♫  Stay with me forever. ♫

378
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,760
♫  Hey! You are the only one for me. ♫

379
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,230
Hey, you can throw
those kinds of things away!

380
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,034
I can use this sample for three whole days!

381
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,385
Gosh.

382
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:23,925
Get out of there!

383
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:28,705
Let's go back inside. It's pretty cold.

384
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,973
It's fine. You two can go inside.

385
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,394
Did you force your way in here to be treated like this?

386
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,420
How about you take care of your own things

387
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,896
instead of making other people worry about you?

388
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,400
Yeah. Don't worry about her. She has me.

389
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:21,424
Then make sure she's not in my face all the time.

390
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:23,776
Or why don't you just get lost?

391
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,720
You heard him, right? He told me to get lost.

392
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,900
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

393
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:30,809
Are you saying that she's your newest toy or something?

394
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:33,120
Why, do you want it or something?

395
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,530
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

396
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,470
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

397
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,520
Stop it, already.

398
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,370
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

399
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,622
Don't worry about them.

400
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:47,750
They're like this every time they see each other.

401
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:53,600
Whatever. Leave me alone, all three of you!

402
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,280
♫  As much as my tears which I secretly wipe away ♫

403
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,260
♫  Won't you come to feel like me? ♫

♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

406
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,700
♫  Like a dream, like a miracle ♫

407
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:27,940

410

411

412
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,770
♫  My unstoppable heart ♫

413

♫  When I walked as I was told ♫

414
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,850

♫  Like a dream, like a miracle ♫

424
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:45,260
How many times has it been already?

425
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:58,606
I apologize. I should've been more careful with your belongings.

426
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:08,725
Oh, it's okay, Ajussi. Thank you for bringing everything here.

427
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:11,544
Let's go. The car is waiting.

428
00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:12,954
Go where?

429
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:23,856
Are we filming "Pretty Woman" right now?

430
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,709
It's the chairman's command.

431
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,928
I told you, I'm okay with having this one outfit!

432
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:34,601
Um, then I'll pick out a few things for you.

433
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,778
- It's the chairman's—
- "It's the chairman's command."

434
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:39,122
That's what you were just about to say right?

435
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,926
I might just go and return everything you buy, okay?

436
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,454
Then how about you go to the cafe and rest a bit?

437
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:48,089
Ajussi!

438
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:50,025
Please go there and wait for me.

439
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:51,301
But...

440
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,022
- Oh my!
- Oh no!

441
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:59,050
Oh my! What the hell? You should be more careful!

442
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,293
I'm sorry.

443
00:39:00,293 --> 00:39:04,088
Oh no, my crocodile skin bag! It got scratched!

444
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,840
Oh no, my crocodile skin bag!

445
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,266
I'm sorry.

446
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:11,721
You think your apology will fix this? It got scratched because you bumped into me!

447
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,232
- Really?
- How dare you touch this.

448
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:17,302
This cost me 30 million won, you know! It's worth 30 million won!

449
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:21,897
Pay me back for this bag! Pay me back!

450
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:23,424
Really?

451
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:32,433
Who the hell are you?

452
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:37,230
A real bag has five stitches on both sides of the logo.

453
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,517
But yours isn't like that.

454
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,200
This material obviously isn't even top quality. Where did you buy this?

455
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:52,169
Really, how is that any of your business?

456
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,832
Looks like we've run into each other again.

457
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,110
Oh. Yeah.

458
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,004
Did you come to do some shopping?

459
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:13,216
Um, no. I'm just waiting for someone.

460
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:14,926
Oh.

461
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:18,021
I guess we tend to run into each other at the most inconvenient moments.

462
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:22,509
Thanks so much for earlier. I was panicking like crazy!

463
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,670
It was obvious that lady was being really weird.

464
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:30,124
But, how did you know that the bag was a fake?

465
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:35,596
People who've done a lot of needlework know these things.

466
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,173
Needlework?

467
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:40,627
I have a lot of interest in fashion design.

468
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:42,629
I'm planning to major in fashion design in college.

469
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:47,950
Oh, no wonder you're always dressed so well!

470
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:54,332
You don't seem like a person from "that world," either.

471
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:58,605
"Either"? So, you're not, either?

472
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:03,809
Don't you know? I'm not from a super-rich family like those guys.

473
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:08,263
Oh. I thought you definitely would be like them.

474
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:11,908
Hyeon Min and I have lived in the same neighborhood ever since we were kids.

475
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:13,927
So we've been close since then.

476
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:15,128
Oh.

477
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:21,818
How did you meet Hyeon Min?

478
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:24,846
Um, well, that is...

479
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:32,003
He came by the convenience store where I work part-time.

480
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:34,372
- So, um...
- A convenience store?

481
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:37,776
Yeah, so...

482
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:41,521
I'm being too nosy. I'm sorry.

483
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:43,031
No, it's okay.

484
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:49,254
I did know that Hyeon Min dates around

485
00:41:49,254 --> 00:41:52,523
but he's never introduced anyone as his fiancee.

486
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:54,733
Oh, really?

487
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:01,532
I guess you're happy.

488
00:42:02,734 --> 00:42:04,753
Huh? About what?

489
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:08,381
Um, to be officially dating Hyeon Min.

490
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,809
I mean...

491
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,974
I'm finished shopping, Ms. Ha Won.

492
00:42:17,974 --> 00:42:19,225
Shall we head back now?

493
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,077
Oppa Yoon Seong?

494
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:25,523
Why are you shopping for her?

495
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:30,186
Did Hyeon Min tell him to do this for you?

496
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:32,130
- Um...
- No.

497
00:42:33,014 --> 00:42:37,435
Ms. Eun Ha Won is living at Haneul House, so I'm taking care of her.

498
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:39,379
She's living at Haneul House?

499
00:42:39,462 --> 00:42:40,755
Yes.

500
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:46,995
So the person you were waiting for was Yoon Seong?

501
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:48,462
Yeah.

502
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:56,262
Sorry. I'll get going.

503
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:07,932
Shall we go?

504
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:13,930
Um, but, why did you buy so many things?

505
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,716
I told you that I'd return everything!

506
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:18,418
It's the chairman's command.

507
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,313
Oh, come on!

508
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:23,732
I have duties that I must fulfill, after all.

509
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:27,460
But still, this is way too much.

510
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,130
I'm sure that you've been having a hard time due to the Kang cousins.

511
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,100
I'll be sure to take care of you from now on so that you won't be troubled anymore.

512
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,228
That's also the chairman's command.

513
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:42,108
And ... I'll apologize on behalf of those three boys.

514
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,510
I'm sorry, Ms. Ha Won.

515
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:47,780
No, no, Ajussi!

516
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,251
Then...

517
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:56,189
I'll just wear this one thing.

518
00:43:56,189 --> 00:43:58,474
It's because it makes me feel bad to accept all of this.

519
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:05,239
Let's hurry and return the rest, okay? Let's go!

520
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,725
Come on, let's go!

521
00:44:13,573 --> 00:44:16,625
Eun Ha Won's friend, Kim Ja Yeong!

522
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,619
It's Hong Ja Yeong, actually.

523
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:29,272
Like I really care?

524
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:31,591
What do you want?

525
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:36,379
You know who I am, right?

526
00:44:44,004 --> 00:44:47,907
I heard that girl, Eun Ha Won is living at Haneul House?

527
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:52,204
Oh... um, no! I don't think so.

528
00:44:52,204 --> 00:44:55,006
"I don't 'think' so"?

529
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:58,184
It's not even a "no", but an "I don't think so"?

530
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:01,012
You know something, don't you?

531
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:03,106
Spit it out.

532
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:06,318
Hurry up and spit it out!

533
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,814
I don't know anything. Really. I don't know.

534
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:13,508
What the hell are you saying?

535
00:45:13,508 --> 00:45:15,893
I really don't know.

536
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:19,155
Give me your phone.

537
00:45:19,155 --> 00:45:21,683
Why do you want someone else's phone?

538
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:24,001
Let me see!

539
00:45:31,693 --> 00:45:34,879
So. It was true.

540
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:39,142
Wow, I'm so jealous. You are too, right?

541
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:41,619
Why the hell would I be jealous?

542
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,150
Happy now?

543
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:49,878
Hey, give that back.

544
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:51,847
How do you know if that's really Haneul House?

545
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:54,031
No. I'm busy!

546
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,442
Hey, let me see!

547
00:45:58,303 --> 00:46:03,866
What... am I holding in my hand right now?

548
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:08,796
I don't know. Three-day-old toilet paper?

549
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,807
Mommy! Ew! Oh my gosh! Mommy!

550
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:39,411
Oh, I guess it's Eun Ha Won's.

551
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:41,871
How cute.

552
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:59,014
Payment of 3,995,000 won to Haneul Crematorium

553
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,434
She only has 800 won left?

554
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:07,907
Oh.

555
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:10,817
Don't worry too much about me.

556
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,405
The part-time jobs I took on before and the work I'm doing now

557
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:19,550
are all just jobs for me to earn money.

558
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:23,546
I don't have any reason to feel hurt by them.

559
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:26,833
I've experienced far worse.

560
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:32,480
You're not just a part-timer.

561
00:47:32,505 --> 00:47:34,540
You're our honored guest.

562
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:43,532
Even so, I'm going to do all the work that the chairman asks me to do before I leave Haneul House.

563
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:47,670
My life is on the line, after all. I can do it!

564
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,111
Ms. Eun Ha Won is living at Haneul House now,

565
00:47:55,111 --> 00:47:57,839
so I'm taking care of her.

566
00:48:20,712 --> 00:48:23,956
I really don't get it.

567
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:31,630
Did something happen?

568
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:36,777
Can I ask you something?

569
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:47,888
I heard that Hyeon Min's fiancee is living at Haneul House now?

570
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:51,042
Yeah.

571
00:48:53,979 --> 00:48:55,530
So it is true.

572
00:48:58,758 --> 00:49:00,985
It just ended up this way, somehow.

573
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:05,390
This is so frustrating. I can't take this anymore.

574
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:10,628
I don't think you'll tell me, so I'll have to go ask Hyeon Min myself.

575
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:13,281
Right now?

576
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:16,927
Hey, Ms. Celebrity!

577
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:17,903
Hey!

578
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:21,731
Did you go out with Hyung Yoon Seong?

579
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:26,344
Yeah. My clothes all got wet, so he bought me some new ones.

580
00:49:27,212 --> 00:49:28,496
Oh yeah.

581
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:33,334
This is yours, right?

582
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:38,222
Oh. Where did you find this?

583
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:40,491
It was on the floor.

584
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,318
Oh, really?

585
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:45,504
Thanks for finding this for me.

586
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:48,382
But, um, did you...

587
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,519
Sorry. I looked inside.

588
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,647
Oh, you did?

589
00:49:55,874 --> 00:50:00,720
I mean, just in case it wasn't yours, I was trying to find who it belonged to.

590
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:05,575
Who else in this house would have a bank book like this?

591
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:08,695
You seem more like yourself now.

592
00:50:09,638 --> 00:50:12,891
But it seems that I keep learning all your secrets, bit by bit.

593
00:50:12,891 --> 00:50:13,917
Oh.

594
00:50:15,085 --> 00:50:16,153
Hey, come on!

595
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:19,122
It's only natural that a high schooler has no money.

596
00:50:19,122 --> 00:50:21,132
What about you guys, then?

597
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:25,562
Um, us? Well, we're...

598
00:50:25,562 --> 00:50:27,080
It's fine.

599
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,775
You guys have your world, and I have mine.

600
00:50:30,775 --> 00:50:33,578
It's just that our worlds are overlapping for a short span of time.

601
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:35,455
Hearing you say that saddens me.

602
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:39,509
No, no. My world is right here.

603
00:50:40,293 --> 00:50:43,613
And I just realized again that I should never forget that.

604
00:50:44,947 --> 00:50:46,224
I wasn't talking about that part.

605
00:50:46,224 --> 00:50:47,592
You said that our worlds are only overlapping for a short time.

606
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:48,969
Yeah, just for a short while.

607
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:52,620
Are you going to stay with Hyeon Min for a bit and then break off your engagement?

608
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,585
Oh. Well, um, that's...

609
00:50:56,585 --> 00:51:01,163
Or are you a bigger Casanova than Kang Hyeon Min himself?

610
00:51:02,107 --> 00:51:05,626
Kang Seo Woo don't try to pry too much.

611
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:08,045
You'll end up getting hurt!

612
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:37,116
Who left this here?

613
00:51:39,644 --> 00:51:42,755
Oh, was it Mr. Yoon Seong?

614
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:48,320
Jerk Kang Hyeon Min

615
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,214
- Are you ignoring me?
- Yep yep.

616
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:17,932
Come here for a sec. I have something to give you.

617
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:20,944
- Where?
- My room.

618
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:21,936
No, no.

619
00:52:21,936 --> 00:52:24,013
I said I have something to give you!

620
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:25,640
No thanks!

621
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,926
You'll be surprised and touched if you see it! Seriously!

622
00:52:42,832 --> 00:52:46,610
Wow, did I just get ignored?

623
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:12,738
What?

624
00:53:12,738 --> 00:53:15,015
Stay right there.

625
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:19,794
What the hell?

626
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:30,972
Oh, that's my uniform!

627
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:34,726
Hey, why do you have that? Hurry up and give it back!

628
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:36,185
Come and get it.

629
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:38,063
What the hell? Hurry up and give it to me!

630
00:53:38,063 --> 00:53:40,598
Hmm, can I cut one of the arms off?

631
00:53:40,598 --> 00:53:42,700
The spring/summer season is approaching.

632
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,921
Hey. No! No!

633
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:48,131
I have to wear that to my graduation!

634
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:50,317
No, no, please! Give it back!

635
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:52,819
Hey, slow down. You're making a lot of sudden movements right now.

636
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:54,320
Okay, fine.

637
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,323
Come on, hurry up! Hurry and give it back!

638
00:53:57,323 --> 00:53:59,467
Are you holding my uniform hostage?

639
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:00,593
Yeah.

640
00:54:00,627 --> 00:54:02,637
- No, you can't!
- Hey!

641
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:06,090
You're the first girl who has ever entered my room.

642
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,193
Sorry. Can you forget about that, please?

643
00:54:08,193 --> 00:54:10,804
Hey, I even got this dry-cleaned for you!

644
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:12,213
Give it back.

645
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:13,381
Want to have some ramen before you go?

646
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,083
We can put some caviar in it.

647
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:18,703
You know, there are only two types of customers

648
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:21,039
that come to convenience stores after 4 a.m.

649
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,352
People who are going to work early, and the good-for-nothings who've been partying.

650
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:28,563
And the worst of them always come on strong, like you.

651
00:54:28,563 --> 00:54:33,884
Are you comparing your one-and-only-sweetheart to those types of guys?

652
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:35,044
That's not very nice.

653
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:37,180
Do you know what I do when that happens to me?

654
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:38,390
What do you do?

655
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,592
An eye for an eye.

656
00:54:40,592 --> 00:54:42,227
Lack of respect for lack of respect.

657
00:54:42,227 --> 00:54:44,245
Violence for violence.

658
00:54:44,245 --> 00:54:47,540
Oh, are you going to come on to me, then?

659
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,100
Yeah.

660
00:55:02,347 --> 00:55:04,107
Was I a bit too forward with you?

661
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:07,618
You sure are unpredictable, Eun Ha Won.

662
00:55:08,712 --> 00:55:09,880
Here.

663
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:13,499
Gosh, not again—

664
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:34,109
You're becoming more and more... intriguing.

665
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,530
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

666
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:32,490
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

667
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:36,450
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie  ♫

668
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,480
♫  pointing only at you ♫

669
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,510
♫  Why did you show up now? ♫

670
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,430
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

671
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:47,190
♫  I've bet my everything on you ♫

672
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,060
♫  You are so precious. ♫

673
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,360
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫

674
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,350
♫  From the first to the last, I wonder about everything. ♫

675
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,850
♫  Even If I secretly  ♫
