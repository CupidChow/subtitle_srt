What are you doing?

10
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:00,655
I'm going to try and steal your fiancee.

11
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:06,628
Stop it!

12

Birthday?

Surprise!
Eun Ha Won ❤︎ Happy Birthday!

16
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:25,247
Happy birthday, Ms. Ha Won.

17
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,501
Oh. Then, you two...

18
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:34,180
Yeah. It was a hidden-camera prank, for your birthday.

19
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,206
Oh!

20
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:37,742
Oh, I told you to take it easy with your acting!

21
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,186
Don't you see you surprised her?

22
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:41,621
I was being completely genuine.

23
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:47,610
Sure. You were completely genuine about surprising her, right?

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,645
Surprise!

25
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,547
All right, let's eat!

26
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:02,959
Yoon Seong told me that Eun Ha Won really knows how to eat!

27
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:05,245
Let's go!

28
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:18,733
Mr. Yoon Seong did the cooking,

29
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,945
and the elaborate decorations were done by the famous singer, right?

30
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:24,530
♫ Hey! ♫

31
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,149
How did you like my present?

32
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:29,519
- What present?
- The cosmetics I left on your desk!

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,870
♫  I also unconsciously look at you and ♫

34
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:36,076
Who left this here?

35
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,430

Hey, hey! Throw that kind of stuff out!

40
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:49,889
I can use a sample like this for three whole days!

♫  unaware I hum. ♫

45
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,558
You're the one who gave that to me?

46
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:10,568
You can save your praise for me.

47
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:13,271
I don't need cosmetics though.

48
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,806
Is there anything that you actually need?

49
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,991
Yeah. A school uniform.

50
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,377
I'm graduating next month!

51
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:22,338
There you go again about that school uniform.

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,740
♫  Both your happiness and your sadness ♫

53
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:27,460
You don't have a gift for her?

54
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,230
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

55
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,591
If you didn't prepare one, you can give it to me now!

56
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,819
Ta-da!

57
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,700
♫  The feelings I can't hide anymore ♫

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,650
All right. One, two, three!

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,430
♫  I love you ♫

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,683
There we go.

61
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:53,770
I'll just consider this your present.

62
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:56,547
What did you just do?

63
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:59,109
Isn't it obvious? She took a picture of us, duh.

64
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,728
You just violated my portraiture rights by taking my photo without my permission!

65
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:05,531
It's nice to get a photo of you all eating together for the first time!

66
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:12,146
Well, then. Shall I give you all a surprise of my own?

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,668
It's not my birthday today!

68
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:20,063
What?

69
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:21,464
Wait!

70
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:27,279
See? You wrote "My Birthday" right here!

71
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,550
Look that part tore off! See? It doesn't quite fit.

72
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,445
The date is correct, but the month is different!

73
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,230
What?

74
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:40,859
But I just want to pretend that today is my birthday anyway.

75
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,987
Thanks to you guys, it really felt like it was my birthday today!

76
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:47,240
We're all eating together, too!

77
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:55,940
It's not even your birthday, so I have no reason to be sitting here.

78
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,712
I'll keep an eye on you. Looks like things will get interesting.

79
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:11,598
Don't worry about him, and let's eat, okay?

80
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,527
- Okay!
- Let's eat!

81
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,770
Here, try this.

82
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:18,747
Okay.

83
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:49,052
Do you remember...

84
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,673
when I told you that I'd protect you?

85
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:55,875
Yeah. I do.

86
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,144
I wasn't just saying that.

87
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:07,470
Even though I can't do anything about all the hurt that Kang Hyeon Min has already given you,

88
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,142
I'll protect you from being hurt by him from this point on.

89
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:16,637
What... do you mean by that?

90
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,201
♫  If you extend your arm ♫

91
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:25,981
I just thought of something that I can do for you.

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,840
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

93
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,170
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

94
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,790
♫  on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

95
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,720
♫  I can't live without you. If this wait ♫

96
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,740
Why do you have to be connected to Kang Hyeon Min, of all people?

97
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,220
♫  were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

98
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,898
I'm going to try and steal your fiancee.

99
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,004
What the hell is Kang Ji Woon thinking?

100
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:06,900
♫  You've become someone who can't give back ♫

101
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,160
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

102
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,600
♫  The one thing my heart says ♫

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:22,800
♫  The one thing my tears say is. Do you hear my love? ♫

104
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,369
This doesn't match.

105
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:40,429
Nope.

106
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:44,584
This isn't it.

107
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:49,005
This isn't it, either.

108
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,044
My Birthday

109
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:56,988
Oh? Oh! I found it!

110
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,156
I found it!

111
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,725
Oh, so Eun Ha Won's birthday is in May?

112
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:03,728
Sheesh.

113
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:10,902
But, what does her birthday have to do with me?

114
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:20,019
Gosh, you surprised me!

115
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,188
What are you doing here?

116
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,121
You...

117
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:34,334
Your heart isn't beating fast because of the dumb things that Kang Ji Woon said

118
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,494
or anything like that, right?

119
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,155
No!

120
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:41,524
Don't jump to conclusions.

121
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:45,211
The only person in his heart is Park Hye Ji.

122
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:47,647
I'm well aware of that fact.

123
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:52,577
Well that has nothing to do with me anyway.

124
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,629
You'll just end up getting hurt.

125
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:58,049
If you're going to talk about me behind my back, do it somewhere else.

126
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:09,594
This is the first family photo that these punks have taken together!

127
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:11,871
A family photo!

128
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:14,232
I should've made sure that the camera was in focus!

129
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:19,095
Who cares about that? What's important is that they ate together.

130
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,151
The chairman has prepared your college tuition for your first year

131
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:27,070
as well as a cash bonus for you, Ms. Ha Won.

132
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:31,007
What? A year of tuition, and a cash bonus?

133
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,960
I've confirmed your skill for myself.

134
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,471
This is just my way of telling you that I expect great things from you

135
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:38,222
so don't feel too pressured.

136
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:41,151
Oh, but still. You're being too generous.

137
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:43,219
What are you talking about? That's not even that much.

138
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,014
Oh! Instead of all this,

139
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:48,708
how about we say that this is a part-time job where I get paid 10,000 won an hour?

140
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,252
As for the food cost...

141
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:53,846
I do eat a lot, so let's factor in the cost of two meals a day.

142
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,741
So, excluding the cost of the items that were bought for me...

143
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,644
Ms. Eun Ha Won.

144
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:00,670
Yes?

145
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,816
To be frank, I'm not paying you nearly enough for your skills.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,827
But, still, Chairman!

147
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,737
This isn't the end, after all!

148
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,132
Yes.

149
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,842
You're the one who told him about my mom's columbarium situation, aren't you?

150
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:25,019
What do you mean by that?

151
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,280
How could the bonus the chairman gave me be exactly the same

152
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,851
as the amount needed for my mom's columbarium deposit?

153
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:34,962
I... I'm sorry.

154
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,557
I didn't mean to do a background check on you.

155
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:40,026
But somehow I brought up the story about your mother to the chairman—

156
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:42,312
Thank you, Ajussi.

157
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:48,310
I felt so bad every day because I couldn't take care of my mom.

158
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:51,980
Really, thank you so much.

159
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:59,137
If you're going to the columbarium now, would you like me to take you there?

160
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:03,866
No. Mom and I will take the bus there.

161
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,085
Yes, Miss. Then, please, don't be home too late—

162
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:13,526
You know, your nagging really reminds me of my mom. Or is it my dad?

163
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Kids, your sons ate together for the first time in their lives. Finally.

164
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:01,349
Ji Hwa Ja

165
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:04,961
This woman is the one who married the chairman of Haneul Group, right?

166
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,838
Yes, that's right.

167
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:10,750
You'll be shocked when you see her! She's incredibly young!

168
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:17,140
Can you switch things up so that I'll be the one to take care of her?

169
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,444
Well, sure. She doesn't have a regular girl she prefers yet.

170
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,862
Wow, figures!

171
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:34,574
The wife of Haneul Group's chairman's skin is a cut above the rest!

172
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:38,661
I saw your customer card before, and you're the same age as me,

173
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:42,340
but your skin is twelve years younger than mine!

174
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:54,500
But, you just got married and you already have three grandsons.

175
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:56,563
Doesn't that make you feel a bit uncomfortable?

176
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:59,240
They're my family, so why would I feel uncomfortable?

177
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,519
Oh, o-of course!

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,000
But, I heard some rumors about Haneul House.

179
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,176
Rumors?

180
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,879
That's the place where your grandsons live, right?

181
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,150
But I heard that there's a girl living there now, too.

182
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:20,253
Where did you hear that?

183
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,215
Um, my daughter heard it at school.

184
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:25,217
She goes to school in that neighborhood, you see.

185
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,145
There's way too much talking going on. Don't you think so?

186
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,642
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

187
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:40,724
Hey, I guess Ha Won really is living at Haneul House.

188
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,470
Hey, calm down!

189
00:13:46,171 --> 00:13:49,682
I met the chairman's wife and tried to get some info while giving her a massage.

190
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:53,169
How the hell is Eun Ha Won living at the Haneul House?

191
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,055
This makes no sense!

192
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:56,239
Yoo Na!

193
00:13:56,239 --> 00:14:00,518
Calm down, okay? It's not like she's going to marry one of them!

194
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:03,355
Calm down, okay?

195
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,565
I can't because I feel it's so unfair, okay?

196
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:08,368
This makes no sense!

I think I'm really going to be able to go to college next year!

202
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,669
Something really amazing happened to me, you see.

203
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:48,850
I got a new part-time job where I work for a super-rich chairman.

204
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,277
And he has three grandsons.

205
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:55,656
But all three of their personalities...

206
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,269
But despite that, we've gotten close.

207
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:03,190
I guess I've even made myself some rich friends now!

Yes, ma'am.

Wow, are you preparing for, a party or something?

232
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,314
It'll be the anniversary of the chairman's sons' deaths soon.

233
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,149
His sons?

234
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:12,961
You know, the boys' fathers.

235
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:14,971
The food must be made by those who work at Haneul House.

236
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:17,240
So there's a lot to be done!

237
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,053
But all three of them passed away, right?

238
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,622
That's right.

239
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:27,592
I feel so bad for the chairman.

240
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,563
His second eldest son took his own life

241
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:36,059
and the other two died in a car accident at the same time.

242
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,353
It really is quite sad.

243
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:41,756
So we observe the anniversary of their deaths on the same day, together.

244
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,067
Oh.

245
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:50,523
I know that none of the boys liked their fathers, but they're too cruel.

246
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:53,259
They've never once shown up to mourn their deaths when the rest of us do.

247
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,186
They haven't? But they're their dads!

248
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,248
Well, this happened to them even before they were old enough

249
00:17:58,248 --> 00:17:59,858
to know that one should be sad about losing their parents.

250
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,951
So I do understand them a bit.

251
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:07,340
But still, the pain of losing a parent

252
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,276
is nothing compared to the pain of losing a child.

253
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:15,531
They should have at least a little bit of consideration for their grandfather.

254
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,027
They say that you make funeral food for your parents with tears

255
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:22,313
but you make funeral food for your children with tears of blood.

256
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:24,157
Isn't that right?

257
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:26,584
Sheesh. Those inconsiderate boys.

258
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,796
You have to go this year. Ji Woon is with us now, too.

259
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:47,755
I don't know.

260
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,232
Why? It's such a nuisance.

261
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,152
The chairman will be waiting for you.

262
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:56,047
I'm sure the people at the temple will do a fine job.

263
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,057
Yeah.

264
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,253
What about you, Ji Woon?

265
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:03,738
It's the first time you'll be here for the anniversary of your father's death.

266
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:04,739
You'll come, right?

267
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:07,350
It's only been a year since I even knew of my father...

268
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,544
so do I really need to go to that?

269
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,328
Aren't they all being too much?

270
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:31,666
They weren't even listening when you were talking to them!

271
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:38,965
What is the reason behind refusing to observe the anniversary of their fathers' deaths?

272
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,318
I do understand where they're coming from.

273
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,553
Yes, I totally don't understand, eithe—

274
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:46,715
Wait, what did you say?

275
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:49,984
You'll come to know the circumstances soon enough.

276
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:54,989
There are many things at Haneul House that can't be explained simply.

277
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:00,570
Oh! Should I give it a try?

278
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:04,357
Ms. Ha Won, you'll try?

279
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:08,811
Yes. You paid me so much to work for you so it's only fair that I work hard!

280
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:13,441
If you leave this to me, I'll definitely succeed!

281
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:19,530
This will be much more difficult than getting them to eat together.

282
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,459
It's also that much more important.

283
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:25,153
I really want to succeed...

284
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:32,660
Because I think their fathers must really want to see them.

285
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,073
Did you give her permission to try?

286
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,442
I want to believe in her.

287
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:51,721
Do you think that she'll be successful this time, too?

288
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,364
Who knows?

289
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:59,962
Thinking about it, it's been ten years now since I've done this on my own.

So you know. I'm coming out!

299
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:47,127
I don't care.

300
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:49,838
What?

301
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:52,123
You said that you liked me.

302
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:56,035
I was thinking that maybe I should swim with you.

303
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,571
So you've finally gone crazy, huh?

304
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:04,235
But... would you be able to say that you like me in front of Hye Ji, too?

305
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:08,148
And why would I have to do that?

306
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:10,434
You, Kang Hyeon Min, and Park Hye Ji.

307
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:13,578
The three of you share a love triangle that's complicated enough.

308
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:17,148
So I'm curious as to why you're trying to force me into the mix.

309
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,251
Is having complicated relationships a hobby of yours?

310
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:23,388
Yeah. It is a hobby of mine.

311
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:28,460
I'll really take my clothes off, then.

312
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,145
What... are you doing now?

313
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:33,565
I want to know how comfortable it is to swim naked, so I'm giving it a try.

314
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,758
How about it?

315
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:39,362
Want to bare it all, since we've already come clean with one another?

316
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:41,356
Stop messing around.

317
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:50,490
Gosh, look at him.

318
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,450
He's totally frazzled.

319
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,452
What an innocent little punk.

320
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,841
♫  Everything I look at ♫

321
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:02,570
One, two, three!

322
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,930
♫  Everything I have will still speak only of you ♫

323
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:14,163
What the hell?

324
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,292
There's only one shower room at our house's swimming pool.

325
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,622
You surprised me!

326
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,600
You said that you had something to say to me, so say it now.

327
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:04,922
I meant it when I said that I'd steal you away.

328
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:10,185
So look forward to it.

329
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:21,656
That good-for-nothing handsome jerk!

330
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:24,142
Why is he making my heart flutter?

331
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:30,115
Get it together, Eun Ha Won!

332
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,384
Get it together!

333
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:37,389
I couldn't even ask him about his father's memorial service!

334
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:44,454
I'm not up to go to a memorial service.

335
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:49,067
It feels like Grandfather acknowledged my dad as family only after he died.

336
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:51,427
What do you mean by that?

337
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:57,122
My grandma... wasn't married to grandfather.

338
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:04,349
In the olden days, they'd call a person like her a concubine.

339
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,900
That's why Dad was forced to live in hiding from Grandfather's other wives until he died.

340
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:12,549
Oh. I see.

341
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:18,221
I know that you have good intentions, but I have stuff to work on right now.

342
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:21,866
Oh. Oh, really? Sorry. I must've gotten in your way.

343
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:24,311
- Not at all.
- Good luck!

344
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,646
Do whatever you want. I'm not going.

345
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,132
It's up to you whether you want to come to Korea or not.

346
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:40,118
Just don't try to use that as an excuse to see me.

347
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,540
What's the occasion? You came into my room of your own free will?

348
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,950
I have something to talk to you about.

349
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:07,495
Oh, I'm really used to stuff like this.

350
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:08,380
What do you mean?

351
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,783
Yeah, people are always nervous when it comes to things like this.

352
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:12,967
Here.

353
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:17,697
Say what you need to say, slowly.

354
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:20,158
Why are you acting like this?

355
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:25,939
Here. You feel your heartbeat, right?

356
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:29,851
Your heartbeat tends to get faster when you're in front of the one you like.

357
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,020
No. It doesn't feel like that at all.

358
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:37,742
Really? What about here? Do you feel it here?

359
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:41,304
It feels a bit irregular. Do you have an arrhythmia?

360
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:42,514
Gosh.

361
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:45,850
You never go with the flow.

362
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,919
My heart is completely normal, thank you!

363
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,255
You're really not going to go?

364
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:51,389
Where?

365
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,217
To observe the anniversary of your father's death.

366
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,929
No, I'm not going.

367
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,455
Why not?

368
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:02,634
Because someone I don't want to see will be there.

369
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:07,238
I'm sorry, but you'll have to give up on this one.

370
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:17,407
Yeah, there's no way that they would go without a fight.

371
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,968
But I'm not giving up easily, either!

372
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:21,694
What are you doing?

373
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:26,240
Why are you blocking the door to someone else's room?

374
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,853
Um... er... it's...

375
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:31,771
about the anniversary of your father's death.

376
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,965
I have no father.

377
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:45,843
Kang Seo Woo!

378
00:27:48,596 --> 00:27:50,473
Kang Seo Woo!

379
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,900
That person's once wide-looking shoulders now look so small.

380
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,000
Your smiles for me were rare, but I knew how you felt.

381
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:34,342
What are you doing?

382
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:36,602
Oh.

383
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,456
I had something to talk to you about.

384
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,729
Why are you touching this?

385
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:50,767
Oh. I'm sorry. I was waiting for you, and...

386
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,004
Don't you want to sing this song for your dad?

387
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:07,358
If you want to see him, go and pay your respects to him and tell him that.

388
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:35,236
If I'd known that day would be our last day together...

389
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,080
Excuse me.

390
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:48,408
Pardon me?

391
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:58,034
So it is you.

392
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,500
You're the girl who came to the chairman's wedding with my Hyeon Min.

393
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,957
Oh... but who are you?

394
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:14,059
Me?

395
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:17,028
Why I'm his mother.

396
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:21,316
Oh! Hello! It's nice to meet you.

397
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:24,027
You're prettier in person.

398
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,696
Um... that is...

399
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,324
Thank you.

400
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:34,438
But, it seems that my Hyeon Min has gone off somewhere.

401
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:37,432
Oh, he's not in his room? I'll go and check.

402
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,459
No. Rather than that...

403
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:43,446
Can you help me?

404
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,300
♫  Stranger who is crossing my mind ♫

405
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,490
♫  I can't take my eyes off of you. ♫

406
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,730
♫  Whisper which is heard by my closed mind ♫

407
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:05,151
Yes.

408
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,220
♫  Softly melts me. ♫

409
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,200
Turn it over.

410
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,220
♫  My Destiny ♫

411
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,890
♫  I recognized my fate at a glance. ♫

412
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,460
♫  My dream's Romeo ♫

413
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,760
♫  I felt the love I had been waiting for ♫

414
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,435
I'd better not buy anything else or it'll be too hard on you.

415
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:31,987
Oh, no! It's okay!

416
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:35,307
You're really going to say that, when you're sweating that much?

417
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:38,101
Oh, this is...

418
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,147
it's because it's so well-heated in here.

419
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:47,744
What else will I need for a week's stay here?

420
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:52,532
What about a toothbrush, and toothpaste? Things like that?

421
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:57,829
They have all that stuff at the hotel, my dear!

422
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:00,373
Oh. I see.

423
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:04,519
I think we're pretty much done here.

424
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,546
Oh, yeah! A book!

425
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:09,132
- A book?
- Yes.

426
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:12,601
Oh, a book!

427
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:15,939
You might get bored if you're staying at the hotel by yourself.

428
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:19,984
Don't you miss books written in Korean since you've lived abroad for a while?

429
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:22,695
What an interesting idea.

430
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:27,367
Then, can you recommend a book worth reading to me?

431
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:30,244
Yes. I'll be your guide.

432
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:44,467
Have you arrived? I'll head down now.

433
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:52,533
You're here, ma'am?

434
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:54,077
Excuse me...

435
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:11,152
- I'm telling you, it's true!
- All right. All right.

436
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:14,322
Yes, come in.

437
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:23,373
I've prepared the item you asked me about yesterday.

438
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:25,600
It's finally here!

439
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:27,586
What is that?

440
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,655
Something I've never had before.

441
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:32,515
What?

442
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,291
It's our first family photo ever taken.

443
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,795
It would only be a family photo if you and I were in it, too.

444
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:50,224
All right, then. Let's take one with them, too.

445
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:58,683
She really isn't an ordinary girl, that one.

446
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:04,014
- Take the books, too.
- Yes, ma'am.

447
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,883
Thank you!

448
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:11,505
Thank you!

449
00:34:17,152 --> 00:34:19,287
Do you want to eat together?

450
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:21,831
You did work hard, after all.

451
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:26,169
Yes. Thank you!

452
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,588
You didn't see your mother?

453
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:52,987
It looks like all that sweating made me hungry.

454
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:56,366
Eat up.

455
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:58,893
Thank you.

456
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:05,350
You worked hard today.

457
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:08,920
This much is enough, right?

458
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,949
- Excuse me?
- It's only fair that I compensate you for your time.

459
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,305
Compensation? You don't have to do that!

460
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:21,324
I only did what I should have!

461
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:27,539
Why?

462
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:30,041
Why is that something that you should have done?

463
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:34,196
Um, that is...

464
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:37,865
I don't think we have that sort of relationship.

465
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:45,973
You don't think that you've already married into this family do you?

466
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:52,547
You know, we're quite picky about allowing people into our family.

467
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:59,779
We can't just let anyone marry into Haneul Group.

468
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,016
You understand what I'm saying, right?

469
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:10,582
This is as far as our relationship goes.

470
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:17,063
So I'd like it if you didn't assume that we were any closer than that, okay?

471
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:19,357
Bye, then.

472
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:28,717
Let's go.

473
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,645
Hey, what are you doing?

474
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:35,106
You're not even going to say hi to your mother, my son?

475
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:37,125
I said let's go.

476
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,850
Hey, wait a moment! How can we leave?

477
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,090
Goodbye!

478
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,510
Wait!

479
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:52,423
Hey, what's with you?

480
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:53,767
Are you an idiot?

481
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:56,419
Why are you just following random people around and acting like their slave?

482
00:36:57,162 --> 00:36:58,896
"Random people"?

483
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,531
What the hell have you been up to?

484
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:03,818
She's not just some random person.

485
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:05,737
She's your mom which is why I followed her.

486
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:08,874
And I didn't act like her slave. She asked me to help her, so I did!

487
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:13,887
Stop assuming things. Helping someone? Yeah right.

488
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,872
It's because she's your mom!

489
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:19,801
What?

490
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:22,070
Is it that strange to help my friend's mom?

491
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:27,358
Stop overstepping your bounds. You totally crossed the line just now.

492
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,011
I thought that I was more than just a fake fiancee or a part-timer to you!

493
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:33,890
I thought that maybe we could be friends!

494
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,600
That's why I helped my friend's mom for a second—

495
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,426
What do you mean, friend?

496
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,482
What do you know that you'd take this upon yourself?

497
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,348
Fine. Sorry.

498
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:55,077
I guess I overestimated my significance in your life.

499
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:20,078
Is your hand okay?

500
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:25,240
I just want that girl gone from Hyeon Min's side.

501
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,161
Hey, what are you doing?

502
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,570
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

503
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,332
I'm going to try and steal your fiancee.

504
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:35,260
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else? ♫

505
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:37,780
Hye Ji

506
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,510
♫ I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

507
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,510
♫  I am wanting you so badly but ♫

508
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,589
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

509
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,320
The person you are trying to reach...

510
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,930
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

511
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,020
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

512
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,780
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

513
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,640
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

514
00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:10,570
Are you the one who brought Eun Ha Won to Haneul House?

515
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,559
Of course, I did. Who else would, when she's my girlfriend?

516
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,605
It has nothing to do with you, so mind your own business.

517
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:25,450
♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

518
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:31,510
♫  Like a dream, like a miracle ♫

519
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:38,510
♫  You will be there in the time that I dreamed of ♫

520
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:42,752
I knew you'd be like this!

521
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:45,380
You didn't pick up my calls, either.

522
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:48,700
Sorry. I didn't realize.

523
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,690
Will everything be over after you throw this away?

524
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:01,545
Sorry. I have a lot to do today.

525
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:17,370
Why aren't you eating? Doesn't it taste good?

526
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,173
I don't have much of an appetite.

527
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:24,385
Is it because of the upcoming anniversary of your sons' deaths?

528
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:30,900
I always remember those kids around this time.

529
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:37,290
I obviously can't completely understand how you must feel,

530
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,201
but please, lean on me a little.

531
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:42,062
Thank you.

532
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,657
Are your grandchildren coming?

533
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:50,203
My sons never showed my grandsons any fatherly love before they died.

534
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,948
It's only natural that the boys ended up this way.

535
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:59,738
What you need right now isn't your grandsons

536
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,498
but a son that you can depend on.

537
00:41:02,057 --> 00:41:04,876
Yes, exactly.

538
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:25,663
Why are you working out so late at night?

539
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:28,600
Oh... I don't really feel good.

540
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,659
Take some medicine, then.

541
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,002
I already did.

542
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,445
Then go to sleep.

543
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:37,400
It just makes you feel worse to be home alone when you don't feel well.

544
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,494
That's why I'm out here.

545
00:41:41,388 --> 00:41:44,423
Hey, don't mind me. I'm sure I'll be okay.

546
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:50,263
Follow me.

547
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:54,092
- Why?
- Just follow me.

548
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:16,973
No!

549
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,743
Shut it, already!

550
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,600
It's been a while since someone pricked my finger!

551
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Do you think I'm doing this for you because I want to? Be still.

552
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:30,212
Wait! No! No! What should I do? Ahh! Ow!

553
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:55,136
You're definitely a pro at this.

554
00:42:55,136 --> 00:42:57,339
I've been doing this for my mom ever since I was eight years old.

555
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:01,951
Wow, so skilled even as tiny little punk, huh?

556
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:10,802
Go to sleep now.

557
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,296
Thanks.

558
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:17,767
If it hadn't been for you, I would've been miserable by myself.

♫  Lately they say I am strange ♫

560
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:24,590
This reminds me of my mom.

561
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,154
Nobody's done this for me since my mom died.

You have your dad, though.

00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:38,087
He wouldn't do it for me.

565
00:43:39,155 --> 00:43:42,070
Since I'm not his biological daughter.

♫  Seeing you will be harder ♫

571

- Hey, come on, Mom!
- What?

621
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:36,986
It's just that I'm so happy to see you for the first time in such a long time!

622
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:39,222
You should've gone to a hotel. Why are you here?

623
00:48:39,222 --> 00:48:42,167
I wanted to see you, so I came straight here from the airport!

624
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:44,044
You haven't changed one bit, Mom!

625
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:45,870
- Let's go in.
- Let's go in!

626
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,839
Let's go, go, go!

627
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:54,545
Wow, how is my son so handsome?

628
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:58,683
And so sweet? And so sexy?

629
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:01,077
Geez. Look at you, overreacting again!

630
00:49:01,077 --> 00:49:03,138
What?

631
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:04,606
Stop it, it's hot!

632
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:06,675
Hey, how can you be like this to me

633
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:08,627
when I only see you once a year for the anniversary of your dad's death?

634
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:13,056
This time, I'm going to stick to you until we get a heat rash!

635
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:17,009
There you go again. I saw you when I went to do a concert in the States!

636
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:17,969
You call that a proper meeting?

637
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:20,263
I only saw you for a second in your dressing room!

638
00:49:20,263 --> 00:49:23,466
This time, I'm going to go on tons and tons of dates with you!

639
00:49:24,342 --> 00:49:26,094
Gosh, let go!

640
00:49:26,094 --> 00:49:28,213
Want to go see a movie? No, a musical!

641
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:32,192
Wait, no! I want to keep staring at your face

642
00:49:32,192 --> 00:49:34,577
so let's stay up all night and talk!

643
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:38,089
Mom, I want to do that too, but I have to record tomorrow.

644
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:39,515
So I have to practice.

645
00:49:39,515 --> 00:49:42,935
Hmph, whatever! Whatever! Whatever!

646
00:49:43,995 --> 00:49:46,172
Wait, if tomorrow's your studio session,

647
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:48,458
you're not going to father's memorial service again?

648
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,495
I'm not really feeling it.

649
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:56,424
Dad's right here, even if I don't go there anyway.

650
00:49:57,884 --> 00:50:01,171
Gosh, my son's all grown up!

651
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:05,066
But still, you have to go and see Dad!

652
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:07,069
- Come on, let's go!
- Let go!

653
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:09,588
Come on, Seo Woo! Let's go together!

654
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:14,009
Oh my. That's Hyeon Min's fiancee's room?

655
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:16,311
Then, are those two really getting married?

656
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:19,047
Gosh, you sure are nosy, Mom!

657
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:21,950
Does Ji Woon come home nowadays?

658
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:22,684
You're here,?

659
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:27,163
Oh, Hyeon Min! You're the same as ever.

660
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:28,965
Is my sister-in-law doing well?

661
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:31,884
I'm talking about your mom.

662
00:50:31,884 --> 00:50:36,478
Why are you asking me that? Have a safe trip home.

663
00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:43,579
Looks like they're on horrible terms, as always!

664
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:46,332
- Let's go, Mom.
- Yeah.

665
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,300
[Mom]

666
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:15,929
Mom: You'd better be there tomorrow.

667
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:09,470
♫  Lately they say I am strange ♫

668
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,742
♫  My heart ♫

669
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:12,419
Okay...

670
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,445
♫ like a bad habit ♫

671
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:16,256
What is she saying?

672
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,840
♫  seems to be putting on a brave face ♫

673
00:52:22,846 --> 00:52:27,450
I missed you too, Dad.

674
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,480
♫  I like a day like this. ♫

675
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,590
♫  I just keep liking you ♫

676
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,390
♫  Turning one step away ♫

677
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:46,350
♫  Seeing you will be harder ♫

678
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:54,520
♫  Even if you laugh louder ♫

679
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:01,360
♫  Without you I wouldn't feel good ♫

680
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,440
♫  Don't leave me anywhere alone anymore  ♫

681
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,336
♫  I want to say I love you just you ♫

682
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:14,697
Really? Did I really snore?

683
00:53:14,697 --> 00:53:17,083
Yep. You talked in your sleep, too.

684
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:20,880
What? What did I say? Huh?

685
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,020
♫  Tell me everything is fine ♫

686
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:30,440
♫  Show me how you really feel ♫

687
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:48,264
I missed you too, Dad.

688
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:56,470
♫  I must be really broken down ♫

689
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:59,310
♫  Without noticing it my heart has a fever ♫

690
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,527
Huh?

691
00:54:00,527 --> 00:54:02,279
Oh, I don't know!

692
00:54:04,422 --> 00:54:08,109
See you tomorrow, then! I'll be waiting!

693
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:09,486
I told you not to mess around.

694
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:13,482
Hey, don't make such a scary face! Okay? Come on!

695
00:54:13,482 --> 00:54:15,041
Gosh!

696
00:54:15,742 --> 00:54:17,235
Hey!

697
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:19,546
Don't come in!

698
00:54:21,447 --> 00:54:23,258
Thanks!

699
00:54:51,094 --> 00:54:53,162
Looks like you two had tons of fun.

700
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,734
- You were giddy. Were you two flirting?
- It's none of your business.

701
00:54:57,734 --> 00:55:00,854
Hey, don't you know that dating is forbidden in Haneul House?

702
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:02,071
So?

703
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:06,876
Hey, you can't do this to me! How could you, as my fiancee?

704
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:08,420
And with my cousin of all people?

705
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,200
- Why are you acting like this?
- What?

706
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:13,967
You said that we weren't anything to each other, and certainly not friends.

707
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:16,786
So isn't it a bit ridiculous that you're acting like this?

708
00:55:18,538 --> 00:55:21,607
Can you draw a clear line for me so I know where I stand?

709
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:27,030
Oh yeah.

710
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:33,711
The person you didn't want to see is your mother, right?

711
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:38,825
Since it's not my place, I won't tell you to make amends with your mom

712
00:55:38,825 --> 00:55:43,028
or to go to your father's memorial service tomorrow.

713
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:45,523
But I will say this one thing.

714
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:50,269
Your dad must be so lonely.

715
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:26,414
You do want to see him, don't you?

716
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:29,009
After all, he's the man your mom loved.

717
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:31,686
Your dad, I mean.

718
00:57:23,263 --> 00:57:28,309
After raising her son on her own, how horrible it is to die from such a terrible illness

719
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,995
Does the child even know what his father looks like?

720
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:34,774
Do you think he'd be sitting there alone like that if he did?

721
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:39,679
It's obvious his dad knocked his mom up and ran away!

722
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:11,670
♫  When you follow the star in the night sky, ♫

723
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:17,170
♫  May I go too? ♫

724
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:24,680
♫  Even if I desperately want it ♫

725
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:32,210
♫  He won't tell me. ♫

726
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:39,850
♫  Although you saved a smile for me ♫

727
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:47,280
♫  Even then if I only knew ♫

728
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:54,820
♫  it was our last time ♫

729
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:03,280
♫  when I could feel how you felt ♫

730
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:13,030
♫  Someday when I meet you again ♫

731
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,720
♫  I will tell you. My whole story ♫

732
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:28,410
♫  Until you reach the place with the stars ♫

733
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:35,710
I'm sorry. I failed this mission.

734
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:43,590
♫ Please take care of me ♫

735
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:06,010
♫  I asked a long time ago. Do you remember me ♫

736
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:13,640
♫  The words which even the world can't answer ♫

737
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:19,060
♫  Now on my face the longing  ♫
