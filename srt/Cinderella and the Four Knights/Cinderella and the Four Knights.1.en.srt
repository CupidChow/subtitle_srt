Cinderella and Four Knights

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,162
A long, long time ago, there lived a kind and beautiful girl named Cinderella.

10
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:56,625
She was always abused by her stepmother and stepsisters.

11
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,729
But on one fateful day, she met a wonderful prince

12
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,524
and thus, she lived happily ever after...

13
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:05,192
Yeah, as if!

14
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:11,066
Cinderellas these days don't have time to meet any princes

15
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:15,010
because all they do is work, work, work!

16
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:20,458
And on top of that, "princes" nowadays are just complete jerks.

17
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:23,169
They all have Casanova complexes, and act so arrogant!

18
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,555
I wish someone would tell them to stop acting with a sense of entitlement.!

19
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:29,918
Cinderella

20
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:34,072
That's why you shouldn't wait around for some dumb prince

21
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:36,216
and depend on yourself to survive, instead. Got it?

22
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:37,392
- Yes!
- Yes!

23
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:38,968
Good!

24
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:45,725
Cinderella and the Four Knights

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,094
Wow, what a great view!

26
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:17,732
Just wait, okay? I'll be a college student starting next month too!

27
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:25,290
Sunbaenims, your pizza delivery is here!

28
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,050
Hanguk National University of Education Welcome freshmen to Hanguk University

29
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:49,831
Huh? The nerve.

30
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:53,059
You're in for it. You'll die today.

31
00:02:57,797 --> 00:02:59,424
You're totally dead!

32
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:15,332
Come on, just a bit more! Come on, please?

33
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:16,983
Oh no!

34
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:29,871
Damn it, where did he disappear to?

35
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,308
Here.

36
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:38,980
Thank you so much! Please let me buy you a cup of coffee, at the very least.

37
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,074
Can I have your number?

38
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:44,553
I'd really like to thank you somehow...

39
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:53,185
What's with that guy who just left?

40
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:56,673
I feel like I just met my knight in shining armor!

41
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,842
He even got my bag back for me!

42
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,629
Oh, so this bag was yours?

43
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,249
This bag is like my glass slipper.

44
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:15,291
Glass slipper? Yeah, right.

45
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,446
But it seems like there are still some decent guys out there.

46
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:27,737
Oh, yes, sir? I just finished my delivery, and I'm on my way back—

47
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:30,765
I'll be back really soon! I'm coming!

48
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,032
- What do you want?
- A handbag?

49
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:50,034
- A handbag?
- Hyeon Min!

50
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,837
- Do you know this person?
- Huh?

51
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:05,809
Um, no. I just...

52
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:08,928
Did you really have to go and start dating one of my friends?

53
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:13,350
To me, there are only two kinds of women in this world.

54
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:17,237
The girls whom I've already dated and the girls I'll date in the future.

55
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:21,082
Do I really need to make a separate category for her just because she's your friend?

56
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:21,983
Why?

57
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,985
Are you really going to be this way?

58
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:28,673
You really have crappy taste in men.

59
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:31,535
And what do you want?

60
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,829
I kept you waiting, right? Let's go.

61
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:37,999
I thought you said that you weren't interested in Haneul Group.

62
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,254
So why do you keep hanging around here?

63
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:49,093
When you come here, do you find yourself wanting this hotel and this company more and more?

64
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:52,605
You're not having delusions that you'll inherit all this, are you?

65
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,224
It's not like I couldn't.

66
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,444
You're taking the joke a bit too far.

67
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:01,356
Are you acting this way because you don't know your place?

68
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,642
Hey. Don't get the wrong idea.

69
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,578
You're just trash, understood?

70
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:17,113
You think I'm joking around? Should I really show you something funny?

71
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:19,507
How dare you grab your older relative by the collar?

72
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,810
You should be respectful to your elders.

73
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,482
Older relative? I don't have any family like you.

74
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,679
Get lost.

75
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,394
You still have a long, long way to go.

76
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,735
Um... Hyeon Min!

77
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,149
Why do you always get into fights with him?

78
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,676
I don't like arguing with him either.

79
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:56,369
Then don't.

80
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,140
Why don't you follow that advice yourself first?

81
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,301
But you know, you really have low standards for men.

82
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,713
Make sure you get my approval for the guy you'll marry, okay?

83
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:09,173
Again with your nagging!

84
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,459
You're the one who was late for lunch.

85
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,161
Let's go.

86
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,288
Gosh, you're so gross!

87
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:34,824
What? They don't expire until the end of today!

88
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:37,077
And you're just going to throw all of this out anyway.

89
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:40,463
I'll eat it all, so don't worry!

90
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,275
Ugh, whatever! Take it! Take it all!

91
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:48,555
You really are the best, Boss! And so kind!

92
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:53,143
- Geez, seriously.
- Goodbye!

93
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:54,544
Whatever. Leave already!

94
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,360
- Then why are you with her?
- Because of love.

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
- Why are you matching couple shoes?
- Because of love.

96
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,730
- Why are you matching couple clothes?
- Because of love.

97
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,260
- Why are you a couple?
- Because of love.

98
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Why can't I do all these things with my boyfriend?

99
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,286
Um, I'm home.

100
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:15,910
I don't care what bad things you might say, I'm curious to hear.

101
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,050
That's how love is supposed to be...

102
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,771
Hey, do the dishes properly.

103
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,574
Are you trying to make it obvious that you hate doing it?

104
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:27,952
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll scrub them really well next time.

105
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:31,555
Also, did you pick up the clothes I left at the dry cleaners?

106
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:35,118
Oh no, I totally forgot. I'll definitely pick it up tomorrow, Unni. Sorry.

107
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:37,745
Damn it, again with the unni thing!

108
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:39,739
Pisses me off.

109
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:43,284
Gosh, you don't know how to do anything right.

110
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:45,778
I wonder whom you take after?

111
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:48,781
Her dead mom, obviously.

112
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:03,079
Part-Time Job Listings

113
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:10,962
Hmm. I'll call this one up next week.

114
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:17,060
I'll get my paycheck from the convenience store in three days

115
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,555
and I'll be getting paid from the restaurant in a week.

116
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,850
Objective: 4 million won for college tuition deposit!

117
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:29,322
Yay! I see the light at the end of the tunnel!

118
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:32,275
You can do it, Eun Ha Won!

119
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,470
Damn it, I really have to find another job!

120
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:04,432
Arrive exactly at 6 p.m. There is an important development in your grandfather's personal life.

121
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:08,411
If you don't come, I will freeze all of your credit cards.

122
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,114
If you don't come

123
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:13,692
I'll take your birth secret to the grave.

124
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,112
Has Grandfather gone bankrupt?

125
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:01,572
Did grandfather collapse?

126
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,876
Where's grandfather?

127
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,770
Invitation

128
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,502
Is this what you would freeze my cards for?

129
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:26,172
Hyung, I canceled my plans for this!

130
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:30,485
I wouldn't have been able to see all three of you at once otherwise.

131
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,371
Are you the one who contacted us?

132
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:36,991
Are you kidding?

133
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,319
This is grandfather's...

134
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:46,243
Grandfather's wedding invitation? Wow. Are you serious?

135
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,687
Yeah. Honestly, this isn't right.

136
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:51,555
I'm not going.

137
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,817
Hey, you're not the only one who doesn't want to go.

138
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:58,938
All three of you, as family, must attend.

139
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,632
- Who are you calling family?
- Who are you calling family?

140
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,571
First, there was a cousin who popped out of nowhere,

141
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,366
and now we're getting a new grandmother who's my mom's age?

142
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:10,984
That's why I said that I wouldn't go.

143
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:12,635
Are you two fighting again?

144
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:15,855
Kang Ji Woon!

145
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,092
Who the hell are you calling Kang Ji Woon?

146
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:21,193
I'm Han Ji Woon.

147
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:35,500
I'll be leaving too then. I have a lot on my schedule.

148
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:44,409
You have to come.

149
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:49,639
Of course. It's our grandfather's fifth wedding, after all.

150
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,984
I'll even bring a gift.

151
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:14,747
This is where the chairman's other grandchildren reside together.

152
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,834
That is the room we prepared for you.

153
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,899
Please get some rest, then. The chairman will be here for dinner.

154
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:34,351
Yes, Chairman. I just escorted him to the Haneul House..

155
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,424
Who the hell are you?

156
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:50,716
And who the hell are you?

157
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:55,371
You don't know who I am? Are you new here or something?

158
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:58,249
Oh, you must be the new cleaning guy.

159
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:02,895
Sure. I'll let you off the hook since it's your first time. You can go.

160
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:06,015
What did you just say?

161
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,067
Mr. Ji Woon!

162
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:27,403
You two are cousins.

163
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,731
Cousins?

164
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:33,468
Mr. Kang Ji Woon is the son of the late Mr. Seok Cheol.

165
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:36,504
How could uncle have a son when he never even got married?

166
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:38,122
That's just ridiculous.

167
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,808
Did you really confirm this thoroughly?

168
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,447
Hey. Where is your mom from?

169
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,149
I mean, what kind of great family are you from

170
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,260
that they kept you hidden all this time?

171
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,079
Did you live abroad this whole time?

172
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:53,780
What school did you attend?

173
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,158
I lived in an orphanage after my mom passed away ten years ago,

174
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:59,010
and I dropped out of high school.

175
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,097
What? Wow.

176
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:07,802
- Mr. Kang Ji Woon is—
- I was worried for nothing!

177
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:12,774
But, is it grandfather's new hobby to go find himself new grandsons or something?

178
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:17,045
It wasn't even that long ago that he took that busker kid off the streets.

179
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:19,531
Well, one thing's for sure: he definitely is an interesting old man.

180
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:21,057
Right?

181
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,889
You'll soon get used to things around here.

182
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,741
I have to get used to this?

183
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:54,065
- Director Kim.
- Oh, yes.

184
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,386
Director Kim is here, sir.

185
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,829
Ten minutes.

186
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:04,425
The Hanyeong Financial Times keeps publishing gossipy news about us

187
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:07,486
and it's been having an effect on our company's image.

188
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:12,333
Both about your wedding and grandsons-—

189
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,210
There's no need to worry.

190
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,428
Excuse me?

191
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:22,727
I took over that publication yesterday.

192
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:28,967
If any more troublesome things happen, go and buy a portal site.

193
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,826
That'll be all, you can go.

194
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,093
So, you can't get it to happen, huh?

195
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:45,749
I think they all won't come.

196
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:51,923
So not a single one of them understands how I feel.

197
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,811
I can't do all this by myself for much longer.

198
00:16:56,811 --> 00:17:01,190
I need a successor who will lead Haneul Group.

199
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,001
They're all still quite young, sir.

200
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:06,212
But I'm sure I'll see which one of them deserves the position

201
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,384
by watching them living together and duking it out among themselves.

202
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:13,786
Yes, sir.

203
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:19,717
Make sure you at least get them to show their faces at my wedding.

204
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:21,794
There will be many people watching us on that day.

205
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:26,958
If I let them off the hook for mistakes they make just because they're young

206
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:31,112
All of that will add up eventually and make them terrible people.

207
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,615
And that will be detrimental to Haneul Group, as a whole.

208
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:35,450
I understand, sir.

209
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:58,281
How many times has this been already? Do I have to pay the repair fee again?

210
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:01,151
You'll put us in a difficult position if you continue acting this way.

211
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,703
This isn't my fault!

212
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,805
What's going on over there?

213
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,916
- Ugh, not that guy again.
- Hey, Mister!

214
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,193
He's some blogger.

215
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:13,238
He did something to his car and is trying to blame it on us!

216
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,440
How many times has it been, already?

217
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,408
And he keeps threatening to post a bad review of us online!

218
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:33,491
Hey. Hey! Who the hell are you?

219
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,769
- Do you have a death wish?
- Not particularly.

220
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,340
What did you say, you little punk?

221
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,150
Do you know how expensive this car is?

222
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,144
I'm sure I know better than you.

223
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:49,140
Hyung, I'll pay for the repairs on both of these cars.

224
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,651
- Ji Woon.
- Get whatever you want fixed.

225
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,712
But in exchange, apologize.

226
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:57,940
Apologize, and don't come back here with this entitlement act ever again.

227
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,864
Where is Kang Seo Woo!? He was supposed to be on standby! Where did he go?

228
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:06,132
Kang Seo Woo's Manager!

229
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:13,273
- Hey, you look over there.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,484
Jingle Jingle Manager

231
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:38,172
How could you dump someone via Kakao talk?

232
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:41,175
It's great, I even used emoticons!

233
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,652
Didn't I send the teary emoticon?

234
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:45,955
- When did I say I was your woman?
- Oh, that

235
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:52,487
That's right. Because all the women in this world are my women.

236
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:56,766
- That's why I'm a bit busy.
- Hey, Kang Hyeon Min!

237
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,527
Why, I should really—

238
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:07,302
- Is that rumor really true?
- Which rumor?

239
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:09,979
I heard that you grant girls one wish after you break up with them.

240
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,906
Just say the word.

241
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,954
There goes another one of my cars.

242
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:21,466
Taxi!

243
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:31,618
- Oh, what's that, over there?
- What?

244
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:35,413
- I don't see anything— oh!
- You fell for it again!

245
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:40,609
- My Madame Ji, I love how naive you are.
- Oh, Chairman!

246
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,779
Oh... I mean, Honey.

247
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:47,267
Oh, what's that on your skirt though?

248
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:50,820
- There's something on my skirt?
- Wow, what a nice bow.

249
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,333
Geez, you drive me insane! I can't live. I can't live.

250
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,566
No need to congratulate me. I'm just getting started.

251
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:10,181
His grandsons? They're nothing to worry about.

252
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:18,131
They're all predictable third-generation chaebols. I have a plan up my sleeve.

253
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:21,609
My new grandmother and my mom are the same age.

254
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,962
And at this rate, I might get myself a baby uncle.

255
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:27,982
Wow, that'll make for one seriously complicated family tree!

256
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:30,226
Is he dissing me?

257
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,287
Why does it feel like he doesn't care about what I think?

258
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:36,057
Hey, I shouldn't just sit still and do nothing, right?

259
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:39,160
What are you going to do, then? The ceremony is tomorrow.

260
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:43,414
All right, let's shake up grandfather's wedding! Let's do it.

261
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:51,664
Whoever ... I'll take the first girl who walks through that door to the wedding.

262
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,499
I really want to dissect your brain.

263
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,327
Just what kind of thoughts do you have in there?

264
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:59,022
I'm sure that girls who come here won't be such easy catches, though.

265
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:03,834
I don't care. It'll be more fun if she's a psycho.

266
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:24,648
Your pizza delivery is here!

267
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:38,987
That's weird. Are you sure that you came to the right place?

268
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:41,039
What? You ordered five pizzas, and I brought you five.

269
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,216
No, I'm talking about this.

270
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,376
Special Requests:
Send your prettiest delivery girl

271
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:49,280
That's for requests, like "The elevator is broken so take the stairs."

272
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,633
Or "Nobody's home, so leave it at the front of the door."

273
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,610
Those types of things are the only things you should be writing, Customer.

274
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,922
Says who? Is that a law or something?

275
00:22:57,922 --> 00:23:01,076
I clearly requested that the prettiest delivery girl deliver this,

276
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:02,911
But some ugly girl like you showed up,

277
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:05,563
so isn't it only fair that I get to express my discontent, as the customer?

278
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:10,209
You'll be paying with a card, right? That'll be 184,500 won.

279
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,404
I'm too annoyed right now to eat. What will you do about it?

280
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:16,408
Stop messing around and pay up, while I'm still being nice.

281
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,602
It's 184,500 won.

282
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:22,179
What the hell? Are you threatening a customer right now?

283
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,718
What, does that piss you off?

284
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:32,031
Why are you talking back so much, when you're just some damn delivery vermin?

285
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:38,655
Hey. What are you planning to do?

286
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:40,740
You'll just end up having to pay hospital fees if you use your fists.

287
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,042
Who said that I'd use my fists?

288
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,600
Excuse me, I'll pay. Please, let me pay.

289
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:21,639
Apologize for calling me "delivery vermin."

290
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:25,502
Fine. Sorry. Sorry, all right?

291
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:28,655
There are so many delivery people in this country riding around

292
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:32,000
at this hour of the night for the sake of customers!

293
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,661
And yet, you dare call us "delivery vermin?"

294
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:37,972
- How dare you compare us to insects!
- All right. I'll apologize for that too.

295
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:41,125
Stop living your life like this.

296
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:46,355
I sincerely apologize for the scene!

297
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:55,065
Do you think you'll be able to bring her?

298
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:57,467
- Are you underestimating me?
- She's a total thug, though!

299
00:24:57,467 --> 00:25:00,937
Hey, come on. I'm a man of my word.

300
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:05,658
I'm a true Korean man, and honor the promises I make.

301
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:08,652
There is always a way. Here I go!

302
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:29,357
This is the last college, right?

303
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,780
Name: Choi Yoo Na.
Acceptance: I'm sorry, you have failed.

304
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,129
See I told you, I did not want to go to college!

305
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,471
It's no use!

306
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:46,717
I sent you to expensive prep schools and got you all of the rich kids' tutors

307
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:49,819
so you could meet Kang Hyeon Min!

308
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:53,523
And since that didn't work, the least >you could've done was get into college!

309
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:57,027
- Damn it!
- Whatever!

310
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:00,388
Why are you taking all of this out on me?

311
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,593
I'm home.

312
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:09,564
Why do you keep wearing your school uniform when you're graduating soon?

313
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:11,783
If other people saw this, they'd say that you look like you're from a poor family!

314
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:14,435
They'd direct their insults at me, not you!

315
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,139
It's just that this is comfortable.

316
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:21,534
- Oh, is it now?
- I'm sorry.

317
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:26,831
- Check just one more time.
- Why? It's not worth looking again!

318
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,005
Stepmom, can I use the computer, just this once?

319
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:41,695
Did you apply to college, by any chance?

320
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:49,695
Fine, go ahead and check.

321
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:02,534
Hankook National University of Education?

322
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:06,705
I want to become a teacher. That was what my mom wanted.

323
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:13,587
Wow, what's the use of raising you, when all you care about is your dead mom?

324
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:17,732
- That's not what I meant.
- Whatever!

325
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:22,854
You shouldn't dream too big, you know.

326
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:25,331
If you do, you'll only end up getting disappointed.

327
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:29,035
Have dreams that are more appropriate for a person at your level, okay?

328
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:39,697
Congratulations.
You've been accepted!

329
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:52,367
Well, it's not like just anyone can go to college, you know.

330
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:55,003
You need money to go.

331
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,407
I've saved up enough money for the initial deposit

332
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:03,602
and I'll pay the rest off with part-time jobs while I'm at school.

333
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,356
Yes! Yes! This is amazing!

334
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:29,146
Wow, I had a pretty rough day. But this makes up for all of that!

335
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:41,800
Mom, I'm a college student now! I got in, Mom!

336
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:45,779
It won't be long until I fulfill your dream of me becoming a college student!

337
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,698
Your daughter is totally awesome, right?

338
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:55,939
I miss you, Mom. I'll come see you soon!

339
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:17,669
Butler Kim!

340
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,840
Butler Kim!

341
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:29,472
- Butler! Are you here?
- Butler Kim!

342
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:33,268
Why is the house such a mess?

343
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:49,367
- What's that noise?
- There's nobody here.

344
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:55,756
Over here, sir! I'm over here, on the ceiling!

345
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:08,929
I'm sorry, Chairman, but I'll be quitting.

346
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:16,353
Your grandsons are devils! Devils!

347
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,194
Um, Chairman. Uh, that's not what I meant.

348
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:26,738
It's fine! It's hereditary, after all.

349
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:29,157
Chairman!

350
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:31,109
Why can't I have some peace and quiet, just for one day?

351
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:34,204
This was expected when you called the boys together, was it not?

352
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:38,166
Even so, it's been a year already since >those three have been living together.

353
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,235
I can't let them act this way for much longer.

354
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:43,262
I'll find a new butler as soon as possible.

355
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:44,773
Just use the money to get someone.

356
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:49,861
I'm sure someone will be willing. And if he quits, we can hire a pricier one.

357
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,220
Yes, sir.

358
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:57,602
Gosh. Who could I hire that can beat some sense into all of them?

359
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:02,740
I can pay my deposit when I get paid tomorrow!

360
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:10,673
I finally saved up 4 million won! Four mil... 4 mil... yay! Four mil!

361
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:13,392
- I think you miscalculated.
- Excuse me?

362
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:15,512
This one thing costs 4 million won?

363
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:18,389
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

364
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:24,453
That'll be 1,500 won. Oh, and this is a 1 + 1 item.

365
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,856
- What?
- It's a 1 + 1 item.

366
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,677
- What does that mean?
- Buy one, get one free.

367
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:33,579
Wait, really? Wow.

368
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:36,666
But, what should I do? I'm only planning to eat one.

369
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,994
But still, the other one would be free.

370
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,600
Wow, you eat fast.

371
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,228
- It is free, after all.
- Are you speaking informally to me?

372
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,814
- Well, you started it!
- But I'm a customer.

373
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:53,474
- But you already paid.
- Wow, look at this one.

374
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:58,654
How thuggish. Well, whatever. I think someone like you will be perfect.

375
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:02,817
- Let me ask you a favor.
- What is it?

376
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:05,962
Give me some of your time tonight from 9 p.m. to midnight.

377
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:08,372
Just three hours.

378
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:13,411
- Leave, okay?
- Hey, I'm still talking! Hey!

379
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:16,389
If you want me to listen, say something that actually makes sense.

380
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,618
I'm not asking you to do this for free. I'll give you 1 million won. (About USD $840)

381
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:25,565
- Okay. How about two million, then?
- Was that ice cream spoiled?

382
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,283
I have money.

383
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:30,119
People who say that they have money are usually the most untrustworthy.

384
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,589
Are you trying to imply that you can buy people with money?

385
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:34,624
Yeah. Why not?

386
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:38,253
Using money to solve problems instead of arguments or violence.

387
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:39,896
Isn't that a lot more pleasant and peaceful for everyone involved?

388
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:44,550
Using money to cover up your problems instead of actually dealing with them?

389
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,545
See? You know what I'm talking about.

390
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:51,115
- Prove it, then.
- Prove it?

391
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:54,469
Prove that you have that kind of money to buy my time.

392
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:06,431
- I've proven myself now, right?
- Yeah.

393
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,518
Want me to give you a tax receipt? Give me your number.

394
00:33:10,518 --> 00:33:14,280
Wow, the lengths people go through to get someone's number these days.

395
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:16,709
Hey, come on!

396
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:21,770
You're at a loss for words because I'm just way too cool, right?

397
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,296
Call me.

398
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,950
Give me 270 centimeters of this, please.

399
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,629
We only sell wholesale amounts. We don't sell such small amounts.

400
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:06,257
There's no other place that sells this fabric in this color, though!

401
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:08,643
I walked around here so many times and only barely managed to find you!

402
00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:13,539
That's not my problem. I don't sell anything less than 9,000 centimeters.

403
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,300
Please? Just this once!

404
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:20,338
You're a student, right? Just take that sample and go.

405
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:24,317
I wouldn't have gone through all this just for a sample!

406
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:29,180
I'm making something for a really important occasion. Please? Can't you do it just this once?

407
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,157
No.

408
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:43,044
You mixed up all of my samples! It'll take a month to reorganize them!

409
00:34:44,788 --> 00:34:47,165
- I can do it for you in 30 minutes.
- What?

410
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:49,651
I'll set your display back up to the way it was, in 30 minutes.

411
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:53,588
But in exchange, you have to sell me some of that fabric, okay?

412
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:56,123
Fine, go ahead and try.

413
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,251
Why did you come here so late at night?

414
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,203
I thought you might've missed me.

415
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:45,840
- Did you have dinner?
- No, I'll eat later.

416
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,661
Oh, really? I'll go stop by a convenience store nearby then.

417
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:52,288
- No, it's fine.
- Just wait.

418
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,310
- Hello.
- Can you heat all these up, please?

419
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,036
Of course.

420
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,939
That'll be 98,000 won.

421
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:15,712
- Um, sir?
- Just a moment.

422
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:19,007
Why does he always choose convenience store food?

423
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:22,143
- Why does he treat us so poorly?
- What is it now?

424
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:26,255
He shouldn't use all that money for himself, and lend us some of it too!

425
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:28,124
I mean, how nice would that be?

426
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:29,643
You caused trouble again, didn't you?

427
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:35,965
Um, no. Actually, my younger sibling beat someone up

428
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:38,209
and they want six million won as a settlement.

429
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:43,756
Stop it. He asked us to treat him just as we did before.

430
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:45,734
In other words, he doesn't want you to talk to him about money.

431
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:48,119
But back then, all of us were in debt together!

432
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:53,483
Honestly, isn't he being too much? We've known each other for so many years!

433
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,384
Stop saying things like that!

434
00:36:56,327 --> 00:37:01,466
It only takes a single moment to sever ties with someone else.

435
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:27,558
Huh? What's going on?

436
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:35,300
Um, sir! You have to pay for the food.

437
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:38,228
Oh.

438
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:40,297
Do you not have money?

439
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,109
You asked me to heat up everything, so I already opened them all!

440
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:47,111
I'll pay you tomorrow.

441
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,638
What?

442
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:54,144
Why am I being hit from all sides today?

443
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:58,982
- How am I supposed to believe that?
- I'll definitely pay you.

444
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:02,326
You're just doing this so that you don't have to pay, right?

445
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,926
I have way too much money to be pulling that kind of scam on you.

446
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:13,888
Are you serious?

447
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,435
Hurry up and pay.

448
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:35,051
You're such a jerk. You're not even going to say sorry?

449
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:43,235
Make sure you bring that money by tomorrow!

450
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:14,883
Yeah, Jung Hoon?

451
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,887
Park Hye Ji! I have a piece of unbelievable news, just for you.

452
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:20,029
What is it?

453
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:24,484
Hyeon Min might be bringing a girl to his grandfather's wedding!

454
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:26,911
You should prepare yourself.

455
00:39:28,196 --> 00:39:29,447
A girl?

456
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:33,634
I mean, Hyeon Min has tons of girls. Bye.

457
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:42,410
- Are you hurt?
- Oh, I'm okay. When did you get here?

458
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:46,656
Hey, a girl shouldn't be doing this to her fingers all the time!

459
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:49,717
Where do you keep your band-aids?

460
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:33,136
Mom.

461
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:01,430
Dad, are you busy? It's been six months since I've seen you.

462
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,483
When are you coming home?

463
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:09,380
Tomorrow is the anniversary of Mom's death.
Can you not make it?

464
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:13,127
- Um, excuse me.
- Yes?

465
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:15,530
Where's the urn that used to be here?

466
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:19,201
- It is my mother's.
- Oh. This one?

467
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,871
You didn't know? The payment on this space is five years overdue now.

468
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,473
And we couldn't get in touch with the guardian, either.

469
00:42:25,473 --> 00:42:27,383
So are you saying that you threw it away?

470
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:31,262
We didn't throw it away. We have it in storage.

471
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:33,556
- In storage?
- Yes.

472
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:37,652
How could you just shove it in storage because of overdue payments?

473
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:40,030
Do people need to be evicted, even in death, just because they can't pay rent?

474
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,682
We have our internal rules as well.

475
00:42:43,682 --> 00:42:45,427
How much money do we owe you?

476
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:48,488
- Five million won.
- What?

477
00:42:48,488 --> 00:42:53,192
- Five million won?
- Five... million?

478
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:55,294
Get out of the way.

479
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:00,617
Can you keep things quiet around here?

480
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:05,138
I apologize. Let's continue this outside.

481

482
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:50,417
Please, sir. Can you take my mom out of storage? Please!

483
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:52,669
Please.

484
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,928
Sir! You have to pay. You can't even say you're sorry?

485
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:56,274
A present for you, Mom!

486
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:59,786
My kindergarten teacher told me

487
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:03,523
that you're supposed to give white roses to people you respect

488
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:10,120
Make sure you become a teacher that is well-respected, Ha Won!

490
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:34,760

Mom. I do have the money,

513
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,937
Ta-da! What do you think?

514
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:42,123
I made this to wear to the wedding.

515
00:47:42,123 --> 00:47:45,176
- What wedding?
- Your grandfather's.

516
00:47:45,802 --> 00:47:48,013
You're going, right?

517
00:47:49,614 --> 00:47:51,474
I'm not going.

518
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:56,395
- You're really not going?
- Nobody wants me there, anyway.

519
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:04,379
Hyeon Min is apparently bringing some girl.

520
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:07,840
Does that bother you?

521
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,394
Can't you come with me?

522
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:16,349
- I'd usually do you any favor, but—
- All right.

523
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,743
Sorry for asking.

524
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:22,856
Why did you ask me for a favor that you knew I couldn't do for you?

525
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:27,284
That's not very good manners.

526
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:39,805
All right. All I need is one million won.

527
00:48:55,113 --> 00:48:59,017
- Your offer is still valid, right?
- Of course.

528
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:05,681
Fine. But in exchange, give me cash.
And I can't give you a tax receipt.

529
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:09,944
You're quite amusing. That isn't what I expected you to say.

530
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:14,223
Fine, then. But let me have a one plus one.

531
00:49:14,223 --> 00:49:16,000
What are you talking about?

532
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,946
- Act like my fiancee for three hours.
- What? Your fiancee?

533
00:49:19,946 --> 00:49:21,539
What, you don't want to?

534
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:23,466
You're never going to get another chance

535
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:26,044
to earn so much money in three hours.

536
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,730
Why do you need a fiancee for three hours?

537
00:49:31,174 --> 00:49:36,537
Oh, because of my grandfather.

538
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:37,681
Your grandfather?

539
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:44,454
He's quite ill and really wants to see me settled down before he dies.

540
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:47,748
Oh, is he really ill?

541
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,003
One of my relatives is getting married today.

542
00:49:52,003 --> 00:50:00,086
And today is the last day that grandfather gets to leave the hospital.

543
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:06,243
Oh, okay, fine!

544
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:12,398
I don't want to participate in your lie, but I'll agree to this for now.

545
00:50:12,398 --> 00:50:15,402
But in exchange, if you try to pull anything,

546
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:17,695
I really won't stand for it.

547
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:21,925
All right. Okay. Since we're engaged, we should introduce ourselves.

548
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:24,819
I'm Kang Hyeon Min. And you are?

549
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:27,363
I'm Eun Ha Won.

550
00:50:34,529 --> 00:50:36,673
Wow, you sure are strange.

551
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:39,451
How is it that you're looking elsewhere when you're right next to me?

552
00:50:40,227 --> 00:50:41,870
What's wrong with you?

553
00:50:42,704 --> 00:50:44,239
Don't act like we are close.

554
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:49,127
Hey, we're engaged, you know. So we should try to act the part.

555
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:50,979
Forget it!

556
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,810
You'll be my fiancée for three hours tonight.

557
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,737
A chance like this won't come again, so let's have fun.

558
00:51:01,181 --> 00:51:04,975
All of this will be over at midnight on the dot!

559
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,700
This is the location of Haneul Group's Chairman's fifth wedding!

560
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,832
They say Korean royalty will be divided into two categories tonight:

561
00:51:18,832 --> 00:51:22,577
those who were invited to this wedding, and those who were not.

562
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:25,296
However, the biggest question tonight is

563
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:31,294
will the Kang cousins, who've never been seen together in one place, all show up?

564
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:42,480
- Who the hell is that?
- Who is that?

565
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,881
- Hey!
- Who the hell is that?

566
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:45,775
Lady Killer Kang Hyeon Min has made his entrance!

567
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:48,728
What the— What girl did he bring?

568
00:52:03,034 --> 00:52:05,661
Kang Seo Woo, who is the youngest cousin and a huge star, arrived.

569
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,639
He's definitely the most handsome!

570
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:16,706
Now, if the rebellious Kang Ji Woon shows up,

571
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:19,000
then all three cousins will have shown up.

572
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,311
Will Kang Ji Woon come to the wedding?

573
00:52:47,704 --> 00:52:49,823
What's all this?

574
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,000
You have to transform into my fiancee now. Let' play!

575
00:53:10,285 --> 00:53:11,644
What?

576
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:15,606
- Are you with someone?
- Yeah.

577
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,784
- Who?
- You don't know her.

578
00:53:19,803 --> 00:53:22,163
What kind of girl is she?

579
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:27,836
Don't you get tired of obsessing over me?

580
00:53:28,511 --> 00:53:33,358
This has nothing to do with you, so mind your own business.

581
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,532
He wants me to wear this? What a total pervert!

582
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:10,787
Should I just quit now and tell him to find someone else?

583
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:16,459
No, I can't do that. His grandfather is waiting.

584
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:29,574
All done.

585
00:55:49,727 --> 00:55:53,264
What the hell is this? This isn't a children's choir!

586
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:56,993
I ate so many raw eggs to be chosen for this!

587
00:55:56,993 --> 00:56:02,231
I'm the prettiest one here. It's okay. Let's do this!

588
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:25,180
I'm halfway there now. Halfway there.

589
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,594
- We're ready now, Chairman.
- Okay.

590
00:56:32,304 --> 00:56:35,265
It's showtime. Let's go.

591
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:01,342
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

592
00:58:02,727 --> 00:58:06,339
- What are we doing right now?
- The wedding march.

593
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:10,860
- We're getting married.
- What?

594
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:16,457
- Hey, are you crazy?
- No.

595
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:18,894
Hey, this is different from what you told me!

596
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:21,096
It's only a tiny bit different. A tiny bit.

597
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:23,473
- We can't do this.
- It's fine!

598
00:58:23,473 --> 00:58:27,752
- What are you trying to pull here?
- People are waiting. Come on.

599
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:30,205
No, this isn't right!

600
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:34,951
Let's go.

601
00:58:34,968 --> 00:58:37,529
What are you doing? Put me down, now!

602
00:58:37,529 --> 00:58:39,255
Shush! Be quiet.

603
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:46,721
- Oh my.
- What's going on?

604
00:59:00,568 --> 00:59:06,458
My lovely grandfather, I give you my fiancee as your wedding present.

605
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,000
Why, you... You!

606
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:12,339
- Fiancee?
- Oh my!

607
00:59:12,339 --> 00:59:15,183
Where are you from, young lady?

608
00:59:15,183 --> 00:59:16,859
What?

609
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:19,729
If you're someone that our Hyeon Min would bring here—

610
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:22,098
Um, I'm a senior at Jeongsan Girls' High.

611
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,794
Hey, say hello. This is my grandfather's fifth wife.

612
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:38,748
You. How dare you speak so rudely!

613
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:43,753
I'm sorry! It wasn't my intention to ruin your special day!

614
00:59:43,753 --> 00:59:48,591
- Hey, what are you doing?
- That's what I'd like to ask you!

615
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:52,403
You're rebelling toward your grandfather here, of all places? You're not a child!

616
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:55,273
What are you doing? Hurry up and apologize!

617
00:59:55,273 --> 00:59:57,191
Why should I?

618
00:59:57,191 --> 01:00:00,045
- Hurry up and do it.
- I don't want to.

619
01:00:09,955 --> 01:00:11,614
I'm so sorry.

620
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:31,476
Time out. I'm leaving.

621
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:34,329
Hey, no round two?

622
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:35,681
No.

623
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:39,576
What, she's really your fiancee?

624
01:00:40,552 --> 01:00:45,724
Of course! Say hello. You know him, right? He's the singer, Kang Seo Woo.

625
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:49,311
We're cousins. It's nice to meet you.

626
01:00:52,272 --> 01:00:54,341
The time right now is...

627
01:00:54,341 --> 01:00:56,234
Oh... yes.

628
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:01,505
Aren't you being too much right now, to Hye Ji?

629
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:08,779
It's not like I have any relationship with Park Hye Ji.

630
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:14,343
How about you stop overreacting in front of my girl?

631
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,501
So, you're Hyeon Min's fiancee?

632
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:33,163
Um, yeah.

633
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,783
I'm Park Hye Ji. I've been friends with Hyeon Min since we were young.

634
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:41,196
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

635
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:48,978
"Nice to meet you?" Have you no pride?

636
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:53,032
Ji Woon. What are you doing?

637
01:01:55,627 --> 01:01:58,171
Did you come all the way here because of money?

638
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:02,533
Do you really need money that badly?

639
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,300
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

640
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,340
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

641
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:43,400
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie pointing only at you ♫

642
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,350
♫  Why did you show up now? ♫

643
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,350
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

644
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,980
♫  I've bet my everything on you ♫

645
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,950
♫  You are so precious. ♫

646
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:57,100
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫

647
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,040
♫  From the first to the last, I wonder about everything. ♫
