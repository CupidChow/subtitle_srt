00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,617
I will now announce the results

10
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,970
regarding the dismissal of Chairman Kang Jong Du.

11
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,935
52 percent in opposition,

12
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,189
46 percent in favor.

13
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,901
And two percent abstained from voting.

14
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:12,514
Chairman Kang Jong Du will not be dismissed.

15
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,841
Why did you do that?

16
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,114
You made a terrible mistake today.

17
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:41,643
Your decision dragged us both down to the very bottom!

18
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:47,040
This was the only way that I could stop you.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,361
Did you want to protect Haneul Group, the Chairman, and those brats so badly

20
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:57,467
that you'd betray your own mother for them?

21
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,181
What happened?

22
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,641
I don't know.

23
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,162
The Chairman was moved to the recovery room, but Ji Woon...

24
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,982
The Chairman's liver transplant was successful.

25
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,659
What about Kang Ji Woon, then?

26
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,995
Mr. Ji Woon went into shock.

27
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,249
Thankfully, he's no longer in critical condition

28
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,192
but he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

29
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,112
You said that there weren't any issues when you tested him, though!

30
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:55,300
Actually, we discovered that he's allergic to anesthesia, during testing.

31
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,204
I warned him that he may fall into shock during the surgery.

32
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,891
But despite that, he still wished to have the procedure done.

33
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:09,873
So... are you saying that he may not be able to wake up, then?

34
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,861
We'll have to monitor his condition.

35
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,072
No way...

36
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,088
You're alive now, thanks to Mr. Ji Woon.

37
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,453
I'm so relieved, Grandfather.

38
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,391
He's okay now, right?

39
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,852
There are no signs of his body rejecting the organ just yet

40
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,896
but we'll have to monitor him closely, just to be sure.

41
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:55,318
Is Ji Woon... all right?

42
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:02,492
He's recovering from the surgery.You needn't worry, sir.

43
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,980
♫  A sad dream always ♫

44
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,320
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,680
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

46
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,801
Go and rest. You spent all night here yesterday, too.

47
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh... I'm fine.

48
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,058
I'll contact you when Ji Woon wakes up.

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,240
♫  Even each moment I take a breath  ♫

50
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,422
You know...

51
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,410
♫ hurts ♫

52
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:57,047
I never once considered the idea that Ji Woon could possibly leave me.

53
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,722
I just thought it'd enough or me to stay away from him.

54
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,500
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

55
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:12,103
That's why I tried to forget about him...

56
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,180
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

57
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,280
and ran away, like that.

58
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,330
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

59
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,030
There's so much that we haven't done yet.

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,320
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

61
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,995
I wanted to go to Namsan Tower and put a love lock there with him.

62
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,930
I wanted to go to a theme park with him.

63
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,200
♫  Without you ♫

64
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,879
I wanted to go shopping with him, and pick out some clothes for him, but...

65
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,820
♫  I'm not letting you go. ♫

66
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,510
♫  Without you ♫

67
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:51,268
I didn't even properly tell Ji Woon that I like him.

68
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,310
♫  I will wait for you forever. ♫

69
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,732
I should've loved him more.

70
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,920
♫  Without you ♫

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,696
♫  Without you ♫

72
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,608
But I've never really ever done anything for him, now that I think about it.

73
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,603
I'm sure that Ji Woon knows how you feel.

74
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,760
♫  Without you ♫

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,290
♫  I'll always love you. ♫

76
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,630
I've processed your letter of resignation.

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,300
Make sure you formally relinquish the stocks you have before you go.

78
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,648
And give this to Madam Ji.

79
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,184
They're divorce papers.

80
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,103
I apologize, sir.

81
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:42,068
Madam Ji... is actually my mother.

82
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,073
Mother did nothing wrong.

83
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,617
This is all my fault.

84
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,228
I'll take responsibility for everything and leave.

85
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:57,717
Thank you for everything up until now, sir.

86
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,710
I thought I told you to never see Grandfather again.

87
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,179
I was giving him my last goodbye.

88
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:25,111
And you think you have the right to be doing that?

89
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,983
Let's never see each other again.

90
00:07:52,681 --> 00:08:01,231
Aren't you curious about why I liked you?

91
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,905
At first...

92
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,060
you were a real jerk.

93
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:21,668
But... you'd show up whenever I was going through a hard time.

94
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,468
And before I knew it, I started waiting for you to show up.

95
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:36,057
And before I knew it, I only had eyes for you.

96
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,853
Yesterday...

97
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:48,061
I was thankful for all the little moments that made me fall in love with you.

98
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:57,011
But right now...

99
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,195
you're right in front of me, like this.

100
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,486
And yet, I miss you like crazy.

101
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,333
I did warn him that he may fall into shock due to the anesthesia

102
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,136
but he said that he was the only one who could save you

103
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:41,689
and insisted on having the surgery done.

104
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,419
Can you watch over Ji Woon, Hyeon Min?

105
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:32,424
I'd like Ms. Ha Won to escort me to my room.

106
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,230
I thought you would've left by now.

107
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,217
I'm... sorry, sir.

108
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:56,198
I felt like it was my fault that you collapsed...

109
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:01,161
so I felt so sorry and guilty.

110
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:09,837
So I was going to leave as soon as Ji Woon's surgery ended, but...

111
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:15,984
You're not the reason I collapsed. So please don't think that.

112
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,222
Then...

113
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,976
just until Ji Woon wakes up...

114
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,895
Chairman, you know...

115
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,207
I don't care about my future, or about money.

116
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:37,405
I'll return all the money I got up to now for completing my missions, too.

117
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:43,119
I had nothing to lose in the first place, so I'm not losing anything.

118
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,706
So...

119
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,001
does that mean that you've chosen Ji Woon?

120
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,175
I want to stay by Ji Woon's side.

121
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:06,810
Even if you find yourself in a position where you really need money...

122
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,480
even if you get a chance to escape your dreary reality...

123
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,335
Do you think you'll still be able to give up on everything and choose Ji Woon?

124
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,182
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

125
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:24,886
If you can't take responsibility for your feelings toward Ji Woon to the end

126
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,855
you shouldn't even bring up such matters.

127
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,390
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

128
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,430
♫  I am wanting you so badly but ♫

129
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,430
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

130
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,600
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

131
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,680
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

132
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,340
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

133
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,860
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

134
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,890
♫  As much as my tears which I secretly wipe away ♫

135
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,850
♫  Won't you come to feel like me? ♫

136
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:08,030
♫  My one and only you ♫

137
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:14,240
♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

138
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,330
♫  Like a dream, like a miracle ♫

139
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:27,250
♫  You will be there in the time that I dreamed of ♫

140
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,760
♫ I believe ♫

141
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:50,205
What's going on?

142
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,649
Your father... is at the police station.

143
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,509
What?

144
00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:00,215
Dad fell asleep at the wheel and got into an accident.

145
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:05,362
Is Dad okay? He's not badly hurt, is he?

146
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:07,706
Your dad is fine, but...

147
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,302
the other driver was injured and admitted into the hospital.

148
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:17,807
They're saying that they'll put him in jail unless we settle with them.

149
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,160
How much money are they asking to settle?

150
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,437
6 million won.

151
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:33,307
He begged me not to tell you about this, but...

152
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:38,586
we don't have any money at all.

153
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,299
You're close with the people at Haneul Group, right?

154
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,844
Can't you ask them for some money. Please?

155
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:52,358
This isn't the time for you to be nursing someone else's grandfather!

156
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,322
You're close with the people at Haneul Group, right?

157
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,284
Can't you ask them for some money. Please?

158
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:20,629
Hello?

159
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,593
What did you just say about Ji Woon?

160
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:37,020
Even if you find yourself in a position where you really need money...

161
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,715
even if you get a chance to escape your dreary reality...

162
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,831
do you think you'll still be able to give up on everything and choose Ji Woon?

163
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,744
If you can't take responsibility for your feelings toward Ji Woon to the end

164
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:56,414
you shouldn't bring up such matters.

165
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm sorry. I really am.

166
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:16,543
It's... okay.

167
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:26,069
What about Ha Won?

168
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,204
Thanks for waking up, Ji Woon.

169
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:41,084
Thank you so much.

170
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:56,391
Kang Ji Woon

171
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,903
Is that you, Hyeon Min? Did you take care of the discharge papers?

172
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:28,414
Just listen to me.

173
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:35,263
I got the divorce papers.

174
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,736
Looks like I just ended up disgracing myself

175
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,814
by trying to cause trouble while you were asleep.

176
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:01,823
Did you ever really love me?

177
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:04,392
I loved you.

178
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,087
It's true that all of this started because of love.

179
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:16,237
But then, I saw Yoon Seong and my maternal instincts took over.

180
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,770
It seems that I was being far too greedy.

181
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:30,085
So you want to blame your maternal instincts for your wrongdoing?

182
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,695
No.

183
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,474
That was just my way of loving my son.

184
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:41,663
Even if it was wrong of me to do this, I have no regrets.

185
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,135
I just feel sorry toward you, is all.

186
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,004
If you feel sorry toward me

187
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,315
you can live with that guilt for the rest of your life.

188
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:56,386
I'll never forgive you.

189
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,228
I don't want your forgiveness.

190
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:12,102
So... just keep hating me, but only me.

191
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:20,343
That child protected you, Haneul Group, and your grandsons until the very end.

192
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,897
He couldn't bear to sit and watch me do this

193
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,099
so he held the special shareholders' meeting

194
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,761
only to vote against your dismissal.

195
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:36,251
Yoon Seong's only fault is having a terrible mother like me.

196
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,104
Wretched woman.

197
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,253
Yes, Stepmother.

198
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,191
I sent the settlement money.

199
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:20,137
They told me that Dad will be out soon, so don't worry too much.

200
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,947
Yes.

201
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,628
Are you all right, Dad?

202
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,021
Yeah.

203
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,832
You must have suffered so much.

204
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:34,693
I heard that it was you who got that money.

205
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,905
Where did you get such a large sum of money?

206
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,407
I worked hard at Haneul House.

207
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,903
I got that money honestly, so don't worry!

208
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,453
Let's go home, Ha Won.

209
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:09,228
Mr. Ji Woon! Are you feeling better now?

210
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:12,080
Where's Ha Won?

211
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,334
She wasn't at the hospital with you?

212
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:37,589
I'm going to go and buy something before heading home.

213
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,820
Let's talk.

214
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:54,206
Let's just talk here.I have to go home soon.

215
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:55,924
I waited for you.

216
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,695
I woke up, but you suddenly disappeared.

217
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,565
I thought, "she'll come in the evening." Then, "She'll come tomorrow."

218
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:06,301
Then, "She'll probably come when I'm being discharged."

219
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:09,705
I missed you like crazy.

220
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,100
I told you already.

221
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,203
Getting you to the hospital was my mission.

222
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,921
My final mission.

223
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,116
That's all that there was to it?

224
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,929
Of course.

225
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,641
I felt like you were feeling really nervous because it was a huge surgery

226
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,577
so I just stayed with you until you went in. That's all there is to it.

227
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:34,021
Don't lie!

228
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:39,434
When you were with me, the look in your eyes, your smile, and your actions...

229
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:41,320
they were all genuine.

230
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:45,648
You couldn't have acted that way if you were going to break up with me.

231
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,360
♫  Like rain in my heart ♫

232
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,994
You still don't get it?

233
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:53,031
I'm doing whatever I can to try and get ahead.

234
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,416
I just stayed by your side for the money!

235
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,693
I told you, I didn't care about your reasons..

236
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,046
Just...

237
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,700
♫  you could almost reach me. ♫

238
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Stay by my side now.
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

239
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,761
It matters to me.

240
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,340
The Chairman told me that he'd pay me for my missions

241
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,243
as well as my college tuition, and send me to study abroad

242
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,937
if I just gave up on you!

243
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,215
So in the end this was just because of Grandfatheri?

244
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:19,691
No.

245
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,644
It was because of me.

246
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,696

No, you stop it!

258
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:01,984
You saved the Chairman and just managed to reconcile with him, but what?

259
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,620
I hate you acting this way!

260
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,198
You live in an amazing world that others can only dream of living in

261
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,909
but all you do is throw fits, and get angry!

00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:01,990
Why are you so pretty? You're making my heart skip a beat.

320
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,842
What's with you?

321
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,529
You still can't get in touch with Ha Won?

322
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,097
She said she never wants to see me again.

323
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,058
Eun Ha Won said that?

324
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:52,416
She took care of someone she never wanted to see again with such dedication?

325
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,926
I guess I made things too difficult for her.

326
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,198
At first, I thought it was because of Grandfather.

327
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:02,109
But I'm not so sure anymore.

328
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,713
I don't understand how she feels.

329
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,625
I'm not sure of anything.

330
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:14,463
I think I should let her go if she's having a hard time.

331
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,692
Well, of course. Since you like her.

332
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:24,973
I think that she's feeling the exact same way, though.

333
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:29,520
You know...

334
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:38,011
I never once considered the idea that Ji Woon might leave me, I guess.

335
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,994
I just thought it'd be enough for me to stay away from him.

336
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,291
That's why I tried to forget about him...

337
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,921
and ran away, like that.

338
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,711
She acted like she had to leave, for your sake.

339
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,186
Eun Ha Won likes you a lot.

340
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,498
She likes you as if you're the only person on this planet.

341
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:21,254
Make sure you don't let her get away, okay?

342
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:26,609
Thanks.

343
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,996
Since you stole my first love away from me...

344
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,215
you should be good to her.

345
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:46,471
What did you say to Ha Won?

346
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,641
Did you tell her to leave me, for my sake?

347
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,811
This is the best decision, for the sake of your future.

348
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,498
You did the same thing to Ha Won that you did to my mother, didn't you?

349
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,910
You told her that it's obvious how things would end up

350
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,345
and didn't want to put me through that.

351
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:04,297
Things would've been different back then

352
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:05,808
if only you hadn't been so against them!

353
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:09,453
Do you think that you two will have a different ending, then?

354
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,496
No.

355
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,540
I don't care if we end up the same way

356
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,160
or I have to suffer through the same things they did.

357
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,338
I want to be with Ha Won in the future, even if I end up hurt in the process!

358
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:22,382
Grandfather.

359
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,386
If I let Ha Won go like this, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

360
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:31,591
Just like you always regretted sending my dad off like that.

361
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:36,345
Do you want to feel the regret of losing me too?

362
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:38,941
If you've acknowledged me, acknowledge Ha Won, too!

363
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,360
That's a different matter altogether!

364
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,428
I'm begging you, Grandfather!

365
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:48,750
I can't breathe without her by my side.

366
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:53,096
Please, give us your blessing.

367
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,522
I want to be by Ji Woon's side.

368
00:33:05,952 --> 00:33:07,254
Please enjoy.

369
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:08,622
Thank you.

370
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,217
We came all the way here, just for you!

371
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:16,013
They say you're supposed to have tofu after you get out of jail, after all.

372
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:19,249
I couldn't take care of you well yesterday since I was all over the place.

373
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,227
I wasn't even in the detention center for that long!

374
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:25,614
That short amount of time was like hell for me, though!

375
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:30,260
I can't live without you, Honey.

376
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,099
All right, let's eat.

377
00:33:57,688 --> 00:34:00,890
Hey, I'm not going to have any of that.

378
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,835
Eat up.

379
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,335
Let's all eat together!

380
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:22,245
- Okay.
- Okay.

381
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,285
Chairman

382
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:41,874
Chairman

383
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,086
Yes, Chairman?

384
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:54,302
I'm glad to see you looking healthy.

385
00:34:55,596 --> 00:35:00,433
Everyone is worried about you because you left the house without a word.

386
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,345
Oh... I'm sorry.

387
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:06,673
You don't need to be sorry to me about anything.

388
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:09,718
I'm the one who told you to leave, after all.

389
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:14,707
How was your stay at Haneul House?

390
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:17,334
There wasn't anything that bothered you, was there?

391
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:19,143
No, there wasn't.

392
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:23,540
How did Hyeon Min seem to you, while you were living there?

393
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:27,485
Well... Hyeon Min...

394
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:32,508
he's the type of person who never seems to be serious about anything

395
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:37,387
but he's quite thoughtful and and innocent, in some ways.

396
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:42,117
And he also made me laugh a lot when I was busy thinking things over.

397
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:46,480
And he's not a playboy at all. He's actually a total romantic!

398
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,024
What about Seo Woo?

399
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:52,002
Well...

400
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:55,697
he's good to others and is kind.

401
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,200
That's why it feels so comfortable to be with him.

402
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,994
He's one of the most caring people I know.

403
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:07,434
He may seem like he's too carefree but he has his own philosophy about life

404
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:12,798
and he's a third-generation chaebol who knows that life isn't easy.

405
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,894
What about Ji Woon?

406
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:26,103
It's all up to you two now.

407
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:31,349
I'm giving you two my blessing.

408
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:39,766
Ji Woon seems to miss you a lot, Ms. Ha Won.

409
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:43,320
What you said was correct, Chairman.

410
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,708
When I really needed money...

411
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:52,004
I couldn't choose Ji Woon over money.

412
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,425
I'm the one who ran away from Ji Woon.

413
00:36:56,425 --> 00:37:01,980
This isn't anyone else's fault but my own, for choosing to do this.

414
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,271
But, I was happy while I was living at Haneul House.

415
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:13,292
I may not have to do missions anymore

416
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:16,211
but the guys are much better people now, right?

417
00:37:18,097 --> 00:37:24,903
It hasn't been quite three months yet, so there is still time left.

418
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:29,866
Feel free to come back anytime.

419
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:44,681
What?

420
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:50,011
You said that you really wanted to go back to busking!

421
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:53,740
Even if you want to go back to the way things were, your face won't allow it!

422
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,833
What are you saying?

423
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,711
People in the provinces will go crazy if they hear that you're there!

424
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:59,655
I have to protect my artist!

425
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:03,616
Hey, your bag looks a bit heavy.

426
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:06,236
So I got you a porter.

427
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:08,997
- A porter?
- Hey, Porter!

428
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:11,825
School Uniform!

429
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:17,289
Hello! I'm Hong Ja Yeong, who will be your manager starting today.

430
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:20,392
No, you're not his manager! You're in training!

431
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:23,328
I only gave you this job because you begged me for it

432
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:26,031
but I'll fire you if you don't do a proper job. Out. Got that?

433
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:29,034
Yes, sir! I'll work hard!

434
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,853
- I'll work hard!
- All right!

435
00:38:31,854 --> 00:38:34,247
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

436
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:46,393
This is your father's keepsake.

437
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,834
Your parents exchanged matching rings, and this one was your father's.

438
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:58,088
Give that to the woman you love, too.

439
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,307
Grandfather.

440
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:06,863
I split your mother and father apart, so I only have your father's.

441
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:10,100
Your mother should've had the same ring.

442
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,902
You've never seen it?

443
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:17,599
No. My mother never wore a ring--

444
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:28,293
This is a ring.It's my mother's keepsake.

445
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:34,332
I don't think it's a wedding ring, since my dad doesn't have one.

446
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:38,921
But I think it was really important to her.

447
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:44,301
Apparently, she had it clutched in her hand when she died.

448
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,871
That day was the anniversary of my mom's death.

449
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:54,895
Really? That day was my mom's, too.

450
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,290
♫  I like a day like this. ♫

451
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,190
♫  I just keep liking you ♫

452
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,460
♫  Turning one step away ♫

453
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:14,010
♫  Seeing you will be harder ♫

454
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:30,973
Hey, it's not like you committed a sin or anything.

455
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:35,269
You left your room empty-handed, and asked me to bring the rest of your things.

456
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:39,731
What, are you mad that I asked you to do me this one favor?

457
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:45,320
Looks like I'm just a nobody again, now that you're dating Hye Ji.

458
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,615
Are you regretting losing a catch like me?

459
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:52,202
You two really suit each other.

460
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,273
What about you two, then?

461
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:59,776
This is because of Kang Ji Woon, right?

462
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:04,339
You took care of him with such dedication, so why did you run away when he woke up?

463
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,029
Here.

464
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,625
What's this?

465
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:17,811
When you ran off during grandfather's wedding, you left this behind.

466
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:24,401
I found one and it turns out Yoon Seong had the other.

467
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,847
Who do you think you are, Cinderella? Leaving shoes behind like that?

468
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,644
These aren't mine.

469
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:35,746
It's just like you said. I'm not Cinderella.

470
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,056
And these don't suit me.

471
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:45,205
Yes, they do.

472
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,827
It's not like you wore these before because you wanted to.

473
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,895
I put them on you.

474
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:58,018
Well, it's an honor for you to have a cool guy like me put shoes on your feet!

475
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:06,768
When you want to, and when you go to the person you like...

476
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,878
wear these and go to him.

477
00:42:12,808 --> 00:42:15,527
I've suffered from some pain from love myself

478
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:19,114
And it's obvious to everyone no matter how much you try and hide it.

479
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:21,308
So don't hide, and just let your true feelings be known.

480
00:42:21,308 --> 00:42:23,393
Don't run away, either.

481
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,614
You like Kang Ji Woon, right?

482
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:31,051
Just think about your feelings for him. That's all you need to do.

483
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:37,774
Got that?

484
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:08,714
Hello.

485
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:12,100
You oversea the relations with the families of the victims, correct?

486
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:16,905
I'm Han Ji Woon, who used to live at Yeongak Apartments, in suite 307.

487
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:18,807
Yes.

488
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,811
Could I take a look at the registry of the deceased...

489
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:26,607
What?

490
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:29,659
Someone was looking for me?

491
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:51,750
♬  I was happy because of you  ♬

492
00:43:51,750 --> 00:44:00,040
♬ My heart hurts. Sorry.  ♬

493
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,101
Ha Won's mother died in that accident, too.

494
00:44:05,537 --> 00:44:06,939
My mother did, too.

495
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:10,925
So you lived in suite 307 back then?

496
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,819
Yes, that's right.

497
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:24,248
Can you check to see if this was your mother's?

498
00:44:26,016 --> 00:44:27,559
This is the necklace that Ha Won always wears, right?

499
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,046
She thought that it was her mother's and wore it.

500
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,815
But it turns out that her mother was trying

501
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:37,602
to save the woman living next door and ended up dying.

502
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:44,542
That woman gave that ring to my wife and asked her to give it to her son

503
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:50,715
but we thought that it was Ha Won's mother's, since she had it in her hand.

504
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:59,575
It would've been great if Ha Won's mother could've saved your mother...

505
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:04,604
but I guess it was their time to go.

506
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:08,968
But I wonder what the significance of that ring was

507
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:12,829
that she asked for it to be given to you, with her dying breath?

508
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:17,984
It was the ring that my father and she exchanged.

509
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:24,433
I think she was trying to help me find my family.

510
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:30,188
Looks like Ha Won's mother did one last good deed before dying, then.

511
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:36,528
That ring felt like it held Ha Won's mom's last wish

512
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:40,490
so I wanted to return it to its rightful owner, no matter what.

513
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,885
Thank you.

514
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:49,191
If you lost your mother in that fire...

515
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:52,836
you lost your mother right when Ha Won did.

516
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,589
I'm sure we used the same funeral home, too

517
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:59,918
so it seems like your connection with Ha Won runs quite deep.

518
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:01,953
The same... funeral home?

519
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:10,102
You don't remember? We both had it at the same hospital.

520
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,170
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

521

Make sure you give that back to me, okay?

543
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,830
♫  A jealous and petty spat ♫

544
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,380
♫  That's not a problem ♫

♫  Whether it's serious or not ♫

549
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,920

♫  I'll always love you. ♫

555
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:17,439
So don't hide, and just let your true feelings be known.

556
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:20,033
You like Kang Ji Woon, right?

557
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:23,887
Just think about your feelings for him. That's all you need to do.

558
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:32,286
When you want to, and when you go to the person you like...

559
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,539
wear these and go to him.

560
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:43,757
Yes, Dad?

561
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,135
I found the owner of the ring, and gave it back to them.

562
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,923
Oh. That's great.

563
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:54,651
But... do you know who it turned out to be?

564
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:57,863
What?

565
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,567
The Haneul Group grandson who came to see you last time.

566
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:07,022
It was... Ji Woon?

567
00:49:07,022 --> 00:49:08,390
Yeah.

568
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:13,560
Do you... like that boy?

569
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:19,680
♫  My heart hurts so much, ♫

570
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:26,170
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

571
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,590
♫  I am barely living. ♫

572
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,390
♫  Like rain in my heart ♫

573
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,570
♫  Tears fall endlessly. ♫

574
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,100
♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

575
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:47,971
I don't know if it was a good or bad twist of fate...

576
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:52,926
but your mother had that ring in her hand when she died.

577
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:55,954
And you kept that on you for ten years after that.

578
00:49:57,114 --> 00:50:00,701
And there's the fact that we held our funerals at the same place, too.

579
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:04,095
I don't think that was all just mere coincidence.

580
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,220
♫  I can't live without you ♫

581
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:17,500
♫  If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

582
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:20,003
I was quite late in returning this to you, wasn't I?

583
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:23,439
Thanks for coming to give it back to me.

584
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,630
♫ You've become someone who can't give back ♫

585
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,820
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

586
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,242
When you look at this ring now...

587
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:39,140
don't think about your mother, and think about me instead.

588
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,940
♫  do you hear my love? ♫

589
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:53,595
You too.

590
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,700
♬ Oh, hey! Yay! ♬

591
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,023
♬ Oh, hey! Yay! ♬

592
00:51:21,023 --> 00:51:24,959
♬ What kind of magic spell did you cast on me? ♬

593
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:31,240
♬  I've become an idiot, who only has eyes for you. ♬

594
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:42,968
♬  I, who'd forgotten how to smile, now laugh when I call your name. ♬

595
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:53,772
♬  I'll protect your smile because the reason why I live now. ♬

596
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,535
One more time!

597
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,079
Go!

598
00:52:03,865 --> 00:52:05,258
One more time!

599
00:52:05,258 --> 00:52:06,860
Attention! Bow!

600
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,253
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

601
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:21,608
You're really not coming back?

602
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:26,254
I don't have the right to go back.

603
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,068
I'm sorry that I couldn't trust you to the end.

604
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:36,448
I want to protect you as much as you wanted to protect Haneul Group.

605
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:41,277
Come on, let's go back, already! Grandfather is waiting for you.

606
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:50,462
This is a new insurance policy that just came out.

607
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:51,822
The payout is incredible, too!

608
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:53,907
Oh, it's all right. I'm sorry.

609
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:56,844
You'll really regret it if you don't buy this insurance plan!

610
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,782
I don't want to have any regrets!

611
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,130
♫  When you speak I, ♫

612
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,680
♫  I also unconsciously look at you and ♫

613
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,920
♫  When you smile brightly, I ♫

614
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:40,821
I made a huge mistake with my son because I thought I knew what was best

615
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:45,775
but I almost made the same mistake with my grandson this time around, too.

616
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:48,890
♫  When you are walking ♫

617
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:52,841
Ji Woon asked me if I was going to live with that regret for the rest of my life.

618
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,037
Ms. Ha Won understands too, so...

619
00:53:57,037 --> 00:54:03,101
she told me to go back and find you, and cheered for our love.

620
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,620
♫  It's okay if it takes a long time ♫

621
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,617
Why are you crying?

622
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:18,467
Because I'm sorry. And thankful.

623
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:32,147
Park Jeong Hyeon Rests Here.
We Will Never Forget You

624
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:52,551
You're doing well, right Jung Hyeon?

625
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:57,981
Park Jeing Hyun. It's been a while.

626
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:06,281
I've only been thinking about you for the past ten years since you died.

627
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:13,480
But I'm only going to think about Hye Ji now.

628
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:21,145
Understand where I'm coming from. Okay, Jeong Hyeon?

629
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,771
I'll love Hye Ji a lot on your behalf, too.

630
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:50,851
This spot hasn't changed at all.

631
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,437
It's so pretty.

632
00:55:55,506 --> 00:55:57,874
Aren't I amazing?

633
00:55:57,874 --> 00:55:59,067
Why?

634
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:01,628
I want to see you, even when you're right next to me.

635
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:03,830
And yet, I held back for ten whole years.

636
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,265
Who told you to do that?

637
00:56:06,265 --> 00:56:10,950
♫  Whisper which is heard by my closed mind ♫

638
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,623
Your eyes are pretty.

639
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:16,818
And so is your nose.

640
00:56:16,818 --> 00:56:18,290
♫  I recognized my fate ♫

641
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:19,760
And so is your cheek.

642
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,540
♫  at a glance. ♫

643
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,130
♫  My dream's Romeo ♫

644
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:27,029
My lips are pretty too, right?

645
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:31,110
♫  I felt the love I had been waiting for ♫

646
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,240
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

647
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,890
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

648
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,910
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

649
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,340
♫  Baby take me take me take me away ♫

650
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,510
♫  Come to me and take me away ♫

651
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:52,020
♫  Baby tell me tell me tell me tonight ♫

652
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,740
♫  The only one I've been waiting for ♫

653
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,024
What are you doing?

654
00:56:56,024 --> 00:56:58,610
Taking photos, since it's so pretty out today.

655
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:01,822
Wow, you're looking pretty today.

656
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:03,206
Really?

657
00:57:03,206 --> 00:57:05,108
Here, hand that over. Let me take a photo of you.

658
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:07,102
- Of me?
- Yeah!

659
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:08,828
Go stand over there.

660
00:57:08,828 --> 00:57:09,747
It's a little embarrassing though.

661
00:57:09,747 --> 00:57:11,398
Come on, hurry up!

662
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:13,459
♫  Stay with me forever. ♫

663
00:57:13,459 --> 00:57:18,863
All right. One, two...

664
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,398
Wait.

665
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:21,567
What?

666
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:26,496
Hey. Where's your ring?

667
00:57:26,496 --> 00:57:28,273
What are you talking about?

668
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,293
This ring, right here. Where is it?

669
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:35,447
Oh, I took it off for a bit while I was helping Ms. Beolgyo.

670
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:37,132
Ta-da!

671
00:57:37,132 --> 00:57:40,110
You took it off? For just a bit?

672
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:42,345
Hey, do you know what kind of ring this is?

673
00:57:42,345 --> 00:57:45,074
I didn't take it off for a month, even when I was showering!

674
00:57:45,074 --> 00:57:47,192
And yet, you took it off "just for a bit?"

675
00:57:47,192 --> 00:57:50,328
All right, already! I'll never take it off again!

676
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:54,241
Forget it. Do whatever you want with it.

677
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:57,436
I'll take it off, and hide it, and throw it somewhere!

678
00:57:57,436 --> 00:58:01,881
Also, no physical contact for you, for an entire month!

679
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:03,617
Don't get close to me.

680
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,144
Hey, are you grumpy again, Kang Ji Woon?

681
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:09,539
Wow, how is it that every little thing sets you off?

682
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:12,893
It feels like I'm dating a child!

683
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:16,563
Also... no touching?

684
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:20,458
Oh, let's just see who suffers more from that.

685
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,246
Oh, all right.

686
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:27,499
Hey, what are you doing? I thought you said no touching!

687
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:28,692
Get off!

688
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:34,588
It's just that this ring linked us together for such a long time.

689
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:37,626
I just want you to treat it as the precious thing that it is.

690
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:39,311
I know that too, you know!

691
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:42,781
- Give me the ring.
- Why?

692
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:44,090
Just give it to me.

693
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,650
♫  I who had forgotten how to laugh ♫

694
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:53,050
♫  laugh at just pronouncing your name ♫

695
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:56,094
I love you, Eun Ha Won.

696
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,597
♫  You who are adorned with a white star ♫

697
00:58:58,597 --> 00:59:02,968
Well... I love you too, I guess.

698
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:07,522
You still like dating me, despite me being childish, right?

699
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:10,867
Oh, stop it, Mr. Grumpypants! Ugh!

700
00:59:12,235 --> 00:59:15,013
You're so stubborn! Come on!

701
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:17,474
- What do you want?
- Don't be mad!

702
00:59:18,116 --> 00:59:19,918
- Whatever!
- I'll do better.

703
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:21,645
I thought touching was forbidden! Let go!

704
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,722
Come on, don't be like that!

705
00:59:23,722 --> 00:59:28,600
♫  Your breath brushes me like a touch and ♫

706
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,600
♫  You are the one star which fell on my heart ♫

707
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:40,090
♫  Like fate I'm falling for you ♫

708
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,580
♫  Love love love is you ♫

709
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,104
- You're here?
- Yeah.

710
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:52,970
♫  Every footstep you walk in my heart ♫

711
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:55,550
♫  will become my everything. ♫

712
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:57,431
Kang Seo Woo!

713
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,334
♫  This love you brought will take care of my spring ♫

714
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,919
You should've made a clean break when you ate it!

715
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:06,880
♫  All I need is you ♫

716
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,060
♫  Don't leave  ♫
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

717
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,461
- Thank you!
- No. Here, say "ah!"

718
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,030
♫  not knowing what I feel  ♫

719
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:17,040
♫  I love you ♫

720
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:22,750
♫  You who shines on my dark heart  ♫

721
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,680
♫  will protect my star ♫

722
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:34,180
♫  Because your smile has become my reason for living. ♫

723
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,690
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

724
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,090
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

725
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:42,500
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

726
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,980
Hyeon Min, say "ah".

727
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,130
You have to take a bite of it.

728
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,030
- I already ate it.
- No, you didn't.
