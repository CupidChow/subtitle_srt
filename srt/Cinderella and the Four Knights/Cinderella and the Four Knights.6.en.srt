1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,340
Cinderella and Four Knights

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,050
Jung Il Woo

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,390
Ahn Jae Hyeon

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,730
Park So Dam

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,680
Lee Jung Shin

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,120
Choi Min

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,580
Son Na Eun

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,140
Cinderella and Four Knights

9
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:12,416
The guys... will come, right?

10
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:37,884
Oh, Hi!

11
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:40,261
You're here, ma'am?

12
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,406
Gosh, you're so uptight! You're no fun!

13
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,942
This secretary is always the same.

14
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,453
- Please head inside.
- Sure.

15
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,441
And who are you?

16
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:59,121
Oh, hello. My name is Eun Ha Won.

17
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:02,784
Oh, so it's you! Hyeon Min's fiancee!

18
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:04,035
I see.

19
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:07,488
But, what about my Seo Woo?

20
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:25,600
♬ If I follow the star in the night sky,  ♬

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,070
♬ May I go there too? ♬

22
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:40,647
♬  No matter how desperately I want an answer  ♬

23
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:46,061
♬ the stars have no answer for me. ♬

24
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:48,847
Since it's not my place, I won't tell you to make amends with your mom

25
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:53,009
and go observe the anniversary of your father's death.

26
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:55,786
But I will say this one thing.

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,008
Your father must be so lonely.

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,196
♬  it was our last time♬

29
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:08,915
You do want to see him, don't you?

30
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:13,855
He was the man your mom loved, after all.

31
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:17,325
Your dad, I mean.

32
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,654
Go and visit your father.

33
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:28,980
♬ Someday if I see you again,♬

34
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,550
♬I'll tell you all of my stories♬

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:42,617
♬Until I reach the place with the stars.♬

36
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:47,739
You want to sing this song for your dad, right?

37
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,540
♬Wait for me♬

38
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,493
If you want to see him, go tell him that in person.

39
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:58,049
♬Please take care of me.♬

40
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,133
That was good,

41
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,685
but why are you acting like that after you wrote these amazing lyrics?

42
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,890
If I Ever See You Again;
Sub-title: Father

43
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:27,929
All right. Control your emotions and try it again.

44
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:32,350
You want to sing this song for your dad, right?

45
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,736
If you want to see him, go tell him that in person.

46
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,334
Hey, where are you going?

47
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:47,064
To go see someone that I miss.

48
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:13,433
Oh, sister-in-law!

49
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,720
Wow, how did you age so much in just a year?

50
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,431
Look at all these wrinkles around your eyes!

51
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:22,175
And it looks like you became even more of a chatterbox since last year.

52
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:24,869
Looks like you and Hyeon Min are the same as ever.

53
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,826
Mom! Don't go!

54
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,010
You stay here to protect your place.

55
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:50,512
Mom! Don't go!

56
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:57,427
Mom! Mom!

57
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,521
Mom!

58
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:04,700
Mom! Don't go! Mom!

59
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,150
Mom!

60
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,865
Mom...

61
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,620
Don't go, Mom. Mom...

62
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,630
Mom...

63
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:02,199
So annoying. You still haven't left yet, sir?

64
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,007
I apologize.

65
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:13,537
Geez, he has no heart.

66
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,973
He knows nothing about Ms. Ha Won's situation.

67
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:20,810
It's no use, no matter what she does.

68
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,856
What do you mean by that?

69
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,836
Goodness, we'll put the finishing touches on all this

70
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:31,221
so go and get some rest.

71
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:34,324
But it'll be helpful to have another pair of hands!

72
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:38,277
Did you cook back at home?

73
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,080
When my mother was alive

74
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:44,634
I would watch her prepare for my grandparents' memorial services.

75
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,169
Really?

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,373
She died when I was ten years old, so I'm okay now.

77
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:55,662
You could be of some use.

78
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,431
I mean that you're doing well.

79
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,593
Your mother really taught you well.

80
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,728
Look at how pretty your jeon ( vegetable fritters) are turning out.

81
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,088
I'm sure that your mother is so proud of you

82
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:07,732
every time you observe the anniversary of her death.

83
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:11,703
I've never been able to observe the anniversary of her death.

84
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,154
Why not?

85
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,224
Because my stepmother doesn't like it.

86
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:17,501
Oh.

87
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,544
It's fine.

88
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:23,331
I just go to visit her on the anniversary of her death.

89
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,810
You sure grew up to be a fine child.

90
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:34,192
Yeah. Compared to you, our boys grew up terribly!

91
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,802
No, compared to you, they're complete children!

92
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,854
I know, right?

93
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,023
They even have people who are preparing food

94
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,533
for the anniversary of their fathers' deaths

95
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,911
so that they can observe the day worry-free.

96
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,530
They don't know how lucky they are.

97
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,057
They're far too privileged.

98
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:50,566
Oh, well.

99
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:55,513
But still, I'm sure all three of them will go this time.

100
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:59,075
I'm sure they'll understand how you feel.

101
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,248
I'm not doing this hoping they'll acknowledge my efforts.

102
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:07,625
Really? Then, why are you working so hard?

103
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:12,046
Because all this reminds me of my mother.

104
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:18,603
I'm sure that my mother waits for the days that I come to visit her.

105
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:23,241
And I feel like the Kang cousins' fathers are waiting for them, too.

106
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:27,295
Jeez. But those boys are adamant about not going!

107
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:33,109
That's why I want to make them some delicious food at least.

108
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:38,114
Since it's not my place, I won't tell you to make amends with your mom

109
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:42,235
or go observe the anniversary of your father's passing.

110
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:44,120
But I will say this one thing.

111
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,941
Your father must be so lonely.

112
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:54,931
I'm sure that my mother waits for the days that I come to visit her.

113
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:58,509
And I feel like the Kang cousins' fathers are waiting for them, too.

114
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,989
It's almost time now.

115
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:27,297
I guess they really aren't coming.

116
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,480
I think it's too soon for you to be completely disappointed.

117
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,970
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

118
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,240
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

119
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,730
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

120
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:52,522
Hey, Ms. Celebrity!

121
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,468
♫  You've become an idiot savant ♫

122
00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:59,936
I'm not late, right?

123
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,315
♫  I who had forgotten how to laugh ♫

124
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:03,575
Wait, am I the only one who came?

125
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:10,500
♫  laugh at just pronouncing your name ♫

126
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,140
♫  You who are adorned with a white star ♫

127
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,010
♫  Your breath brushes me like a touch and ♫

128
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,830
♫  You are the one star which fell on my heart ♫

129
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:33,121
♫  Like fate I'm falling for you ♫

130
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,514
Were you waiting for me?

131
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:35,670
Of course!

132
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,330
♫  Love love love is you ♫

133
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,027
I'm not talking about me.

134
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:43,957
I'm sure your father has been waiting.

135
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,510
♫  will become my everything. ♫

136
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:59,290
♫  This love you brought will take care of my spring ♫

137
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,960
♫  Because your smile has become the reason I live. ♫

138
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:12,835
I don't think Ji Woon will be coming.

139
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,424
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:56,562
I failed this mission.

141
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,251
Having Ji Woon come would've been close to a miracle.

142
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:26,084
I thought a miracle would be possible f I just got through to him.

143
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:31,389
I guess I got too cocky after getting them to share a meal together.

144
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:37,537
You were still half-successful just by getting Seo Woo and Hyeon Min to come.

145
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:40,732
Yes, but it wasn't a complete success.

146
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,651
Looks like I failed my mission.

147
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,714
Um, I'll be going now.

148
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:51,634
It's a family gathering, so I don't think it's my place to take part in this.

149
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:54,454
I'll go on ahead.

150
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,834
You're here, Father?

151
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:11,804
Let's begin. My children must be hungry.

152
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:00,854
I'm sure that they're all happy to have seen their sons this year.

153
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,440
Yes.

154
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,534
There is, however, someone who probably feels lonely.

155
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:09,704
Why would he be?

156
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:13,333
His son even left him a rose as a gift.

157
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,518
What?

158
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:46,107
You don't look well. Shall we go, Chairman?

159
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:49,911
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

160
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:56,651
You two really look good together.

161
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,155
Really?

162
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,824
One needs to have as much refinement as you, Madam,

163
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:06,253
to shine when standing next to the Chairman.

164
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:10,331
It feels quite awkward to have a family member call me "Madam."

165
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:15,995
It'd be selfish of you to want us to treat you like our mother-in-law.

166
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,482
Is that right?

167
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:24,696
Then, I wonder what kind of selfishness

168
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,130
prompted you to never contact us once

169
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,441
and then suddenly make an appearance just for this occasion?

170
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:31,778
Did you want to make a much overdue attempt at reconnecting with your son?

171
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,680
What do you mean?

172
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,734
It's only natural that I take part in this occasion

173
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,137
as the mother of the heir of Haneul Group.

174
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:42,747
Heir?

175
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:48,202
My son is the only one who was born and raised in Haneul House.

176
00:16:51,731 --> 00:17:01,533
The only one who can lead Haneul Group in the future is my Hyeon Min.

177
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:04,035
Nothing has been decided yet.

178
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:06,713
It's only right that we should follow the natural order of things.

179
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:12,177
My husband was the heir to Haneul Group before he died,

180
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:18,082
so it's only natural that his son, Hyeon Min, would be next in line. Isn't that so?

181
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:20,902
That was before, and this is now.

182
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:27,442
Even so, the fact that Seo Woo's father was an illegitimate child won't change.

183
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:30,812
Are you saying that for me to hear?

184
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:36,676
That wasn't my intention.

185
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:38,862
Think about it.

186
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:42,824
Don't you think that my own children would take after me?

187
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,318
If you keep talking about heirs and whatnot,

188
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:49,414
regarding kids who are so under-qualified for the position

189
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:57,516
I'll be sure to search the entire planet for any children that your husbands may have fathered.

190
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:34,317
Ji Woon's father must have been disappointed.

191
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:44,244
Ji Woon's mother and father are probably happy in heaven right now.

192
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:48,890
Let's not talk about Ji Woon's mother.

193
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:55,162
Thanks to her, Ji Woon was forced to fend for himself for so many years.

194
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:12,213
But you know, it would've been nice if Ji Woon had come, too.

195
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:15,366
Um, Chairman.

196
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,194
I've been told that Ji Woon came here today.

197

I didn't see Kang Ji Woon today. Did he finally realize where he belongs?

235
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:30,720
He's not trying to take your place as successor or anything, right?

236
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:32,864
The position of the successor.

237
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,666
Why is that the only thing you ever talk about when you see me?

238
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,785
Is that all you know how to talk about?

239
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:39,587
Well, that's...

240
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:47,203
You should've taken that exit to get to the hotel.

241
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:48,705
I'm not going to your hotel.

242
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:49,731
Where then?

243
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,299
I'm going to the airport.

244
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,000
- Hyeon Min!
Don't ever return to Korea.

245
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:08,241
Is this really the place?

246
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:12,837
What in the world! Is this a palace or a castle?

247
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:15,666
Mom, those are exactly the same thing.

248
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:19,744
I know. And it's "castle" in English!

249
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:23,082
But does Eun Ha Won really live in this place?

250
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:27,118
I told you so! I saw it with my very own eyes!

251
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:30,288
She was riding next to Kang Hyeon Min in his sports car, and she got clothes!

252
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:32,690
I'm telling you, it's crazy!

253
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,500
It's not like only Eun Ha Won can be allowed to live in a place like this.

254
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:38,838
I'm her mom.

255
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:40,681
Her stepmom. Stepmom!

256
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:04,431
You're Ms. Eun Ha Won's family?

257
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:06,224
Yes. I'm her mother.

258
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:07,917
And I'm her older sister.

259
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:15,141
I'm just so worried about how Ha Won is doing, I can barely function!

260
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:21,689
Ever since Ha Won came to live here, I haven't been able to sleep well!

261
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:24,575
Ms. Ha Won is doing just fine.

262
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:30,373
But still, this is where my younger sister lives, so can I look around?

263
00:24:44,804 --> 00:24:48,207
Stop making such a big deal! It's so embarrassing!

264
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,028
This here...

265
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:55,974
I mean, this is Ms. Eun Ha Won's room.

266
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:57,284
- Oh.
- Oh.

267
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:00,920
The side dishes for dinner have been delivered,

268
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,548
but you'll have to come check and make sure that nothing is missing.

269
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:08,186
Then, please take a look around as much as you wish.

270
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,298
Yes, we will.

271
00:25:23,843 --> 00:25:26,120
- What?
- Where are you going?

272
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,348
Who cares about Eun Ha Won's room?

273
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:30,508
I want to look at your future son-in-law's room!

274
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:33,753
Are you sure it's that one?

275
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:36,807
Geez, what do you take me for?

276
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:38,300
Look.

277
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,721
I have Kang Hyeon Min in the palm of my hand.

278
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:55,425
Wow, this is insane!

279
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,197
Huh?

280
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:19,874
Isn't this Eun Ha Won's?

281
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:21,009
[Eun Ha Won - Jungsan Girls' High]

282
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:22,160
Why is this in here?

283
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:26,531
Wait a second.

284
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:30,193
You're trying to worm into his room and win him over, Eun Ha Won?

285
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:55,944
Hey, Yoo Na. Yoo Na!

286
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,880
Yoo Na!

287
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:01,616
Oh my.

288
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:07,247
Um... you're... that General Secretary of Haneul Group, from last time!

289
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:09,841
What brings you here?

290
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:14,713
Tomorrow is Ha Won's graduation.

291
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:17,340
So I was curious as to how she was doing so I came by.

292
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:27,225
Oh, why did you go into the wrong room to look for Ha Won, sweetie?

293
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,703
Does Ms. Ha Won know that you two are here?

294
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,271
What does that matter?

295
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:33,081
Does that matter? I'm just a mother here to see my daughter!

296
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:37,460
I'd like it if you refrained from dropping in without any notice.

297
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,113
Wow, you sure are uptight.

298
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:44,226
I was just worried that she may be being mistreated here, so I came.

299
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:45,652
Is there anything wrong with that?

300
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:49,697
Don't worry. I'm treating her as our valued guest.

301
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,809
And we're that valued guest's mother and sister, all right?

302
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,946
I'm sorry, but our only guest is Ms. Ha Won.

303
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:00,325
I'll show you the way out.

304
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,614
- Hey!
- Hey!

305
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:21,395
How the hell did she train these people so that they're treating us this way?

306
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,549
Goodness.

307
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,477
Here's the truth behind Eun Ha Won, Senior at Jungsan Girls' High.

308
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:40,031
She ran away from home to try to change her wretched life

309
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:43,626
and now she's living at Haneul House, with the Kang cousins.

310
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,514
Eun Ha Won, you're dead now.

311
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,900
Submit Post

312
00:28:54,304 --> 00:28:59,542
In case you think I'm lying, I've attached photos.

313
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,720
I can't tell you where I got them, though.

314
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:02,913
Is she with one of them? Which one?
What the hell?

315
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:04,197
Oh my god!
She must be crazy!

316
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:25,627
You can't!

317
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:29,155
Why are you trying to sleep at my place, when you live in a mansion?

318
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:32,425
You have to go to the graduation tomorrow anyway,

319
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:37,255
so how about we greet the day together, and go to school together tomorrow?

320
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:40,458
My house is cramped enough as it is.

321
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:43,369
If you come over, tomorrow morning will be hell.

322
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:45,179
Hell.

323
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,215
Come on, Ja Yeong!

324
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:49,567
I told you, you can't!

325
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,071
I'll clean this entire place up for you!

326
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:55,640
- I told you, you can't!
- Why not?

327
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,283
Listen to me!

328
00:29:58,243 --> 00:30:01,021
- Welcome—
- Welcome!

329
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,722
What, do you know her?

330
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:18,296
Oh, what a relief!

331
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:22,758
I didn't know that Ha Won had a friend like you!

332
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:23,418
What do you mean—

333
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:26,312
Can I leave Ha Won in your care for just one night?

334
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,100
If Eun Ha Won snores or talks in her sleep, call me. I will scold her.

335
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,411
Hey!

336
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:35,305
Thanks a lot!

337
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,123
Hey, what are you doing?

338
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:54,349
Let's go together.

339
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,059
Wow, your house is amazing!

340
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,770
This is nothing compared to Haneul House.

341
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:19,757
No, this place is really amazing!

342
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,235
My room is over there.

343
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:41,604
Wow, your room is so pretty, just like you!

344
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,800
Huh?

345
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,500
Isn't this you and Kang Hyeon Min?

346
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,922
Yup.

347
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,000
- It's me and Kang Hyeon Min.
- Oh.

348
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:07,305
But who's that next to you? He looks a lot like you.

349
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,100
My older brother.

350
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:15,280
But... he died a long time ago.

351
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,486
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't even know, and...

352
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,432
It's fine. It happened a long time ago, anyway.

353
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:32,221
But, Kang Hyeon Min seems really different here.

354
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:35,350
He doesn't look like the troublemaker he is now.

355
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,088
You're right. Hyeon Min, as he is now

356
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,048
is not really who he truly is.

357
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:48,346
Um, but... why did you leave Haneul House?

358
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:50,657
What about Hyeon Min?

359
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:56,437
Um, about that. To tell you the truth...

360
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:59,549
I'm not Kang Hyeon Min's fiancee.

361
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:05,104
Kang Hyeon Min asked me to pretend to be his fiancee, so I did it as a job.

362
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:10,360
And he asked me not to tell anyone I was a fake fiancee, no matter what.

363
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:15,281
Then, about you living at Haneul House...

364
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:18,109
It's because of a job I took on from the Chairman.

365
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:21,229
But that's all over now, too.

366
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:24,632
Wow, what a load off my chest!

367
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:27,519
Sorry. This is a lot to take in, right?

368
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:31,690
So, you're not in any kind of relationship with Hyeon Min?

369
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,425
Of course not!

370
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,528
Hye Ji.

371
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:40,748
Honestly, I thought that you two looked so great together, from the start.

372
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:43,442
So there's no need to worry about me!

373
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:46,621
Honestly, it's not like I'd look good by his side, anyway.

374
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:54,696
Do you want to go and wash up first?

375
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:57,157
Oh, can I?

376
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:07,809
Good job, Eun Ha Won.

377
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:11,287
Yeah, there's no need to lie to Hye Ji, too.

378
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:15,700
The truth was bound to come out anyway!

379
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:28,788
Hye Ji.

380
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,241
Are you sleeping?

381
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,730
No.

382
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:36,721
I could have just slept on the floor.

383
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:42,043
Thanks.

384
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:43,611
If it hadn't been for you

385
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:46,848
I would've slept in front of my school on the day before graduation!

386
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:53,596
Then, you'll be seeing your family tomorrow?

387
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:55,031
I don't know.

388
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:58,093
Maybe none of my family members will show up.

389
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:00,971
Don't worry about it.

390
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:03,973
All I have to do is to get my diploma.

391
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:11,038
I'll go to see you.

392
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,485
- Really?
- Yeah.

393
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:20,506
Thanks, Hye Ji!

394
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:24,310
Thanks so much! Good night!

395
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,532
Are you asleep, Ms. Ha Won?

396
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:42,929
Get a lot of rest. I'll see you tomorrow.

397
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,183
I heard that you came to the temple.

398
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:49,844
Good.

399
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:52,439
It was because of Ms. Ha Won, right?

400
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:55,325
No!

401
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:58,328
She was deeply hurt because she thought you didn't come.

402
00:35:58,328 --> 00:36:00,079
Go and comfort her a bit, okay?

403
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,489
Apparently, her graduation is tomorrow.

404
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:06,511
Drop by to congratulate her, if you have time.

405
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:31,536
Wait, what is it to me whether or not she's graduating?

406
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:10,575
Dad. Tomorrow's my graduation. Can you make it?

407
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,592
Dad. Tomorrow's my graduation. Can you make it?

408
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:31,538
Eun Ha Won!

409
00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:44,909
Where did she go so early in the morning?

410
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:52,334
Graduation

411
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:58,798
My school uniform. My graduation is next week!

412
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:10,035
What the... where did it go?

413
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:12,204
Oh.

414
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:21,338
What the hell happened to this?

415
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:29,304
Oh man, this is bad.

416
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,603
Buy some flowers here!

417
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:40,056
Ten-thousand won for one! 10,000 won for one!

418
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,816
Oh, hello! Buy some flowers!

419
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,550
- What's wrong with her?
- It's so embarrassing.

420
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Isn't it great? And it's really cheap, too.

421
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:52,026
- Wow!
- Really?

422
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:54,321
- It's so cheap!
- I have to buy one!

423
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:56,606
- You have to keep in touch, okay?
- You too!

424
00:38:56,606 --> 00:38:59,242
Keep in touch! Promise?

425
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,850
All right, I promise.

426
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:05,831
Wow, look at her, ignoring all of us.

427
00:39:07,317 --> 00:39:08,418
I know, right?

428
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:09,410
She thinks she's pretty for some reason.

429
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,721
The graduation ceremony will soon start in the auditorium. Please make your way there.

430
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,181
- Oh, let's go.
- Let's go.

431
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:32,333
Eun Ha Won!

432
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,119
Did you get a good night's rest in that unfamiliar house?

433
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,188
Why are you so late?

434
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,300
Well, obviously ... I overslept.

435
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,729
But where is everyone else going?

436
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:48,950
- Oh, to the auditorium.
- And why didn't you go?

437
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,700
Were you, by any chance waiting for me?

438
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,700
Of course, I was!

439
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,979
Wow, our Ha Won is so loyal! So loyal!

440
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Let's go. Come on.

441
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:06,818
Hey, come on, Ha Won! Let's move, already!

442
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:11,715
Excuse me!

443
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:13,858
Can you hurry and find me a uniform that looks just like this one?

444
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:15,318
Yes, sir.

445
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:21,082
To Eun Ha Won: Where are you?

446
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:25,170
Calling: Eun Ha Won

447
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:31,418
The party you are trying to reach is unavailable. Connecting to voicemail...

448
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:33,169
Where are you?

449
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:36,239
It's the day of your graduation, so you should be wearing your school uniform!

450
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,226
Wait for me. I'll bring it to you now.

451
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:40,952
Here you are.

452
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,747
This school's uniforms sure are pretty!

453
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:46,649
Really? You're quite pretty, too.

454
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:50,095
Oh my... thank you.

455
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,207
Let's Play,
My Girlfriend's Schoolmates!

456
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:15,445
Welcome.

457
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,096
Can I get a bouquet of flowers, please?

458
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:19,082
Oh, are you going to a friend's graduation?

459
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:21,709
You can choose among these.

460
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:23,311
Um... all right.

461
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:26,589
I'm not Kang Hyeon Min's fiancee!

462
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:30,176
Kang Hyeon Min asked me to pretend to be his fiancee, so I did it as a part-time job.

463
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:34,297
So... you're not in any kind of relationship with Hyeon Min?

464
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:36,658
Of course not!

465
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:41,346
Please pick out a pretty one for me.

466
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:42,497
Okay.

467
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:56,887
I don't think I deserve to be here anymore. Thank you for everything.

468
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,597
What on earth is this nonsense?

469
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:00,799
This child!

470
00:42:05,678 --> 00:42:07,497
- Yes, this is Lee Yoon Seong.
 - Oh my!

471
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:10,834
- Ms. Ha Won is gone!
- What?

472
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:14,587
It seems she left believing that she failed her mission.

473
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:17,390
Ask around and find out where she is, right away.

474
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,802
Is there any place where you think she may be?

475
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:24,606
Yes, actually. Today is the day of Ms. Eun Ha Won's graduation.

476
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:28,935
We truly hope that you have happy lives.

477
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:32,514
Here's the truth behind Eun Ha Won, br>Senior at Jungsan Girls' High.

478
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:35,499
She ran away from home to change her pathetic life

479
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:39,036
and now she's living at Haneul House, with the Kang cousins.

480
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:43,633
I thought she went there as a maid, but that's actually not the case.

481
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:46,277
Has she curried the favor of the recently married Kang Jung Du?

482
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:48,496
Is she getting some sort of special treatment?

483
00:42:48,496 --> 00:42:51,274
What? How did Eun Ha Won get to live at Haneul House?

484
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:53,042
Did she snag one of the potential heirs?

485
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:55,145
As if. Why would any of the Kang cousins give her a second look?

486
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:57,730
Though Chairman Kang might.

487
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,926
Then did Eun Ha Won enter Haneul House as Chairman Kang's sixth mistress?

488
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,101
Ja Young!

489
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:12,020
- Oh!
- Oh, hello!

490
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,730
- Let's go take photos.
- See you later!

491
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,273
Okay!

492
00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:29,521
To: Dad

493
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:36,027
I wonder if Dad is really busy.

494
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:52,260
What's with that outfit?

495
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,213
You were acting all high and mighty about living at some rich person's place

496
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:56,640
and totally ignored us.

497
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,050
Oh, I left that place.

498
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,327
What are you going to do, then?

499
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:03,596
What?

500
00:44:03,596 --> 00:44:05,590
You have nowhere to go.

501
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:11,813
Don't even think about coming back to our place.

502
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,319
Ah, Yoo Na!

503
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,413
- Oh, you're here?
- Yeah!

504
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:33,460
The first concept for my new album is a schoolboy look!

505
00:44:34,419 --> 00:44:35,353
Honey!

506
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:37,956
Who is that crazy bitch from Jungsan Girls' High who lives at your house?

507
00:44:37,956 --> 00:44:39,808
Jungsan Girls' High is in an uproar right now!

508
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:40,875
The day of reckoning.

509
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,760
That girl who lives at Haneul House is going to die today!

510
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,462
I should go, too!

511
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:45,880
Jungsan Girls' High's graduation ceremony.

512
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,133
I'm ready for some bloodshed! Let's go, go, go!

513
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,719
Hyung! Hyung!

514
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,355
Yeah? What? What? What?

515
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,290
What?

516
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,833
Cancel my appointments for today.

517
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,319
- What?
- Don't look for me.

518
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,600
Hey, your appointments for today— Hey!

519
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:11,064
Eun Ha Won. Someone's looking for you.

520
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:14,225
- Looking for me?
- Yeah.

521
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,022
- Buy some flowers!
- Buy some flowers!

522
00:45:36,022 --> 00:45:37,491
I'll give them to you for cheap!

523
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:39,442
I'm not here for the graduation.

524
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:52,388
They're catching Eun Ha Won now!

525
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,242
It's Kang Hyeon Min!

526
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:27,157
Oh, damn this popularity of mine.

527
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:29,901
Testing, one, two.

528
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,308
Hello, students of Jungsan Girls' High! Schoolmates of my girlfriend, Eun Ha Won!

529
00:46:36,308 --> 00:46:38,685
Hurry over, and have as much as you'd like.

530
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:41,487
Today, I, Kang Hyeon Min, will pay for it all!

531
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:48,645
Oh, also, Eun Ha Won! Where are you?

532
00:46:48,645 --> 00:46:49,854
Eun Ha Won!

533
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,907
Someone took Eun Ha Won from the auditorium earlier.

534
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:03,135
- Let go!
- Sit down, damn it!

535
00:47:03,135 --> 00:47:04,611
- Why are you doing this?
- Hey!

536
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:05,779
Let go!

537
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:15,372
Hey, this room is totally soundproof, so no one will hear your screams.

538
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:17,599
Why are you doing this?

539
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,109
"I wonder why they're acting like this?"

540
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:23,004
Do you think you deserve to hang out with the Kang cousins? Huh?

541
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,902
No, I heard that she was Chairman Kang's mistress.

542
00:47:28,902 --> 00:47:31,004
Yeah, yeah! Eun Ha Won!

543
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:33,139
Even if you wanted to go to Haneul House that badly,

544
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:35,659
going for a guy that old is too much, don't you think?

545
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,627
Are you out of your damn mind?

546
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:41,665
I'm guessing there are weird rumors circulating, but that's not true.

547
00:47:41,731 --> 00:47:45,852
Hey, girls. The Chairman's mistress says this isn't true!

548
00:47:45,852 --> 00:47:48,104
Oh, for real?

549
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:50,323
Take back what you said, right now.

550
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:52,358
What?

551
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:54,144
Take it back.

552
00:47:54,144 --> 00:47:55,779
Is this girl out of her damn mind?

553
00:47:57,597 --> 00:48:03,420
- Oh my gosh!
- What's he doing here?

554
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:06,423
Eun Ha Won!

555
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:09,642
Congratulations on your graduation.

556
00:48:34,843 --> 00:48:36,578
- Sit still.
- What are you doing?

557
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:42,425
What are you doing?

558
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:47,614
What are you doing right now?

559
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:50,016
You told me to take back my words.

560
00:48:50,016 --> 00:48:54,462
I'm going to see for myself whether you're telling the truth or not.

561
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:56,022
What?

562
00:48:56,022 --> 00:48:59,667
I'm going to see for myself just how pure you really are.

563
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:03,980
- Let's get started, girls.
- Okay.

564
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:05,581
What are you doing?

565
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,658
- Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!
- Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!

566
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:25,635
- Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!
- Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!

567
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:26,778
Hey.

568
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,100
Is Eun Ha Won here?

569
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,885
Who the hell are you to be looking for her?

570
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,237
So this is the place, then.

571
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:38,248
What the hell is this idiot saying?

572
00:49:51,144 --> 00:49:53,154
Stop it!

573
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:57,242
Hey, should we record this on that camera, too?

574
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:58,660
Okay.

575
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,154
Stop it.

576
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:04,249
Stop it!

577
00:50:13,525 --> 00:50:15,343
Oh, were you in the middle of something?

578
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:24,369
Hey, the guys are knocked out. Hurry up and run!

579
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:26,421
- Damn it!
- Damn it!

580
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,210
♫  You are messing with my head, ♫

581
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,390
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

582
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:38,800
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else? ♫

583
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,590
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

584
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,680
♫  I am wanting you so badly but ♫

585
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,220
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

586
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,880
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

587
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,970
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

588
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:03,930
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

589
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,100
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

590
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,230
♫  As much as my tears which I secretly wipe away ♫

591
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:16,090
♫  Won't you come to feel like me? ♫

592
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:22,761
♫  My one and only you ♫

593
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,896
Hey, hey!

594
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:27,265
Where the hell are you going?

595
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:44,090
Are you using your fists again?

596
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:48,086
Who the hell is he?

597
00:51:54,225 --> 00:51:57,971
Geez, you're not savvy whatsoever, are you?

598
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:01,707
Hey, you punks.

599
00:52:01,707 --> 00:52:04,744
I'll give you this, so go away.

600
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,950
I don't care if you ride it around, or sell it. Do whatever you want.

601
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:24,973
Damn it.

602
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:27,842
Thanks, man.

603
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:46,954
- Oh my gosh, it's Kang Seo Woo
- Kang Seo Woo!

604
00:52:46,954 --> 00:52:50,032
- Honey!
- Yes, it's me!

605
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:56,188
Yes, yes, it's me. Yes, I'm Kang Seo Woo, everyone!

606
00:52:56,188 --> 00:53:00,951
All right. If there are any girls who are doing mean things, bring them here!

607
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:03,929
- There are no girls like that!
- We don't know!

608
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:07,365
Okay, then. Who here knows Eun Ha Won?

609
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:08,934
Eun Ha Won? Eun Ha Won?

610
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:10,852
Me! Me, me!

611
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:12,486
- Who's she?
- Move it!

612
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:14,130
- What the hell?
- I know Eun Ha Won!

613
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,540
- You do?
- Yes!

614
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,943
- Okay, let's go!
- Let's go!

615
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:21,238
Hey, it's Kang Seo Woo!

616
00:53:41,816 --> 00:53:43,034
Here!

617
00:53:47,464 --> 00:53:48,898
Here's a graduation gift for you.

618
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:52,694
What is this?

619
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:55,355
What is this? Just look at you.

620
00:53:57,766 --> 00:53:58,917
All right, you look pretty!

621
00:53:59,943 --> 00:54:01,719
I'll be going.

622
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:03,454
Of course, you should be.

623
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:04,806
Wait!

624
00:54:05,465 --> 00:54:07,208
You have to talk with me for a bit.

625
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:09,243
And you, be on your way.

626
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:18,920
Wait, no!

627
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:21,840
Change your clothes before you go.

628
00:54:34,628 --> 00:54:36,271
Get the hell out of my way!

629
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,194
- What the...
- Damn it!

630
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:43,886
Who the hell is this?

631
00:54:43,886 --> 00:54:45,763
Damn it—

632
00:54:45,763 --> 00:54:48,533
Ow! Ow! Ow, it hurts!

633
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:10,238
Geez, it's not like anyone's looking.

634
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:13,249
I told you, don't mind me and just get changed.

635
00:55:19,497 --> 00:55:21,608
Kang Hyeon Min!

636
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,736
Thanks!

637
00:55:28,064 --> 00:55:30,174
Thank! You!

638
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:38,975
We were heading out anyway, so why are we coming in here?

639
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:41,061
I told you, I have something to talk about with you.

640
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,363
Since we're in here, let's just talk here.

641
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:44,923
It's nice and cozy in here.

642
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:47,325
Oh, it's Kang Hyeon Min!

643
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:51,037
- What the...
- What is this?

644
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,548
- Wow! Oh my gosh!
- What's going on?

645
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:55,733
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

646
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,927
Huh? Kang Ji Woon?

647
00:56:08,296 --> 00:56:10,115
How did you know to come here?

648
00:56:11,174 --> 00:56:14,068
Did you come here knowing that it's Eun Ha Won's graduation today?

649
00:56:14,077 --> 00:56:16,020
Are you crazy?

650
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,049
Well, anyway, what about Eun Ha Won? Where is she?

651
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:25,338
- Isn't that Hyeon Min?
- Hyeon Min is on the screen.

652
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:32,228
- Wait, that really is him!
- Oh my gosh!

653
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:34,347
- Wow!
- This is crazy!

654
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:54,725
I'm just saying this now, just in case.

655
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:59,372
I'm not coming back to Haneul House. I have no right to be there.

656
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,761
What are you talking about? I'm here to talk about something else.

657
00:57:04,761 --> 00:57:06,245
What is it?

658
00:57:11,401 --> 00:57:13,294
I have something to confess to you.

659
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:15,847
Huh?

660
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:23,646
- Oh my gosh!
- No way!

661
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:26,641
- Wait, for real?
- Seriously?

662
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:30,445
- Oh my gosh!
- No way!

663
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,100
After meeting you, all other women seem boring to me.

664
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:38,978
What do you mean by that?

665
00:57:38,978 --> 00:57:43,366
And you keep crossing my mind.

666
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,930
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

667
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,810
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

668
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,180
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie  ♫

669
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,930
♫  pointing only at you ♫

670
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,930
♫  Why did you show up now? ♫

671
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,980
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

672
00:58:02,986 --> 00:58:05,663
I don't like it when you're with other guys,

673
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:08,330
and I especially don't like you hanging around Kang Ji Woon.

674
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:11,720
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫

675
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,750
♫  From the first to the last, I wonder about everything. ♫

676
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,630
♫  Even If I secretly must close my eyes  ♫

677
00:58:16,633 --> 00:58:19,210
Is Ms. Ha Won all right?

678
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,528
I...

679
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:23,631
have great looks, and a brilliant mind.

680
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:26,851
And I'm first in line to be the heir of Haneul Group.

681
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:29,710
♫  My love is growing bigger every day. ♫

682
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,850
♫  Truly you're the only one I know. ♫

683
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,142
♫  You're the only one  ♫

684
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:35,794
Kang Hyeon Min.

685
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,030
♫  Look only at me yet. ♫

686
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,847
Let's...

687
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:40,340
♫  Even if the world is ending, I will run ♫

688
00:58:40,348 --> 00:58:42,330
put a stop to this now.

689
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,540
♫  So that I can protect you. ♫

690
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,156
- Oh my gosh!
- What the hell!

691
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:52,234
Kang Hyeon Min just confessed his feelings for Eun Ha Won?

692
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:53,929
No freaking way!

693
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:57,431
But, what does she mean by, "let's put an end to this now"?

694
00:58:57,431 --> 00:59:00,880
Did Eun Ha Won just dump Kang Hyeon Min?

695
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,550
♫  Even though every start is clumsy and awkward ♫

696
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,100
♫  To the contrary I will be strong ♫

697
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,360
♫ Love is always a paradox ♫

698
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,750
♫  Whether it's serious or not ♫

699
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,037
Sorry. I'll leave first.

700
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,300
♫  This is a marathon I need to control. ♫

701
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,700
♫  If I keep professing my love, ♫

702
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,192
My confession isn't over yet.

703
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,150
♫  Bye bye bye Sad Goodbye ♫

704
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,630
♫  I cherish our meeting ♫

705
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:21,564
You and I...

706
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:29,038
- Wait, why did it turn off?
- Why!

707
00:59:29,038 --> 00:59:32,517
- What's going on?
- Damn it!

708
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:37,300
You and I ... haven't even started anything yet.

709
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:40,325
No.

710
00:59:41,676 --> 00:59:45,163
I don't want to pretend to be your fiancee anymore.

711
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:53,980
Let's end this fake relationship of ours!

712
00:59:57,275 --> 00:59:58,635
Sure.

713
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:02,838
Let's end this fake relationship of ours.

714
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:07,060
And then...

715
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:11,105
let's start dating, for real.
