I really want to be a proper father to you now.

00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,998
You have a dad right here, so it's not right for us to live apart.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,170
I never should've raised someone else's child.

Your mother had you with another man!

That's not true is it, Mom?

15
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:26,086
It can't be.

00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,634
I was worried about you!

33
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,571

if you're here because I called you before...

40
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,809
it's nothing.

41
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,595

59

Eun Ha Won's father came by?

60
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,291
I only allowed him in because he said that he was her father.

61
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,428
But Ha Won called him "Ajussi."

62
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:16,023
So Ha Won ran out after meeting that man?

63
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:21,044
Yes. I have no idea what's going on.

64
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:36,693
Suddenly I have two fathers.

65
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:41,340
Isn't that funny?

66
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,219
One year ago...

67
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,998
Yoon Seong came to find me, out of the blue.

68
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,511
He told me that I was the grandson of the chairman of Haneul Group.

69
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,262
And that my name was actually Kang Ji Woon.

70
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,384
But I've never even seen this so-called father of mine.

71
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:08,525
And I pretty much never heard about my father from my mother.

72
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:12,437
Oh. You must have been so shocked.

73
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,374
I think that...

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,862
how I felt back then must be similar to how you feel now.

75
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:28,537
That's why I think I understand just how shocked you are by all this.

76
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,182
Even if I may not understand everything.

77
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:37,963
Were you able to come to terms with what you were told?

78
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:40,174
No.

79
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,969
I've lived as Han Ji Woon my entire life.

80
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,640
Then suddenly someone says otherwise. How could I possibly believe it?

81
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,252
Right?

82
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,399
It's only natural not to believe something like that.

83
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,197
To be honest, I was a bit curious.

84
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,233
From the moment the man I thought was my father and who I lived with for twenty years...

85
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:14,124
told me that I wasn't his real daughter...

86
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:22,883
I only thought that he said that because he was really angry.

87
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:32,350
But... if I really did have a different biological father...

88
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,205
I thought about what kind of man he would be

89
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,077
and wanted to meet him at least once.

90
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,905
I think that's what I thought back then.

91
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:53,563
But then, he appeared right in front of me.

92
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,973
I had no idea what to do.

93
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,663
To be honest, I still can't believe it, but...

94
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,723
Don't overdo it.

95
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,070
You're not at a point where you're ready yet

96
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,566
So, forcing yourself to believe that truth...

97
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,526
will just make things that much harder for you.

98
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:30,241
Just wait until you're mentally prepared to accept that fact.

99
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,996
Thanks.

100
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:44,739
To tell you the truth, I was really scared to be by myself back there.

101
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:50,512
I was thinking how nice it'd be if there was someone with me.

102
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,290
And then you appeared at that very moment!

103
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,979
You must've been so happy to see me, then.

104
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,816
Well...

105
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,303
I thought at that moment,

106
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,447
"There are times when Kang Ji Woon is helpful, after all!"

107
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,616
Now you seem more like your usual self.

108
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:26,673
You came running to me.

109
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:33,063
Why did you come to me, if you didn't feel that way?

110
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,632
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,259
Get some good sleep tonight.

112
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,086
Okay. Thanks.

113
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,550
I don't need Kang Hyeon Min anymore!

114
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,187
He likes a girl like Eun Ha Won?

115
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,522
I don't like guys who have terrible taste in girls, either!

116
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:34,891
Yeah! What a great decision you've made!

117
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:38,086
You're the one who rejected that Kang Hyeon Min!

118
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:40,530
- Well, duh.
- Yeah!

119
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:48,505
Then... should we just give up on Haneul Group now?

120
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,133
We can't do that.

121
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,139
I'm going to switch over to Kang Seo Woo.

122
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,411
You said you were going to seduce Kang Seo Woo, so what are you doing?

123
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:18,018
Just watch. I'm going to make him mine, no matter what!

124
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,207
Chairman!

125
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,510
What brings you here?

126
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,979
Why did you leave without saying anything?

127
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,440
I had a breakfast meeting this morning.

128
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,929
You should've told me in advance! I made a surprise breakfast for you.

129
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,623
Oh, whatever!

130
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,884
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,245
Are you still not feeling well?

132
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:57,424
I feel as if you haven't been as talkative lately.

133
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,125
And you seem a bit listless too.

134
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,872
There's nothing bothering you, is there?

135
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,672
You know, I actually deceived you.

136
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:13,582
Excuse me?

137
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,343
I had no breakfast meeting.

138
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:19,638
To tell you the truth, Chairman Lee wanted to go to the bathhouse together

139
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,898
which is why I headed out early.

140
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,668
You don't like going to bathhouses.

141
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:33,134
That's because you go there so often!

142
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:35,787
Going there once a week or so is fine.

143
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:39,749
I've been honest with you, so be honest with me too

144
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,378
if there's anything that you're hiding from me.

145
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,733
I'll forgive you as long as you tell me now.

146
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,173
What would I be hiding from you, Chairman?

147
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,437
Hello?

148
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,815
Are you Ms. Park Ok Seon's guardian?

149
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,775
Yes.

150
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,678
I'm just calling to let you know that there have been

151
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,864
two payments for her columbarium space this month.

152
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,860
What? There's nobody else who would pay for that.

153
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,262
Who made the other payment?

154
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,839
Just a moment. I'll check for you.

155
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:34,371
Well... the name is Kang Yeong Jin.

156
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:38,709
Kang Yeong Jin?

157
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,071
Oh! All right.

158
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,555
Why would he pay for her columbarium fees, too?

159
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,190
Come out.

160
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,495
Here. Kang Seo Woo's specialty: garlic spaghetti!

161
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,263
Eat up.

162
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,415
I heard you didn't even eat breakfast.

163
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,925
Yeah.

164
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,471
Hey. Stop looking at me with so much concern in your eyes.

165
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,776
You've always been the one to try and fix our family's problems.

166
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,336
But yet, I feel like we haven't done anything to help you.

167
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:44,157
I was okay yesterday because Ji Woon came to find me.

168
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,602
Kang Ji Woon did?

169
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:50,831
Yeah. He's always telling me to go away

170
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,500
But deep inside it seems like he has a warm heart.

171
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,447
And on top of that, top star Kang Seo Woo made breakfast for me!

172
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:02,367
Looks like it's worthwhile to be working at Haneul House, after all!

173
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:07,489
Wow, you're not a bad cook!

174
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:11,518
Eat up.

175
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,410
What are you doing here?

176
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,396
Oh my gosh! I was just standing here! I wasn't doing anything!

177
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,950
Have you been eating?

178
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,661
Of course!

179
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:33,465
Well, of course. You're not the type to let yourself starve.

180
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,685
Kang Seo Woo seemed to be worrying quite a lot about you.

181
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,590
So I told him that you're very mentally strong.

182
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,510
Of course!

183
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,943
You're not going?

184
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:14,272
Hey, don't wear those sweats! They're super tacky!

185
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:21,054
What the... what's with him?

186
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,131
I wear those all the time!

187
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,113
Did you, by any chance...

188
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:32,182
say something to Ha Won?

189
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,901
I told her that I wanted to go out with you.

190
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,311
What?

191
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,221
And...

192
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:40,832
that you'd probably feel the same way.

193
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:03,062
About yesterday...

194
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,216
I'm sorry for leaving you like that.

195
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:12,555
It's okay. I heard something happened to Ha Won yesterday.

196
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:17,869
You know, you unexpectedly have a soft side.

197
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,638
You're rough around the edges on the outside,

198
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:25,719
but you can't ignore people in need and have to help them feel better.

199
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,032
That's not why I went to Ha Won

200
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,539
Then?

201
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,750
Ha Won is someone special to me.

202
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,436
If you went to Ha Won because you have feelings for her...

203
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,506
Why did you come to me that time?

204
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,744
Did you pity me?

205
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,847
- No, that's not—
- Why were you nice to me, then?

206
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,183
You should've just left me to deal with it on my own.

207
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,436
Why are you making me feel more pathetic than I already do?

208
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:13,125
You were the first one who opened up to me when I came here,

209
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,319
so I wanted to be nice to you.

211
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,567
I'm sorry if that upset you in any way.

00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:24,687
Stop saying that you're sorry.

♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

214
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:33,937
You were the one who was always by my side every time Hyeon Min hurt me.

215
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,264
And I always felt bad about that.

216
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,443
But what should I do now that you're the one saying sorry?

217
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,270
♫  Won't you come to feel like me? ♫

218

No. You just got used to having me being by your side

223
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,786
instead of Kang Hyeon Min.

224
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:04,251
But do you really think I'll be able to fill that gap for you?

♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

I didn't miss you all.

230
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,100
Why are you acting like this?

231
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,430
Do you know how many years it's been since we last saw each other?

232
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,256
You're... just joking right?

♫  You will be there in the time that I dreamed of ♫

You really don't get it, do you?

235
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,296
Do you want me to repeat myself?

236
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,358

241
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,078
I'm sure she was a bit confused yesterday.

242
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,207
[PAYMENT TO HANEUL COLUMBARIUM]

243
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,861
Have to do at least this much to succeed.

244
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,588
She should've called me about it by now.

245
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,717
Are you, by any chance, Ha Won's...

246
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,998
Oh, yes! I'm her dad.

247
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,076
My name is Kang Ji Woon.

248
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:25,475
Oh... to meet one of the Kang Cousins... I have no idea what to call you.

249
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,477
Should I call you "Mr...?"

250
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,504
No, it's fine.

251
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:31,865
Well, at any rate, it's an honor to meet you.

252
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,059
I'm not that great of a person.

253
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,460
Please, take a seat.

254
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,695
All right.

255
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,699
I'm just Ha Won's friend.

256
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,935
What kind of friend?

257
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:47,355
Are you two... engaged, by any chance?

258
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,849
I think of Ha Won as a part of my family.

259
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,052
Oh, you and Ha Won...

260
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:55,547
um, I mean... thank you so much

261
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,240
for taking such good care of my Ha Won

262
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,128
You're doing all the things that I haven't been able to do for her.

263
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,155
I heard everything from Ha Won.

264
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:05,081
That it's been ten years since you've last seen each other.

265
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,745
Yes. I was deep in debt

266
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:11,813
so wasn't in a financially secure place.

267
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:19,988
I was going to come and take her when I could afford to feed and clothe her well.

268
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,117
But my financial situation never got any better.

269
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,097
And I felt that I'd never be able to see Ha Won, the rate I was going.

270
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:37,055
I've been a terrible father, never being able to afford to buy her clothes

271
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:40,809
or even a proper, warm meal.

272
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,974
Um...

273
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,770
if it's not too rude of me, please take this.

274
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:57,200
Oh... no! No. It's fine.

275
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,489
No, it's all right. Please meet Ha Won, and buy her some clothes and food.

276
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,220
Oh, I know this is shameless of me, but I'll take it for Ha Won's sake.

277
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,946
Thank you.

278
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,582
Also...

279
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:16,736
If you ever need my help, feel free to call me at any time.

280
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,214
Oh, yes.

281
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,006
SECRETARY LEE

282
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,374
VIBRATE

283
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,131
I just got a call from Secretary Lee.

284
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:22,402
- If the Chairman hears of this...
- Don't worry.

285
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:25,948
Do you have what I asked for?

286
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,908
Yes.

287
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,901
Here is a copy of his will.

288
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:33,121
I'll read it over, and contact you.

289
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,333
Please take care of everything.

290
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,123
Why are you here?

291
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:53,934
Whom did you meet with today?

292
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,887
I had a gathering.

293
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:59,038
Didn't you meet with Attorney Kim?

294
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,776
Were you following me?

295
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:11,493
What were you planning to do with this?

296
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,362
None of your business.

297
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,724
The Chairman will find out about this.

298
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,151
All you need to do is keep your mouth shut.

299
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:21,044
Until when?

300
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:24,548
Until what I want is in the palm of my hand.

301
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:31,638
Was it all just for money? The reason why you've done all this

302
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,715
And pretended not to know the son you haven't seen in 20 years?

303
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,294
This is all for your sake!

304
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,313
You've dedicated your entire life to Haneul Group.

305
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:46,236
Are you still going to pick up after those brats after the Chairman is gone?

306
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:50,516
This is why I'm doing all this! To get you to a better place!

307
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,992
Stop being a hypocrite!

308
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:59,082
It doesn't matter what you say. I'm going to see this to the end.

309
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,469
And just where is this "end"?

310
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,917
If you abandoned me once, you shouldn't have come looking for me.

311
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:14,022
No... if you really wanted to come back into my life,

312
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:17,167
at the very least, it shouldn't have been like this.

313
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:43,994
It's me.

314
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:47,881
Please arrange a meeting with the board for me as soon as possible.

315
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,409
There's no time to waste.

316
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:05,899
Did you get home safely last night? From Dad.

317
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,865
Peek-a-boo!

318
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:15,117
Nyah! Nyah!

319
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:19,554
A boy shouldn't bother girls! My mom said that's a bad thing to do!

320
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:20,956
And who are you, brat?

321
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,632
Apologize to her, right now!

322
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:24,368
Stay out of this, kid!

323
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:26,553
I'm not a kid!

324
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,809
My dad's right over there! When my dad gets here, you're dead!

325
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:33,727
I have a Dad too!

326
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:34,978
Where is he? Huh?

327
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:39,241
He's far away right now. But he said that he'd be back in ten days!

328
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:41,067
Liar.

329
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,211
Ha Won!

330
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:46,840
Your dad's here.

331
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,817
Mist...

332
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,329
- Dad!
- Yes!

333
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:56,766
All right, upsy-daisy! Morph!

334
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,564
I just transformed with my dad!

335
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:04,741
So don't mess with me!

336
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:06,460
Hey! Hey!

337
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:30,809
Damn it.

338
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,030
Aw, man!

339
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:41,169
EUN HA WON

340
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,171
Ha Won?

341
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,175
Have you had dinner?

342
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,554
No. I'm still working right now.

343
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:02,015
Then...

344
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,643
Let's have dinner together.

345
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,370
What's the matter? Does the food not taste good?

346
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,905
Um, no. That's not it.

347
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:25,313
I heard that you paid the fee for Mom's columbarium.

348
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,338
Oh... of course I should pay for that.

349
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,341
About what you said yesterday...

350
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,329
Is it really all true?

351
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:46,435
Something happened between your mom and I that you don't know about.

352
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:51,340
Since we went to college together, we opened the taekwondo center together,

353
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,569
but we found out about our feelings for each other way too late.

354
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:58,906
Love can be a terrible thing sometimes.

355
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,401
So why did you wait this long to come and find me?

356
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:06,362
After my apartment burned down, and I lost the center.

357
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:09,616
I had so much debt and was going through a really hard time.

358
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:13,012
I figured I'd get you when I was in a better place financially,

359
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,255
and it ended up taking this long.

360
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:24,940
You were so small, and yet you got so big already.

361
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:28,226
Time sure flies by.

362
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:32,814
It feels like only yesterday when I used to play with you and carry you around.

363
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,483
You don't remember that?

364
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:38,578
You'd yell, "morph!" when I put you on my shoulders

365
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,323
and you loved it!

366
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:51,516
Um, I'll be back in a bit.

367
00:29:51,516 --> 00:29:53,235
- Where are you going?
- Um...

368
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:58,841
I have a friend nearby who I need to pick up something from. Just a minute.

369
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,300
Wait!

370
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,484
Where is she running off to, all of a sudden?

371
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,229
I didn't even get to the part about the money yet.

372
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,341
Um, I'm looking for clothes for a man in his forties.

373
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,634
Oh, clothes for your dad?

374
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:30,122
Well... um... not exactly.

375
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:10,629
Oh, that was quick.

376
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:14,291
Yes. My friend was nearby.

377
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,910
Hurry up and eat. Your food will get cold!

378
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,921
Are you still struggling financially?

379
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:20,772
What?

380
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:24,468
You said that you couldn't come get me because of your difficult financial situation

381
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:27,571
I'm still in a similar situation.

382
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:32,518
I'm working at a construction site, living day-by-day

383
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:38,815
But you know, it makes me sad that I don't have a home to share with you.

384
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,553
If you can give me a little money for that...

385
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:45,722
I don't have that kind of money, either.

386
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:50,302
If it's difficult for you, what about asking Chairman Kang's grandson?

387
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,646
What was his name, again? Kang Ji Woon, was it?

388
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:56,867
Can't you ask him?

389
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,362
How do you know Ji Woon?

390
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:03,615
I went to Haneul House and happened to run into him.

391
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:08,220
You know, I think that he finds you very special.

392
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,231
- Kang Ji Woon does?
- Yeah!

393
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:14,685
And maybe because he's so rich... but he's so generous!

394
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:18,163
He even gave me money to buy you something delicious!

395
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:20,248
You accepted money from Ji Woon?

396
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:23,927
Oh. He told me not to tell you. Oops.

397
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:25,554
How much did you get from him?

398
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:28,156
- Well, that's...
- No.

399
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:31,151
I'll ask Ji Woon myself.

400
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,886
I'll get going now.

401
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:34,229
Wait.

402
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,876
Hey, you didn't finish your food!

403
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:50,520
No. You just got used to having me by your side, instead of Kang Hyeon Min.

404
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:57,019
But do you really think I'll be able to fill that gap for you?

405
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,476
Park Hye Ji?

406
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,014
It's been a while.

407
00:33:09,014 --> 00:33:12,109
Wow, unbelievable!

408
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:17,206
The perpetually stuck-up Park Hye Ji is drinking alone today?

409
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,884
Then you can drink with me, Joon Soo.

410
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,023
You never spared a guy a glance unless it was Kang Hyeon Min.

411
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,908
What's gotten into you?

412
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:29,384
Is that how I was?

413
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,820
Um, yeah. You totally were.

414
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,073
Do you want to go out with me, if things between you and Hyeon Min are over?

415
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,437
It won't be easy for you.

416
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,649
Sounds like a challenge.

417
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,486
Did you drink a lot?

418
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:53,725
Wow, you've become really pretty.

419
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:00,999
What?

420
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,879
Hey, Hyeon Min. Big news!

421
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,982
Park Hye Ji is here, drinking.

422
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:10,408
By herself?

423
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:13,303
No. With Joon Soo.

424
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:15,664
And? So what?

425
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:20,602
Wow, it looks like the two of them are hitting it off.

426
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,796
Are you really okay with...

427
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,440
Damn it!

428
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,872
Do you have some time?

429
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:49,222
Want to go on that drive that we couldn't go on last time?

430
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:58,932
Yeah. It'd be weird to give this to her now, in this situation.

431
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,343
Hello?

432
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:13,113
Um, it's Ha Won's dad.

433
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:24,232
Hey, where are you going?

434
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,027
Why do you care?

435
00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:30,055
Are you going to pick up Hye Ji, by any chance?

436
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:31,448
Where is she?

437
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,910
Never mind. Forget it.

438
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,622
Let's stop playing these games already.

439
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,272
Just do whatever you want to do.

440
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,861
If you're that concerned about her, take care of her yourself.

441
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,980
♫  My heart hurts so much, ♫

442
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:08,300
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

Did you go see your father?

♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

449
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,568
What's wrong?

♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

Huh?

453
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,886
I heard that you gave money to Mr. Yeong Jin.

You know...

♫  I can't live without you ♫

458
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:52,988
you told me about what happened to you a year ago, right?

459
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,799
And said that we were in similar situations.

460
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,720
♫ I would accept it. ♫

461

♫  You've become someone who can't give back ♫

But I guess I was wrong about that.

464
00:37:08,712 --> 00:37:10,430
What do you mean by that?

465
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,942
It's not like I suddenly hit the jackpot like you.

466
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:17,579
But I can't complain about this situation, either.

467
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,407
It's hard enough for me to get through each and every day,

468
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:25,002
and I hate myself for thinking, "How will I live my life if that man really is my father?"

♫  My only one ♫

00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,383
Eun Ha Won.

474
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:41,512
It's not like that. And you know that.

You told me to contact you any time I needed help, so...

483
00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:17,339
Yes, please go ahead.

484
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,661
I lived apart from Ha Won for over ten years and was just reunited with her.

485
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:26,331
So it'd be a bit strange to continue living apart from her.

486
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:28,976
And... so?

487
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:32,896
I'd like to get a fully-paid for apartment somewhere in Seoul.

488
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:40,779
Does Ha Won know that you're asking me these kinds of things?

489
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:42,439
Oh, of course!

490
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:49,245
She said that she felt bad about asking herself, so she wanted me to instead.

491
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,958
Well, all right.

492
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:56,586
I'll come to see you at your workplace tomorrow.

493
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:17,649
Mom...

494
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,321
What do I do?

495
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:32,456
Did you really love a man like him?

496
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:43,550
Oh, what's this?

497
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,745
This one is on me, so drink up!

498
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:49,698
- Here.
- Looks like you got some money.

499
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:51,425
You even bought us food last time, too.

500
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:52,768
Did you get some money from somewhere?

501
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:55,962
I've gotten myself a real nice sponsor, you see.

502
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:57,664
- Wow!
- Wow.

503
00:39:57,664 --> 00:39:59,780
What are you saying?

504
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,360
Aigoo. Let's get going.

505
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,250
After all, we enjoyed the drinks.

506
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,453
Let's go!

507
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:35,936
Goal: To earn enough for college! Let's start over!

508
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:42,250
The fact that I don't have a place where we could live together

509
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,152
is quite a shame, really.

510
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:47,773
If you give me a little bit of money...

511
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,283
Mr. Kang Seo Woo, who made a comeback with the new track called "Confession,"

512
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:00,577
is talking to us right now about love.

513
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:05,991
A lot of fans are wondering if the lyrics are about your first love.

514
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:08,076
Oh... really?

515
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:11,513
What was your first love like?

516
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:15,133
Well... my first love, huh?

517
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:17,119
I'm kind of going through it right now.

518
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,912
Right now?

519
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,189
Yes.

520
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,457
I'm a bit late to the game when it comes to love, you see.

521
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:27,287
Just what kind of woman is she then?

522
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,849
She tends to first react with her fists rather than her words.

523
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:33,368
She makes a skincare sample last for three days.

524
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:36,671
And she practically always wears sweats.

525
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:39,925
But when she wears a dress, which is rare, she looks really pretty.

526
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:46,431
And... even when a guy like me confesses his feelings for her,

527
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,967
she doesn't even realize it and goes to the person she loves.

528
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,661
That's the type of woman she is.

529
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:55,265
I don't know who that may be, but I'm so jealous of her!

530
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,156
"Kang Seo Woo?"

531
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:04,733
No, no.

532
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:09,154
Is this... fate?

533
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,607
That was good! It seemed totally natural!

534
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,243
It's Kang Seo Woo!

535
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,679
Hong Ja Mong?

536
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:29,107
My name is Hong Ja Yeong, okay?

537
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:31,109
Get it right, already!

538
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,912
You're Eun Ha Won's friend, not mine.

539
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:37,132
Anyway, Hong Ja Mong.

540
00:42:37,132 --> 00:42:38,808
Why are you here?

541
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:42,262
I'm a fan of Seo Woo's, okay?

542
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:45,423
Wow. So even people like you think you can be a fan.

543
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,827
What the hell did you say? People like me?

544
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:55,200
Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey!

545
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,787
Oh, hey, School Uniform!

546
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:01,807
She's Eun Ha Won's older sister.

547
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:05,335
You know, Yoo Na. The one with the rotten personality.

548
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,212
Shut your damn mouth.

549
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:45,358
Be nice to Eun Ha Won!

550
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:46,668
What is this?

551
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:52,441
Looks like you're on his hit list.

552
00:43:52,441 --> 00:43:55,411
This is why you should've been nicer to Ha Won sooner.

553
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:57,154
Honey!

554
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,516
Eun Ha Won! That good for nothing!

555
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:13,537
Just do whatever you want to do.

556
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:18,875
If you're that worried about her, take care of her yourself.

557
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,920
♫  Lately they say I am strange ♫

558
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,270
♫  My heart like a bad habit ♫

559
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,548
Hey!

560
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,050
♫  seems to be putting on a brave face ♫

561
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:47,340
♫  hiding all it's feelings facing you ♫

562
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,920
♫  I like a day like this. ♫

563
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,870
♫  I just keep liking you ♫

564
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,750
♫  Turning one step away ♫

565
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,920
♫  Seeing you will be harder ♫

566
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,716
You were able to get all the money for the lease?

567
00:45:10,986 --> 00:45:12,237
No.

568
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,423
Then?

569
00:45:15,423 --> 00:45:17,993
That's the money you paid for my mom's columbarium.

570
00:45:17,993 --> 00:45:20,529
I'm returning it to you.

571
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:22,656
What's wrong, Ha Won?

572
00:45:22,656 --> 00:45:25,308
I have no reason to accept this money from you.

573
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:27,002
What do you mean, you have no reason?

574
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:29,421
- I'm your dad—
- You know...

575
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:33,566
I can't acknowledge you as my father.

576
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:37,562
Who cares if you acknowledge it or not? We're related by blood!

577
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:45,145
Do you think that I'm lying, or something?

578
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:53,228
The truth behind whether or not you're her father is inside this envelope.

579
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:00,760
Ha Won. You don't trust me? Huh?

580
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,933
You can just check the results.

581
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:10,528
Should I do it, or would you rather do it yourself?

582
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,873
Ha Won.

583
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:34,018
It's okay. I don't need to see this.

584
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:38,031
I trust my mom.

585
00:46:39,116 --> 00:46:42,118
There's no way my mom would've loved a man like this.

586
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:54,873
Mister.

587
00:46:56,433 --> 00:47:02,155
If it's money you need... you came to the wrong person.

588
00:47:03,515 --> 00:47:05,659
I have no money.

589
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:10,689
I'm only living at Haneul House because I work there part-time.

590
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:16,253
So there won't be any reason to meet again.

591
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:21,925
There was nothing else I could do, either.

592
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,388
If it hadn't been for that fire at that apartment,

593
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:31,876
my life wouldn't have been so completely ruined like this.

594
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:46,766
Your life was completely ruined?

595
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,556
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

596
00:47:52,556 --> 00:47:55,970
You know, there are people who lost their lives that day, like my mother!

597
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,920
♫  I am barely living. ♫

598
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,216
How do you think my life has been after that day?

599
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,860
♫  Tears fall endlessly. ♫

600
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,613
But despite everything,

601
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:11,174
I never once thought that my life was completely ruined!

602
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,600
♫  you could almost reach me. ♫

603
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:16,800
The person who ruined your life is you.

604
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,950
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

605
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:27,230
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

606

00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,650
♫  I can't live without you ♫

608
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:45,600
♫  If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

609
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,089
Let's go!

610
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:52,474
Where?

611
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,310
On that drive that we couldn't go on last time.

612
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:09,291
Joon Soo?

613
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,185
I'm coming now.

614
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:14,288
The cafe at the intersection in Sinsa-dong? Okay.

615
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,861
Wow, it looks like the two of them are hitting it off!

616
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,706
You really came.

617
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,450
You said that you wanted to go on a date with me.

618
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,247
Things are really over between you and Hyeon Min, right?

619
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,316
It's not like the two of us were ever dating.

620
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,025
We were just friends.

621
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,678
Just friends?

622
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:50,140
Let's go.

623
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:52,409
What's with you?

624
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:54,019
What are you doing?

625
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:58,332
Leave.

626
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:00,625
I don't want to.

627
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:04,446
How did things go with the girl you were seeing up until yesterday?

628
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,299
How dare you try to cheat on her.

629
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:12,429
Leave, before that girl calls you.

630
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,040
Why are you here?

631
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:45,829
Why are you doing this to me?

632
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:47,981
Why are you even seeing a guy like him?

633
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:49,733
That has literally nothing to do with you!

634
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:53,511
Hey. If you're going to date someone, date someone actually worth dating!

635
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,182
You're so ridiculous.

636
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,118
If you're going to approach me then treat me with some decency.

637
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:02,179
And if you're not, then leave me alone!

638
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,723
I really want to stop being bothered by you too okay?

639
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:06,058
But I'm only doing this

640
00:51:06,058 --> 00:51:09,578
because you're trying to see weird guys after getting rejected by Kang Ji Woon!

641
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:12,806
That is none of your business.

642
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:14,499
Let me out.

643
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:19,762
Can't you hear me? Stop the car!

644
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:58,568
What are you doing?

645
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,272
I can't drive now.

646
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:05,592
No drinking and driving. You know the law, right?

647
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:22,942
Oh, Reporter Choi!

648
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:24,811
What's the occasion?

649
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:26,730
What did you say?

650
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:30,292
Seo Woo isn't dating anyone!

651
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:33,436
That's definitely not true. It's definitely not true!

652
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:36,907
Yes, yes! I'll call you and visit you!

653
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,283
Yes!

654
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:41,153
What, did someone say that they were dating me?

655
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:42,320
Who is it this time?

656
00:52:42,888 --> 00:52:46,900
They didn't say who, exactly. But about your last scandal...

657
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,603
We managed to get through it, thanks to those school uniform photos.

658
00:52:49,603 --> 00:52:52,055
But if you get caught this time, it'll really be the end!

659
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:53,457
You're not dating anyone, are you?

660
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:55,968
Where would I have the time to date anyone?

661
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:01,573
Oh yeah. It was a bit weird that you mentioned your first love on the radio.

662
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,283
Was that real?

663
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:05,644
I told you so many times already! It was all just a lie!

664
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:08,814
You really don't have a first love, right?

665
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:12,192
You were just saying that because of her prompt, right?

666
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:13,551
Right?

667
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:15,996
Yes! I lied a little! Okay, so what?

668
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:35,624
Should I signal now?

669
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:37,509
You have to go a bit farther before doing that.

670
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,161
Okay.

671
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,599
Should I switch lanes now?

672
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:46,243
We're in the left-turn lane right now.

673
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:48,203
We need to make a right turn!

674
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:51,999
Oh. A right turn? Look to see if there's a car next to us.

675
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:55,135
- Oh, now, now, now!
- Now?

676
00:54:00,674 --> 00:54:02,551
You missed your chance again.

677
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:04,411
How long are you going to keep on going straight?

678
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:06,838
What am I supposed to do, then?

679
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:08,916
I told you, this is my first time driving since getting my license!

680
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,928
Sure, sure. Keep going straight, then.

681
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:16,523
We'll get there one day, I guess, since the earth is round.

682
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:17,882
Stop that!

683
00:54:20,027 --> 00:54:22,137
Look in front of you!

684
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:27,643
Just keep going straight.

685
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:36,151
We'll end up meeting all the children of this world before we get back.

686
00:54:45,093 --> 00:54:46,912
Are you still mad?

687
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:53,877
Sorry for interfering when you would've figured it out on your own.

688
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:57,080
About the other day...

689
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,967
I was too harsh to you.

690
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,286
I'm sorry.

691
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:08,100
I was in conflict.

692
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:15,270
And didn't know whether or not to believe that guy.

693
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,277
I was really agonizing over it.

694
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:23,348
But, when you showed up with that envelope...

695
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:27,018
I knew my answer.

696
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:30,330
I didn't need to confirm whatever was in that envelope.

697
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,169
I trust my mom.

698
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:55,030
Hey, isn't this kind of boring, though?

699
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:58,008
This is all I get after getting blown off twice?

700
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:00,460
Boring?

701
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:10,179
Wow, this is so nice.

No.

♫  The only one I've been waiting for ♫

719

Finding someone who I thought was quite similar to me, I mean.

♫  It was you. In my heart ♫

723

thought that we were quite similar.

But...

727
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:32,820
♫ Hey! ♫

728
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:35,430
you have a really peculiar personality.

729
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,433
You don't try to get close to people and just get mad!

730
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,397
You locked the door to your heart and kept telling me to go away!

731
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:46,140
Why were you always saying that to me?

732

♫ Hey! ♫

733

Yep, you did!

735
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,341
You're like an ironclad wall.

What's this?

740
00:58:06,503 --> 00:58:08,588
A gift, from Mr. Ironclad Wall.

741
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,791
Hey, what is this?

742
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,411
Can't you see?

743
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,037
They're my feelings for you.

744

Eun Ha Won!

745
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:39,586
I bought candy on White Day to give to you.

746
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,219
What's this, then?

747
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,281
That's because...

748
00:58:52,399 --> 00:58:54,617
it melted, so...

749
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,930
It's not Hye Ji.

750
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,940
It's you.
