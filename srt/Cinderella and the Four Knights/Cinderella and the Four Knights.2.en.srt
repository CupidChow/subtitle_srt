Do you need money that badly?

10
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,412
Hey, Han Ji Woon.

11
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:19,382
Don't you dare mistreat my girl.

12
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,368
"My girl?"

13
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:34,747
Stop it, both of you!

14
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:51,730
Wait.

15
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:57,704
I know that you people can easily throw around this kind of money

16
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:01,340
but there are plenty of people in the world who can't.

17
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:04,110
Wait.

18
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:08,473
- Who are you?
- What are you doing?

19
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:12,268
I have no interest in what you have to say, so get lost.

20
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,762
In other words, stay away from Kang Hyeon Min

21
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:17,282
if you don't want to see things get really nasty.

22
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,007
Your name is Kang Ji Woon, right?

23
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:30,036
Stop ranting about things you know nothing about.

24
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,180
This is my last warning to you.

25
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:40,279
If you ever touch me again, that'll be the day you die.

26
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,305
Wait.

27
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:42,192
Are you upset?

28
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:44,444
Do I look like I'm so easy to push around?

29
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:46,971
No, it's not that--

30
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,180
♫ While I keep looking only at you ♫

31

78
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,537
Oh, we're already here?

Why are you spacing out so much?

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,100
♫ Doing anything for you excites me. ♫

83
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,670
♫ I'm not letting you go easily ♫

84
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,230
Do you like Kang Hyeon Min that much?

85
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,420
♫  You're the only one for me.  ♫

86
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,097
Even though he won't even look twice at you?

87
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:20,667
I'm going to make him look at me. Don't you worry.

88
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,100
♫  So that I can protect you ♫

89
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,050
♫ I'm the only one for you♫

90
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,662
Kang Hyeon Min. Just what are you trying to pull?

91
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:36,257
Well, I just took a shower.

92
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:38,660
Do you know what you did at the wedding today?

93
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,564
Oh. What? Was it bad of me to have gotten Grandfather a present?

94
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:48,777
To reciprocate, he's also prepared a present for you.

95
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:55,485
Who's that?

96
00:06:55,485 --> 00:07:00,064
Your real fiancee. She's the grand-daughter of K Group's Chairman.

97
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,769
What the hell? Are you telling me now to have an arranged marriage?

98
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,379
You'll be meeting with her tomorrow.

99
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,465
It's the first meeting, so make sure you're good to her.

100
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:09,958
Aw, come on, Hyung! Why are you doing this to me?

101
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,653
You really thought you'd get away with pulling that stunt?

102
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,264
Oh, whatever. Whatever.

103
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:24,447
You'd better go if you want to keep your place as heir to Haneul Group.

104
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,028
Damn it.

105
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,615
Oh, whatever!

106
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:15,732
I've gotten married five times, but yesterday was the best wedding I've had.

107
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:18,551
I got to see quite an amusing spectacle.

108
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:27,944
Wait.

109
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:32,682
I know that you people can easily throw around this kind of money

110
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:35,251
but there are plenty of people in the world who can't.

111
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,671
That girl is no ordinary girl.

112
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:43,659
Look into that young lady who came to the wedding.

113
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,453
Yes, sir.

114
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:02,987
Oh, good morning!

115
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:07,542
Hey, I have to eat breakfast!

116
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,570
How are you ever going to get anywhere in life when you move so slowly?

117
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,133
I'm sorry. I woke up a bit late today. I'll whip something up quick!

118
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:19,621
Damn it, I'm going to starve because of you!

119
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:21,355
So annoying!

120
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:49,216
What do you want?

121
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:54,155
Um, I have a favor to ask you.

122
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:57,275
No, don't bother.

123
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,296
Um...

124
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,168
Can't you hear me out, just this once?

125
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,939
What, huh?

126
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:19,847
Could you lend me some money to pay my tuition for the first semester of college?

127
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:22,133
I'll be sure to work really hard at my part-time jobs and pay you back!

128
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:25,661
Tuition? What are you talking about?

129
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:29,899
Are you talking about my Yoo Na's tuition?

130
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:39,092
What, did you pray for Yoo Na to not get into any colleges, so you could go?

131
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,861
No... No, that's not what I meant.

132
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:45,657
You were acting all high and mighty before, saying you had tons of money!

133
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:50,995
But, what? You want me to give you my Yoo Na's tuition?

134
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:54,566
Are you crazy? Are you out of your damn mind?

135
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,226
Why are you being so loud?

136
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:59,061
Let me sleep, damn it! Let me sleep!

137
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,940
Hey. Go.

138
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,310
Just leave.

139
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,927
I'll head out, then.

140
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,657
She's become the "Nation's Jackpot Girl."

141
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:33,346
She's the fiancee of Kang Hyeon Min, first in line to inherit Haneul Group.

142
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,665
But, who really is this girl?

143
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:41,446
Who is she really? Did she save the country in her past life?

144
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:42,864
There's finally a pic of her online! I'm a guy and even I'm jealous!

145
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,449
Did you hear about that girl? I feel like she must be pretty!

146
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:50,096
The biggest news story from yesterday: Kang Hyeon Min, the heir to Haneul Group

147
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:53,658
brought his fiancee to the wedding of his grandfather, Chairman Kang!

148
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,936
And there's something we've prepared for everyone, in light of that news, right?

149
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:59,240
Here you are. This photo of the Nation's< Jackpot Girl is all over the web now.

150
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,183
Doesn't that girl kind of look like Eun Ha Won?

151
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:06,079
Eun Ha Won? As if! No way!

152
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,540
Her face ...

153
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,482
- No, they do look kind of similar.
- Mom!

154
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:13,353
I'm really sensitive right now, okay? Stop bothering me!

155
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:22,362
Yes, Honey? Of course, we're all doing well!

156
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:26,040
Ha Won and Yoo Na left for school together.

157
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,459
The two of them are practically inseparable!

158
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,900
Oh, I see.

159
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,240
Oh, you're coming tomorrow?

160
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:46,327
The government needs to do its job! Geez, this is really pissing me off!

161
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:49,864
- Boss.
- What?

162
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:54,252
- Today is payday.
- So?

163
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:58,230
Could you pay me in advance for next month?

164
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,950
I promise I'll work really hard!

165
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,553
Stop being ridiculous. You're pissing me off.

166
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:05,814
Hey, you have to work to get paid!

167
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:08,175
Does it make sense to be paid before you work?

168
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,460
Jesus, I'd kill you if you were serious.

169
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,728
You have to put in the work to get paid!

170
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:17,542
What kind of ridiculous request is that? Huh?

171
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,980
She started working part-time at a convenience store

172
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,167
and then she began working at a cafe, restaurant, movie theater,

173
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,062
as a dog-walker, and at an amusement park.

174
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,748
She currently has ten part-time jobs.

175
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,203
Is she the only one who can support the family?

176
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:41,775
Not exactly, but it is true that she has to fend for herself.

177
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,669
Her biological mother passed away when she was young

178
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,397
and her father remarried.

179
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:48,957
She's currently living with her stepmother

180
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:52,126
and her stepmother's daughter, who is the same age as she is.

181
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:55,555
Her father is a truck driver, but he often works in the countryside

182
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,666
so he only comes home every couple of months.

183
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:01,010
Her family isn't exactly well-off

184
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,955
so it seems they only have money to send< one of their daughters to college.

185
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:09,526
Therefore, it seems that Ms. Ha Won is >doing her best to earn her own tuition.

186
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:14,924
No wonder she seems so mature for her age.

187
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,220
It may be better to get someone like her, who's close to them in age

188
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,925
rather than someone who will try to cater to all of the boys' requests.

189
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,164
Haneul Columbarium - 3,995,000 won
Remaining balance: 800 won

190
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:33,910
Deadline for tuition deposit!
Important for my dream!]

191
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:38,089
Yeah. I can just go to college next year.

192
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:41,951
I'm sure I'll earn 4 million won in no time if I work hard for a year!

193
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,130
No. I'll have to earn more than that.

194
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,670
That way, Mom can rest in peace.

195
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,657
Objective: 4 million won for tuition!
Let's start again!

196
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:05,858
Why isn't Dad responding?

197
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:11,072
Huh? What the heck? This isn't mine!

198
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,327
Oh no. Did it get switched at the hotel?

199
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,593
There's someone who'd like to meet you, Ms. Eun Ha Won.

200
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,378
What?

201
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,072
Hello.

202
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:40,852
Oh. You have something on your clothes.

203
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:41,853
What?

204
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:47,776
What a nice bow. It sure is nice to be greeted with a bow twice!

205
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,472
You have a great sense of humor.

206
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:54,774
That's a compliment, right?

207
00:15:56,718 --> 00:15:59,996
I'm sorry about what happened that day.

208
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:03,667
I was really worried that I ruined your wedding.

209
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,744
There's no need to worry about that.

210
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:08,964
But, um, why did you ask to see me?

211
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:15,370
I'm sorry, but I did a bit of a background check on you. "The Art of War by Sun Tzu"

212
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,656
It's the first time I've met someone of your age

213
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:20,174
with similar tastes in books as me.

214
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:23,970
My mother told me that adhering to Sun Tzu's teachings

215
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,839
would get me through life without hardship.

216
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:32,687
How amusing. Would you be willing to lend me some of that wisdom, then?

217
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,164
Excuse me?

218
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:37,008
Let me explain everything to you first.

219
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:48,228
Haneul House's architectural design is based on nature.

220
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:52,799
In terms of modern architecture, it's in the top 100 in the entire world.

221
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:57,696
It's incredibly secure, and no outsiders can enter.

222
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:00,657
Wow. So who lives there?

223
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:03,576
Chairman Kang's grandsons live there.

224
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,441
The Chairman's eldest grandson, Kang Hyeon Min, is a person...

225
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:12,460
who seeks to spread the incredible amount of love he's received to many people—

226
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,737
In other words, a total player.

227
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:23,071
The Chairman's second eldest grandson, Kang Ji Woon

228
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:26,166
is a person who challenges boundaries, and cannot be tamed by anyone—

229
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,268
In other words, a total thug.

230
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:34,850
The Chairman's youngest grandson, Kang Seo Woo

231
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,745
has all the qualities of a singer-songwriting star, and is unrivaled in—

232
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:40,680
In other words, a good-for-nothing.

233
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,478
These three cousins began residing in Haneul House last year.

234
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:52,416
And it's because of these punks that I'd like to make a proposition to you.

235
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:57,772
Make my grandsons into decent human beings.

236
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,416
What do you mean by that?

237
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,478
Do you want me to give them etiquette lessons, or something?

238
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:06,889
It could end up being something like that, yes.

239
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:11,945
Whoa. I thought that third-generation chaebol sons weren't taught etiquette on purpose,

240
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:15,807
for fear they might be too nice and give away all the money.

241
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:19,567
So I thought they were raised to be people with terrible personalities who only focus on money.

242
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:28,928
Really? Then, will you reform them, for me?

243
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,875
I've come up with a program to reform them.

244
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:39,238
All you have to do is carry out the missions I give you, for three months.

245
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,192
How could I possibly do that?

246
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:44,861
You can definitely do it.

247
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:47,555
If you'll do that for me, I'll pay for your college tuition

248
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:51,651
and even send you to study abroad. I'll give you anything you ask.

249
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:54,379
College?

250
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:58,691
What I'm saying is that I can change your life, Ms. Ha Won.

251
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,955
Okay?

252
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:14,782
You really had me excited for a second,

253
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:18,737
but I am not qualified to reform someone.

254
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:19,705
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:24,459
Thirty-Six Stratagems, Chapter 1, Section 5! Loot a burning house!

256
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:27,970
In other words, make sure you take ample advantage of every opportunity.

257
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,948
Don't you think that this may be that kind of opportunity?

258
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:32,375
Chapter 3, Section 14: Borrowing a corpse to resurrect the soul!

259
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,260
One should avoid opportunities that look hopeless.

260
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,062
And honestly, this does seem kind of hopeless.

261
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:38,565
Chapter 3, Section 18: Defeat the enemy by capturing their chief!

262
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,342
You don't know the outcome of a battle until it's over.

263
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:43,328
You'll have to see for yourself if this is

264
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:45,772
a hopeless venture or the opportunity of a lifetime, won't you?

265
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:49,226
Chapter 6, Section 36: If all fails, retreat!

266
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:52,678
I think that's the best teaching that suits my current situation.

267
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,990
Is there a need to go to such lengths for her?

268
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,037
For me, changing a person's life takes almost no effort whatsoever.

269
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:19,789
You're even prettier in person.

270
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,450
I don't really like such blatant flattery.

271
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,713
I really like this style of clothing.

272
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,060
You must really like women.

273
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:36,062
Everyone's talking about the rumor that you brought someone to the Chairman's wedding.

274
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:40,560
It's not a rumor. I guess you didn't do your research on me before coming.

275
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,478
Of course I did.

276
00:20:42,478 --> 00:20:46,355
But I didn't realize I'd get a glimpse of your infamous personality at a meeting like this.

277
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:49,578
Or is this a cleverly-crafted maneuver of yours?

278
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:54,791
Why would I bother to strategize when I'm just meeting a woman?

279
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:57,911
Why don't we just have a fun time today? Just the two of us.

280
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:01,297
I was told that I would be meeting with a business partner today.

281
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,567
I guess you're not that person.

282
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,660
Let's negotiate the terms of our agreement first.

283
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,375
You're here?

284
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,827
Hyeon Min.

285
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:49,112
I'd heard the rumors, but wow. You're really something else.

286
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,772
Looks like our negotiations fell through. I won't be seeing you again, I hope.

287
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:19,617
Sorry.

288
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:27,592
Kang Hyeon Min!

289
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:36,251
- What are you doing now?
- What are you talking about?

290
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:38,344
Don't use people for your own purposes.

291
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,480
And that's why I apologized.

292
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:43,199
Just what am I to you?

293
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:47,379
Someone I used to be friends with when I was young?

294
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:50,732
That's all I am to you?

295
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:52,658
What else would you be, then?

296
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,954
Are you going to bring up the past again?

297
00:22:57,847 --> 00:22:59,758
I know that you changed after that day, but—

298
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:05,780
Of course, someone would change after ten years.

299
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:10,777
That's true. I've changed too, after all.

300
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:15,581
But you know, this is the most repulsive I've seen you since you've changed.

301
00:23:18,185 --> 00:23:22,288
I still believe that some part of you from ten years ago

302
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:25,048
is buried in there, somewhere.

303
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:43,151
Sir, you left this behind yesterday.

304
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,170
I don't think this is...

305
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,290
No wait, it is.

306
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,375
Thank you.

307
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,366
Only for a moment, please.

308
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:18,052
I think my phone got switched, and I left something else behind.

309
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,416
Not just anyone can check into one of our suites.

310
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,245
I went up yesterday, so why can't I go up today?

311
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:31,449
You came here with another guest yesterday, right?

312
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:35,787
I guess you don't have anyone to pay for your room today.

313
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:36,788
What?

314
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:39,649
We may have made an exception since you were with a guest yesterday

315
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,509
but I cannot let you into the suite today.

316
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:44,679
- Please leave.
- Wait, Mister, just this once!

317
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:47,348
It really will only take a second! Please? Please!

318
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:49,817
Hey, Sweats!

319
00:24:57,592 --> 00:25:00,453
What are you doing here? Let's go.

320
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:06,459
Is there anyone who accidentally got their phone swapped?

321
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:11,840
What about a school uniform? Or a white bouquet of flowers?

322
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,801
I didn't see anything like that.

323
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:19,372
You didn't throw it out because it was a bit old and shabby did you?

324
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:22,850
Um, I'm not really sure.

325
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:37,481
Thanks. I'll definitely repay this debt to you.

326
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:43,788
Ask Kang Hyeon Min to buy you a new one. Isn't that why you're seeing him?

327
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:47,491
So he can buy you everything and anything you want?

328
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:50,979
Are you done?

329
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:53,607
The strategy that girls like you use is to act all proud

330
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,526
and then take all the handouts, isn't it?

331
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:01,180
I let you go that day because you're a girl.

332
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,308
But seriously, don't ever show yourself to me again

333
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,457
- Are you serious right now?
- Ow! Hey!

334
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:13,551
What? And what about guys like you, huh?

335
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:17,764
You act like you're so hot and just go around disregarding girls like nothing.

336
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,933
But you're a real jerk you know.

337
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:22,577
Why, that little!

338
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,683
You're the Nation's Jackpot Girl?

339
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:40,678
Why won't the owner of this phone pick up?

340
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,840
I SEOWOO U ❤︎

341
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,450
Only You ❤︎ Seo Woo

342
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:03,485
Wow, are you serious? That's awesome!

343
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:05,820
Are you living at Haneul House now, then?

344
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,314
No. I decided not to go.

345
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:12,577
Are you crazy? Do you know what kind of place that is?

346
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,030
That's where the Kang Cousins of Haneul Group live!

347
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,566
The one-percenters! The Royal Family of Korea!

348
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,444
You had a chance to live somewhere like that

349
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:23,813
but you rejected it to make coffee at a place like this?

350
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:27,667
To me, this sound is the same sound as money stacking up in my bank account!

351
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,278
I have to work hard at my part-time jobs!

352
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:35,651
Are you out of your mind? This is a chance for you to reset your sad life

353
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:38,661
so why wouldn't you go there?

354
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:42,165
That's why I didn't go. I may not be from a distinguished family

355
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:47,178
but I have some pride, you know. I'll protect my own life.

356
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,761
Today's concert was awesome, Kang Seo Woo!

357
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,722
- Can I have my phone, please?
- Okay.

358
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,641
Thank you.

359
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:14,055
What the heck? This isn't mine!

360
00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:16,867
- What?
- Let me borrow your phone.

361
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,276
Sure.

362
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:22,966
Twelve... 09, 09. Put that in.

363
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,910
The customer you have called ...

364
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,054
- Damn it, he's not answering.
- He's not answering?

365
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:32,457
Damn it, I have so many of my lyrics and demos in there!

366
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:36,770
Huh? Oh no! Your phone died!

367
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,066
I didn't bring my charger today! They didn't call from your phone?

368
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,985
This phone is dead, too!

369
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:47,055
Damn it, what if I never find my phone?

370
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:49,975
Thank you for tuning into the beauty show, "Love is Now!"

371
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:54,162
I'm your host, Kkongyang Yoo Na!

372
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:57,357
Ta-da!

373
00:28:57,357 --> 00:29:00,076
I even got myself on a TV show!

374
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:03,947
I guess it won't be long now until I become a celebrity!

375
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:09,828
All right, I'll start my beauty show now!

376
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:11,763
All right, everyone.

377
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:16,668
You all know that salmon is one of the 14 superfoods, right?

378
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:20,380
Now, we have a salmon product that you put on your skin!

379
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:25,850
Wow! It'll make your skin smooth, and

380
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,470
get rid of all your wrinkles! Try it!

381
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:32,934
I'm home.

382
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,721
Okay, now I'll teach you how you can make a mask at home...

383
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,173
You're the Nation's Jackpot Girl, right?

384
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:41,359
Um, who are you?

385
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,147
Wait, this isn't the girl you want! What are you doing?

386
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:47,674
Why are you filming her?

387
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:50,601
She's Kang Hyeon Min's fiancée!

388
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:53,796
So, how does it feel, now that you're the Nation's Jackpot Girl?

389
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:56,708
Um, it's not like that.

390
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:58,535
- Um...
- But...

391
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:03,464
- Get out! Right now!
- Wait, but...

392
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:07,511
I thought you came to film Yoo Na! What's all this, all of a sudden?

393
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:17,854
You're... the Nation's Jackpot Girl?

394
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:21,382
How the hell could you be Kang Hyeon Min's fiancee?

395
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:23,068
How did you even go to the wedding?

396
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,894
Something happened.

397
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:27,521
What happened, exactly?

398
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:34,028
I can't tell you, but I didn't go because I wanted to.

399
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:36,247
I'm being honest, Unni!

400
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,862
Stop acting so high and mighty, Eun Ha Won.

401
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,082
Isn't this what you wanted

402
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:49,669
to escape your shitty life by seducing some rich boy?

403
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:52,781
So why the hell do you keep going on about some damn "situation"?

404
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:55,517
There's nothing between us, really!

405
00:30:56,242 --> 00:31:00,480
And I don't want to use someone in order to change my life.

406
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:03,599
I'm not going to freeload off someone else's life.

407
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,463
Get out. Get out! Get the hell out!

408
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:09,673
Unni!

409
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:12,759
I thought you said that you weren't going to freeload off other people!

410
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:16,337
And yet, you keep leeching off our family!

411
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,257
But we are family.

412
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:27,131
I've never once considered you family.

413
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:33,471
Please, get the hell out of my life!

414
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:42,597
You know, Dad said he's coming back tomorrow.

415
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:44,357
You're really going to kick her out?

416
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,485
I don't know! Whatever!

417
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:51,656
Darn it. I don't even have other clothes to wear.

418
00:31:53,466 --> 00:31:55,026
I bet this will leave a stain.

419
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:10,642
Damn it, what am I supposed to do with this?

420
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:27,041
I still believe that some part of you from ten years ago

421
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,060
is buried in there, somewhere.

422
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:01,008
You've already been checked out.

423
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:11,568
- Then give me another room, please.
- Yes, sir.

424
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,133
This card is no longer valid.

425
00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:27,202
Mr. Kang Ji Woon. The Chairman wants you to return to Haneul House.

426
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:28,386
I'm not going.

427
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,981
Then, you won't be able to take< advantage of any of the benefits

428
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,024
that come with being affiliated with Haneul Group, either.

429
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,760
I can get by without that kind of stuff.

430
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:45,970
It seems that Mr. Ji Woon's wounds run quite deep.

431
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,581
And it seems like he can't get accustomed to Haneul House.

432
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:50,166
This may be impudent for me to say, sir,

433
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:54,629
but I believe that it will be difficult to get Mr. Ji Woon back to Haneul House.

434
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:57,140
That's why we have to get him back there as soon as possible.

435
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:02,495
I've already thought of a way.

436
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:35,470
Right this way.

437
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:38,415
- You're done here, right?
- Yeah.

438
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:41,368
There isn't a single customer in theater three. Let's go see a movie!

439
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:43,745
A movie and popcorn? Sounds awesome!

440
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:45,580
- I'll be right there!
- Okay!

441
00:34:55,498 --> 00:35:00,795
Damn it, I have to go. I have to leave now. Have fun!

442
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:02,672
How come?

443
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:07,553
Why should I run away, though? I didn't do anything wrong.

444
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:11,041
Oh my gosh, you surprised me!

445
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:14,268
Do you have any money?

446
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,584
Are you really a rich chaebol? If you are how could you not even have 10,000 won?

447
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:23,570
I think that's enough prying out of you.

448
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,064
So do you have money, or not? Just answer the question.

449
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:31,369
I do. Or I would if you'd actually paid your debt at the convenience store.

450
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:35,857
Wow! I have 5,000 won!

451
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:39,978
What an enormous amount of money you've got there.

452
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:45,742
Whatever, Sweats. Forget about it! Gosh!

453
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,777
Wow, your words and actions don't match, do they?

454
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,904
Was this all because you were hungry?

455
00:36:57,904 --> 00:37:01,224
Just wait a bit. I'll get changed and come right out.

456
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:04,752
I can take care of everything with just this!

457
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:15,080
My debt to you for helping me out
at the hotel is repaid now, okay?

458
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,107
Don't even think about saying that I still owe you later, okay?

459
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:21,177
My help to you was only worth 1,500 won?

460
00:37:21,945 --> 00:37:24,255
What about the cost of the cheese? With that, it's 2,500 won!

461
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,549
I'm the one who taught you that it tastes better with cheese in it!

462
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:29,669
I already knew about that, okay? I just forgot for a second!

463
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:32,280
What, so you're going to disregard that extra 1,000 won I paid?

464
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,150
Hey, give me back the cheese. Hurry up and give it back!

465
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,177
Give it back! Don't you dare eat it!

466
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:40,596
You know how gross it tastes without cheese? Give it back!

467
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:48,972
Hey, I'm sorry. I won't bother you while you're eating anymore. Eat up.

468
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:52,450
You said you were hungry, right? Hurry and eat up!

469
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:03,277
So he ate and ran, huh?

470
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:08,266
I lose my phone and get kicked out of my house.

471
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,177
What's with today? Seriously.

472
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:15,073
Can I charge this just for a bit?

473
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:19,527
If the boss finds out, we'll be in huge trouble! You know how he is.

474
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,057
Can you lend me your phone, then?

475
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:28,303
I'm sure you realize that it'll be of no use to cut me off financially.

476
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:34,768
I can do much worse if it will get you to come back home.

477
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:40,941
There'll be no reason to go back to that house.

478
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:44,444
- Come back, already.
- I said no.

479
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:50,024
All I want is for things to go back to the way they were.

480
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:53,411
You do realize what that means, right?

481
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:58,841
Everything you think is yours can disappear in an instant.

482
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:03,412
That's the kind of power I wield. And it'll soon be yours, too.

483
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:06,582
I don't need that kind of power.

484
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:13,014
Stop clinging onto me. I'm going to live as Han Ji Woon now.

485
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,257
Let's go.

486
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:27,411
Will it be all right to leave him alone like that?

487
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:34,385
It'll be fine. He'll come back on his own soon.

488
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:40,325
- Um, who is this?
- I'm the owner of that phone.

489
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:42,886
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

490
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:45,988
I was waiting for your call for a really long time, too!

491
00:39:45,988 --> 00:39:48,958
At any rate, I couldn't read any of my messages because of you today!

492
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:51,978
- Oh, you keep getting texts.
- Really?

493
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:55,849
That might be from someone at home! Can you unlock my phone?

494
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,651
- What?
- First, I'll tell you the pattern.

495
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:01,463
Start where 5 would be on the keypad, and then 7-2-9-4-3-8-6-1.

496
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,548
Wait, so how do I unlock your phone?

497
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:06,876
Just move your finger toward where those numbers would be on the keypad.

498
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:11,063
Why is it so complicated? Are you a celebrity, or something?

499
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:17,553
Come on, try doing it slowly! Five7-2-9-4-3-8-6-1!

500
00:40:19,322 --> 00:40:22,567
Oh, it worked! I did it!

501
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,244
Really? Who texted me?

502
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:29,165
Just a moment. Um... it's from "Unni Yoo Na..."

503
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:31,359
What did she say?

504
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:34,796
Hurry up and tell me!

505
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:44,789
Oh, she says that... um... you'll be eating dinner together tomorrow.

506
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,082
And that your father's coming home tomorrow.

507
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:47,792
Really? She really said that Dad's coming home?

508
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:50,519
She asked me to have dinner with them?

509
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,664
You bitch! Just eat dinner and leave

510
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:55,258
- Yes.
- Wow, thank you!

511
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:57,443
But, um, where are you right now?

512
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:01,672
Um, excuse me.

513
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:04,325
I came here to get my phone back.

514
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:10,465
What, is he a celebrity or something?

515
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:19,766
Kang Hyeon Min's fiancee?

516
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:26,806
Delete these messages?

517
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:38,209
Huh? Where did my texts go? I thought you said that I got texts.

518
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,915
Oh, that? I accidentally deleted them.

519
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:45,275
What?

520
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:48,170
Anyway, they were telling you to have dinner with them tomorrow.

521
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:51,573
Did they really tell me to come home?

522
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,551
And she really said that Dad's coming?

523
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:56,452
Yeah!

524
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:02,533
Thanks for finding my phone for me. I'd better get going.

525
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:03,960
Bye.

526
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,660
Gosh, why do I feel so uneasy about this?

527
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,832
I heard that you're coming home tomorrow...

528
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:30,712
Why didn't you contact me at all?

529
00:42:38,028 --> 00:42:39,962
See you tomorrow.

530
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:58,289
Does she really work here? How many hours have we been waiting for already?

531
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,058
It's the Nation's Lottery Girl!

532
00:43:00,058 --> 00:43:03,954
- Ms. Eun Ha Won!
- Is it really you?

533
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:05,872
Are you really Ms. Eun Ha Won?

534
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:07,874
Is it true you're engaged to Mr. Kang Hyeon Min of Haneul Group?

535
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,376
How did you two meet?

536
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:12,954
Um, I don't have any relationship with that man!

537
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:15,182
I'm sorry! Please leave! I'm sorry!

538
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:19,202
- Please, just one comment!
- How did you two meet?

539
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:21,446
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

540
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:31,414
Let's go.

541
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:38,146
- How did you two meet?
- Since when have you been dating?

542
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:42,367
- Please, just one comment!
- How did you meet?

543
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:46,445
- Where are you going?
- Ms. Eun Ha Won?

544
00:43:55,563 --> 00:43:58,091
Hey, I'm totally awesome, right?

545
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,212
You got the nickname, "Nation's Jackpot Girl" after you met me.

546
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:05,307
And you even got yourself a man who'd save you under such circumstances.

547
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,618
Do you not realize the gravity of the situation here?

548
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:11,079
Gravity of the situation? You mean how I saved you?

549
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,058
Just look how serious things have gotten because of your stupid lie!

550
00:44:17,736 --> 00:44:21,222
Go and tell the reporters that we're not in a relationship.

551
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:25,359
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.

552
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,071
Fine. All right. Just give me five minutes, then.

553
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,957
I'll make your name disappear from the internet.

554
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:35,061
What, are you some kind of a genius hacker or a magician or something?

555
00:44:35,061 --> 00:44:37,488
How could you possibly do that?

556
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:39,782
Why can't you trust me?

557
00:44:44,404 --> 00:44:48,124
Hey, is this Joon Myeong? It's me, Kang Hyeon Min.

558
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,370
Isn't this a bit beneath you guys, as the number one portal site in Korea?

559
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,031
The news about my fiancee is plastered everywhere.

560
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:58,326
This is clearly defamation and libel

561
00:44:58,326 --> 00:45:03,398
and it could really harm one's freedom and dignity!

562
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:05,825
For the sake of social justice, you shouldn't be doing this.

563
00:45:06,651 --> 00:45:09,887
Do you want me to spell it out in a way you'll understand?

564
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,000
I'll pull all our ads off your site!

565
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:20,273
Take down everything that pertains to "Kang Hyeon Min's fiancee" immediately.

566
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:25,295
You totally fell for me just now, right? You did, right?

567
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:27,681
You wouldn't be human if you didn't fall for me after that!

568
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:31,259
Wow. Even I'm stunned by how cool I just was.

569
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:34,871
- How could this happen?
- Of course, it couldn't, for most people.

570
00:45:34,871 --> 00:45:37,857
Honestly, even I think I was really amazing this time.

571
00:45:37,857 --> 00:45:43,388
What is this? Are these goosebumps? Look, look! Do you see my goosebumps?

572
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:45,940
I heard you could control portal sites if you had enough money

573
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,451
but that was actually true?

574
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:52,455
I trusted my online sources so much! I can't believe this... seriously?

575
00:45:53,448 --> 00:45:55,099
Seriously, I can't believe this.

576
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:57,878
How could you be thinking about something like that at a time like this?

577
00:45:58,853 --> 00:45:59,980
What?

578
00:46:02,207 --> 00:46:05,752
I just thought of one thing that money can't buy.

579
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:10,248
- What?
- Your smile.

580
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:18,356
That's none of your business! Anyway, thanks for getting the photos taken down.

581
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:32,870
Hello?

582
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:37,967
What? My father took my mother's urn?

583
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:41,729
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm here!

584
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:49,913
What? Did something happen?

585
00:46:52,198 --> 00:46:53,625
Get out of here.

586
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:58,071
- Clean this up, you guys.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:01,733
Hyung, what's going on?

588
00:47:06,696 --> 00:47:13,352
Don't ask any questions, and just leave.

589
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:27,467
I'll come back next time.

590
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:35,825
Ji Woon.

591
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:41,840
This is the money that the boss saved up.

592
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,651
I'm really sorry, but please don't come back.

593
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:47,904
What?

594
00:47:47,904 --> 00:47:51,891
We promised your grandfather that we'd never see you again

595
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:56,329
and that we'd act as if we never knew you.

596
00:47:59,307 --> 00:48:02,101
He gave us enough money for us to make that kind of promise!

597
00:48:04,145 --> 00:48:06,256
That Haneul Group sure is powerful.

598
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:12,287
I guess changing someone's life is child's play for them.

599
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:18,476
That's good, then.

600
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:20,787
What?

601
00:48:20,787 --> 00:48:25,149
Of course, you should've gotten that much money when you sold me out.

602
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:32,206
It's fine.

603
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,748
I'm sorry!

604
00:49:01,528 --> 00:49:06,466
Is this the power that Grandfather was talking about?

605
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:11,146
The power to buy people?

606
00:49:11,146 --> 00:49:19,145
He could erase everything that you hold dear if he wanted to.

607
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:23,975
Wow, he truly is an amazing person.

608
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:27,387
There's no such person as Han Ji Woon in this world.

609
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:35,261
There's only Kang Ji Woon now.

610
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:39,666
I told you, I'm Han Ji Woon.

611
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:45,063
You'll no longer be able live as you please, either.

612
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,372
Hey, the heiress to K Group is going around

613
00:49:54,372 --> 00:49:56,983
and trying to make sure you can't do business with other people anymore!

614
00:49:56,983 --> 00:49:58,660
Whatever.

615
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,511
You sure are carefree.

616
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,490
Arranged marriages are pretty much a given for people like us.

617
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,376
It won't be much help to you if you can't get a suitable wife.

618
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:12,565
What if you end up jeopardizing your position as the heir by doing this?

619
00:50:12,565 --> 00:50:15,193
- What?
- Well, yeah.

620
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:17,445
Kang Seo Woo lives at Haneul House now,

621
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:21,416
and Kang Ji Woon came out of nowhere, too, and is apparently related to you.

622
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,776
You're competing against a lot of people!

623
00:50:40,026 --> 00:50:41,719
One month's worth, please.

624
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:48,752
Citizen ID Card: Kang Ji Woon

625
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:06,461
Then, she's not really Hyeon Min's fiancee?

626
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:09,580
I think she only acted like she was for money.

627
00:51:11,049 --> 00:51:13,159
What an impudent child.

628
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:21,159
I told her to go and live at Haneul House with my grandsons.

629
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:28,274
What is it about that girl that you like so much?

630
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:35,673
Even though I'm rich, I often wonder who's really in charge: me, or the money.

631
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:39,561
And yet, she didn't lose her resolve at the sight of money.

632
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:44,290
I think she's more than worthy to keep around the boys.

633
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:46,768
Yeah?

634
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,368
Yes, so how did it go?

635
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:57,837
I've solved the issue regarding Ji Woon.

636
00:51:57,837 --> 00:51:59,281
And what about the girl?

637
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:01,132
I've assigned someone to watch over her.

638
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:05,294
But I don't think she'll change her mind.

639
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:10,266
I don't think she has any intention of agreeing to your deal.

640
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:15,137
As to be expected. But I definitely can't lose her.

641
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:28,175
Oh my, our Ha Won is here!

642
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:32,463
Little Sis! Come and have dinner.

643
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:35,666
Where's Mom?

644
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,519
Your mom's right here, Sweetie.

645
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:44,909
I heard that you took my mom's urn!

646
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:48,771
Your mother's right here, so who the hell are you looking for?

647
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:50,848
Oh, I'm okay, Honey.

648
00:53:28,136 --> 00:53:30,513
How could you do this?

649
00:53:32,307 --> 00:53:36,136
I heard that you never paid the columbarium fees!

650
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:39,789
They said that we owed them five million won, so I paid four million won!

651
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:42,884
If you had just paid the rest, I could have let Mom rest in peace!

652
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:46,988
Why should I have to use so much money on a dead person?

653
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,325
She was your wife.

654
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:53,253
It's not like those ashes are a big deal!

655
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:56,273
In the olden days, we'd just scatter them in a river or the ocean!

656
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:58,066
Stop making a big deal over nothing.

657
00:53:58,066 --> 00:54:01,661
Mom lost her final resting place and she was just cast aside like this

658
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:03,955
so how can I just stay still and do nothing?

659
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:05,648
How dare you do this

660
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:09,786
in front of your stepmother, who raised you with so much care?

661
00:54:10,537 --> 00:54:13,890
Way to go, clutching your dead mom like that. Great job.

662
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:20,897
Honey, I told you, I'm fine. I'll also try to get some money for that.

663
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:25,676
I have some money I saved to send Yoo Na and Ha Won to college.

664
00:54:27,904 --> 00:54:31,266
You told me that you could only send one of us to college.

665
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:37,146
Ha Won. I know you're angry, but you shouldn't lie like that!

666
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:41,584
Also, where are my belongings that were on the balcony?

667
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,147
You just shoved all my stuff wherever last time, too, because Dad was coming.

668
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:49,375
I had to look for a really long time because the photos of my mom disappeared!

669
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,094
What are you talking about?

670
00:54:51,094 --> 00:54:53,579
Your belongings are in your room, of course!

671
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,207
The room that you share with Yoo Na!

672
00:54:57,434 --> 00:54:59,885
No, my room is that balcony.

673
00:55:02,197 --> 00:55:04,666
Are you trying to make me look like the bad guy on purpose?

674
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:07,311
No! I'm just stating the facts!

675
00:55:07,311 --> 00:55:11,689
Stop it! How dare you speak that way to your mother!

676
00:55:12,424 --> 00:55:14,884
You don't even appreciate her kindness for raising you all these years!

677
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:16,978
And now you're trying to make her seem like a liar?

678
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:20,848
You don't believe me at all, do you?

679
00:55:28,064 --> 00:55:31,225
I never should have gone and raised someone else's child.

680
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:41,761
What are you talking about?

681
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:46,390
Your mom had you with another man!

682
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:57,869
So, I'm not really your daughter?

683
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:00,872
I wanted to believe that you were my real daughter.

684
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:07,462
Wait, Honey. What do you mean by that?

685
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:11,808
What, you're not related to Dad at all?

686
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:15,845
So I guess we weren't really family after all.

687
00:56:26,331 --> 00:56:31,452
Where are you going? Your father only said that because he was upset.

688
00:56:33,113 --> 00:56:37,725
That's right. Everything will be fine once you're gone.

Thirty-Six Stratagems, Chapter 1, Section 4.
