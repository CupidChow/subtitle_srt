Huh?

37
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:33,470
How could you date my Seo Woo without saying a word about it to me?

38
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,597
Um...

42
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,930
No, this isn't true.

43
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,974
It's really not true!

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,166
Wow, I guess you and Kang Seo Woo are really close.

45
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,186
Those pictures really emphasized that.

46
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,704
Are you going to be like this, too?

47
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,332
You two look like lovebirds in that photo!

48
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:32,512
That's not what's important right now. I have a favor to ask you.

49
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,674
You have to keep the fact that we're dating a secret, no matter what.

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,388
We're not the one with the dating scandal, it's you and Kang Seo Woo!

51
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,348
You have to explain to me what was going on there, first!

52
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,209
I told you! It's not even worth explaining!

53
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,397
Here. You've promised me that you'll keep this a secret, okay?

54
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,357
You have to keep this a secret, no matter what! Okay?

55
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,192
Especially from the Chairman.

56
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,069
Whatever.

57
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,031
You have to keep it a secret!

58
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,129
Have a seat.

59
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,388
What have you been going around doing, exactly?

60
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,099
Why was this scandal with you, and not Hyeon Min?

61
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:31,029
I told you already, Grandfather! That was nonsense before. None of this is true!

62
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,407
Yes, Chairman. This is really just a misunderstanding.

63
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,778
Have you two plotted together in order to deceive me?

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,530
- Um, no...
- Grandfather.

65
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,095
Come on. They're both saying that it's not true.

66
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:50,015
Yeah! Why can't you trust us?

67
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:53,243
There's seriously nothing going on between us!

68
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:57,256
Chairman. I'm definitely not dating Seo Woo.

69
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,007
No way.

70
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,052
You're really overdoing it, Grandfather!

71
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,955
This is all just a misunderstanding because of those one-sided articles!

72
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,392
There hasn't been anything happening here, right?

73
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,586
Yes, sir. Nothing at all.

74
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,046
That's a relief, then.

75
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,925
This can potentially be the last

76
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,377
time that we see Ms. Ha Won

77
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:21,112
based on what you say now, Seo Woo.

78
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,118
There's really nothing going on between you two, right?

79
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,880
I told you... wait.

80
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,582
Why would it be the last time that we see her?

81
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,285
That was our agreement when I allowed her to live here.

82
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:38,046
If she breaks the "no dating" rule...

83
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,324
she has to leave.

84
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,735
Furthermore, she would be forbidden from ever meeting

85
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:46,279
the people that live here, ever again.

86
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,881
Hey, you're not going to park?

87
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,041
We're already here.

88
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,493
Hey, don't you know that the driving laws have changed?

89
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:19,771
You can't drive while drunk in parking lots, either!

90
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,740
You can park this car tomorrow, then.

91
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:29,472
You did what you wanted today but don't act like this from now on.

92
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,829
Why is she walking so well?

93
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,944
Contract

94
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,756
So basically, Grandfather is just doing whatever he pleases.

95
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,468
Isn't this going overboard? What's so wrong about dating her?

96
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,669
You can't!

97
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,397
I didn't bring her here so you could date her.

98
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,701
Don't misunderstand the situation just because she lives here.

99
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,636
Misunderstand what?

100
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,273
Just because she lives here with all of you

101
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,025
doesn't mean that she's the same as us.

102
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,394
You haven't been thinking that have you?

103
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,357
Grandfather! You're being too harsh.

104
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,214
This is nothing for someone like him, who buys people with money.

105
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,133
Family members are just a part of the business for him.

106
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,804
So it'd be terrible for him if we were to date someone he didn't deem fit.

107
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,345
Hey, School Uniform!

108
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,343
Seo Woo.

109
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,662
You know...

110
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:04,960
other fans might be opposed to you dating someone.

111
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,745
But not me.

112
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:11,725
Also, my Ha Won has been through quite a lot.

113
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,277
So...

114
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,938
Why are you acting like this?

115
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:25,088
You know, my Ha Won goes crazy for deals and discounts.

116
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:28,158
She grew up really poor, you see.

117
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,953
And she clips coupons and goes to flash sales like no other.

118
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,806
Also, she acts before she thinks, so she can be a bit violent.

119
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,062
If she happens to lash out at you, just accept the beating.

120
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,063
That will probably be best for you.

121
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,841
And you can never eat something by yourself, when you're with her.

122
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:48,970
And if there's a great group deal, you have to let her know about it.

123
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,073
You just accepted all that as fact?

124
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,251
What?

125
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,586
You saw that article too, didn't you?

126
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,198
There's nothing going on between Ha Won and me.

127
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,959
That article was all wrong.

128
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,902
Really?

129
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:05,379
An article refuting those claims will be out soon.

130
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,590
Oh, what a relief!

131
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:10,817
You didn't come all the way here just because of that, did you?

132
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,053
Yes, I did!

133
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,382
I'll be going, then.

134
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,151
Ji Woon.

135
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,084
Hey.

136
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,715
Kang Ji Woon!

137
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:54,611
How could you agree to some ridiculous contract like that?

138
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:59,215
So you're never going to see me again if we get caught dating?

139
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,860
No, that's...

140
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,539
Hey, I didn't know that things would end up like this between us!

141
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,043
Are you angry because of the contract?

142
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,779
You really do have a gift for making me worry.

143
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,550
I only want to focus on our relationship right now!

144
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,278
But the situation keeps on getting twisted, because of contracts and rules!

145
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,415
All thanks to a certain someone.

146
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:27,711
What am I supposed to do? Things just turned out this way.

147
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:33,241
Do you really think you'd be okay never seeing me again?

148
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,977
You don't, right?

149
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:38,463
So hurry up and get that contract terminated.

150
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,534
I don't even know if you actually even want to date me or not.

151
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:46,287
How could a girl just go around signing contracts so carelessly?

152
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:52,277
Come on. When I first came here, you and Hyeon Min drove me insane!

153
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,579
How could I have even think about possibly dating you when you were so mean?

154
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:59,184
Oh, I see. So that's why you were leaning on Kang Seo Woo?

155
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:03,455
Yeah. After all, he treated me like a human being, unlike you two.

156
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,050
So? Are you saying that this is all my fault, now?

157
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,462
What about you, then? There's really nothing going on between you and Hye Ji?

158
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,606
You two even went on a date.

159
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,199
That's not true.

160
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,950
Did you even think about how I might've felt seeing you and Hye Ji together, all this time?

161
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:20,456

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,180
Here. Have both of the drumsticks. I'll be generous.

324
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,306
Wow!

325
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,151
Thanks!

326
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,654
Wow, this is so good!

327
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:30,657
I wonder why it tastes so good? Wow!

328
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:44,338
Yes, hello?

329
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:47,925
When are you going to pay me for finding Kang Yeong Jin for you?

330
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,687
Excuse me? What do you mean?

331
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:54,348
I sent you a text before with his information!

332
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:56,266
Were you not able to meet him?

333
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:59,827
Your wife took his contact info, though!

334
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:05,725
Are you sure it's Kang Yeong Jin?

335
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:08,078
Where is that punk now?

336
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,984
Kang Yeong Jin!

337
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:28,106
Did you meet with Ha Won?

338
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:33,512
How was your father-daughter reunion after so long?

339
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:38,684
Do you really think that Ha Won is my daughter?

340
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:42,354
Why do you keep wasting your time with such nonsense?

341
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:43,647
What?

342
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,342
There was nothing going on between me and Ok Seon!

343
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:48,443
Don't you dare lie to me!

344
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:54,449
You two fell head over heels for one another while I was away working!

345
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,144
The only thing that the either of us were good at was exercising

346
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:59,621
which is why we opened a taekwondo center together! That's it!

347
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:03,317
Why did Ha Won's mother die at your apartment, then?

348
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:06,195
She was at my house because of an issue related to the center, and--

349
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:09,156
You two were trying to run away together, but Ha Won's mom died

350
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:10,882
so you ran away by yourself. Isn't that what happened?

351
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:16,597
Geez. You know better than I do that Ok Seon wasn't that kind of person!

352
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:21,793
I know all about the fact that you put the center up for sale, too.

353
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:28,400
Yes. I sold it without telling Ok Seon.

354
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:32,988
I was being chased by debt collectors, and I went a bit crazy for a second

355
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:35,324
which is why I sold the center!

356
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:38,327
Ok Seon found out about that, and came to see me.

357
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,579
And then... she died.

358
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,831
What... did you say?

359
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,958
I really do deserve to die.

360
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:50,464
But I feel even worse toward Ok Seon, who died because of that.

361
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:58,012
I came home to run away from the debt collectors.

362
00:25:58,012 --> 00:26:00,541
But the house was already in flames when I arrived.

363
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:05,020
Ok Seon was trying to rescue the woman, next door, and didn't get out in time.

364
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:08,741
Apparently, the ring that Ok Seon was holding was from the woman next door

365
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,943
Who asked it be given to her own son, but...

366
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,364
Are you going to continue to doubt that poor woman

367
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:18,925
who died while trying to save someone else's life?

368
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:24,456
I didn't even know that, and hated Ok Seon.

369
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,943
And I even hated poor Ha Won...

370
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:35,260
who treasured that ring as her mother's keepsake!

371
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:14,506
What's the matter, child? Do you have a sore throat?

372
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,442
Oh, it's nothing like that.

373
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,559
Meet me in the storage room!

374
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:43,543
Why did you get here so late? Didn't you hear my cue?

375
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,687
You call that noise a proper cue?

376
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:48,498
Yeah! That means, "see me now!"

377
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,243
Just text me.

378
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,253
That's no fun at all!

379
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:55,972
Look at the mess we're in because of my grandfather.

380
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:58,600
We have to hide away like this.

381
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,010
Why do you hate your grandfather so much?

382
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,793
You know...

383
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:13,231
my mom was a really ordinary woman.

384
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,195
Ordinary enough to make someone wonder how she even met someone like my dad.

385
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:23,567
Seeing as how she never talked about my dad to me...

386
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,478
it's clear that they didn't part on good terms.

387
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:33,168
I came to Haneul House because I had a lot of questions.

388
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,381
That's more of a reason to not hide away in a place like this

389
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,882
and ask the Chairman your questions.

390
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,550
Isn't that right?

391
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:45,722
I saw a trace of my father for the first time, here.

392
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,071
My dad's name is carved into this.

393
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,717
I think he used this, a long time ago.

394
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:01,971
But only the camera is here.

395
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:03,782
There aren't any photos.

396
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,969
All right, then. Let's report this to him.

397
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:08,996
Huh?

398
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,891
Let's report to your dad that we like each other!

399
00:29:12,891 --> 00:29:16,853
All right. Reporting time!

400
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:19,764
There we go.

401
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,802
Dad

402
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,139
Dad?

403
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,175
There we go.

404
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:52,230
It's a mess in there, isn't it? And it smells like gas, too, doesn't it?

405
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:55,458
I like that, since that's what you smell like.

406
00:29:57,236 --> 00:30:01,965
You seemed so cool, driving around in a huge truck like this one.

407
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:05,928
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:09,932
I misunderstood something greatly this whole time.

409
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,436
I trusted Mom.

410
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:19,174
Yes, you were a better person than I was.

411
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:22,619
I should've trusted your mom, too.

412
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:25,797
You trusted Mom too, Dad.

413
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:34,164
I thought about why you never got us tested, kept on searching for Mr. Young Jin

414
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:40,629
even when you said that I wasn't really your daughter.

415
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:47,210
You felt bad that you couldn't be by Mom's side back then

416
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:51,123
when she was going through all that.

417
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,308
Isn't that right?

418
00:30:54,393 --> 00:31:00,782
And so you wanted to find Mr. Young Jin and ask for forgiveness, right?

419
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,129
I'm sorry.

420
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:10,408
To both you... and your mother.

421
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:14,621
Your mother... she...

422
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,794
Don't be sorry, Dad.

423
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,506
Let's go back home now, Dad.

424
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:32,297
I didn't know how much your stepmother and Yoo Na had been harassing you.

425
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:37,519
It'll be hard for you if you come back home now.

426
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:42,424
But she's someone I chose. I can't cast her aside now.

427
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:44,442
You understand what I'm saying, right?

428
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:51,950
So... give me some time.

429
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:59,082
I'll make it so that our family can be a real family.

430
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,878
I still have some work left to do, too.

431
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:09,176
Oh! You're home, Honey?

432
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,596
Honey. Did you meet Kang Yeong Jin?

433
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:16,433
Well, um...

434
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,736
Did you meet him, or not?

435
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,954
I... did meet with him.

436
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:24,583
It seemed like you were trying to find Ha Won's real father

437
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,169
so it'd be good for everyone if we did that for her, right?

438
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,255
I was just trying to get money from him, as compensation for raising her--

439
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,598
Park Soo Gyeong!

440
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:33,867
Y-yes?

441
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:36,987
Ha Won isn't that man's daughter.

442
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:38,863
She's my daughter!

443
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:45,170
Honey. And you, Yoo Na!

444
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,738
Yes, Dad?

445
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:50,008
How have you been treating Ha Won all this time?

446
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:53,453
Tell me, right now!

447
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:56,348
I'm so sorry, Honey.

448
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:03,563
I'm sorry, Dad. 'm sorry!

449
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:13,198
Mom... I'm cold.

450
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:16,243
I'm cold, too.

451
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:22,541
Why do I keep getting kicked out of places lately?

452
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,420
How did Eun Ha Won manage to sleep here?

453
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:31,958
She has a lot of extra fat, so she can bear cold temperatures better than us!

454
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:36,287
Mom... what if we end up getting kicked out?

455
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:42,060
I don't know! What do we do?

456
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:50,769

Wow, this is awesome!

465
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,874
What about mine?

466
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:24,361
Oh... this is Hye Ji, my little sister.

467
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:30,042
I gave Jeong Hyeon a present because it's his birthday.

468

Me too! It's my birthday today, too!

Where are you going?

478
00:35:27,457 --> 00:35:29,459
I have a lot of plans today.

479
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,869
Did the Chairman tell you to keep an eye on me?

480
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:08,882
I wonder what I did wrong.

481
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,586
Why does he keep doubting me?

482
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,040
I don't know why either.

483
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:25,657
Do you think that I'm cheating on the Chairman, too?

484
00:36:25,657 --> 00:36:29,519
It's not my place to make that kind of judgment.

485
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,970
We're here. You can get out.

486
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,852
Can't we have a meal together?

487
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,291
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,844
I didn't have the right to have you buy me a meal with your first paycheck.

489
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:08,391
But I really wanted to buy you a tie if you got a job somewhere.

490
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:13,663
I know it's quite overdue, but will you accept it?

491
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,533
Yes, hello.

492
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,376
Please, take a seat.

493
00:37:55,547 --> 00:37:59,326
I'm trying to find a room.

494
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,535
For rent?

495
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:02,529
Um, yes.

496
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,831
How much can you afford to pay in terms of a security deposit?

497
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,627
Is there a place I can move into without paying a security deposit?

498
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:14,249
Well, you'll have to look into basement rooms, or a student hostel.

499
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:15,634
A... student hostel?

500
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:18,128
It wouldn't be the best place for a young lady to live by herself, but...

501
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:21,715
Oh, just a moment. Let me take a look here.

502
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:26,720
Hope Student Hostel

503
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,208
- Please give me a call, then.
- Yes, I will.

504
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,254
Yeah?

505
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:45,489
Where are you?

506
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:49,776
Why do you care where I am?

507
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:51,912
It's your birthday today.

508
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah. So I'm meeting up with some friends today.

509
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,127
So can we hang up already?

510
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:26,529
What a great age to be.

511
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,912
Hey, you! I'm going to kill you!

512
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,844
You go in first.

513
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:52,264
No. You go in first.

514
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:55,951
Okay. I'll head in first, so come inside soon!

515
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:57,619
Okay?

516
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:06,236
Hey, shush!

517
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,611
What are you doing?

518
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,038
What?

519
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,919
This sure feels nice.

520
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,147
Yeah, it does.

521
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:37,726
What are you doing?

522
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,236
Oh, hey!

523
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:44,082
Oh, you know. I feel really cramped.

524
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:45,634
So I'm trying to stretch a little.

525
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,135
Finish whatever you're doing, then.

526
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:50,113
Hey! Wait.

527
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,408
My shoulders feel as stiff as an old man's. Can you massage it for me?

528
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,802
Oh please. At your age?

529
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,664
Come on, I'm being serious! My shoulders really hurt!

530
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,698
Don't you know that young people these days get shoulder problems, too?

531
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:03,443
It's probably because I play the guitar so much. Please?

532
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,966
Your shoulders don't feel stiff at all, though.

533
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,108
- Oh, really?
- Wait, you have a knot here.

534
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,385
Right there? Yeah, right there!

535
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,727
Those are the terms we agreed to when I allowed Ms. Ha Won to live here.

536
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,182
If she breaks the no-dating clause, she'll have to leave.

537
00:41:34,683 --> 00:41:38,996
Furthermore, she can never meet with the people living here again.

538
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:52,467
Wow, that smells nice!

539
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,553
Want me to make you a cup, too?

540
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,846
Yeah!

541
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,441
Did something good happen to you recently?

542
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:09,985
Me?

543
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:14,365
Um, well... no. Not really. Why?

544
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:22,331
Really? No reason. You just seem to be smiling more than usual.

545
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:25,584
Oh. Am I?

546
00:42:28,737 --> 00:42:30,547
But, um...

547
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,300
You get a lot of gifts from your female fans, right?

548
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,427
Gifts?

549
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:41,283
Yeah, so, um... a friend of a friend is dating for the first time.

550
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:46,146
She wants to get her boyfriend a gift, but doesn't know what to get.

551
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,358
Oh.

552
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:54,446
Well... is there anything special that she could get him?

553
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,876
Men don't really need things like gifts.

554
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,970
What?

555
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:06,124
Just being with him and smiling with him will be enough.

556
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,461
Just like you are, right now.

557
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:15,300
There you go again, writing lyrics to another love song.

558
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,357
Hello, Chairman.

559
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,777
Could you come see me, Ms. Ha Won?

560
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,960
Why isn't she back yet?

561
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:06,860
Thanks for everything! And I'm sorry.

562
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,440
I really wanted to say this to you.

I'm quite disappointed in you, Ms. Ha Won.

00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,900
I trusted you. And yet you lied to my face.

581
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:33,463
I... I apologize, Chairman.

582
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,109
What will you do now?

583
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:43,640
Well, I'll give you some choices, then.

584
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,911
Choices?

585
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:53,592
Which will you choose: your future, or Ji Woon?

586
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,945
Chairman.

587
00:45:56,945 --> 00:46:03,060
Forget about Ji Woon, me,

588
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,470
and the time you spent in Haneul House, and leave.

589
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:15,522
If you do, I'll give you all of the support I promised you before.

590
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,452
I'll pay for your college tuition, and pay you for your services.

591
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,671
You can have it all.

592
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:26,699
However, you can't have Ji Woon.

593
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,706
I'm sure you'll want to continue seeing Ji Woon in secret.

594
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,335
It's not like it would be impossible to do that.

595
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:42,774
Will you choose some unpredictable love that may not even last?

596
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:49,189
How long did you think you can continue seeing him?

597
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:52,584
A few months? A few years?

598

It was difficult serving you, but I thank you for the opportunity.

Hurry up and leave.

612

You're being too cruel.

613

How could you do this to my father, who's only served you his whole life?

614
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,048
What did I even do wrong?

615
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,318
Your existence in itself was a mistake.

616

You kicked out Jeong Soon's family?

620
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:19,356
Stop overreacting. The other workers are watching.

621
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,909
They probably don't even have a place to go!

622
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,320
Why did you do this without even telling me?

623
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,615
You know the reason why better than anyone else.

624

I love Jeong Soon!

625

It didn't seem like she felt the same way about you

626
00:49:37,115 --> 00:49:39,642
judging from the fact that she accepted my money and left.

627
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,190
This is why I told you to be wary of people like her.

628
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:50,337
This is why I told you not to be affectionate towards people like her.

629
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:55,473
Don't you know that you're more of a coward for playing with people's hearts with that damned money of yours?

♫  Even if everything disappears over time ♫

641
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,111
So basically, grandfather is just doing whatever he pleases.

642
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,250
This is nothing for someone like him, who buys people with money.

643
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:55,410
♫  You’re my everything ♫

644
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:59,890
♫  I love only you. ♫

645
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,359
What are you doing?

646
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,490
Can't you tell?

647
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,018
What the hell are you doing?

648
00:51:20,018 --> 00:51:22,729
Go away. My friends will be here soon.

649
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,515
Your friends? Who, exactly?

650
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,433
Mind your own business.

651
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:37,261
This is the perfect place for us to say farewell forever.

652
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:54,344
Open it.

653
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,961
Will you marry me?

654
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:13,780
Well, I don't know.

655
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,949
Are you really going to be like this?

656
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:17,551
In ten years.

657
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,078
I'll answer you in ten years or so.

658
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:30,314
I'll give you my answer to your proposal from ten years ago.

659
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,292
My answer is no.

660
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:38,955
Things won't work out between us.

661
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,490
Fine, but...

662
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,368
go back to Haneul House.

663
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,930
If you feel uncomfortable there, I'll leave.

664
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,667
So don't go around doing stupid things, and go back.

665
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,745
Seriously, mind your own business.

666
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:55,547
I'll take care of it myself.

667
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,199
Why won't you listen to me?

668
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,386
I have no reason to listen to you

669
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:06,666
and I definitely don't have a reason to go back to Haneul House.

670
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,143
I can just go to my uncle's house.

671
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,611
Don't lie.

672
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:12,080
Are you going to go live at a student hostel?

673
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,191
You've been looking at places like that because you have no money.

674
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,751
And yet, what?

675
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:17,319
You're going to live with your uncle?

676
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,836
Did you see me?

677
00:53:18,836 --> 00:53:19,863
Yeah.

678
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,141
So you're pitying me now, because of that?

679
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:28,421
You're going to give me a place to eat and sleep because you pity me?

680
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,250
And is that why you got the stuff from my studio, too?

681
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,352
It's not like that.

682
00:53:33,352 --> 00:53:36,838
You disappeared as if you'd never see me again...

683
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,341
and then made me miss you so much that I almost went crazy.

684
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:45,447
And when you re-appeared in my life, you looked at me with the coldest expression.

685
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:48,116
And when I came to you with that kind of expression on your face

686
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:51,461
you hurt me so much that it felt like my heart was ripped to shreds.

687
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,757
Is it that fun for you to toy with someone's feelings?

688
00:53:55,757 --> 00:53:58,034
Was it fun for me?

689
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:05,057
When you missed me, I missed you a hundred times more.

690
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,280
♫  My love cannot be stopped. ♫

691
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:10,513
I wanted to touch you when you looked at me

692
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:13,875
and I wanted to hold you tight whenever you approached me.

693
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,154
I wanted to do that a hundred - no, a thousand - times more than you did!

694
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:24,077
I treasured you and loved you more.

695
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,090
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

696
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,724
But the two of us can never be together.

697
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:30,934
What?

698
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,261
We can't be together.

699
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,890
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

700
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,073
On the day that Jeong Hyeon died...

701
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,343
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

702
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:41,528
on that day, ten years ago...

703
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:45,866
I was with him.

704
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:54,250
I saw a car hit him, and then speed off.

705
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,750
♫  I'm not letting you go. ♫

706
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,337
I was so scared.

707
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:02,966
I had no idea what to do back then, so I ran away.

708
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,010
♫  Without you ♫

709
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,541
This is the type of cowardly bastard that I am.

710
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,800
That's why you and I ... can never be together.

711
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,966
So...

712
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,821
that's the reason why you pushed me away this whole time.

713
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,958
So...

714
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:32,028
you deceived me.

715
00:55:34,857 --> 00:55:36,983
Let me make one thing clear now.

716
00:55:37,776 --> 00:55:40,695
Whether it be intentional or accidental...

717
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,532
let's never see each other again.

718
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:50,730
Let's never be in the same place at the same time, ever again.

719
00:55:54,310 --> 00:56:00,560
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

720
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:07,110
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

721
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:13,350
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

723
00:56:18,392 --> 00:56:22,350
Oh man. Why isn't she picking up?
The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

724
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,510
Please leave a message after the tone.

725
00:56:47,846 --> 00:56:51,374
What happened with the favor I asked you for?

726
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,547
There was nothing worthy of reporting.

727
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,584
- Is that right?
- Yes.

728
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:05,464
All right. That's a relief.

729
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,102
Chairman! Are you all right?

730
00:57:10,102 --> 00:57:13,388
I'm fine. You can go now.

731
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,734
Shall I escort you back home, sir?

732
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,944
I'll call Driver Park, so you can go.

733
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,439
I'm going to stay here a bit longer.

734
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:26,276
I... understand, sir.

735
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:51,993
So you came.

736
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,736
Mom.

737
00:58:52,513 --> 00:58:59,419
Mom... lived at Haneul House?

738
00:59:06,235 --> 00:59:08,237
Does the food taste okay?

739
00:59:08,237 --> 00:59:09,755
Yes.

740
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,974
