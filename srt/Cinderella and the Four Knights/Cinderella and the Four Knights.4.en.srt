Cinderella and Four Knights

9
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:50,744
- Here.
- Really...

10
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:06,842
You're becoming more and more... intriguing.

11
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:39,736
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:42,838
The sun is already high in the sky.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,177
Did you want to see me first thing in the morning?

14
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:58,094
As if. Come have breakfast.

15
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,884
Look at you, trying to hide behind that sad excuse of yours!

16
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:04,869
I don't eat at home.

17
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:07,914
That's why I'm trying to change that now.

18
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:08,840
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,160
People need food in them to keep them going, hmm?

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,300
So you're playing housewife? I like it.

21
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,835
Lie down.

22
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,381
Come to the dining room.

23
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,060
Nope! And hurry it up!

24
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:44,999
You're becoming more and more... intriguing.

25
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:56,821
Hey, you're always making things not fun.

26
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,133
Hey! Hey!

27
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,761
Gosh, Eun Ha Won.

28
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:06,255
You keep provoking my competitive side.

29
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,740
♫  My heart hurts so much, ♫

30
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,515
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

31
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,651
Do you really have to see Kang Hyeon Min?

32
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,456
♫  I am barely living. ♫

33
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,632
You're not in the best condition right now.

34
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:45,034
Don't go.

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,970
♫  If you extend your arm ♫

36
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,758
Then...

37
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,754
will you answer my question?

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,540
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

39
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,640
Later.

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,540
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

41
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,856
Let's just go for today.

♫  do you hear my love? ♫

51
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,983
They're not in their rooms.

52
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,687
It's harder to track them down than it is to eat with them.

53
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:14,267
All right. Try eating a meal together with all of them.

54
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:17,895
That's your very first mission.

55
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:24,419
Thinking about food is making me hungry.

56
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:29,707
I have to hurry and call everyone to eat with them!

57
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,420
I'll get you all.

58
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:44,105
Where on earth is Kang Ji Woon?

59
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,438
What the hell are you looking at?

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,900
- L-Let's eat.
- Scram.

61
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:16,846
Come on, let's just eat one meal together!

62
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,590
I'll be waiting, so come out.

63
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,002
I'm not wearing a swimsuit. Do you still want me to come out?

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,400
- What?
- I'm swimming alone at home, so why bother with a swimsuit?

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,950
But if you want, I'll really come out.

66
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,586
No, no!

67
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,100
If you want your phone back, come and eat!

68
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:51,249
Put it down!

69
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:55,652
Stop! Do you know it's hard to recover your data if your phone falls in water?

70
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:57,329
- Hey!
- Whoa!

71
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,331
Stop! If you want it back, come and eat!

72
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:02,383
Has she lost her mind?

73
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,371
Kang Seo Woo!

74
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:43,750
Kang Seo Woo! Hey! Kang Seo Woo!

75
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:47,670
Over here!

76
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,832
Come out!

77
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,261
You woke up early, huh?

78
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:58,265
- I didn't go to sleep.
- Wow.

79
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:01,834
Artists usually don't get much sleep.

80
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:05,505
But even artists need to eat. Come on, let's go eat.

81
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,849
Eat?

82
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:18,693
Oh, Miss! Please go back and get some more rest!

83
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:22,288
I want to help you! Wouldn't it be nice to work together?

84
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,583
Come on, please?

85
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,055
Make the eggs.

86
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:56,422
Wow, you made all this yourself?

87
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,475
Don't touch me.

88
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,286
You're really rough around the edges.

89
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:05,056
I made this since there's no such thing as "free" in my dictionary.

90
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,441
Don't go overboard.

91
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:08,018
Let's go on a date after breakfast.

92
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,869
I have to do the dishes.

93
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,480
Why would you have to do that?

94
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,309
I'm different than a certain someone, and I clean up after myself!

95
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,037
It's fine. You don't need to do stuff like that.

96
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:28,279
What's this about?

97
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,925
Can't you tell? I'm expressing my feelings for her through touch.

98
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:37,047
Why are you here?

99
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,890
That's what I want to ask!

100
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:43,678
Why did you call me here, when he's here?

101
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:46,931
Let's all eat together. You're family, after all.

102
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,441
Who are you calling family?

103
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:51,261
Nobody here is my family.

104
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:52,987
If you're here, sit down.

105
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,682
Give me back my phone.

106
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,067
I'll give it to you after we eat.

107
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,493
Are you out of your mind?

108
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:02,338
Yeah. I'm really not up for eating with this guy.

109
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
I heard that the three of you have never eaten together! What kind of family is this?

110
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,145
That's none of your business. Phone?

111
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:12,057
I told you, I'll give it to you after you sit down and eat!

112
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:15,076
Is it really that hard to eat a meal with your family?

113
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:16,919
Family is nice, sure.

114
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:21,491
But the only thing we have in common is our address.

115
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,427
They might as well be strangers.

116
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,931
I'd be down to take your side pretty much anytime

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,200
but I'm drawing the line here. I'm leaving.

118
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:34,746
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min! Where are you going?

119
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:37,723
It's not fun eating with you if it's not just the two of us.

120
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:44,755
Don't try too hard. The three of us aren't close.

121
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:45,916
- But still...
- Oh yeah.

122
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,269
Also, it's around this time of day that I get all my inspiration.

123
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,423
As fellow celebrities, let's respect each other's daily schedules. Okay?

124
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,262
I'll enjoy this!

125
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,983
Give it to me.

126
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:14,961
So you're saying you proud jerks value a phone more than family.

127
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,846
Stop acting as if you know us.

128
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:23,327
I know that a family should be able to manage to eat a meal together.

129
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,566
And?

130
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:40,328
Hey, what... are you doing?

131
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,706
Stop messing around.

132
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,798
Why is this so hard?

133
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,342
Wow, what an initiation into Haneul House!

134
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:04,828
They're resisting much more than we anticipated.

135
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:07,130
They're definitely family, all right.

136
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,840
They all share something in common.

137
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,276
I think it'll be hard, at this rate.

138
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:13,944
She can't give up already. It's far too soon.

139
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:16,547
But even so, I feel that one week isn't enough time.

140
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:18,783
I agree. That's too much.

141
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:21,920
- No.
- What?

142
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,690
I am not unreasonable.

143
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:33,014
Oh, Chairman! Again with your silly puns!

144
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:36,442
All right, I won't do anything.

145
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:42,340
It's only natural that family members eat together.

146
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,453
I'm curious to see how Eun Ha Won will accomplish this mission.

147
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:56,179
You sly girl! You said you didn't want to freeload off of someone else's life!

148
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:00,542
And you were putting up such a fuss about not going to Haneul House, too!

149
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,835
You must be so happy!

150
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:05,714
I'm there to work! I'm not there to play.

151
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:07,424
Exactly!

152
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:13,605
So you get to see the Kang Cousins' faces every day while you work!

153
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:17,167
How did you land yourself such a sweet job?

154
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,228
Sheesh! I told you, it's not like that at all!

155
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:24,716
But anyway, I'm still so jealous of you!

156
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:28,561
So, what kind of work are you doing, exactly?

157
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:35,777
How do you think you could get Kang Seo Woo to eat?

158
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:39,789
Whoa... You get to eat with my honey, Seo Woo, too?

159
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,243
Hey, that's not what's important right now!

160
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:47,705
I have to get the three of them to sit down to eat together.

161
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,160
That's my mission!

162
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,945
Wow. Mission ... Impossible.

163
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:59,651
You didn't know? The three of them have a terrible relationship.

164
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:01,102
Really?

165
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:03,496
I've only heard this through rumors

166
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,349
but apparently, it's a miracle that they haven't killed each other!

167
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:10,420
I think it's been like this since they moved in together last year.

168
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,698
Since then, there's never been a quiet day at Haneul House.

169
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,000
They don't have to worry about making a living so they spend their energy fighting over useless stuff.

170
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:22,490
That mission definitely won't be easy.

171
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:25,477
Did I underestimate this mission too much?

172
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:28,404
There's only one method that'll work.

173
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:33,259
Eun Ha Won's ultimate strength: sheer willpower!

174
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,336
Aw, come on!

175
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:39,215
Despite everything, you definitely have more spirit than anyone else I know!

176
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:44,812
Face those stuck-up rich boys head-on and see who will win!

177
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:47,966
You can do it!

178
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:56,508
Project: Get the Kang Cousins
to Eat a Meal Together!

179
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,230
Plan No. 1:
Catch them off-guard!

180
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:05,600
Di-bi-di-bi-dip!

181
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,078
- What are you doing?
- Di-bi-di-bi-dip! All right, I win.

182
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,430
I asked what are you doing?

183
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,741
You lost, so let's eat together!

184
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:17,195
You still haven't given up on that yet? I'm not going to eat with those guys.

185
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:21,540
Then, do you want to get hit, or eat with them?

186
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,909
Gosh.

187
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,260
Hey!

188
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:30,383
Hey, let's play one more time!

189
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,745
- Di-bi-di-bi-dip!
- Di-bi-di-bi-dip!

190
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,364
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

191
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:37,941
- All right, I win!
- What's this about?

192
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,151
Why are you playing rock, paper, scissors all of a sudden?

193
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:42,245
Last one up the stairs grants the other person a wish!

194
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:44,522
Okay, sure.

195
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:51,379
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

196
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,697
- Yes!
- Gosh!

197
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:54,899
I win!

198
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,060
So, what's your wish?

199
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,847
I want the three of you guys to eat together.

200
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,849
I told you, I don't want to.

201
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:06,102
Come on, it's just one meal. Are you really that against it?

202
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:08,671
Yeah. I just don't want to.

203
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:12,433
Isn't it impolite of you to force me to do something I don't want to do?

204
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:16,912
I'm not forcing you. You lost, fair and square.

205
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,917
Well, that's true.

206
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:25,663
Cham, cham, cham!

207
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,584
Cham, cham, cham!

208
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:30,910
Get lost.

209
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,825
Gosh, this won't work on him, huh?

210
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,487
This particular plan seems unsuccessful.

211
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:51,647
Then, we'll have to go to Plan B.

212
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,200
Plan B?

213
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,860
How did you find out what the Kang cousins' favorite foods were?

214
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,096
I did some research.

215
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:09,682
Young Master Ji Woon doesn't eat normal pork belly.

216
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:11,051
He likes pork belly with the pig's skin still attached.

217
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:13,544
The most important thing when cooking lamb is to make sure that it doesn't give off a pungent flavor.

218
00:17:13,562 --> 00:17:16,420
It would be best to purchase it at a Michelin-starred restaurant.

219
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,960
♫  Stranger who is crossing my mind ♫

220
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,130
♫  I can't take my eyes off of you. ♫

221
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,009
♫  Whisper which is heard by my closed mind ♫

222
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,978
Your order of lamb chops is ready. Enjoy.

223
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,800
Thank you.
♫  My Shining Destiny ♫

224
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,500
♫  I recognized my fate at a glance. ♫

225
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,060
♫  My dream's Romeo ♫

226
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:48,100
♫  I felt the love I had been waiting for ♫

227
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:57,110
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

228
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,290
♫  Baby take me take me take me away ♫

229
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,500
♫  Come to me and take me away ♫

230
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,540
♫  Baby tell me tell me tell me tonight ♫

231
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,110
♫  The only one I've been waiting for ♫

232
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,965
Where's this delicious smell coming from?

233
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:18,443
Because people have sensitive tastebuds,

234
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:21,921
their instincts are bound to win at the smell of their favorite foods.

235
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:24,658
Plan No.2:
Use their favorite foods as bait!

236
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,200
♫  My paradise is wherever you are. ♫

240
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:44,610

241
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,950
♫ Hey! ♫

242
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,830

♫ Hey, hey! ♫

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,002
No, I can't!

245
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:57,740
I have a shoot tomorrow! You monsters!

248
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,250

♫  My sighs are finally ending. ♫

252

♫  so that I can look at the only one I love. ♫

254
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:27,686
Don't just eat. Say something to them!

255
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:28,780
Let's eat together.

256
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,720
♫  I need you here with me (I need you here with me). ♫

257
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,752
This is your favorite dish from Chef Terry Kang's 3-Michelin Star restaurant!

258
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,423
Why are you so obsessed with this idea of making us eat together?

259
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,725
This is my first mission!

260
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,090
♫  Come to me and take me away ♫

261
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,412
None of this will work, you know.

262
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:45,380
You stop too, Yoon Seong.

263
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,470
♫  You are the only one for me. ♫

264
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,926
Stop it! Stop it! Stop eating, damn it!

265
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:57,851
Does it taste good?

266
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:00,519
Yeah. It's totally delicious!

267
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,452
Here. Try it.

268
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:17,854
Say, "ah!"

269
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,794
Get lost.

270
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:39,801
I'm at a total loss right now.

271
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,004
This was an impossible mission from the start.

272
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:46,257
The idea of family has become a source of pain for all three of them,

273
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:50,511
so things that are easy for most people are hard for them.

274
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,104
Oh, Miss! Miss! Miss!

275
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:02,156
Stop calling me agasshi.

276
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:06,652
Just call me Ha Won, okay? Please?

277
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:11,850
You are a guest at Haneul House, and I'm an employee at Haneul House.

278
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,161
Who cares? People are more important than some house!

279
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:18,564
So please, just speak comfortably to me. Please?

280
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,800
Okay.

281
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,861
Then, I'll take care of this, all right?

282
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:33,771
Oh my, oh my, those stubborn punks! None of them ate anything?

283
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,633
No. My plan was a total failure.

284
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,637
I guess they'd rather die than eat together!

285
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:46,759
They may be wealthy, but they're still quite pitiful.

286
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:51,748
Young Master Hyeon Min has been eating alone since he was young

287
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:55,218
so he finds it awkward to eat with others.

288
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,504
Why did he eat alone?

289
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:02,367
His father died, and his mother was out all day.

290
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,336
It seemed like he was having a hard time getting by,

291
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:09,441
so the Chairman sent him away to study abroad when he was ten years old.

292
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:13,353
I'm sure he ate and slept alone all the time over there too.

293
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:16,522
Thinking about it makes my heart hurt for him.

294
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:19,242
What about the rest of them?

295
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:23,772
Young Master Seo Woo makes a living by using his looks,

296
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:28,543
so he really cares about maintaining... um... what's it called, again?

297
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:31,087
You know.

298
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:34,799
- Oh, maintaining his image?
- Yeah. Maintaining his image.

299
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,786
Because of that, he doesn't like to eat that much.

300
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:42,215
I'm sure he needs to eat a lot to be strong enough to sing, though!

301
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,726
Don't you think so?

302
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:48,321
I feel so bad for him sometimes.

303
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,601
Then... what about Kang Ji Woon?

304
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:57,655
It's honestly so hard to catch a glimpse of him at home.

305
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,458
And on the rare occasions that he does come home, he locks himself in his room,

306
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,802
so you can never even get to see his face.

307
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:06,139
I think it may be because he can't get used to living at this house.

308
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,750
Why not?

309
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,920
It hasn't even been a year since he found out that he's related to the Chairman.

310
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:17,258
That's not exactly an easy idea to come to terms with.

311
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:24,949
Do you think he'd want to eat with me, if I offered?

312
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:29,437
He probably wouldn't. I wouldn't either, if I were him.

313
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:31,214
Never mind.

314
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:39,688
They may be wealthy, but they're still quite pitiful.

315
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,722
What's this?

316
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,752
Make sure you eat breakfast!

317
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:03,612
Good luck on your CD cover shoot. Ha Won.

318
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,772
Does Eun Ha Won think that I'm a little kid or something?

319
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,474
What's with the milk?

320
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,760
You usually don't even drink milk on days you have shoots.

321
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:22,298
I know but I'm kind of craving milk today.

322
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,746
Kang Ji Woon!

323
00:24:58,259 --> 00:24:59,852
What are you doing?

324
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,022
Oh, this, um... fell.

325
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,815
Don't touch anything.

326
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:07,786
I have something to tell you.

327
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:09,587
Get lost.

328
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:10,463
Why do you always say that?

329
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:11,740
There isn't even a place here to "get lost" to.

330
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,324
Get lost!

331
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:18,054
Are you that upset about the fact that I moved in here?

332
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:20,940
That was your choice.

333
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,752
Coming here without knowing what kind of place this is was also your choice.

334
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:25,810
So...

335
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,190
Leave me alone.

336
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,586
Are you threatening me right now?

337
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:38,558
But you know, I have a mind of steel, so that kind of threat won't work on me.

338
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,362
And I'm the type to do my best at the things I've been assigned to do,

339
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:45,123
so I can't promise you that I'll leave you alone, either.

340
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,611
If you want to play "happy family," go and do it somewhere else.

341
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:53,064
You know...

342
00:25:54,749 --> 00:25:59,912
have you ever once considered this place your home?

343
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:07,453
Have you ever once considered accepting the people living here as your family?

344
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,850
All you care about are your own emotions,

345
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,361
but you don't care if you end up hurting other people, right?

346
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:20,766
You won't get a family just by staying in this dark place by yourself.

347
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:32,603
By the way, thanks for finding my bouquet and giving it back to me.

348
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,900
- What are you doing?
- Playing.

349
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:58,713
You do this kind of thing for fun, too?

350
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:01,424
You thought I only cared about women, right?

351
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:02,884
I really did.

352
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:04,661
Look at you, looking down on people again.

353
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,139
There's no escaping Kang Hyeon Min's charisma, okay?

354
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:11,476
I haven't even found the "door" that leads to that supposed charisma.

355
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:18,116
Oh, I used to play with these often when I was a kid.

356
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:20,410
It won't be easy.

357
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:25,240
Hey, will you grant me a wish if I complete this?

358
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,041
How about it?

359
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:30,753
Fine. But you have to finish it within two minutes. Deal?

360
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:32,054
Deal!

361
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:37,360
All right. Ready?

362
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:40,563
Go!

363
00:27:50,023 --> 00:27:52,100
- Time's up!
- Wait!

364
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,811
Hey, that wasn't enough time!

365
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:57,238
Here.

366
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,335
Ready, set, go!

367
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:14,372
What the heck? You're already done?

368
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:17,091
Oh well. I guess I can't grant you a wish.

369
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:19,210
Whoa.

370
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,234
Yeah. I'll come out now.

371
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,127
Ah, how nice.

372
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:46,779
All you care about are your own emotions,

373
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:49,407
but you don't care if you end up hurting other people, right?

374
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:53,461
Did you come here because of money? Do you need money that badly?

375
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:59,124
Don't girls like you act all proud and then take all the handouts?

376
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,869
What's important to you is money, isn't it?

377
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:03,379
Or are you going to try to seduce me or something?

378
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:07,467
You know...

379
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:13,722
have you ever once considered this place your home?

380
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:21,155
Have you ever once considered accepting the people living here as your family?

381
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:34,686
Hye Ji

382
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:39,582
Yeah.

383
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:47,056
Really? I'll head over there right now.

384
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:50,960
You're not still playing with Rubik's Cube, are you?

385
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:56,032
What the hell? Did you get yourself another girl?

386
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:57,651
I always have women around me.

387
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:58,852
What did you say?

388
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:00,670
Do you want to break up with me right now?

389
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,372
Or how about next week?

390
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,953
Hey, eat with some enthusiasm! Haven't you ever heard of "mukbang"?

391
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:19,405
But you don't like girls that eat a lot.

392
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:21,374
How is it that you're so predictable?

393
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,852
I'm the type to put on weight if I even drink water!

394
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:26,746
Whatever. Do you know how to throw a punch?

395
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:27,639
Of course!

396
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:29,115
Do you really know how to hurt someone?

397
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:31,125
Hit me.

398
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:35,221
How could I hit you? I have really weak wrists!

399
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,666
How boring.

400
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,636
I can't play with you anymore. Let's break up now.

401
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,813
Bye!

402
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:45,907
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min!

403
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:57,135
This makes no sense!

404
00:30:57,135 --> 00:31:01,147
How the hell did Eun Ha Won end up at Haneul House?

405
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,019
Did you really confirm this with Eun Ha Won's friend?

406
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,697
I told you, I saw the photos that Eun Ha Won sent her from there!

407
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,038
I heard that place is huge, though! I'm sure there's plenty of employees!

408
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:19,265
She probably went there as a dishwasher.

409
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:22,060
And she took some photos while she was wandering around!

410
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,730
They said that she went there because she was invited by Chairman Kang!

411
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,534
He probably invited her because she looked like a good worker!

412
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:33,655
I mean, that girl is a miracle worker when it comes to doing dishes!

413
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:35,924
Just look at our plates! They're sparkling!

414
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:37,375
Mom!

415
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:39,969
Gosh, you surprised me.

416
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,054
What?

417
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:44,249
Do you really think that the chief secretary of Haneul Group would come to personally

418
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:47,384
take the belongings of some girl who'd be working there?

419
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,513
You have a point.

420
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,153
I can't stand this anymore.

421
00:31:57,746 --> 00:32:02,141
I have to go and find out with my own two eyes!

422
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,050
What is it?

423
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:12,027
What are you up to? Let's play.

424
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:14,229
Forget it. I have a lot to do.

425
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:15,831
Are you working on Grandfather's mission?

426
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:18,699
If you're not going to help me, leave me alone.

427
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:20,735
I'll help you.

428
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:22,437
Wait, really?

429
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,740
I know those guys better than you do.

430
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,433
Do you have a plan?

431
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,152
Of course I do.

432
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:37,493
So Eun Ha Won really lives here?

433
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,453
What the hell!

434
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:16,140
Not only does she live here, but she's sticking to Kang Hyeon Min like glue?

435
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,764
Why are we here?

436
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:24,841
We'll be doing things my way from now on.

437
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:27,185
So don't say another word and follow me.

438
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:37,879
Do rich guys enjoy pretending like they're in "Pretty Woman?"

439
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,998
Don't you want to accomplish your mission?

440
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,076
Fine, I'll wear it, I'll wear it!

441
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,245
I'm just trying to close the door for you!

442
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,981
Plan No. 3: Make their hearts race!

443
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,320
♫  Stranger who is crossing my mind ♫

444
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,634
Next.

445
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,510
♫  I can't take my eyes off of you. ♫

446
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,210
♫  Whisper which is heard by my closed mind ♫

447
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,230
♫  Softly melts me. ♫

448
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,750
♫  My Shining Destiny ♫

449
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,999
All right. Next.
♫  My Shining Destiny ♫

450
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:35,450
♫  I recognized my fate at a glance. ♫

451
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:39,120
♫  My dream's Romeo ♫

452
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,060
♫  I felt the love I had been waiting for ♫

453
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:44,538
Next.

454
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,220
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

455
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,480
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

456
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,290
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

457
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,210
♫  Baby take me take me take me away ♫

458
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,210
♫  Come to me and take me away ♫

459
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,321
- You look pretty.
- Really?

460
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,520
♫  Baby tell me tell me tell me tonight ♫

461
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,770
♫  The only one I've been waiting for ♫

462
00:35:10,772 --> 00:35:13,024
But, is this really going to help me with my mission?

463
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,625
Of course!

464
00:35:15,543 --> 00:35:21,024
- This, this, and that.
- So you'd like these three items?

465
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:22,467
No. I'd like everything except those three.

466
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,343
Excuse me?

467
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:25,704
I want everything in your store except those three things I pointed out.

468
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:29,416
Hey, what are you doing? Are you showing off your wealth again?

469
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,842
No. They're gifts.

470
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:33,770
I don't need these kinds of things!

471
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,430
That's up to me. Wear them.

472
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:43,171
Very typical of you, Eun Ha Won.

473
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:44,431
All right, let's go and eat.

474
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:46,808
This isn't the time to be eating!

475
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,586
I'll tell you how to convince those guys!

476
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:51,471
- Really?
- Of course!

477
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:53,690
- You're being honest, right?
- Hey!

478
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,000
If you're lying, you're dead!

479
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:10,198
You know the clothes that country girl just bought, right?

480
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:12,491
Show that to me!

481
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:19,064
Didn't you hear me?

482
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,550
5,450,000 ₩

483
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:31,077
Over five... million won?

484
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:40,446
Oh, hello! Oh, how are you?

485
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,480
What the heck?

486
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,610
♫  Don't come any closer. ♫

487
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,700
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

488
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,680
♫  Go far away. ♫

489
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,480
♫  A sad dream always ♫

490
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,690
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

491
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:40,140
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

492
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,500
♫ like a strong wind blowing ♫

493
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,980
♫  Even each moment I take a breath hurts ♫

494
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:00,270
♫  My love cannot be stopped. ♫

495
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:17,217
Sorry. I'm the one who called you over, and yet I fell asleep.

496
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:21,321
It's okay. Let's go.

497
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:24,324
- Where?
- To eat.

498
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:27,510
I have something to talk to you about, though.

499
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:34,517
I thought you said that you'd give me an answer for Hyeon Min.

500
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:41,750
- Let's eat first.
- What?

501
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,068
I'm hungry.

502
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:47,263
What do you want to eat?

503
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:51,651
Well, let's leave first. Get ready.

504
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,471
Hey, you planned this, didn't you?

505
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:06,749
Oops, you caught me. I thought you said you'd pay.

506
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:11,938
I guess I'll have to get the cheapest thing on the menu.

507
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:14,132
You can order the most expensive thing here.

508
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:15,033
I'll buy it for you.

509
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:18,011
Really? I'm really going to order whatever I want!

510
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:22,048
Sure. Eat up, and grow tall.

511
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:24,592
Hey, I'm not a kid!

512
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,620
Why do you always try to act like you're an older brother to me?

513
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:33,101
But still, I'm glad that you're my friend and not my older brother.

514
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:36,479
I can treat you like my equal, too!

515
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:41,784
Welcome.

516
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,581
You look pretty.

517
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:55,857
Let's leave.

518
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:57,142
Why?

519
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,311
Let's just eat with them.

520
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:04,015
That's okay, right?

521
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,827
Let's do that, then.

522
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:29,015
You look like a different person, dressed like that.

523
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:33,077
Really? It makes me feel a bit awkward.

524
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:37,240
I assume Hyeon Min bought that for you?

525
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:42,420
Not just anyone can buy that. It looks like he made a nice pick.

526
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:44,840
Really?

527
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,609
She's just being jealous because I bought you new clothes.

528
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:53,423
What's it like to live at Haneul House?

529
00:40:54,257 --> 00:40:57,269
Well, you know...

530
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:58,928
Of course, it's great.

531
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,348
She's living there as my fiancee, after all.

532
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:25,630
Let's ask them to cook the clams a bit more.

533
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:28,700
But you don't like them thoroughly cooked.

534
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:33,713
You can't eat clams if they aren't thoroughly cooked, right?

535
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,642
You've been like that since you were a kid.

536
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,486
Was it when you were elementary school?

537
00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:44,299
You accidentally ate raw clams, and then ended up at the hospital.

538
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:48,694
It's fine. I just won't eat them.

539
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:03,051
You should be more careful! Is your hand okay?

540
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:05,236
Yeah. Oh no!

541
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:09,007
Oh no! These clothes were expensive, right?

542
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,058
The clothes aren't what's important right now.

543
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:13,677
Don't you know that I'm a klutz?

544
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,213
Geez.

545
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:18,049
I'll get indigestion because of you, eating in such expensive clothes!

546
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:20,443
Hey, I can buy you more clothes like these, anytime!

547
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:23,921
No thanks. I'm going to return them.

548
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,823
Oh no!

549
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,243
Just a moment.

550
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:47,870
Oh no... What do I do?

551
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,854
Hey, what are you doing?

552
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:59,349
Does it make you happy that Kang Hyeon Min bought you expensive clothes

553
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,709
and brought you to eat at a place like this?

554
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:04,987
Why are you coming at me like this again?

555
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:10,802
I can do that much for you, too.

556
00:43:11,995 --> 00:43:14,413
What is it that you want to say?

557
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:19,561
If this was your only objective for coming to Haneul House,

558
00:43:19,561 --> 00:43:21,337
it's a bit pathetic.

559
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:24,824
You're definitely underestimating me.

560
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:28,820
I don't have such shallow objectives, you know.

561
00:43:29,813 --> 00:43:31,698
I appreciate your honesty.

562
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:34,976
I did underestimate you, didn't I?

563
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:40,982
Yep. My objectives and hopes for this job are much greater than that!

564
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:47,463
I heard that you guys have never even had a meal together!

565
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,386
Despite that, I'll make you guys into a real family!

566
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:55,972
If you say the word "family" one more time...

567
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,000
I'll make you regret it.

568
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,400
No matter how much you hate it, your cousins, and family—

569
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:06,140
Eun Ha Won.

570
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:09,010
Limit your interference.

571
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,100
This is hell. A part-time job from hell!

572
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:36,329
I've lived as Han Ji Woon all my life!

573
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:39,332
How am I supposed to become Kang Ji Woon overnight?

574
00:44:39,332 --> 00:44:43,912
Are you going to continue living as Han Ji Woon, who just repaired cars?

575
00:44:43,912 --> 00:44:48,425
Sever your ties with those people, too! You're different from them now.

576
00:44:49,342 --> 00:44:52,011
So you're telling me to throw away everything I have.

577
00:44:53,396 --> 00:44:55,815
I lived with those guys, and spent so much time with them.

578
00:44:55,815 --> 00:44:58,993
They're like family to me, stuck by me whenever things got rough.

579
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:01,212
How could you ask me to abandon my family?

580
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,465
Family?

581
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:06,601
Those people are neither your family nor friends anymore!

582
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:11,239
All you'll be to them now is a guy to freeload off of.

583
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:13,416
Wow, you really don't have any boundaries, do you?

584
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:18,120
I cannot acknowledge you as family if you continue to live as Han Ji Woon.

585
00:45:21,149 --> 00:45:25,411
Remember this my child: you're the heir of Haneul Group.

586
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:30,533
Even if that old man brings that kid in here, calling him family and such,

587
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:34,111
you mustn't fall for that, and protect your place!

588
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:36,664
I don't have any family.

589
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:40,409
I'm sure that kid will get it soon, too.

590
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:44,278
It looks like he came here all happy because his rich grandfather came and found him.

591
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:47,107
But he won't even last a day here.

592
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:19,899
So... it looks like I'll be the one to ask you, after all.

593
00:46:22,669 --> 00:46:27,865
Are you the one who brought Eun Ha Won to Haneul House?

594
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,901
Tell me the truth.

595
00:46:29,901 --> 00:46:35,122
Of course, I did. Who else would invite my own girlfriend to my house?

596
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:41,730
I guess she's different from the other girls.

597
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,408
Can't you tell? She's totally different.

598
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:53,591
It seems like I got in the way of your date.

599
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:11,926
What did you say to Hye Ji?

600
00:47:11,926 --> 00:47:12,994
I didn't say anything to her.

601
00:47:12,994 --> 00:47:15,288
But she ran out before she even finished eating?

602
00:47:15,288 --> 00:47:17,323
What the hell did you say to her?

603
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:18,542
What do you mean?

604
00:47:19,392 --> 00:47:21,953
You're best at hurting Hye Ji.

605
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:30,294
And you're the best at taking care of her when I do.

606
00:47:31,463 --> 00:47:34,065
It's been like that since you first came to Haneul House.

607
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:37,535
Sounds to me like you really hate that.

608
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,287
Why would I care?

609
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:41,673
Because you still think of Hye Ji as your girl.

610
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,625
No. I never have.

611
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:45,669
Do you sincerely mean that?

612
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:47,403
Sincerity?

613
00:47:49,305 --> 00:47:51,724
I don't care for such nonsense.

614
00:47:57,088 --> 00:47:59,215
You're saying you really don't have a shred of sincerity in you, right?

615
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:03,061
You start obsessing over things when you become sincere about it.

616
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Why would I make things complicated for myself? It takes the fun out of life.

617
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:18,167
What? Did everyone leave?

618
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,130
♫  My heart hearts so much, ♫

619
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:44,050
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

620
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:51,350
♫  I am barely living. Like rain in my heart ♫

621
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,337
Come to your senses! What the hell are you doing?

622
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:56,114
What am I supposed to do, then?

623
00:48:56,114 --> 00:48:58,499
I'm telling you this as a friend,

624
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:00,601
but you'll be the only one who ends up hurt.

625
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:05,656
Why do you act out like this when you can't say anything to his face?

626
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:10,294
I don't want much.

627
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:13,197
What is it that you want?

628
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:20,654
I just want that girl gone from Hyeon Min's side.

629
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,570
♫  I can't live without you ♫

630
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,931
♫  If this wait were a long punishment ♫

631
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:31,699
What are you sneaking looks at me for?

632
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:32,442
Just take a good look!

633
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:34,627
My beauty won't fade because you stare at it.

634
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:38,306
Why did Hye Ji leave all of a sudden?

635
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:42,794
It's always hard to predict where Kang Ji Woon will run off to.

636
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:45,830
But it's a bit weird that Hye Ji left, too!

637
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,548
Mind your own business.

638
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:50,718
Why are you so mean to Hye Ji?

639
00:49:51,728 --> 00:49:53,271
What are you talking about?

640
00:49:53,271 --> 00:49:55,570
You like her, don't you?

641
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,000
No.

642
00:49:57,007 --> 00:50:02,405
I feel like you took me to the wedding because of her, not the Chairman.

643
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:04,148
Stop overthinking things!

644
00:50:04,808 --> 00:50:08,427
Why keep bothering your crush like you're little kid?

645
00:50:09,913 --> 00:50:11,814
Are you jealous?

646
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:16,227
Oh, please! Never mind!

647
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:34,596
Hey, weren't we heading home? Where is this place?

648
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:35,647
Your house.

649
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,423
What?

650
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:38,208
You have no chance to succeed, anyway.

651
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,643
You'll get kicked out after you fail the mission.

652
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:43,305
Even if you succeed because of some stroke of luck this time,

653
00:50:43,305 --> 00:50:45,323
you're bound to get kicked out eventually.

654
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:47,058
Who are you to decide my fate?

655
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:51,253
Because I'm going to date you. That gives me the right, doesn't it?

656
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:54,198
Hey, I usually grant a girl a wish when I break up with her.

657
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,900
But I'll give you that wish right now. Let's go look at it.

658
00:51:08,371 --> 00:51:10,381
There's definitely no other guy as great as me, right?

659
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:16,003
I bought you clothes, food, and even a house in case you get kicked out!

660
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:21,909
I have no intention of dating you!

661
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:23,903
If you pull another stunt like this one,

662
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:26,931
I'll make sure that you'll have to crawl home! Got it?

663
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,099
Hey...

664
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:34,914
Hey, what is it that you want?

665
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:39,594
Ah, I can't even turn the blinkers on!

666
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:51,982
These jerks!

667
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:55,994
One does whatever the hell he wants, while the other one uses physical force!

668
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:59,855
How is it that they never think before they act?

669
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:06,696
This won't do. I'll have to battle them head-on!

670
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,680

This is the last time I'll ask you.

676
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,520
Would you like to leave this group chat?: Yes.

677
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,483
Kang Ji Woon has left the chatroom.

Kang Seo Woo has left the chatroom.

Oh yeah. You said you'd do everything yourself?

684
00:52:56,805 --> 00:53:00,884
Yes. But can you give me a basic idea of how to do it?

685
00:53:00,884 --> 00:53:02,418
Okay.

Hey, Ms. Celebrity! What are you doing here?

692
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:44,794
What's all this garbage?

693
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:48,331
It's not garbage. They're my belongings.

694
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:51,175
Oh, so it's Ha Won's!

695
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:03,363
Wow, she didn't throw out a single thing, huh?

696
00:54:11,054 --> 00:54:12,655
Birthday?

697
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:20,313
My birthday

698
00:54:20,313 --> 00:54:23,299
Huh? It's her birthday today?

699
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:44,037
What are you doing?

700
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:48,633
Oh, I'm looking for something. I thought it would be here somewhere.

701
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:51,486
- What is it?
- Oh, party supplies.

702
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,205
Why do you need that?

703
00:54:56,883 --> 00:55:00,370
Apparently, it's Eun Ha Won's birthday. I wanted to throw her a party.

704
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,715
- You didn't know either, right?
- No, I had no idea.

705
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:08,645
She got kicked out of her house and has nobody to celebrate with her.

706
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:12,724
- She must be sad.
- Yeah.

707
00:55:15,477 --> 00:55:18,755
I don't think she heard from her family, either.

708
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:22,884
Oh, I found it!

709
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:27,797
Eun Ha Won asked us to meet her in the courtyard in an hour,

710
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:31,050
so let's hurry, Hyung!

711
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,409
You still think of Hye Ji as your girl.

712
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:58,845
No. I never have.

713
00:55:59,545 --> 00:56:01,939
- Do you sincerely mean that?
- Sincerity?

714
00:56:04,216 --> 00:56:06,719
I don't care for such nonsense.

715
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,533
I just want that girl gone from Hyeon Min's side.

716
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:15,628
You don't think you'll be able to become the successor, do you?

717
00:56:15,628 --> 00:56:17,205
It's not like I couldn't.

718
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:20,817
Wow, your joke's gone a bit too far.

719
00:56:21,326 --> 00:56:23,770
Are you acting up like this because you don't know your place?

720
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:29,417
Hey, don't kid yourself. You're just trash.

721
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:19,717
- What are you doing?
- I want to drink it.

722
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:28,326
- What the hell are you doing?
- I want to drink it.

723
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:36,934
Hey!

724
00:57:36,934 --> 00:57:39,087
Are you sure that you don't know how to be sincere about anything?

725
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:42,190
- Move over.
- Come to the courtyard.

726
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:45,868
I'll show you something amusing.

727
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:49,080
Forget it if you don't want to.

728
00:57:57,514 --> 00:58:01,526
Let's eat together. Come to the courtyard in an hour.

729

This is the last time I'll ask you.

730
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,924
She got kicked out of her house and has nobody to celebrate with her.

731
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:11,002
She must be sad.

732
00:58:19,886 --> 00:58:22,839
All right, I think it's pretty much done now!

733
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:24,983
Did you tell Hyeon Min and Ji Woon, too?

734
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:26,493
Oh, yeah!

735
00:58:30,772 --> 00:58:32,907
Hyung, cover this up!

736
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:56,639
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min! I told you to keep your hands off—

737

What the hell are you doing?

738
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:12,638
Why do you have to be connected to Kang Hyeon Min, of all people?

739
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,352
What are you doing now?

740
00:59:34,352 --> 00:59:37,396
