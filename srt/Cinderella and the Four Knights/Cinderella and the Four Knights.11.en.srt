Cinderella and Four Knights

9
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:00,869
Hey, you!

10
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,386
Hye Ji...

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,408
will be living here for the time being.

12
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,715
Come in.

13
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,680
Sorry for barging in like this, all of a sudden.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,450
No, it's fine. It's not like this house is mine anyway.

15
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,303
If Ji Woon's okay with this, then it's all okay

16
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:03,306
But still. Won't you feel uncomfortable because of me?

17
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:06,827
No, no! This room was a bit too big for me to use by myself, anyway.

18
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,697
The minute you look at this room, you obviously see that it's a family room.

19
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,324
Thanks.

20
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,183
But you know, I was so glad that Ji Woon rushed over to me right away.

21
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:36,982
I felt really terrible back there, all by myself.

22
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,536
But, the person who has always come running to me at times like these

23
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,263
has always been Ji Woon.

24
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,276
I'm going to get some water.

25
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,887
Oh. Okay.

26
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,777
Do you have something to say to me?

27
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,530
Are you all right?

28
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:18,407
About?

29
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:22,444
So, I was right about to pick up your call, when—

30
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:24,254
You know?

31
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:30,018
You were a step behind Ji Woon today, too.

32
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:51,406
But, the person who has always come running to me at times like these

33
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,309
has always been Ji Woon.

34
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:07,397
Um, Hye Ji left this behind.

35
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,285
Just leave it there. I'll give it to her.

36
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:27,400
When... did you get home?

37
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:29,436
A while ago.

38
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,815
Did you take the bus back? Was there any traffic?

39
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:41,490
Well, um, I was just curious to see if you got back home okay.

40
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,545
I got home okay, obviously. That's why I'm standing here.

41
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:49,873
That's true. You did get home in one piece.

42
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:58,131
At any rate... take good care of Hye Ji for me, please.

43
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,481
Is Hye Ji the only person you care about?

44
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,549
How strange, really. It's so strange!

45
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,861
What are you talking about?

46
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,047
What's so strange?

47
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:02,863
Why is it so quiet today? Did everyone already leave?

48
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,249
There's a reason for that.

49
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,493
Excuse me?

50
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:16,693
Good morning!

51
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,150
Good morning!

52
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,137
Huh? Why are you here?

53
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:29,973
It ended up that way somehow.

54
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,110
Did something happen last night that I don't know about?

55
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,191
But, you look a lot different than when I see you outside.

56
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,317
Me?

57
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,354
Let me know if you need more of anything.

58
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,863
Thank you.

59
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,944
- Mr. Hyeon Min.
- Yes?

60
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,398
Do you know who this belongs to?

61
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:24,361
Judging from the color, they seem to be yours.

62
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:36,731
Oh. Did I do something wrong?

63
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,003
I did, didn't I?

64
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:58,003
Morning service!

65
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,980
Oh, thanks.

66
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,934
And this is a bonus since I need to pay you rent somehow.

67
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,578
Did you sleep well?

68
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:09,689
Thanks for bringing me here.

69
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,743
Let's go eat breakfast.

70
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,574
It really is quite ridiculous!

71
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,169
How is it that this house has changed so much

72
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,688
just because some girl is here?

73
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,668
It was like that when I first came here, too.

74
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:41,989
I came into a house with three guys and they kept their distance from me.

75
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,983
No, it wasn't like this back then.

76
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:51,031
The boys never changed the way they acted because of you!

77
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,076
Oh, really?

78
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,204
But you know, it's the first time I've seen

79
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,082
Mr. Ji Woon being so kind to a girl.

80
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:03,710
Really?

81
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:09,432
Well, it figures. Ms. Hye Ji doesn't look like any ordinary girl.

82
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,061
Yes.

83
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,596
She's as pretty as a doll!

84
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,476
Yet one was caught with his morning face and the other with his underwear in front of her.

85
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:24,506
I'm sure that they all feel a certain kind of way!

86
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,385
What? Am I not a woman?

87
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:38,570
How is she that different from me?

88
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:16,099
We... are pretty different, huh?

89
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:23,774
Guys are all the same.

90
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:27,402
They only care about a girl's face and body!

91
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,091
Third Empress:
Charisma and Charm

92
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:37,513
"Your own inherent charm will attract the one fated to be with you."

93
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:47,272
Yeah, I'm plenty charismatic already!

94
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,858
Yep, I'm fine!

95
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,210
♫  I also unconsciously look at you and ♫

96
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,520
♫  When you smile brightly, I ♫

97
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,606
♫  unaware promptly smile at you ♫

98
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:06,608
Ugh, it looks like I'm going to
a bathhouse!

99
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:11,280
♫  I didn't know I would do that. ♫

100
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,870
♫  I didn't know that you would become my everything ♫

101
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,620
♫  Both your happiness and your sadness ♫

102
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,900
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

103
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,620
♫  Now I'm confessing my feeling ♫

104
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,280
♫  The feelings I can't hide anymore ♫

105
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,930
♫  I am saying I like you and I love you ♫

106
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:50,010
♫  You are everything to me ♫

107
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,870
Everyone, the watches inside this bag cost three thousand won each.

108
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,250
Hey, what's wrong with you?

109
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,710
What is it?

110
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,490
What's wrong with you? You dropped it!

111
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,585
Um, what is it?

112
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:10,981
You look a bit... different today.

113
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,759
Oh. Do I look weird?

114
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,929
Um, I don't know.

115
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:21,408
Oh, let me ask the others!

116
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:26,204
Hey! Kang Hyeon Min! Hey! Kang Ji Woon!

117
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:39,009
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

118
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,995
Hey. She's acting a bit weird.

119
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,818
Oh, whatever!

120
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:13,110
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

121
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,641
I got home okay, obviously. That's why I'm standing here.

122
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:23,286
Is she still mad at me?

123
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,476
Man, what should I do?

124
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,365
Stop that already. Let's just eat!

125
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:38,443
Beautiful dishes like this must be photographed.

126
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,071
What's the point?

127
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:48,320
I'll order you two— No, ten dishes of this anytime you want,

128
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,380
so hurry up and eat.

129
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm doing this because I want to cherish the memory of eating

130
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,323
such pretty pancakes with you and look back on them later!

131
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,985
Is that right, Honey?

132
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,589
- So, I can taste it later. Okay?
- All right.

133
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,944
Oh, yes. I bought a gift for you.

134
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,565
You didn't need to do that.

135
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,332
Close your eyes first.

136
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,001
I have to do that too?

137
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,627
Come on!

138
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:34,933
All right. I can't see anything now!

139
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,210
One.

140
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,378
Two.

141
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,697
Three!

142
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,996
How do you like it?

143
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:50,282
The design and the material are so luxurious.

144
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:52,484
It's perfect for you!

145
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,996
What's the matter? You don't like it?

146
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,986
He's young enough that something flashier would be okay.

147
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,785
I like it.

148
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,670
Chairman!

149
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,857
Oh, um... I do like it.

150
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:17,859
Right? Isn't it just gorgeous?

151
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,286
I want to come back here sometime.

152
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,266
What's the matter? Is there something on my face?

153
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,160
No, it's because you're so pretty.

154
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,446
Let me see him for just ten minutes, please! No, five minutes!

155
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,774
I just want to get a look at my dad's face!

156
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,935
I'm sorry, but the prosecutors are interrogating him right now,

157
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:54,012
so you can't see him.

158
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,740
Then, can you bring him this, at least?

159
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,984
You can do this much, can't you? Please!

160
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,878
I told you, no.

161
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,538
Please come back later or something.

162
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,060
♫  Don't come any closer. ♫

163
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,190
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

164
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,750
♫ Go far away. ♫

165
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,930
♫  A sad dream always ♫

166
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,160
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

167
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,670
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

168
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:44,370
♫ like a strong wind blowing ♫

169
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,773
Uncle? It's me, Hye Ji.

170
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,392
Have you been well?

171
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,960
♫  Even each moment I take a breath hurts ♫

172
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,930
You heard about Dad, right?

173
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,100
♫  My love  ♫

174
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,587
If you help us just a bit...

175
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:10,772
Oh, I'm sorry to call when you're busy. I'll let you go.

176
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:17,440
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

177
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,720
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

178
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,710
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

179
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,080
♫  Without you ♫

180
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,230
♫  Without you ♫

181
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,440
♫  Without you ♫

182
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,270
♫  I'll always love you. ♫

183
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,279
Yeah, it's me.

184
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:04,209
Hey, you'd better repay me for this, all right?

185
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,646
I got my car and cards taken away from me.

186
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:10,265
You know that I'm in the middle of a cold war with my father, right?

187
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:15,079
And yet, I tossed my pride aside and begged him.

188
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,063
Tell me what happened, first.

189
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:20,793
I looked into it, and apparently

190
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:24,988
the judge in charge of Park Hye Ji's dad's case is my dad's sunbae.

191
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:27,040
So he said that he'd put in a good word for her dad.

192
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,684
He's not sick, right?

193
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,800
I usually don't do things like this, but you're special.

194
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,500
You know that, right?

195
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,493
To Hye Ji

196
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:46,493
But man, embezzlement charges? How freaking humiliating!

197
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:50,880
How is Park Hye Ji ever going to show her face anywhere again?

198
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,011
Hey, what's with you?

199
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Your dad set up a law firm not too long ago after losing his job over corruption charges, didn't he?

200
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,294
It's only been a couple of months since you've able to show your face again.

201
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:06,538
Hey. Kang Hyeon Min.

202
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:09,633
If it's that humiliating, don't even mention it.

203
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,547
You don't need to worry anymore.

204
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:42,374
To Hye Ji

205
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:44,393
Your father wanted this to be given to you.

206
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:50,499
What... happened?

207
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,200
Don't you know yet there's nothing in this world that I can't do.

208
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:59,074
No need to thank me. But if you really need to know why I did this,

209
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,094
I didn't pick up your call last time, so I felt really bad about that, and—

210
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:04,229
You don't need to go to great lengths for me.

211
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:08,275
What?

212
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,237
It makes me uncomfortable to receive help from you.

213
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,091
Hey.

214
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:20,429
But anyway, thanks for this.

215
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,680
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

216
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,320
♫  I am barely living. ♫

217
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,120
♫  Like rain in my heart ♫

218
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,580
♫  Tears fall endlessly. ♫

219
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,300
♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

220
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:48,640
What's this?

221
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,752
Hye Ji's things are there, so go and get them.

222
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,662
What did you say?

223
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:56,739
You're the one who brought Hye Ji here.

224
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,050
♫  I can't go ♫

225
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,122
Don't tell her that I was the one who got that for her, though.

226
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,940
♫  I can't live without you ♫

227
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:18,270
♫ If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

228
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:21,156
Kang Hyeon Min!

229
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,632
What's with him? Did they fight again?

230
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,426
Hye Ji.

231
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,595
I'm fine.

232
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,750
All I can tell you right now is this one thing.

233
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,854
And that is, I'm sorry.

234
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,609
Don't worry about me, and carry on with your head held high.

235
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:02,514
Your life won't change in the slightest because of me.

236
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:06,409
Wait just a little bit. I'll be back soon.

237
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,459
Let's go out.

238
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,052
Huh?

239
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:51,313
You can get ready in 30 minutes, right?

240
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:58,904
Where are we?

241
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,583
How were you able to do this?

242
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,893
Actually, the truth is...

243
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,601
Thanks, Ji Woon!

244
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,761
Sure.

245
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:32,496
I think it'd be too much to try and take everything,

246
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,506
so just take a couple of the things you'll need.

247
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:35,983
Kang Ji Woon.

248
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,076
There's no time for crying now, okay?

249
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:41,079
You have to hurry up and complete the stuff you were working on.

250
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,381
Yeah.

251
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,113
- Hye Ji.
- Let's eat before we go home.

252
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:53,141
As long as it's not too expensive, I'll pay!

253
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:56,979
Okay.

254
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,091
You wanted to eat this, of all things?

255
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,785
Yeah. Looks good, right?

256
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,905
Here. Eat up. It's amazing.

257
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,700
- I guess you've had this a lot.
- Yeah.

258
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,814
With who?

259
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:20,001
Eun Ha Won. She loves this.

260
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,800
- Looks like you two got really close.
- Huh?

261
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,638
It's clear to me just how much you look out for Ha Won.

262
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:35,401
What are you talking about?

263
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:40,839
Is being nice to me the same thing for you as being nice to Ha Won?

264
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,776
I don't know.

265
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:48,463
I haven't really done a lot of nice things for her.

266
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:49,615
Really?

267
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:54,085
Want some coffee? I'll go and buy some.

268
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:05,297
March 14th - White Day. Express your love to that special someone.

269
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,594
March 14th - White Day. Express your love to that special someone.

270
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:15,682
- How much is this?
- Thirty-five hundred won.

271
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:18,168
- I'll take this.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:31,573
Here.

273
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,348
That took a while.

274
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,983
Did it?

275
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,394
What about the others?

276
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:54,763
Mr. Seo Woo headed out for an appointment,

277
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:59,393
and Mr. Ji Woon and young Miss Hye Ji left this morning.

278
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,895
Th-They left together?

279
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,456
You didn't know?

280
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,817
I thought that you knew.

281
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:11,530
Oh. No wonder I didn't see them.

282
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:16,368
Oh, what a shame.

283
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:23,625
I mean, you've been alone every day since Ms. Hye Ji came around.

284
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,713
Oh, that's not true, Ahjumma!

285
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:30,107
What do you mean, that's not true?

286
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,734
Mr. Ji Woon shouldn't treat you like that!

287
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:36,246
How could his personality do a 180-degree change, just like that?

288
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:41,518
Is the only person he cares about here Ms. Hye Ji, or something?

289
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:47,808
Um, Hyeon Min might be in his room. I'll go and get him.

290
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,526
All right.

291
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:57,334
Oh my. Having a lot of women in the house definitely causes trouble!

292
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:09,238
Kang Hyeon Min. Let's eat together!

293
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:10,631
Stop it.

294
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:17,387
- Hey, eat with me!
- I can't see!

295
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:21,642
Come on. I heard you haven't eaten at all. So eat with me!

296
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,519
I'm not in the mood. Eat by yourself.

297
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:31,318
Hey! Why'd you turn that off?

298
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:35,430
Come on, please? I really don't want to eat alone.

299
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:38,700
Okay?

300
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,629
Lead the way.

301
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,164
Thank you!

302
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:47,109
I almost beat it! How could you turn it off?

303
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,836
Nah, you were about to lose. Come on, let's go.

304
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,912
Geez, you're so rude.

305
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:09,306
You know, the amount you eat has tripled. No, no. It's increased more than that.

306
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:10,899
Did you starve the last couple of days or something?

307
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:14,920
It's because my heart feels empty. Not my stomach, but my heart.

308
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,799
Why? Do you miss being my fake fiancee or something?

309
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,752
You're going to make me sick. Don't talk to me.

310
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:25,038
Why did you call me over, then?

311
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,625
I told you. I didn't want to eat by myself.

312
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:33,146
You want me to sit and eat with you, but you don't want me to talk to you?

313
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,932
Whatever. Just have Kang Ji Woon sit here, instead.

314
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:38,835
He went out. With Hye Ji.

315
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,439
Oh, really?

316
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,567
I wonder where they went off to.

317
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:48,754
Looks like you're suddenly bothered

318
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:50,539
now that I said that she went out with Kang Ji Woon.

319
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,317
What are you talking about? I'm not acting any sort of way.

320
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:59,222
If you're interested or curious, just say so!

321
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:02,050
You're going to get indigestion if you keep all your thoughts to yourself.

322
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,238
Then, are you annoyed that they keep leaving you out?

323
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,659
Hey, what are you talking about? I'm not being left out!

324
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:13,045
You're eating by yourself right now! That's called "being left out!"

325
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
- I'm not being left out.
- "I'm not being left out."

326
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,100
- I'm not being left out, you immature brat!
- "I'm not being left out, you immature brat!"

327
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,437
Whatever. Just eat.

328
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:24,598
Ugh! Just go play your stupid game! You're so immature!

329
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,800
- Fine, fine, fine.
- So annoying.

330
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:49,648
Ji Woon helped me find the stuff that was at my studio.

331
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:06,014
Should I go and put this in storage for now?

332
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,308
Sure.

333
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:24,116
Kang Hyeon Min. I did as you said.

334
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:25,934
Thanks.

335
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,537
What are you doing, hiding here?

336
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:34,234
Today's the last day I'm doing this for you.

337
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,945
I'll keep asking you to do this stuff.

338
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,884
What I'm saying is take care of Hye Ji.

339
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,194
There's no reason for me to do that, is there?

340
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:46,346
I don't have the right.

341
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:54,121
I'm good at hurting her, but I don't know how to comfort her.

342
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:59,309
So you want to do nice things for her but act like I did them instead?

343
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,528
It's no different from what you've always been doing.

344
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:06,616
She won't feel pressured if she thinks you're the one doing it.

345
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,679
It's not because of you that I'm doing this.

346
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,706
I'm only doing this as her friend.

347
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:15,525
Because I care for her.

348
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:16,943
Also...

349
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,131
don't make Hye Ji cry from now on.

350
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:35,103
I hope you two have a super-amazing relationship.

351
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,025
You're out. Out!

352
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,952
Who are you talking to?

353
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:46,231
Um... well...

354
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:49,009
Why are you here?

355
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,403
What, am I not allowed to come here?

356
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:55,340
Um, go. Go and take care of Hye Ji or something.

357
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,545
Sounds to me like you're hurt that all my attention is on her.

358
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:04,157
Me? Um, no. That's not true.

359
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,785
I'm sorry.

360
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:12,207
I'm sorry that I left you behind that day.

361
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:19,398
Oh, it's fine. That's all behind us. Why are you bringing it up now?

362
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,700
Ermm ...

363
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:27,050
♫  When you speak I, ♫

364
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,683
♫  I also unconsciously look at you and ♫

365
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:31,451
Wh-When do you have time?

366
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,261
What are you talking about?

367
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:34,380
To go on a drive.

368
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,390
♫  When you smile brightly, I ♫

369
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,859
Why?

370
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,821
We stopped in the middle of the last one. You don't want to go?

371
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,139
No, I do.

372
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,426
Oh, um... wait. No.

373
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,770
♫  I didn't know I would be like that.. ♫

374
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,264
And I have something to tell you, too.

375
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,930
♫  I didn't know you would become my everything. ♫

376
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,309
To me?

377
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,628
Anyway, I'll be going now.

378
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,620
♫  And your sadness ♫

379
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,910
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

380
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,540
♫  Now I'm confessing my feeling ♫

381
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,190
♫  The feelings I can't hide anymore ♫

382
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,361
♫  I am saying I like you and I love you ♫

383
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,479
I couldn't give this to her in the end.

384
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,730
♫  You are everything to me ♫

385
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:36,499
What did he mean when he said that he had something to tell me?

386
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,897
What are you thinking about so deeply?

387
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,300
Oh. Nothing, really.

388
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,613
It's definitely something.

389
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:52,533
No, it's nothing like that.

390
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,418
Is this because of Hye Ji?

391
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,441
Why? Does it make you feel uncomfortable to share a room with Hye Ji?

392
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:03,343
Oh, it's not like that.

393
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:06,363
Be nice to her while she's here.

394
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,657
She's kind of pitiful, right?

395
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:10,617
I mean, something like that happened to her dad all of a sudden

396
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,619
and they lost their house, too.

397
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:17,349
Be nice to her in your usual Eun Ha Won-ish way.

398
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,052
Where are you going?

399
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:56,196
I was going to do some laundry.

400
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:59,933
- Give that here.
- It's okay.

401
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,921
The laundry room is in a separate building. I'll wash it for you!

402
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:06,339
You don't need to do that for me.

403
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:11,436
I feel like I haven't done anything for you since you came to live here.

404
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:14,306
Just trust in me.

405
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,446
Oh, I'm sorry, Hye Ji.

406
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:34,510
I was trying to get it to dry quickly and put it in the dryer but...

407
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:40,206
It's okay. It can't be helped.

408
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,618
Here. Do you want to wear these, at least?

409
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:20,430
I'll be sure to pay you back for the clothes later.

410
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,817
No, it's okay. They were all old clothes, anyway.

411
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,878
Oh, but still!

412
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,633
Or I'll just go shopping for clothes with Ji Woon later, or something.

413
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,078
With Ji Woon?

414
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:44,938
I told Ji Woon that I like him.

415
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,749
Did you know?

416
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:57,092
When I was having a hard time because of Hyeon Min,

417
00:36:57,943 --> 00:37:01,496
and when I didn't know what to do with the situation with my dad,

418
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:09,220
the person who was always by my side through it all was Ji Woon.

419
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:18,104
That's why I want to try going out with him.

420
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,414
I'm going to go and throw these out.

421
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:30,483
So, what did Ji Woon say?

422
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:50,120
Did he... give you an answer?

423
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:53,381
Yeah.

424
00:37:56,443 --> 00:38:02,674
Ji Woon probably feels the same way I do. Don't you think?

425
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:15,979
I want to get him an expensive present.

426
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:19,758
The person is young enough to be able to wear something more flashy.

427
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,095
I like this.

428
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:36,266
Did you call for me, sir?

429
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:38,777
I need you to keep an eye on my wife.

430
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,404
Excuse me?

431
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:45,467
Report to me where she goes and who she meets, down to every last detail.

432
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,310
May I ask why?

433
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,837
Yes, sir. I understand.

434
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,721
I heard that you and your husband are living in newlywed bliss.

435
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:09,291
I mean, it's not the first time either of you have been married,

436
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:12,686
and yet you two are so happy. How nice.

437
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,314
What do you mean, it's not my first marriage?

438
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:18,934
Oh, was that not true?

439
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:22,554
It's just that I heard that this isn't your first marriage, so...

440
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,541
And who said that?

441
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,618
Um, well, that is...

442
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,046
to tell you the truth...

443
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:34,499
the wives of the chairmen from Joonmyeong Group and Jaeil Group

444
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:38,628
both came by not too long ago, and I overheard them say that.

445
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,033
Those people were talking about me?

446
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:48,830
Well, it's probably because you're prettier and richer than them.

447
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,533
They probably made up false rumors because they're jealous.

448
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,846
But don't worry, Madam!

449
00:39:55,846 --> 00:40:03,411
I'll be sure to relay everything I hear to you from now on, as a special service.

450
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,086
What's wrong with you?

451
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:12,746
Um, what's the matter?

452
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,599
I've thought you talked too much from the very beginning, but

453
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,709
do you get that much pleasure from gossiping about others?

454
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:21,705
Um, but, I'm not the one who said those things.

455
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:23,632
- I'm just telling you what I heard—
- That's enough.

456
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:29,079
I'm going to talk to the manager and get you fired, so just be aware of that!

457
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:36,044
Oh my! No! No, Madam!

458
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:56,498
Have you been doing well, Madam Kim?

459
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,404
Yeah. We should go golfing together sometime.

460
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:08,260
But, have you been talking about me behind my back?

461
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:14,766
If I hear some strange rumors about me again,

462
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,937
you'd better be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions.

463
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,100
What are you doing?

464
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,200
- Hey, this is the only way you'll dry it properly!
- I told you, it's fine! I'll take care of it!

465
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:47,182
What is this?

466
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,359
Is this for me?

467
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,802
Do you think it's for me, then?

468
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:03,590
That's why I want to try going out with Ji Woon.

469
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,407
Oh? What brings you here?

470
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:32,344
I couldn't sleep.

471
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,598
- Are you worried about something?
- No.

472
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:41,019
I have to go buy some things tomorrow. Can you come with me?

473
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:44,005
Sure.

474
00:42:47,217 --> 00:42:49,828
Good morning!

475
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:53,715
Oh. They didn't tell you?

476
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:54,825
About what?

477
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:58,620
The manager said that you shouldn't come to work from now on.

478
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:02,115
Me? Why?

479
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:05,836
Don't play dumb. It's because of what you did yesterday!

480
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:09,590
Is it that fun for you to gossip about others?

481
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,775
- I'm just repeating what I heard—
- That's enough.

482
00:43:11,775 --> 00:43:16,346
I'm going to talk to your manager and get you fired, so just be aware of that!

483
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:22,761
No, that's not true! That was all just a misunderstanding!

484
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,711
What's the matter, Mom?

485
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:52,799
I did something crazy because of you, and now...

486
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:56,937
What's the matter? Why are you crying?

487
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:02,918
I was just trying to marry my daughter off and ended up getting fired!

488
00:44:02,918 --> 00:44:05,103
What? You got fired?

489
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:10,325
How am I going to get a new job, at this age?

490
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:17,515
What about your plan to become Haneul Group's Madam's right-hand woman?

491
00:44:17,515 --> 00:44:20,244
Shut up! That's not the issue right now!

492
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:24,597
What the hell? No!

493
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:41,314
Do you need anything, Madam?

494
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:47,003
No. I just thought that I saw someone.

495
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,823
Report to me where she goes and who she meets, down to every last detail.

496
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,732
Wow, Eun Ha Won's going off to eat again?

497
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:21,179
She's not just feeling down. Her stomach has turned into a pit.

498
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,089
She really is something.

499
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:39,222
Hey, you should finish drying your hair before you eat.

500
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,620
It's been so long since you've had an orange, huh?

501
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,410

502

Oh, sorry. I thought you were Eun Ha Won.

Are you going somewhere?

00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,198
I'm going somewhere with Ji Woon.

521
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:08,547
Oh, I left my wallet inside.

522
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:11,249
Do you want to pay for everything today?

523
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,700
- I'm just kidding. I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

524
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:27,599
Did he... give you an answer?

525
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,101
Yeah.

526
00:48:32,938 --> 00:48:39,377
Ji Woon obviously feels the same way that I do, don't you think?

527
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,073
Are the two of them going on a date?

528
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:20,610
What is it?

529
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:25,865
Didn't you have something to say to me?

530
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:29,511
No.

531
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:31,897
Why did you come in, then?

532
00:49:31,897 --> 00:49:36,390
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

533
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,145
Sorry for not noticing sooner.

534
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:40,397
What are you saying?

535
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:44,418
I must be out of my mind to make that kind of assumption.

536
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:46,050
Say things in a way that I can actually understand.

537
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,190
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

538
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:50,532
I heard everything from Hye Ji.

539
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:55,412
So don't do things that will cause any confusion again

540
00:49:56,346 --> 00:49:58,589
Please.

541
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,420
Hey...

♫  you can see how I feel ♫

00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:17,192
I'm such an idiot! This is so embarrassing.

546
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,320
♫ I believe ♫

547
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:38,813
Ha Won.

548
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,418
What is it, Ahjumma?

549
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:45,796
Your father is here.

550
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,507
M-My dad?

551
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:49,508
Yeah.

552
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:51,844
My dad is here?

553
00:50:52,819 --> 00:50:56,164
When did he get here? Where is he now?

554
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,107
Dad!

555
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,614
Oh! Ha Won!

556
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,118
Um, who are you?

557
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,874
It's me! You don't remember me?

558
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,600
It's me, Mr. Young Jin! I ran the Taekwondo dojo with your mom!

559
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:33,886
Oh.

560
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:51,445
Oh, Ha Won.

561
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,601
Oh, you didn't need to bring out tea for me.

562
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,914
Thanks.

563
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:07,027
You sure do live in a nice place, huh, Ha Won?

564
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:11,023
I'm only staying here for a bit.

565
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:15,827
Oh. I heard that the rich Kang cousins live here.

566
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:20,916
Wow, you sure have moved up in the world, haven't you?

567
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:25,912
What did you want to see me about?

568
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:29,725
Huh? Hey, let's slow things down a little.

569
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:32,027
I haven't even been here that long!

570
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:36,198
Aren't you curious about what kind of life I've been living, up until now?

571
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:47,742
I guess Ahjumma mistook you for my dad.

572
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:51,129
And here, I thought that my dad had actually come.

573
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,801
Um, about that.

574
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:02,307
Has your mom ever spoken to you about your dad?

575
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:05,143
Excuse me?

576
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:07,821
About your real dad, I mean.

577
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:25,038
I heard everything from Hye Ji.

578
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,650
So don't do things that will cause any confusion again

579
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,302
Please.

580
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:35,007
Why did you stop all of a sudden?

581
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:37,801
Did you, by any chance...

582
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:44,641
say something to Ha Won?

583
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:46,510
Huh?

584
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,170
♫  I am barely living. ♫

585
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,605
What did you say to her?

586
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,810
♫  Like rain in my heart ♫

587
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:55,027
I told her that I wanted to try going out with you.

588
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,300
What?

589
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:01,533
And also that... you probably feel the same way that I do.

590
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:08,432
♫  I can't go on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

591
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:09,917
Is that not true?

592
00:54:11,902 --> 00:54:13,837
You rushed to me, though.

593
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:17,582
If you didn't feel that way about me,

594
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,802
why did you come?

595
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,720
♫ I would accept it. ♫

596
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,015
I'm sorry.

597
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,718
What do you mean by that?

598
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:29,962
I think you'll have to go by yourself today.

599
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:32,664
I'll see you later, at home.

600
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,710
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

601
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,980
♫  The one thing my heart says ♫

602
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,790
♫  The one thing my tears say is ♫

603
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:49,390
♫  do you hear my love? ♫

604
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,818
Oh, Ha Won! You didn't get burned, did you?

605
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:03,220
Are you okay?

606
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:09,117
You're my real father?

607
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:17,025
Well, um... yes. I completely understand how shocked you must be.

608
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:21,029
But you and Mom were just friends.

609
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:24,232
Um, yes, we were.

610
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:30,372
That's why I always felt bad towards your dad, who raised you.

611
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:36,903
I really want to be a proper father to you.

612
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:43,510
You have a father right here and we shouldn't be living apart.

613
00:55:45,195 --> 00:55:48,365
If you can just help me a little, we can live together.

614
00:55:48,365 --> 00:55:49,308
Okay?

615
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:54,980
- Um—
- Please leave.

616
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:57,624
I asked you to leave!

617
00:55:57,624 --> 00:55:59,034
Ha Won.

618
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,904
I'll leave instead, then.

619
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:05,165
Wait! Ha Won!

620
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:07,918
Ha Won!

621
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,800
I'll just come back again, then.

622
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,919
Where's Ha Won?

623
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:11,014
You didn't see him on the way in?

624
00:57:11,832 --> 00:57:14,810
A man claiming to be Ms. Ha Won's father came by,

625
00:57:15,827 --> 00:57:19,815
but she didn't seem too happy about it.

626
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:23,543
He claimed that he was her father, but she called him, Ajussi.

627
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:25,487
That was a bit strange.

628
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:36,623
You have a dad right here and we shouldn't be living apart.

629
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:42,003
If you can just help me a little, we can live together.

630
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,428
Dad

631
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,133
Dad...

632
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:08,455
Please, pick up the phone!

633
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:18,582
Where in the world are you, Eun Ha Won?

634
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,255
You do have a dad, though.

635
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:27,616
He won't.

636
00:58:28,692 --> 00:58:31,286
Because I'm not his real daughter.

637
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:35,999
Isn't that funny?

638
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:43,732
But I want to believe that my dad is my real dad.

639
00:58:48,303 --> 00:58:50,806
The line you have reached is currently busy.

640
00:58:50,806 --> 00:58:53,124
Who is she on the phone with?

641
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,240
♫  My heart hearts so much, ♫

642
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:09,491
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

643
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:14,337
Ha Won

644
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:20,001
15 missed calls

645
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:31,300
♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

646
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:35,007
Your battery is at one percent.

647
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:41,306
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

648
00:59:41,306 --> 00:59:43,542
Kang Ji Woon

649
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:46,800
♫  on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

650
00:59:48,822 --> 00:59:51,709
Hello? Where are you right now, Eun Ha Won?

651
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,044
♫  If this wait ♫

652
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:55,120
Ji Woon!

653
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,300
♫  were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

654
00:59:58,307 --> 00:59:59,725
Ji Woon...

655
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:03,896
Hello? Hello, Eun Ha Won?

656
01:00:04,538 --> 01:00:06,031
Eun Ha Won!

657
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,870
♫  You've become someone who can't give back ♫

658
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:14,320
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

659
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,430
♫  The one thing my heart says ♫

660
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:20,470
♫  The one thing my tears say is ♫

661
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:26,001
♫  do you hear my love? ♫

662
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:27,669
Mom!

663
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,240
♫  I can't live without you ♫

664
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:42,900
♫  If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

665
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:51,610
♫  You've become someone who can't give back ♫

666
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:55,870
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

667
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,090
♫  Even if there are only tears ♫
