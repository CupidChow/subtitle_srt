don't want to cry because of Hyeon Min anymore.

11
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,196
I want to...

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,507
take a break from you.

13
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,206
Will you...

14
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,786

You don't have to give me an answer now.

♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

It's late. Good night.

Well, then,

Wow, this is really old.

60
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,389
Who are you?

61
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,451
You just took a photo of me, didn't you?

62
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,019
No.

63
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,356
Then let me see.

64
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:24,575
Are you sure you didn't just take a photo of me?

65
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:31,498
Do you work here? What are you doing here?

66
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,343
I didn't do anything.

67
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:45,153
What about you? Why were you crying by yourself?

68
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,310
If you're going to keep crying...

69
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,000
go ahead. I'll leave.

70
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:03,175
So your friend's aunt's cousin's son

71
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:08,479
finally got a confession from the girl he had unrequited feelings for?

72
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,365
Is the girl pretty?

73
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,882
Yeah.

74
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,519
Then it looks like another couple is born!

75
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,981
When am I finally going to get a chance with my Seo Woo—

76
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:29,926
But, the guy hasn't given her an answer yet.

77
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,030
Is a response needed? You said she's pretty.

78
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,508
But being pretty isn't everything!

79
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:38,977
Um, yeah, it is.

80
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:47,002
But, still. He has clearly said, "Let's date!" for them to be official, right?

81
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:49,004
You're so old-fashioned!

82
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:54,535
If dating was already a possibility, then it's just the next natural step

83
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:59,598
But of course, if he had a ones-sided crush on her for a long time,

84
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:01,858
it could be a different story.

85
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,694
Really, how?

86
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:10,259
For example, he could've started to like another girl.

87
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:12,511
Another girl?

88
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:37,077
There's no way.

89
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,488
I mean, he's always by himself!

90
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,500
The only girl around him besides Hye Ji is...

91
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,678
Me?

92
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:58,740
Oh, no way. No way.

93
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,209
No, it can't be.

94
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,312
No. No way. Nope.

95
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:15,340
How do I know if a guy likes me?

96
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,258
Oh?

97
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:35,994
Are you pretty?

98
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:39,389
What the... Of course!

99
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,125
Don't have any expectations. He doesn't like you.

100
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,337
Don't waste your time asking here, go ask the guy yourself!

101
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:48,248
You think I would've asked if I knew how he felt?

102
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,578
What is this?

103
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,479
If he never gets mad at you no matter what, he definitely likes you.

104
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:06,875
Guys would never get angry at a girl that they like.

105
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,090

You're the one who did that!

What did I do?

145
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:49,997
Why are you being so mean to someone who's sick?

146

Do you have a death wish?

147

Hey, why are you treating someone who is hurt like this?

148
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,061
You're faking the extent of your injuries, aren't you?

149

What?

150
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:12,869
If you're bored, just go to sleep. Got it?

Hey!

153
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,615
What? It's not like you helped in any way since I got injured.

154
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,716
What?

155
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:29,644
You never once worried about me or bought me something to eat.

156
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,900
Are you a child? Stop being such a pain.

157

He definitely doesn't have any feelings for me!

Let's meet today.

159

Why is there so much mail?

160

165
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,630
♫  seems to be putting on a brave face ♫

166
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,220
♫  hiding all it's feelings facing you ♫

167
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,170
♫  I like a day like this. ♫

168
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,680
Park Hye Ji.

169
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,750
♫  Turning one step away ♫

170
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,160
♫  Seeing you will be harder ♫

171
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,129
Let's talk for a bit.

172
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,232
I have nothing to say to you.

173
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,442
Is this because of me this time, too?

174
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,070
Are you just using Kang Ji Woon to get to me?

175
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:12,115
Really? Is that the best you can think of?

176
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,644
Then why else would you be suddenly acting this way?

177
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:18,054
It's because I just realized

178
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:23,100
that the one who was always by my side wasn't you but Ji Woon.

179
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,080
♫  I want to say I love you just you ♫

180
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,841
What brings you all the way here?

181
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,095
- What about you?
- We have plans.

182
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,848
Are you guys done talking?

183
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,726
Sorry, but it's okay if we go, right?

184
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,100
♫  My heart  ♫

185
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,762
Let's go.

186
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,520
♫ like a bad habit ♫

187
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,530
♫  seems to be putting on a brave face ♫

188
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,400
♫  hiding all it's feelings facing you ♫

189
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,203
Hurry and eat. I have to go to work.

190
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:07,345
Are you even making any progress with the Haneul Group Chairman's wife?

191
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:13,177
Hey! Do you know how much I'm suffering right now because of that?

192
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,929
Why are you getting so annoyed about this?

193
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,434
I add extra minutes to her massages, just to get on her good side!

194
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:24,196
Look at how thick my arm has gotten!

195
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:27,599
Ungrateful girl. You didn't realize how thick my arm got, did you?

196
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,202
Oh, Mommy!

197
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:32,053
What the...

198
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,923
Of course, I know how you feel!

199
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,885
Just wait until I marry into Haneul House.

200
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:44,791
I'll get you a hundred botox shots for your arm, okay?

201
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:49,020
A hundred? How is my arm supposed to handle that?

202
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,781
Go and sit back down already!

203
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,118
You totally could.

204
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:58,263
But, you know...

205
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:02,917
- I did hear something strange.
- Like?

206
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:07,906
Apparently, there are rumors that this isn't her first marriage.

207
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,260
No way! Really?

208
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,656
Then, the Chairman of Haneul Group was tricked when marrying her!

209
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,658
Who knows?

210
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,644
I guess I'll find out the truth once I ask her about it.

211
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:22,913
Do you really think that could be true, though?

212
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:26,508
What if they're just spreading false rumors because they're jealous?

213
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,628
Figures. That's definitely possible.

214
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,915
Well, she's the fifth most important person at Haneul Group now, at her age

215
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,760
It would be weird if there were no rumors circulating about her, right?

216
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,680
Isn't this our chance, then?

217
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:44,751
It's a great chance for you to get on her good side!

218
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,753
What are you talking about?

219
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:51,007
You can become her ally and tell her all the gossip going around about her!

220
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:57,089
So, in other words, her right-hand woman!

221
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:02,243
And then, you can become in-laws with her!

222
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,507
Oh my. My daughter is so clever!

223
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,502
- In-laws!
- Yes!

224
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,995
About what happened the other day.

225
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,825
Is there anything you want to say?

226
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,080
There is.

227
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,454
What you said that day...

228
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,993
did you really mean it?

229
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,756
Is this because of me this time, too?

230
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,591
Are you just using Kang Ji Woon to get to me?

231
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:02,471
Yeah.

232
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,707
I really did mean it.

233
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,010
♫  You are messing with my head, ♫

234
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,930
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

235
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,380
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else? ♫

236
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,180
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

237
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,180
♫  I am wanting you so badly but ♫

238
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,400
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

239
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,703
We have plans.

240
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,997
Are you two done talking?

241
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,085
Sorry, but it's okay if we go, right?

242
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,540
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

243
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,220
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

244
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

245
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,880
♫  As much as my tears which I secretly wipe away ♫

246
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,810
♫  Won't you come to feel like me? ♫

247
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:00,111
All right, Eun Ha Won.

248
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,556
Why are you going around in circles, like this? It's not like you!

249
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:08,779
Let's just ask him directly which girl he likes.

250
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,165
Yeah. I can do this.

251
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,736
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min!

252
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,192
Are you in elementary school? Huh?

253
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:50,395
You better tell Kang Ji Woon about this when he gets home. And apologize to him.

254
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:51,972
Why should I? Huh?

255
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:54,249
Because I saw what you did!

256
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,061
What's the big deal about breaking something like this, huh?

257
00:22:57,061 --> 00:23:02,407
Hey. You know how crazy Kang Ji Woon is about cars.

258
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:05,769
This is basically murder.

259
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,596
Really?

260
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,142
- What should I break next, then?
- Hey!

261
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,939
You're being like this because of Hye Ji, aren't you?

262
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:25,072
I heard Hye Ji ask Ji Woon out on that day, too.

263
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,551
But still, you shouldn't be blaming that on Ji Woon!

264
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:32,729
Why should I care whether or not they date? It has nothing to do with me.

265
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,207
Do you really mean that?

266
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:37,709
You don't, right?

267
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,978
Geez, stop that, already!

268
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How many times will you question my feelings? It really annoys me. So annoying!

269
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:52,340
But, why did you come into Ji Woon's room?

270
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,650
Me?

271
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:56,979
Oh, I...

272
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:00,882
Kang Ji Woon is with Park Hye Ji right now.

273
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,903
He's with Hye Ji?

274
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,755
Hey, Ms. Celebrity!

275
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,033
What are you doing today?

276
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:29,111
I only have one thing scheduled today. Want to hang out with me after that?

277
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:31,638
I'll pass today.

278
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:35,025
Did something happen?

279
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,277
You know...

280
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:51,241
all guys probably prefer girls who are pretty and feminine like Hye Ji, right?

281
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,035
Why are you bringing up Hye Ji, all of a sudden?

282
00:24:54,953 --> 00:25:00,317
Oh, it's just because I was wondering if anyone would ever like a girl like me.

283
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,961
There's nothing wrong with you!

284
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,006
If anything, I think you're prettier than her.

285
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:14,756
Oh, you punk!

286
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,042
Maybe it's because you've been working for a while,

287
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:19,869
but you sure know how to flatter someone.

288
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,041
♫  I didn't know that you would become my everything ♫

289
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,317
I'll get going, then.

290
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,570
♫  Both your happiness and your sadness ♫

291
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,540
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

292
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,150
Did you really mean what you said then?

293
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,461
Yeah.

294
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,456
I really did mean it.

295
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,970
♫  I am saying I like you and I love you ♫

296
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:59,270
♫  You are everything to me ♫

297
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:05,115
You never once worried about me or bought me something to eat!

298
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:12,264
Oh, whatever.

299
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,595
- This is good.
- Who doesn't have chopsticks?

300
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,873
Here, have some more pickled radish.

301
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,791
Chairman Kang Jong Doo:
King of real estate in Korea

302
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:28,297
Chairman Kang Jong Doo:
King of real estate in Korea

303
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:34,052
The people of Haneul Group probably have tons of money, right?

304
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,571
Of course, they do!

305
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:39,349
This plot of land belongs to Haneul Group, too!

306
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,146
Yes, exactly.

307
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,633
I'm sure they have dozens of other properties just like this.

308
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:54,239
That's great! Please move forward a bit.

309
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:21,850
All right, here's our last question.

310
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,604
The main track of your album is called "Confession."

311
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,166
Did you write this with someone specific in mind?

312
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,077
- Um...
- Oh!

313
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,197
There definitely isn't anything like that. Not at all.

314
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:39,092
Geez, you just won't ease up, will you?

315
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,154
Let's take a few more photos, and finish up for today.

316
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,072
- Thank you.
- Yes.

317
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:51,412
Oh, yes. We prepared a gift to congratulate you on the new album.

318
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:53,156
Oh, thank you.

319
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,295
You remember how you did calligraphy for your last album, right?

320
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,557
Um, yes.

321
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,635
Put a hot mug on top of this.

322
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,779
When you do, words will appear.

323
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,398
Oh, really?

324
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:25,389
You have to take one per day, even if I'm not here, okay?

325
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:27,649
All right, all right.

326
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,130
If you keep neglecting your health like this, I'll get angry!

327
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,266
Looks like you're quite upset because of me.

328
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,452
Oh, I don't know!

329
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,388
Sheesh. Come, now!

330
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,190
Oh, you're here?

331
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,834
Did you call for me, sir?

332
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:55,944
It's nothing big.

333
00:28:55,944 --> 00:29:00,990
My wife has a gathering tomorrow. Can you take care of her?

334
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,385
Excuse me?

335
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:07,114
You must be quite busy. I'm sorry to add to your workload.

336
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:12,361
I haven't found a suitable person to help my wife yet.

337
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:20,385
So you take care of our Madame Ji until then, Yoon Seong.

338
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,806
That's okay with you, right, Secretary Lee?

339
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,585
Yes. I understand.

340
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,846
One, two...

341
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:49,998
three!

342
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,360
What are you doing?

343
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,003
Oh! Ouch! That's hot!

344
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,259
Are you okay?

345
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:05,388
Yeah! I'm fine! I'm totally fine!

346
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:09,501
Hey! Are you really okay?

347
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:13,763
Yeah, I'm really fine. I'm really fine!

348
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,870
Huh? What's with him?

349
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,531
Why is he acting like that?

350
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:40,040
Oh my gosh, she surprised me!

351
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,300
Why did she come in out of nowhere?

352
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,181
Seo Woo.

353
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,061
Oh. Yeah?

354
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,039
Your new song comes out tomorrow, right?

355
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,401
I totally forgot. Sorry.

356
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,820
Oh, whatever!

357
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,557
Hey, I didn't mean to! See? Look!

358
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,501
One day before Kang Seo Woo's new song is released

359
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,500
All right, already. Here. Take this. Anyway, it was for you.

360
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:24,426
Really? Wow!

361
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:30,023
Well, since you're giving me this, can you give me a live preview too?

362
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:37,105
I don't want it to get leaked 30 minutes before it's supposed to drop.

363
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,800
Hey, come on! We're like family since we live together!

364
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,343
I can't even ask for a freebie from you?

365
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,729
Nope.

366
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:44,905
Hey, come on!

367
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:58,060
Milk colored skin Kang Seo Woo! Kang Seo Woo!

368
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:02,280
I told you, I'm not doing it!

369
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:06,042
You're really not going to?

370
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:40,143
♫ When you start talking, I look at you without even realizing it.

371
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:49,953
♫ And when you sing shyly, I can't help but hum along.

372
00:32:49,953 --> 00:33:00,297
♫ I'll confess how I feel now, my feelings, which I can't hide anymore

373
00:33:00,297 --> 00:33:13,777
♫ That I like you, that I love you, that you're my everything

374
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:17,206
♫ Will you accept my feelings?

375
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,749
- ♫ I —
- Ah.

376
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,568
Wait.

377
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,681
I don't think I can do this.

378
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,659
What do you mean?

379
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:34,915
Um, I'll listen to it at midnight. It's only fair, right?

380
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:40,862
I feel sorry toward your fans

381
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:44,024
since only I get to listen to such a great song before its release.

382
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,301
Is it that good?

383
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,929
Y-Yes!

384
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:56,578
Thanks, Kang Seo Woo. I'll listen to this happily.

385
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,926
Geez, how could he sing that kind of song while looking me in the eye?

386
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,914
This is why there are over a million people in his fan club!

387
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:55,245
Did you have fun on your date?

388
00:34:57,447 --> 00:35:00,475
You've always had to settle for pathetically following Hye Ji around,

389
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,102
but it seems like you've finally succeeded.

390
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:07,974
Why? Do you feel like you've lost out now that she's asked me out?

391
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,834
What did you say?

392
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:13,890
What did you want to see Hye Ji about earlier this afternoon?

393
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,784
Tell me. I'll give you an answer for her.

394
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:21,896
Wow, does she know that you're this much of an asshole?

395
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:24,382
Who knows?

396
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,093
I don't know about anything else...

397
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:32,607
but it's clear that you lost to me this time.

398
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,664
Your response has made one more thing clear to me.

399
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,018
And what's that?

400
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,269
You...

401
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,330
regret your decision don't you?

402
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,606
Before you regret it even more, why don't you hang onto her?

403
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,277
What are you doing?

404
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:21,456
Oh. Did you go somewhere?

405
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,396
What's this?

406
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,051
Is this for me?

407
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:34,495
Well, it's certainly not for me.

408
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:36,888
Aw, you didn't need to!

409
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,310
Hey, I bought you something now, all right?

410
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,095
I don't want you claiming otherwise later!

411
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:44,288
Yes, sir!

412
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,720
♫  I also unconsciously look at you and ♫

413
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,172
Wow, this looks delicious!

414
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,740
♫  When you smile brightly, I ♫

415
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,060
♫  unaware promptly smile at you ♫

416
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,310
♫  When you are walking ♫

417
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,970
♫  I follow you and ♫

418
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,970
♫  When you shyly sing a song ♫

419
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,680
♫  unaware I hum. ♫

420
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,980
♫ I didn't know it would be this way ♫

421
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,720
♫  I didn't know you would become my everything ♫

422
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,460
♫  Both your happiness  ♫

423
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,761
Confession
♫  and your sadness ♫

424
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,640
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

425
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,469
♫  Now I'm confessing my feeling ♫

426
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,879
Sub-title: To Ha Won

427
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,030
♫  The feelings I can't hide anymore ♫

428
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,790
♫  I am saying I like you and I love you ♫

429
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:07,300
♫  You are everything to me ♫

430
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:25,622
Why are you drinking so much alcohol?

431
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,085
Do you think you could like another guy instead of me?

432
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:33,246
How could I ever like someone, other than you, Honey?

433
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:34,823
No way!

434
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,193
So, why, then?

435
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,531
Why is she doing this to me now?

436
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,801
No, no! You're the only one for me, Honey!

437
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,620
She acted as if she'd never leave me...

438
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:52,082
So why is she leaving me for someone else, now?

439
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:58,062
I'm not going anywhere. I'll stick to your side, just like this.

440
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,497
Don't leave me.

441
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:14,396
You can't take back what you just said, okay? You better remember that!

442
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:22,087
Please be sure to give me a call as soon as you arrive at the hospital.

443
00:39:22,087 --> 00:39:23,538
All right, all right.

444
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,899
And please let me know how things go.

445
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:27,792
Yes, I will!

446
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,653
And if, by any chance, something happens, please—

447
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,229
Ajussi!

448
00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:34,399
You've said the same thing five times already!

449
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,919
Have I really?

450
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:39,822
It's not like this is my first trip to the hospital.

451
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:41,965
Please, go about your business now. Quickly! Quickly!

452
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:43,800
But still, I must see you off at the very least, miss, to—

453
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,772
If you really feel so worried, should I take someone instead of you?

454
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:59,149
So you're telling me to be your escort, basically?

455
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:05,814
No. I mean, Secretary Lee can't come with me because he's busy,

456
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:07,766
and Seo Woo has a photoshoot.

457
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:12,479
And I haven't really heard from Hyeon Min since last night, so...

458
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,540
you're the only one left.

459
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,227
Nah. It's too much of a bother.

460
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:20,720
Wait!

461
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,759
- Do I have to go by myself, then?
- Why can't you?

462
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:31,974
You want me to take the bus and the train by myself, with this leg?

463
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,535
I'll have to transfer four times.

464
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:41,491
Oh, I really can't do that with this leg!

465
00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:45,804
Please?

466
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:47,764
Am I your part-timer?

467
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,655
Hmph. I knew it was impossible.

468
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:06,725
Let's go.

469
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,470
I'll wait for you outside, ma'am.

470
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:39,382
No, please come in with me.

471
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:41,176
Excuse me?

472
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,927
Hello.

473
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,529
Did we keep you waiting for a long time? I'm terribly sorry.

474
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:55,682
It's quite alright. I just got here, myself.

475
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:58,135
Let us introduce ourselves.

476
00:41:58,135 --> 00:42:01,855
This is Ms. Kim Hye Na, the Section Chief of Strategic Planning at Ohsung Chemicals.

477
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,148
Who are you...

478
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:08,219
And this is the General Secretary of Haneul Group, Mr. Lee Yoon Sung.

479
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:09,671
Pleased to meet you.

480
00:42:09,671 --> 00:42:12,674
To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to this marriage meeting,

481
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:15,802
but now that I've seen you in person, I'm glad that I decided to come.

482
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,540
I'm sorry.

483
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:29,741
Secretary Lee! Secretary Lee!

484
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,510
What are you doing?

485
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:33,445
That's what I should be saying!

486
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:35,472
How could you do that, after all I went through to arrange this?

487
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,941
So why are you acting this way?

488
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:45,599
My last wish for you is to marry a woman from a rich family...

489
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:49,152
and have a fulfilling life,

490
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,471
as your mother.

491
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:57,327
Is that why you're using the Chairman?

492
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,739
What's wrong with what I'm doing?

493
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:03,500
It was all for your sake!

494
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:06,236
For whose sake do you think I came this far?

495
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:07,921
Don't you dare use me as an excuse.

496
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,614
Yoon Seong.

497
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:15,479
I'll pretend that none of this ever happened

498
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:18,164
in line with the agreement that we made before.

499
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:35,032
There's someone that I want to introduce to you today.

500
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:37,442
Introduce to me?

501
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:39,252
Come on in!

502
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,375
Ah, yes.

503
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:51,481
Say hello. This is Secretary Lee. He's like a son to me.

504
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,954
My son grew up well.

505
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:12,235
Has it been twelve years since we last saw each other?

506
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:16,957
I knew that we'd meet each other again, but I didn't know it would be today.

507
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,218
Were you really surprised?

508
00:44:20,218 --> 00:44:22,829
I believe that you've mistaken me for someone else, ma'am.

509
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,889
My mother...

510
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:29,002
passed away twelve years ago.

511
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:33,507
All right, then.

512
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:37,978
If you've erased me from your memory...

513
00:44:39,154 --> 00:44:40,848
feel free to keep living that way.

514
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,750
I obviously didn't bring you up...

515
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,812
since I told him that I've never been married.

516
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:51,332
It seems like I'm not the only one who has erased someone from their memory

517
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,803
for such a long time.

518
00:44:56,822 --> 00:45:00,442
Let me make a request of you. Please pretend as though you don't know me.

519
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:02,435
And why must I do that for you?

520
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:05,196
I...

521
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:07,974
want to live as a woman for the remainder of my life.

522
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:12,387
If you just grant my request, I can do that.

523
00:45:39,965 --> 00:45:41,216
Oh!

524
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,207
- Hey!
- What?

525
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,959
You're not going to open the door for me?

526
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,980
Hey, do you not have fully functioning arms?

527
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,106
No!

528
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,627
Do you want me to go back into the house?

529
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:05,098
Fine... I just said that for the fun of it.

530
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,830
♫  When you are walking ♫

531
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,232
Oh, this door is...

532
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,780
♫  I follow you and ♫

533
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,944
Give me those.

534
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,930
♫  When you shyly sing a song ♫

535
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,680
♫  unaware I hum. ♫

536
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,980
♫  I didn't know it would be like this ♫

537
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,776
♫  I didn't know you would become my everything. ♫

538
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:42,180
Get in.

539
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,320
♫  Both your happiness and your sadness ♫

540
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:52,510
♫ I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

541
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,660
♫  Now I'm confessing my feeling ♫

542
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,441
Put your seatbelt on.

543
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:58,318
Yes, sir!

544
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:03,020
♫  The feelings I can't hide anymore ♫

545
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,690
♫  I am saying I like you and I love you ♫

546
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:12,200
♫  You are everything to me ♫

547
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:16,803
Looks like our Ha Won grew a lot.

548
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:24,052
You'll be able to take off your cast and walk around slowly without problems.

549
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:25,929
What?

550
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:32,436
I'm all better already?

551
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:36,098
Yes. Judging from these scans, it's healed up quite nicely.

552
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:38,950
You've made a very speedy recovery.

553
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,593
Doctor, my leg still feels a bit uncomfortable, though.

554
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:51,588
Don't worry. You're back to normal now.

555
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:54,190
Oh, I see.

556
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,472
So you're saying that her movement

557
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:03,817
isn't restricted in any way because of her leg, correct?

558
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:06,870
Of course not! She can even run now if she wants to.

559
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,389
Oh, I see.

560
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,577
Thank you, Doctor!

561
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:18,857
Goodbye.

562
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:20,901
Hey!

563
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:26,882
What are you so grumpy about?

564
00:48:26,882 --> 00:48:28,116
What are you talking about?

565
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:32,212
You've been acting grumpy towards me since earlier.

566
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:33,997
Well, I don't know.

567
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,042
I do feel a bit annoyed that I mistook a perfectly healthy girl

568
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,603
for an injured patient, and got dragged all the way here.

569
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:42,506
I was still a patient up until a few minutes ago!

570
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,617
I mean, I just got my cast taken off!

571
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:48,070
Really?

572
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,889
Find your own way home, then.

573
00:48:51,657 --> 00:48:52,641
What?

574
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,252
You said that you're fine now, right?

575
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:58,346
There's no reason for me to escort you anymore, then.

576
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,941
Did you hate this that much?

577
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:04,302
What?

578
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:07,464
What's so hard about coming here with me?

579
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:14,137
Hey, I'm just kidding.

580
00:49:14,137 --> 00:49:16,573
Whatever. Jerk.

581
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:19,251
Hey!

582
00:49:19,935 --> 00:49:22,112
Wow, I can't believe she's running when she just got her cast taken off.

583
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:24,230
Hey, where are you going?

584
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:32,097
Oh yeah!

585
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:36,276
Oh man, my bag! I left it in the car!

586
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:39,346
I'm so screwed.

587
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:44,109
Where did she go, when she left her bag behind?

588
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:51,124
I can't believe she got upset over a dumb joke like that.

589
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,244
Eun Ha Won.

590
00:49:58,765 --> 00:50:00,125
Eun Ha Won!

591
00:50:01,393 --> 00:50:02,936
Get in.

592
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:11,436
You're not going to get in?

593
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:15,490
I'll find my own way home, even if I have to take the bus or subway!

594
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,309
Just leave me alone. Why are you even here?

595
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,689
Do you even have money to take public transportation?

596
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:30,631
I don't have any, which is why I was planning to walk home!

597
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:33,300
Are you out of your mind? You're going to walk all the way home, from here?

598
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,595
What's wrong with that? It'll be nice. The weather is nice, too.

599
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:38,155
And the air is nice, too.

600
00:50:38,155 --> 00:50:42,167
I'm going to take a nice, long walk using my two perfectly healthy feet.

601
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,978
Wow, this sure is nice!

602
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,710
Drive with me instead.

603
00:51:10,395 --> 00:51:11,596
Get in.

604
00:51:13,048 --> 00:51:15,826
Well, if you really want me to.

605
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:25,143
Please put on your seat belt, ma'am. We'll soon get going.

606
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:26,795
Yes, sir!

607
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,510
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

608
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,890
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

609
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,995
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

610
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:44,580
Wow, this is awesome!

611
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,640
♫  What magic did you do? ♫

612
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:52,863
Wow, this is awesome! Whoo! Whoa!

613
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:57,340
♫  I who had forgotten how to laugh ♫

614
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:04,140
♫  laugh at just pronouncing your name ♫

615
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,750
♫  You who are adorned with a white star ♫

616
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:14,720
♫  Your breath brushes me like a touch and ♫

617
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,550
♫  You are the one star which fell on my heart ♫

618
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:25,830
♫  Like fate I'm falling for you ♫

619
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,859
Why is he so determined to win today? What's with him?

620
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:44,890
You're not answering?

621
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,516
Hye Ji

622
00:52:46,516 --> 00:52:47,668
Turn it off.

623
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,006
Want me to answer the call for you?

624
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,094
I told you. Turn it off.

625
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:19,341
The party you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

626
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:21,285
Please leave a message after the tone.

627
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:34,464
Awesome!

628
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:46,059
Wow, this is amazing! Wow!

629
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:49,438
This is awesome.

630
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,485
Wow, this is so nice!

631
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:04,869
Hey, I was drinking that.

632
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:06,830
I drank all of mine already.

633
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:36,435
What's with your expression?

634
00:54:36,435 --> 00:54:37,661
What?

635
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:41,490
Um, why? What's wrong with my expression?

636
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:00,483
Do you have something that you want to say to me, by any chance?

637
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:07,140
Um, that is...

638
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,560
Do you, by any chance...

639
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:13,255
have someone that you like...

640
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:17,568
Hye Ji

641
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:20,779
Yes, hello?

642
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:22,472
Ji Woon.

643
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,772
Wait for me. I'll head over there right now.

644
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,272
♫  Don't come any closer. ♫

645
00:55:38,272 --> 00:55:39,590
Let's go.

646
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,540
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

647
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,800
♫  Go far away. ♫

648
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,210
♫  A sad dream always ♫

649
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:59,580
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

650
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:06,210
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

651
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,951
Where are you going?

652
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:12,300
♫ like a strong wind blowing ♫

653
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,000
♫  Even each moment  ♫

654
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,835
You're going to Hye Ji, right?

655
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,340
♫ I take a breath hurts ♫

656
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,341
Yeah.

657
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,640
♫  My love  ♫

658
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,885
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

659
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:35,354
Let me out.

660
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,673
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

661
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:38,732
What?

662
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:42,027
I can get home by myself. I'll just take the bus.

663
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:45,472
It's fine. I'll just drop you off...

664
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:47,707
Hye Ji is waiting for you, though.

665
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:51,060
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

666
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:57,940
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

667
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,410
♫  Without you ♫

668
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,550
♫  Without you ♫

669
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,430
♫  Without you ♫

670
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,246
♫  I'm not letting you go. ♫

671
00:57:09,246 --> 00:57:11,060
Sorry.

672
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,220
♫  Without you ♫

673
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,380
♫  Without you ♫

674
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,600
♫  Without you ♫

675
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:27,050
♫  I will wait for you forever. ♫

676
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:47,110
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

677
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:53,600
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

678
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:59,070
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

679
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,856
What's wrong with me?

680
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:06,760
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

681
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,220
♫  Without you ♫

682
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,400
♫  Without you ♫

683
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:20,650
♫  I will wait for you forever. ♫

684
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:24,529
Ji Woon!

685
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:30,201
Some people from the court came to my house.

686
00:58:31,353 --> 00:58:34,781
Apparently, my house is in foreclosure and will be sold at auction.

687
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:37,359
And my dad was taken by prosecutors to be questioned.

688
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:40,529
What do I do now?

689
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,722
It'll be okay.

690
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:35,868
Let's get going.

691
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:52,176
I was going to pick up the phone if she called me a third time!

692
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:13,764
What?

693
01:00:13,764 --> 01:00:17,718
Did you hear, Hyeon Min? Apparently, Youngsin Construction went bankrupt.

694
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:19,453
Isn't that Park Hye Ji's family's business?

695
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:26,060
Hye Ji

696
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:29,780
The party you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

697
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,915
Please leave a message after the tone.

698
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,015
Huh?

699
01:00:42,242 --> 01:00:43,552
Where are you headed, at such a late hour?

700
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:46,104
Oh, that is...

701
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,970
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

702
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,460
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

703
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:52,979
Hey, you...

704
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:59,653
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie pointing only at you ♫

705
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:00,996
Hye Ji...

706
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,760
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

707
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:07,590
will be living with us for the time being.

708
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,510
♫  You are so precious. ♫

709
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:12,730
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫

710
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,040
♫  From the first to the last, I wonder about everything. ♫

711
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,950
♫  Even If I secretly must close my eyes, I open them. ♫

712
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,810
♫ Make you feel my love love love. ♫

713
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,990
♫  Now you're not alone anymore. ♫

714
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,840
♫  My love is growing bigger every day. ♫

715
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,940
♫  Truly you're the only one I know. ♫

716
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,930
♫  You're the only one for me. ♫

717
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,860
♫  Look only at me yet. ♫

718
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,650
♫  Even if the world is ending, I will run ♫

719
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:46,270
♫  So that I can protect you. ♫

720
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,780
♫  I'm the only one for you ♫

721
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,830
♫  I like it when you smile ♫

722
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:55,190
♫  I will only dream as brightly as you ♫

723
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,020
♫  I will love you with everything I've got ♫
