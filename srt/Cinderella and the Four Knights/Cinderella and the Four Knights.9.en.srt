00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,120
Ow, my head.

10
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,876
What a strange dream to have.

11
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:27,156
Oh my gosh, I must be crazy!

12
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,115
Wait, why am I liking this? Stop it! This isn't something to like!

13
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,225
I must be crazy!

14
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,027
Crazy. Oh man, I really must be crazy!

15
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,430
Come on, Eun Ha Won! Get it together!

16
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,950
Kang Hyeon Min

17
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,667
What's going on?

18
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,061
Hey, Eun Ha Won! Are you okay?

19
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,355
Ha Won!

20
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:33,914
It seems like a minor concussion.

21
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,391
Will she regain consciousness soon?

22
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,002
Yes. She's just asleep right now.

23
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,871
Then, would it be okay for us to transfer her to a facility in Seoul?

24
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,734
Yes. If there's a hospital that she regularly goes to, you can do that.

25
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,561
I'm sure she'll wake up soon.

26
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,247
Okay. I'll go and take care of her discharge paperwork, then.

27
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,608
All right.

28
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:04,219
Yeah. I'll take Ms. Ha Won to Seoul,

29
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,405
so I think it'd be best for you guys to go back to Seoul on your own.

30
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:09,082
All right. Do that, then.

31
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,093
You don't need to worry.

32
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,941
He says that she's fine. Hyung Yoon Seong said he'll take her to Seoul.

33
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,360
What about us, then? We don't need to go see her?

34
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,113
Right. He said that it was only a minor concussion

35
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:24,898
and he wants us to go home and wait.

36
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:29,027
Just how did she manage to fall in the bathroom and get a concussion?

37
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:31,546
She really is...

38
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,710
She really is a weird girl.

39
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:43,150
Let's hurry up and pack and go back home.

40
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,619
Yeah. It's not like we'd do anything on our own without her around, anyway.

41
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,876
Aren't you going to pack your things?

42
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,212
What?

43
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:56,897
It won't take me too long to pack.

44
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Then I'll pack my things quickly. Wait for me.

45
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,612
Um, excuse me.

46
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,748
Oh, you're awake?

47
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:37,421
What day is it today?

48
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,864
It's the 15th.

49
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,133
Huh?

50
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:47,105
What the, not even a single day has passed?

51
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,190
Excuse me?

52
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,568
I mean, usually when people pass out and stuff

53
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:54,538
and then wake up, a week or so has gone by.

54
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,131
Isn't that how it usually is?

55
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,310
Thankfully, that's not the case with you, so don't worry.

56
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,607
Hey, are you okay?

57
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:08,051
Oh, um... yeah, I think so.

58
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:13,090
I was super worried about you because you passed out in the bathroom!

59
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,518
- Aw, you were?
- Yeah!

60
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:18,720
Oh yeah! Where's everyone else?

61
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,165
Mr. Yoon Seong rushed you here alone.

62
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:25,885
Oh. But, um, Ja Yeong.

63
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,682
When people usually pass out, don't they get temporary amnesia

64
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,928
or something like that, and not remember anything that happened the night before?

65
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,855
What's with you?

66
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,362
Oh, never mind. It's nothing.

67
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:55,849
- Are you really okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

68
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,164
I was quite worried about you. I'm quite relieved.

69
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:06,560
Oh. I'm sorry, Ahjussi. Because of me, you...

70
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,863
Oh, let's hurry back! I'm sure the rest of them are waiting.

71
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,175
No. You must go to Seoul and get a cast put on your leg.

72
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,552
I've made an appointment for you at a hospital that is owned by Haneul Group.

73
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,729
All they did here was emergency first aid.

74
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,731
A cast?

75
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,862
They said that you sprained your ankle, too.

76
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:29,616
Oh no, are you serious?

77
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:33,570
Please get on. I'll take you to the car.

78
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,276
Huh? She left all her clothes here.

79
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,859
How tacky.

80
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,113
Why does she always focus on such unimportant things?

81
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,099
What are you doing?

82
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,559
Huh?

83
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,114
Oh, nothing.

84
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,293
Let's go.

85
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,283
What about everyone else?

86
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,953
They've taken another car and are on their way back to Seoul.

87
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:34,423
Oh. Did I cut this trip short for everyone?

88
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:35,733
It's quite all right, Ms. Ha Won.

89
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,986
None of them would've come if it hadn't been for you, anyway.

90
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,034
What is it?

91
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:48,787
You seemed to have quite a low tolerance for alcohol.

92
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:52,958
You didn't even seem like you had a lot, but you passed so soon.

93
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,452
I saw a side of you that Ive never seen, Ahjussi!

94
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,598
Please... um... erase that memory from your mind.

95
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:02,417
Oh, your face is all red!

96
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,179
I... suppose that you didn't get drunk, then, Ms. Ha Won?

97
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,964
Well, I—

98
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:13,278
No. I was super drunk last night, too.

99
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,165
And because of that, I don't remember a single thing that happened last night.

100
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,834
Did something happen last night?

101
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:22,671
Um, no. Nothing happened.

102
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,231
But you just said that you don't remember anything.

103
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,575
Well, that is...

104
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:31,738
Yes, um, I don't remember anything. But nothing really happened.

105
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,081
You've stretched a tendon in your ankle.

106
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:51,692
It's not serious so you'll be fine if you're careful for the next couple of days.

107
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,927
Yes, thank you.

108
00:09:55,153 --> 00:09:56,997
Have you used crutches before?

109
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:01,009
It's hard to get used to them at first, but they'll be quite useful once you do.

110
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,206
- Can she go now?
- Yes.

111
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,666
Be sure to schedule your next appointment.

112
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,918
And be extra careful over the next couple of days!

113
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:11,878
Yes, I will.

114
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,036
Ahjussi!

115
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:23,315
Let's go.

116
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:32,658
Organ Transplant Center

117
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:34,584
Organ Transplant?

118
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,626
It really won't be easy to find an organ donor.

119
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,079
Oh... I see.

120
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,524
It'd be best to inform his family about his condition

121
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,442
and find a donor among them—

122
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,820
He's completely against that idea.

123
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:57,457
We have no other options to offer you at present then.

124
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,952
All I can tell you to do now is wait.

125
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:05,791
All right. If you do find a donor, please contact me.

126
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,084
I will.

127
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,033
- Um, Ahjussi?
- Yes?

128
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,113
Oh, it's nothing. Let's hurry and go.

129
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,337
We need to talk.

130
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:19,965
About what?

131
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,617
About last night...

132
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,159
Oh, that?

133
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,254
Let's just pretend that it didn't happen.

134
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,706
What?

135
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,900
It's simple. Let's just pretend that none of that happened. Okay?

136
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,220
What is it?

137
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,930
Did something happen?

138
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,460
Um, no.

139
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,539
Eun Ha Won!

140
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,456
♫  When you speak I, ♫

141
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:37,292
Are you okay? You even have to use crutches now?

142
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,862
Oh, it's only for a couple of days.

143
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,300
♫  I also unconsciously look at you and ♫

144
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,720
♫  When you smile brightly, I ♫

145
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,850
♫  unaware promptly smile at you ♫

146
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm fine!

147
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,870
♫  When you are walking ♫

148
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,500
What a shame. That must be so uncomfortable. It's not painful, is it?

149
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,070
They said that I just stretched a tendon a bit. I'm fine.

150
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:09,115
You should've been careful.

151
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,501
I'll be your human crutch.

152
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,329
Even though she's not your fiancee?

153
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,574
- Ms. Celebrity! I'll help you.
- No!

154
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,120
♫  I didn't know it would be this way. ♫

155
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:22,847
Um, it's because I'm not quite used to them yet. I'll be fine soon.

156
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:24,730
♫  That you would be giving me my everything ♫

157
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,474
I'll help you, Ms. Ha Won.

158
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:32,513
Then, can you hold these for me, Ahjussi?

159
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:38,750
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

160
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,930
♫  Now I'm confessing my feeling ♫

161
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,834
Why is she hopping off like that, as if she's running away from us?

162
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,710
What's with her now?

163
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,060
♫  The feelings I can't hide anymore ♫

164
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,570
♫  I am saying I like you  ♫

165
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,286
Let's go. I'll take you home.

166
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,500
♫  You are everything to me ♫

167
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,250
♫  Will you accept my heart as it is? ♫

168
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:17,250
Good work. Ms. Ha Won is fine now, I presume?

169
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,011
Yes. I've brought her back to Haneul House.

170
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,558
I was planning to get some rest here and keep it a secret from the kids.

171
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,235
But instead, I almost got caught.

172
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,646
How long are you planning to hide your condition, Chairman?

173
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:33,700
I don't know. Until I die, perhaps?

174
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,587
Honey! How could you say something like that?

175
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:42,125
Is it all right for him to be discharged?

176
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,628
His hepatic cirrhosis is getting worse by the day.

177
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:49,065
It won't be long before his liver fails completely.

178
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,842
The only option left to us now is...

179
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,686
It's fine. Whatever.

180
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:57,249
- I'll quit drinking, and—
- You must receive a transplant.

181
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,543
I thought you said you added my name to the donor list.

182
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:03,714
Yes. That is true, but a compatible donor for you has yet to—

183
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,383
Well, I'm sure we'll find one soon enough.

184
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,452
Isn't that right?

185
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:10,253
Chairman!

186
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,591
What good will it do anyone to go around telling everyone that I'm sick?

187
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,018
Let's go now.

188
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,377
Yes.

189
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,659
I'll take that, ma'am.

190
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,161
Thank you.

191
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:29,097
No. This is merely a part of my duty.

192
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:35,612
It would've been quite nice if I had a son like you.

193
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:37,905
You're too kind.

194
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,740
Did something happen between you and Ha Won yesterday?

195
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,776
Huh? What is it?

196
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:00,979
You two seemed awkward back at Haneul House before.

197
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,273
No, I don't know anything about that.

198
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,709
It kind of seemed as if Ha Won was avoiding you.

199
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:12,141
She probably feels embarrassed about the fact that she tripped and fell over.

200
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:16,895
Figures. We all drank way too much. My head still hurts a bit.

201
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,657
Yeah.

202
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,244
Wow, I feel like I have a really bad headache coming on.

203
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:27,647
You were quite cute when you were drunk, Kang Ji Woon.

204
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,401
Stop kiddin around!

205
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,697
No, really. It's been a while since I saw you smiling like that.

206
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,867
Really?

207
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:41,895
Are you the daughter of the people who live here, by any chance?

208
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,339
Yes.

209
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,049
Is your father home?

210
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:48,251
No, he went on a business trip.

211
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,636
Oh.

212
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,515
Who are you?

213
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:57,910
Oh, it's nothing. We'll come back another time.

214
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:06,953
What's with those guys?

215
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,141
I don't know. Maybe they're people that my dad knows?

216
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:12,868
Will you be alright?

217
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:16,980
Yeah. I want to go in, wash up, and get some rest.

218
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,292
All right.

219
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,069
Thanks for dropping me off.

220
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,533
Yes, go ahead.

221
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:49,254
Really?

222
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:52,257
I'll head over there right now.

223
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,860
Did something happen between you and Ha Won?

224
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,637
It seemed like she was avoiding you.

225
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,570
I knew this would happen.

226
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,950
Don't you want my help?

227
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,144
I was about to change into something else.

228
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,422
Yeah.

229
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:07,666
Get out!

230
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:09,501
Nah.

231
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:10,878
Hey!

232
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:21,405
Wow! Is this really all for Eun Ha Won?

233
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:26,243
Yeah. She's injured, so she needs to eat up.

234
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:28,061
Isn't that right?

235
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,023
Oh, of course! I'll take this to her.

236
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,534
- Be careful.
- Okay

237
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,301
How could this be? No way. This can't be.

238
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:47,297
Hey, what about my clothes? Why don't you have anything with you?

239
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,966
Your wardrobe is a disaster!

240
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,585
There's nothing in there that's actually worth wearing!

241
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,763
That's not true. I'm sure that there are tons of things worth wearing in there.

242
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,941
- Just wait.
- Where are you going?

243
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,901
To buy some clothes!

244
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:03,322
- Oh my—
- Hey!

245
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:05,215
- You surprised me!
- You surprised me!

246
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:06,842
You almost knocked everything over!

247
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:09,745
- And why are you here?
- Oh, for Eun Ha Won.

248
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,798
Food is the most important thing to her, as you know. What about you?

249
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh, I just had a couple of things I had to take care of. Out of my way.

250
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,454
Hey, be careful!

251
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:20,839
Why, you little!

252
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:22,866
Damn it.

253
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:31,675
All right. Ta-da! Your breakfast!

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,574
I know. It was probably Ahjumma who made this.

258

She's quite a generous person!

259
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,545
No, it's not that she's a generous person.

260

Why are you eating so little?

I don't have much of an appetite.

272
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:26,947
Did you hurt another part of your body besides just your leg?

273
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:30,392
Oh! Did you get a bump on your head?

274
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,278
Maybe your concussion affected your brain somehow?

At his current place on the waitlist,

311
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:29,027
he'll have to wait two to three years, at the very least.

312
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:32,047
However, if a relative is willing to be a live donor

313
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:35,742
he can get moved up.

314
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,829
The Chairman told me to keep this a secret from his family, at all costs.

315
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:41,748
Yes, of course. I know that.

316
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,949
The person in need of the donation is being stubborn

317
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:01,384
but there aren't enough donors.

318
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:04,879
Those who care about him must be quite worried.

319
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:10,310
But, he refuses to let his true condition be known to his family members?

320
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:13,688
Yes. That's how things stand now.

321
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:15,574
If the donor is his relative, he can be operated on first

322
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:18,752
regardless of his place on the waitlist.

323
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,687
Excuse me?

324
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,358
There are currently over 200 brain-dead patients who are potential donors.

325
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:28,345
However, there are thousands more on the transplant waitlist.

326
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:34,134
However, if the recipient is related to the donor

327
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,619
then that patient gets moved up to the top of the list.

328
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:40,974
This also applies to people who are only relatives on paper.

329
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,794
Naturally, fabricating such documents will cost you a bit.

330
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:47,906
It's not something that I can do myself, you see.

331
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:54,454
But isn't saving a person's life the most important thing right now?

332
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,180
Waltzin'

333
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,194
Manager

334
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:16,285
Manager

335
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:21,356
I told you that I'm taking the day off today!

336
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:24,251
Hey, where are you right now?

337
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:31,616
Man, staying in my room all day is so suffocating.

338
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,326
Just where did this guy go, though?

339
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:47,173
Why are you looking into someone else's room?

340
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:50,986
Who says I was looking!

341
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,822
Hey.

342
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,767
What?

343
00:27:02,764 --> 00:27:07,944
Um... about what happened last night...

344
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:09,871
It was the first time for me.

345
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,206
Huh?

346
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:14,918
It was the first time that I got drunk...

347
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,617
and blacked out.

348
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,828
O-Oh.

349
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:27,648
- What about you?
- Me?

350
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,943
Well, I... I...

351
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:38,700
Well, you know, I even got a concussion! So I pretty much forgot everything!

352
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:43,664
Sure.

353
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,918
Control your alcohol intake from now on!

354
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:58,637
Oh, come on!

355
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:04,910
I'm sorry for making you spend so much time at the hospital

356
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,612
when such a life doesn't suit a lady like yourself.

357
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:11,166
If there's anything you want to buy, just say the word.

358
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,061
Do you think that I stayed with you just so I could get to shop?

359
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:17,147
Buy some things for yourself, instead! I don't need anything.

360
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:20,350
Do you want to make me buy you all the clothes that this store sells?

361
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,062
That's what I'll be forced to do f you don't pick something out yourself!

362
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:27,891
Oh, darling! You're so silly!

363
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:32,587
Right? Can't stop, won't stop.

364
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:37,884
Wow, that's pretty. Let's take a look at that.

365
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:47,010
Are you looking for a gift for someone?

366
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,023
Yes. I want to give them a significant gift.

367
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,752
Refined gentlemen like styles like these ones here.

368
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,839
No, these are too boring!

369
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:04,536
How old is the person you want to give this to?

370
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:08,156
He's young enough that he could wear something more flashy.

371
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,918
Oh, I see. Then...

372
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:15,472
How about this, ma'am?

373
00:29:25,824 --> 00:29:27,667
I like it.

374
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,399
Of course. I'm quite youthful. At heart.

375
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,195
Look at her, buying a present for me when I told her to get herself something.

376
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,704
What is it?

377
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:51,608
See for yourself.

378
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,621
What is all this?

379
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:07,049
I got a call from the paparazzi.

380
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,168
They're going to release these photos, saying you got yourself a girlfriend.

381
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:11,787
What kind of nonsense is this? That's not true!

382
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:14,414
Right? It's not true, right?

383
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:17,108
You two don't have anything going on, right?

384
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,363
Well, we can't do anything about the fact that these photos exist.

385
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:26,610
So if they do release these, let's just deny that you have a girlfriend. Okay?

386
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,304
They said they're planning to release these early tomorrow.

387
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:35,594
No. These definitely can't get out!

388
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:39,848
I'm sure we'll be getting tons of calls. Things will be hard for a while.

389
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,709
But I'm sure this won't hurt you in any way.

390
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,320
I mean, it's not like there was a photo of you kissing her, or anything.

391
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,332
All you have to do is say, "we're not dating!"

392
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:50,600
I told you, no!

393
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,253
Haven't you given any thought to how Eun Ha Won will be affected?

394
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,872
Last time, she suffered because of that issue between her and Hyeon Min!

395
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:58,349
How do you think she'd feel if she had to go through something like that again?

396
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,662
Hey, why are you acting like this, all of a sudden?

397
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,982
- Find another way.
- Another... way?

398
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:09,286
Hey, these guys are totally relentless! You know that, don't you?

399
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,105
You know that they go crazy when something juicy pops up!

400
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:16,251
Really? Then give them something even crazier to report on.

401
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,904
And where in the world would we get that?

402
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,758
You don't mean "that," do you?

403
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:26,377
Yeah. I have something that's even juicier than those photos.

404
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:32,400
Don't let your imagination run wild. It's nothing like that, okay?

405
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:40,234
My heart totally skipped a beat just now.

406
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:45,130
When did my Seo Woo grow up so much?

407
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,075
Come on, snap back to reality!

408
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:56,291
What the heck? He can't even remember what happened?

409
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,077
Did he really only do that because he was drunk?

410
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,190
That's not fair!

411
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,330
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

412
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,109
Or, maybe I'm wrong.

413
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:09,121
Is it actually better that he forgot about everything?

414
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:12,157
But still, this isn't right!

415
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:14,935
Damn him. Should I go yell at him?

416
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:20,132
Oh, but even if I do, he won't be able to remember anything!

417
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:22,142
Oh, forget it!

418
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,650
♫  I who had forgotten how to laugh ♫

419
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:27,147
What are you doing?

420
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,233
Hey, what are you doing?

421
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,968
♫  laugh at just pronouncing your name ♫

422
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:32,010
Ta-da!

423
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:37,499
Hey, why did you buy so much?

424
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:40,085
You feel totally thankful, right?

425
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,654
I even cut them for you, like this

426
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:46,508
so that you'll be able to wear everything comfortably! See?

427
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,953
Hey! How could you cut up new clothes like that?

428
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:52,914
It's fine! They said that they'd re-stitch them for me!

429
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,376
What does it matter if you cut it there?

430
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,495
I'm sure that my thighs won't even fit into those!

431
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:00,856
Don't worry. I knew you'd say that, and...

432
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,944
You see this? I even bought you a dress.

433
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:09,948
At any rate, I'll fill up your closet for you, so wear these clothes.

434
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,433
Got it?

435
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,852
Geez, you...

436
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:16,146
What? Want me to put these clothes on you, too?

437
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:18,148
- Sure, if you want—
- Wait!

438
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,833
That's as far as you go.

439
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:23,295
- Thanks.
- Okay.

440
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,048
- Thanks!
- Sure!

441
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,930
♫ Oh, hey! Yay! ♫

442
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:33,539
Chairman.

443
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:37,935
What is it? Are you worried that I'm worried about "that?"

444
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,053
Excuse me?

445
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,963
It's written all over your face.

446
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:43,982
Shall I... give them a call?

447
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:47,444
No, the opposite of that.

448
00:33:50,547 --> 00:33:53,642
I don't even know how many years this body has left,

449
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:56,962
so I don't want to act like a coward and go through such lengths just to save my skin.

450
00:33:56,962 --> 00:34:00,140
- But this might be the last option—
- I know how you must feel.

451
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,228
But there are some lines that you shouldn't cross in life.

452
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:10,625
There are things that no amount of money can buy,

453
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,178
and there are things that one must never buy as well.

454
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,616
What, do you pity me that much?

455
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:22,354
No, sir.

456
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:27,050
I was just thinking to myself about what a great man I serve.

457
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,938
You've worked quite hard.

458
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,549
You must be, to notice something as insignificant as that.

459
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,166
About what happened last night...

460
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:02,986
Oh, that? Let's just pretend that it never happened.

461
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:03,745
What?

462
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:05,647
It's simple. Let's just pretend that none of that happened.

463
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,157
Okay?

464
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:18,143
What's wrong with me?

465
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:40,682
Oh, geez!

466
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:45,178
He's supposed to be a man, but he blacked out from just a couple of drinks?

467
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:47,113
How could you not remember what you did?

468
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:49,316
Geez! Geez!

469
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,326
Oh no!

470
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,218
Wait a minute. Why should I have to hide?

471
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,331
What is all this?

472
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:48,458
Hey, Ms. Celebrity! Eun Ha Won!

473
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:52,813
Can you open the door for me?

474
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:56,291
Hey, what are you doing here?

475
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,426
- Shush!
- What?

476
00:36:57,968 --> 00:36:59,794
Can you help me up? Quick!

477
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:02,414
What are you doing here? Did you get hurt badly?

478
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:04,366
- Quick! Get in!
- What? Why?

479
00:37:04,366 --> 00:37:06,451
- Hurry up!
- Why?

480
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:08,720
- Geez.
- The door! Close the door!

481
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,047
What, the door? You want it closed?

482
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:17,004
Geez. Why did you go out when your foot is injured?

483
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:18,413
Are you okay?

484
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:19,523
Yeah.

485
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:23,727
Sheesh. Wait just a sec.

486
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:53,089
Hey, why am I your girlfriend? Our engagement wasn't even real!

487
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:56,985
You're just my employer.

488
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:08,805
Why are you being so nice to her, Seo Woo?

489
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,455
Oh, geez.

490
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:18,915
Give me your hand.

491
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,760
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

492
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:24,513
What were you doing outside?

493
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:27,974
Oh... I was just getting some fresh air.

494
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:46,468
- Oh, thanks.
- Geez.

495
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,411
What the hell is he doing?

496
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,039
Here, keep this wrapped around your hands.

497
00:38:52,516 --> 00:38:55,085
But, where did you go, dressed like that?

498
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,854
- What's wrong with this outfit?
- What is this?

499
00:38:57,854 --> 00:38:59,890
It's this new thing called "curtain style!"

500
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,291
What even is that?

501
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:24,815
Banana milk

502
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:48,663
Wow, what kind of stain is this? It just won't come out!

503
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,644
Um, about that shirt... please just give it to me.

504
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:57,439
Oh,Young Master! It hasn't been properly washed yet, though.

505
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:01,009
I'll be sure to wash it properly this time.

506
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:03,637
No, I'll just take this.

507
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:07,298
No, no. Washing your clothes is my duty.

508
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:09,985
You can just give this back to me.

509
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:12,679
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden, Young Master?

510
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,156
This is a part of my duties!

511
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:16,767
- I told you, it's really fine!
- Oh my!

512
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,670
Oh my! Are you all right, Young Master?

513
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,313
Are you hurt?

514
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:23,507
A man's hips are the most important part of a man's body!

515
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,391
- Ow!
- Oh no!

516
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm fine.

517
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,714
It's nice to see you around more often these days.

518
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:34,634
And you seem to be smiling a lot more these days, too.

519
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:36,645
- I do?
- Yes.

520
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,107
Oh, really?

521
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:45,529
Here, have this.

522
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:48,115
Is he giving this to me so that I get younger?

523
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,720
♫  Lately they say I am strange ♫

524
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,814
What the heck...

525
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,650
♫  My heart like a bad habit ♫

526
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,600
♫  seems to be putting on a brave face ♫

527
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,220
♫  hiding all it's feelings facing you ♫

528
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,985
Why did I take this, though?

529
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:44,629
It's not like I want evidence of what happened, or anything.

530
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,660
♫  Turning one step away ♫

531
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:55,680
♫  Seeing you will be harder ♫

532
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:03,690
♫  Even if you laugh louder ♫

533
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,542
♫  Without you I wouldn't feel good ♫

534
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,018
Are you sleeping?

535
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:09,146
Come out to the balcony for a second.

536
00:42:09,146 --> 00:42:10,697
To: Eun Ha Won

537
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,561
♫  Don't leave me anywhere alone anymore  ♫

538
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:19,348
- Ta-da!
- Wow! What is all this?

539
00:42:19,348 --> 00:42:22,292
- A midnight snack?
- Hurry and sit.

540
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,905
Wow, I really wanted to eat this kind of stuff!

541
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,382
You're the best!

542
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:33,611
Wow, flavored fried chicken? It looks so delicious!

543
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:36,465
Hey, how did you know that this stuff is the good stuff?

544
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:39,050
Wow, this looks delicious!

545
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,583
You're totally touched, right?

546
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,086
See, I guess this is why girls go crazy over me.

547
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:50,888
What, did another girl confess her feelings to you?

548
00:42:50,888 --> 00:42:53,282
As if you need to confirm that

549
00:42:53,924 --> 00:42:56,726
You're not that popular lately, though.

550
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,845
Hey, what are you talking about?

551
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:01,647
Does anyone really like you for who you are?

552
00:43:03,658 --> 00:43:05,551
Like Hye Ji does?

553
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,631
Well, duh.

554
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:14,595
Hey! You're being really mean, you know.

555
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:19,291
- What now?
- You know Hye Ji really likes you.

556
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:26,981
I think that Hye Ji is really quite brave.

557
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:31,153
She's honest about her feelings and is consistent.

558
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:35,123
Do you know how hard that is to do?

559
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,576
She's like a tree.

560
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,336
She's planted her roots in one spot

561
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:42,080
and won't be shaken, no matter what comes her way.

562
00:43:43,865 --> 00:43:45,751
What about me, then?

563
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:48,162
You're...

564
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:52,966
like the wind, that just keeps blowing, completely unaware of her efforts.

565
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:56,494
In other words, you're a complete player!

566
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,223
Geez.

567
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:04,236
I wonder if I could ever bring myself to do what she's doing.

568
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,565
Do you think you could, if you were in her shoes?

569
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:14,155
I never had a chance to date because I was too busy with part-time jobs,

570
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:17,724
so I really know can't know exactly how it must feel

571
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:21,553
but even I know enough to tell that her feelings for you are real.

572
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,502
Hye Ji really has genuine feelings for you.

573
00:44:30,354 --> 00:44:34,349
Stop eating. It doesn't suit you.

574
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:38,720
But I feel like you're that way sometimes, too.

575
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,222
What do you mean?

576
00:44:42,032 --> 00:44:44,934
I'm talking about the way you look at Hye Ji!

577
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,871
You're so rude to her when you talk to her

578
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:52,467
but sometimes, our eyes tell a different story.

579
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:56,488
I'm not that complicated, you know.

580
00:44:58,882 --> 00:45:01,209
But keep this in mind.

581
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:05,797
There's no tree that will wait around for you forever.

582
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:07,899
Don't regret that later.

583
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:13,446
Eat up.

584
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,217
Hey!

585
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,380
♫  A sad dream always ♫

586
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:43,820
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

587
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:50,210
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

588
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:56,520
♫ like a strong wind blowing ♫

589
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:03,020
♫  Even each moment I take a breath hurts ♫

590
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:09,810
♫  My love cannot be stopped. ♫

591
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:22,430
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

592
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:28,920
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

593
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,180
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

594
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,150
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

595
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,620
♫ Without you ♫

596
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:53,220
♫  I will wait for you forever. ♫

597
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:57,743
I'm going to visit someone who was sick, so please don't make it too flashy.

598
00:46:57,743 --> 00:47:00,336
Yes, I understand.

599
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:24,136
Here.

600
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:26,205
Happy?

601
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:29,183
Kang Seo Woo Flees While Wearing Jungsan Girls' High Uniform!

602
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,355
I must be a genius, Manager.

603
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,857
Whatever. Let's not talk about this anymore.

604
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:40,935
Come on, check out these comments!

605
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:43,100
"Kang Seo Woo looks cool, no matter what he does!"

606
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,900
"He's so adorable!" "Shield your eyes, my body!"

607
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,800
- See? Everyone's going crazy over this.
- Really?

608
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:55,918
See? I told you! I'm successful no matter what I do.

609
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:59,262
My Seo Woo... you're all grown up now, aren't you?

610
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,122
You're all grown up!

611
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:05,927
Maybe I should've just said that we're dating.

612
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:18,841
You're out of your room?

613
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:21,418
Huh? What brings you here?

614
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:24,046
I came by because I was wondering how you were doing.

615
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:26,340
Oh... thanks!

616
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,635
I'm not that badly hurt, though.

617
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:32,329
I felt like you'd pretty much have access to anything here

618
00:48:32,971 --> 00:48:34,873
so I just brought you some flowers.

619
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:40,100
Wow! Thanks! They are so pretty.

620
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,389
Oh, do you want to come in for a second?

621
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:44,891
Sure.

622
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,100
Thanks. This way.

623
00:49:05,103 --> 00:49:07,289
So this is your room?

624
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:11,051
Oh, it's not my room, per se.

625
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:14,663
It's really nice. Looks like the Chairman put a lot of work into it.

626
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,899
Well, you know.

627
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,924
Thank you, Ajumma. I should've gotten this myself!

628
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,121
With that leg? Don't say something like that.

629
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:34,783
I'll come and clean this up after you're finished.

630
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:37,019
Okay. Thank you.

631
00:49:45,335 --> 00:49:49,347
- Then, have a pleasant time together.
- We will!

632
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,800
- Eat up, Hye Ji!
- Yes.

633
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:57,288
Looks like everyone here likes you.

634
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,900
Me? Well, you know ...

635
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:04,438
Sometimes, I'm a bit jealous of you.

636
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:07,624
You get along so well with all of the Kang Cousins.

637
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,400
Oh, it only seems like that on the surface! Actually they fight a lot.

638
00:50:16,209 --> 00:50:21,162
Sorry. My head itches because I couldn't wash my hair for a couple of days.

639
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:22,456
Want me to help you?

640
00:50:22,456 --> 00:50:26,818
Oh, it's okay! I hurt my ankle and not my wrist, after all.

641
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:31,640
Okay, then. Go ahead.

642
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,451
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

643
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,932
Are you sleeping?

644
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,270
What are you doing?

645
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,380
♫  You are messing with my head, ♫

646
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,780
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

647
00:52:09,788 --> 00:52:11,130
Get out.

648
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,640
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else? ♫

649
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:15,536
We need to talk.

650
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:17,262
I have nothing to say to you.

651
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,550
I can't pretend that nothing happened between us.

652
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,220
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

653
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,703
Don't be like this.

654
00:52:25,703 --> 00:52:27,780
What am I to you?

655
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,249
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

656
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,909
A friend?

657
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:35,820
Or... the younger sister of my brother, your friend who died?

658
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,820
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

659
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:41,470
We don't have any kind of relationship.

660
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,280
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

661
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,740
♫  As much as my tears which I secretly wipe away ♫

662
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,628
And does this also mean nothing to you?

663
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:53,131
If you keep acting this way...

664
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,868
I really won't ever see you again.

665
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,510
♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

666
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,110
♫  Like a dream,  ♫

667
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,444
You're not leaving?

668
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,950
♫  like a miracle ♫

669
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,900
I'll... leave, then.

670
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,640
♫  You will be there in the time that I dreamed of ♫

671
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:25,110
♫ My one and only you ♫

672
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:31,230
♫  Don't close the door to the memories left of you and me ♫

673
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:37,370
♫  Ultimately our ending will become ♫

674
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:43,660
♫  the heartfelt wish of each of us. ♫

675
00:54:08,865 --> 00:54:11,226
Who's there? Can you help me?

676
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,461
Oh man!

677
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:29,294
Hey. What are you doing down there?

678
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:31,355
What happened?

679
00:54:32,348 --> 00:54:34,207
Well, uh...

680
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:36,610
I was trying to wash my hair, and...

681
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,998
Sorry, but can you call Ms. Beolgyo for me?

682
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,701
She... went out before.

683
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:47,037
Oh... really?

684
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:53,452
Then... I'm really sorry, but...

685
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:55,245
But can you help me up?

686
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:57,506
Sorry.

687
00:54:58,357 --> 00:54:59,758
Geez.

688
00:55:00,651 --> 00:55:02,285
Wait just a sec.

689
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,435
Geez, way to go. Stay still.

690
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:11,895
Okay.

691
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:19,678
Thanks!

692
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:25,617
Um, thanks.

693
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:33,717
- Hey. You...
- What?

694
00:55:33,717 --> 00:55:36,069
Are you planning to leave the bathroom with your hair looking like that?

695
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:38,839
Oh.

696
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:50,884
Wow... no other guy but me would do this for you!

697
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:53,729
Thanks.

698
00:55:54,846 --> 00:55:58,241
Hey! You're getting water in my eyes!

699
00:55:58,241 --> 00:55:59,351
Ugh!

700
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:01,286
All right, already!

701
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:06,950
Ah, my ear! Oh no! There's water in my ear!

702
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,303
Geez, stop yelling so much!

703
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,808
Hey, what are you doing?

704
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:16,360
You have to dry it like this for it to dry well. Just stay still, okay?

705
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,612
I knew you'd do this! No! I'll do it! It's fine!

706
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,656
Oh, no, ma'am! You've hurt your leg! Please, sit still.

707
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:23,399
I told you, it's fine! I'll do it! I'll...

708
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:40,066
I told you, I'll do it myself! Sheesh.

709
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:43,987
Geez, you even complain when I try to help you.

710
00:56:46,131 --> 00:56:49,451
The dryer's in the bathroom.

711
00:56:52,262 --> 00:56:54,331
Oh... thanks!

712
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:22,650
Wait a sec.

713
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,707
If you keep acting like this...

714
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,743
I won't see you ever again.

715
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,330
♫  My heart hurts so much, ♫

716
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:58,230
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

717
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,120
♫  I am barely living. ♫

718
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,010
♫  Like rain in my heart ♫

719
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:09,323
♫  Tears fall endlessly. ♫

720
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:10,310
Hye Ji!

721
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:17,120
♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

722
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,530
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

723
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,320
What's wrong, Hye Ji?

724
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:29,540
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

725
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:35,770
♫  on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

726
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,860
♫ I can't live without you ♫

727
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:48,130
♫ If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

728
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:57,190
♫  You've become someone who can't give back ♫

729
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:01,920
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

730
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,880
♫  Even if there are only tears ♫

731
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,020
♫  Even if the world is ending ♫

732
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,000
♫  You, my only one ♫

733
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,120
♫  Even if everything disappears over time ♫

734
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,880
I told you not to make Hye Ji cry, didn't I?

735
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,620
♫ I'm hurting so much ♫

736
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:32,454
Who do you think you are? What gives you that right?

737
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:35,720
♫  You’re my everything ♫

738
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,300
♫  I love only you. ♫

739
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:42,849
Ji Woon has the right to say that.

740
01:00:01,827 --> 01:00:03,829
I...

741
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,366
don't want to cry because of Hyeon Min anymore.

742
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:15,757
I...

743
01:00:15,757 --> 01:00:17,850
want to take a break from you.

744
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:24,833
Will you...

745
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:28,520
accept me?

746
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,800
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

747
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,710
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

748
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:14,820
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie pointing only at you ♫

749
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,790
♫  Why did you show up now? ♫

750
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,750
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

751
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,400
♫  I've bet my everything on you ♫

752
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,150
♫  You are so precious. ♫

753
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,100
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫
