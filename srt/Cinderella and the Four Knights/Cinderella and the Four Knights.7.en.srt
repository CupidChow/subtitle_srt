1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,470
Cinderella and Four Knights

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,770
Jung Il Woo

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,470
Ahn Jae Hyeon

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,720
Park So Dam

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,360
Lee Jung Shin

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,940
Choi Min

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,920
Son Na Eun

8
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,920
Cinderella and Four Knights

9
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,018
Fine.

10
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,321
Let's end our fake relationship.

11
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,852
Then...

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,597
Let's start dating, for real.

13
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,470
♫  You are messing with my head, ♫

14
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,510
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,060
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else? ♫

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,830
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

17
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,920
♫  I am wanting you so badly but ♫

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,340
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,090
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,292
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

21
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,430
Do you like me?

22
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,840
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

23
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,700
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,530
Take a good look at how you really feel.

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,200
♫  Won't you come to feel like me? ♫

26
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,702
Regarding both your family and women.

27
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,730
♫  My one and only you ♫

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,500
♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

29
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,920
♫  Like a dream, like a miracle ♫

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,920
♫  You will be there in the time that I dreamed of ♫

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,010
♫  I believe ♫

32
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:41,653
We need to talk.

33
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,905
Just leave me alone.

34
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:47,125
There's nothing going on between Eun Ha Won and Kang Hyeon Min.

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,438
I already knew It's not because of that.

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,181
Then...

37
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,069
Wait, why are you here?

38
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,970
♫  When I walked as I was told ♫

39
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:03,616
I'm not sure, myself. How could I be a friend to someone like her?

40
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,336
Did something happen between you two?

41
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,248
I have to get going. I want to be alone.

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,400
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,500
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

44
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,875
- Please give me an autograph!
- Don't go!

45
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,234
Oh.

46
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,128
- No!
- No!

47
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,489
- Oh... ow!
- Oh my goodness!

48
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,108
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

49
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:38,677
- Oh, it's CNBlue!
- Where?

50
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:47,311
- Seo Woo!
- Wait!

51
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,573
Oh!

52
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,985
- Seo Woo!
- Wait!

53
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,436
What do we do? There are a zillion girls out there right now.

54
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,630
Damn it, this is bad.

55
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,241
There is one way, you know.

56
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,477
Really? What is it?

57
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,806
What's with that bow-legged weirdo?

58
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,643
Damn it!

59
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,607
Manager! It's me! Open the door!

60
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,567
Damn it!

61
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,230
Manager! It's me! It's me, Seo Woo!

62
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,949
- Huh? Seo Woo?
- Open the door!

63
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,834
Get in! Get in!

64
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,848
Hey, why are you dressed like that?

65
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,100
Hurry and go! Hurry!

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,401
Oh, okay!

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Hong Ja Yeong

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Your battery is low.

69
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:28,270
What are you doing, wearing a new uniform on the day of your graduation?

70
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:37,854
Oh my, oh my, what do we do? It's so cold today, too.
I don't think I should stay here. Thanks for everything.

71
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,882
And the world is such a cruel place!

72
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,143
You said you found this, this morning, correct?

73
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,186
Yes.

74
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,748
Where did she go?

75
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,941
I'll go try to find her.

76
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,797
Have you seen Ha Won?

77
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,050
No.

78
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,402
Aren't you the least bit worried about her?

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,229
I don't have the slightest interest.

80
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,741
Aren't you being too mean? She used to live with us!

81
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,093
You really are spiteful.

82
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,769
So you're aware of that. Good.

83
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,450
Where are you going?

84
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,527
To go and get Ms. Ha Won.

85
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,606
I'll come with you.

86
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:21,365
Why should you?

87
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,892
I was close to Ha Won, too!

88
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,970
Sure. Let's go together.

89
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,476
Speaking of which, where did Kang Hyeon Min disappear to

90
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,853
after causing such a scene at the school?

91
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:48,725
That's him, right?

92
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,118
Wow!

93
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,362
What's with these looks?

94
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:54,873
They're different from the ones that I usually get.

95
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,741
From Jung Hoon:
Hey, have you seen this?

96
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,795
A confession.

97
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,347
I keep thinking about you.

98
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:14,233
Let's stop all this, already.

99
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,519
Um, did Ms. Ha Won possibly come here today?

100
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,137
Ha Won?

101
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,308
Wait, did that girl really leave Haneul House?

102
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,061
No.

103
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:37,975
You were making such a fuss about how she was such a valued guest of yours.

104
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,911
Did you throw her out already, or what?

105
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,177
And she was acting like she was all that because she was living with rich people.

106
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:53,557
Serves her right! Yep, yep!

107
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:08,221
Number 548-23 Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.
Hong Ja Yeong, friend from cafe job

108
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,574
I guess you had one friend, at least, Eun Ha Won.

109
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:16,554
Hmm, that name seems a bit familiar.

110
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:37,092
Um, is there a girl named Hong Ja Yeong who works part time here?

111
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,936
Oh, that's me.

112
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,762
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

113
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,207
I'm Hong Ja Yeong.

114
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,284
Seo Woo!

115
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,105
Oh... r-really?

116
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,516
Looks like we meet again!

117
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,295
Um... yeah.

118
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,532
Um, about what happened at school...

119
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:21,211
I won't tell anyone.

120
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,930
You won't, right?

121
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,085
- Thanks, Uniform Girl.
- Of course!

122
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,629
But, why are you here?

123
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,539
Oh.

124
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,159
Did Eun Ha Won possibly come here?

125
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,511
No, she didn't.

126
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,263
Do you know of any place she might go?

127
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:42,966
She ran away from home, you see.

128
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,405
No wonder she was begging me to let her sleep over one night!

129
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,685
How could you people kick her out when she has nowhere to go?

130
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:56,154
Oh, no! That's not it at all!

131
00:09:56,154 --> 00:10:00,841
This is bad. I'm sure she doesn't have any money, either.

132
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:07,407
Geez, why is so cold in here.

133
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,345
It was finally starting to seem like a place where people lived.

134
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,390
It's probably because the boys caused so much trouble that she up and left!

135
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,562
Oh my.

136
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:24,182
It's past dinnertime, sir. I didn't know you'd be home.

137
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,587
I'll get these out of your way.

138
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:31,281
Was it Eun Ha Won?

139
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,649
Pardon?

140
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,654
The person who bought those flowers, I mean.

141
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:39,606
Yes. My, how did you know, sir?

142
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,451
She said that you boys would probably feel down

143
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:45,178
after attending the memorial.

144
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:49,666
But it would be inappropriate to get something colorful given the circumstances.

145
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:55,121
So she said, "how about buying simple, pleasant white roses for the table?"

146
00:10:55,121 --> 00:11:00,944
That young lady has been through a lot, so she's quite thoughtful.

147
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:05,189
What's she going to do now, now that she's left?

148
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,325
I don't think they found her yet!

149
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:11,288
It wouldn't be good if something bad happened to her... right, Mr. Ji Woon?

150
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,748
Mr. Ji Woon?

151
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:16,802
Dang it, just who was I even talking to?

152
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,702
What makes you think living here will be okay?

153
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:36,321
I came to live here in order to take care of something important to me.

154
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,010
♫  Don't come any closer. ♫

155
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,260
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

156
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,760
♫  Go far away. ♫

157
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,963
Yoon Seong

158
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,690
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

159
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,928
Yeah, Hyung.

160
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,891
She didn't go there, apparently. How did your search go?

161
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,785
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

162
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:07,910
Oh, really?

163
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,510

Hey!

194
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,678
What kind of girl finishes three bowls of instant noodles by herself?

195
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,220
Stop starving yourself, and return home.

196

What I'm saying is, return home.

197

Home?

198
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,340
Haneul House.

199
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:36,793
Why can't you comprehend what I'm trying to say?

200
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:40,172
Oh... that's what you meant by "home."

201
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,717
I can't go back there anymore.

202
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,904
I...

203
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:53,585
went to Haeryong Temple.

204
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:56,422
What?

205
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:00,558
What I'm saying is, you completed your mission, or whatever.

206
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:05,721
Really?

207
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:12,412
You're the one who left the rose in front of my mom's urn, right?

208
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh... well...

209
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:23,198
Well, in a way, your mom and mine are like neighbors.

210
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,643
That's why.

211
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:29,028
I gave that flower...

212
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,925
to my dad.

213
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:40,440
Oh, you little punk! Great job!

214
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,526
Really, great job!

215
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,662
Stop overreacting.

216
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:49,557
Are we going home together, then?

217
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,829
Hurry up and come out!

218
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:05,915
The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable .

219
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,859
Damn it, her phone is still off.

220
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:10,812
Where in the world is she, and what is she doing?

221
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:14,399
I'll have to check the saunas and internet cafes nearby.

222
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,036
I wonder if she's keeping herself fed.

223
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:20,021
I'm back!

224

Oh my, oh my! You're back!

229
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:47,549
And you said before that you had no interest.

230
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,308
Were all of you waiting for me?

231
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,162
Of course! Everyone was so worried about you!

232
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:01,830
But, have you eaten?

233
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,665
Yes, I ate.

234
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:07,018
No, no. I'm going to make you more food, so eat some more!

Kang Seo Woo, I was totally touched!

241
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:43,155

242
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,938
- Sorry.
- Huh? Why?

243
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:57,127
I'm apologizing on behalf of the three idiots you have to live with here.

244
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,229
I feel like we put you through a lot just because of our family issues.

245
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,832
Hey, come on, now!

246
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:05,277
How could you say that, Mr. Celebrity, when you called me 49 times?

247
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:07,396
I should totally screenshot this and put it online!

248
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:09,256
I bet everyone would be so jealous!

249
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,841
How about it? Hmm?

250
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:13,610
Hey, you can't!

251
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,998
I have an image to maintain and protect! You better erase that call record, now!

252
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:20,450
I don't want to! I don't want to!

253
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,936
- I don't want to!
- Hey!

254
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,964
I'm going to use this and get really famous!

255

No, go away! Go away!

256
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,238
Anyway, you really are impressive, Eun Ha Won.

257
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,490
You even rejected Kang Hyeon Min as if it were nothing!

258
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,393
How did you know about that?

259
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,161
You didn't know?

260
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:48,754
A confession.

261
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,756
I keep thinking about you.

262
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,717
Let's stop this, already.

263
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:58,964
I'm sure that he was pretty shocked. He's never been rejected before.

264
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:01,975
But now, there's a video of him getting rejected going viral.

265
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:09,942
You don't need to worry. I'm sure he's seducing women somewhere else right now.

266
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,796
Was I too hard on him?

267
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:47,037
Wow, I totally love this! Just goes to show that money can't buy everything.

268

Celebrate! Korea's Number One Douchebag is now born!

An awesome video that shows you that good looks aren't everything in life!

270
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,532
You should be born as a bug in your next life. Life will be easier for you then.

00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,497
Wow, you're looking great today!

323
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:42,291
Are you making progress on your song?

324
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,034
No, something even better happened!

325
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:47,963
Huh? Really? What is it? What is it, Seo Woo?

326
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:49,806
What is it?

327
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:36,879
Ajumma! I came back because I missed your cooking.

328
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:42,284
I set up a real feast over there, so why are you over here?

329
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:45,454
But I like this! This tastes more like food you eat at home.

330
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:48,448
If I eat over there, it feels like I'm eating at someone else's house.

331
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,653
Oh, Ajussi! Come over here and eat with me!

332
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,054
No, it's all right.

333
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:57,891
You were going to say, "Eat as you'd like, Ms. Ha Won." Right?

334
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,351
- Well...
- Say "Ah!"

335
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,211
It tastes good, right?

336
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,559
Oh yeah... um, Ajussi.

337
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,111
Doesn't Kang Hyeon Min seem a bit off to you?

338
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,949
I saw him in the garden just now. It's the first time I've seen him like that.

339
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:18,720
Oh. Is he really all right?

340
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,581
I'm sure he'll be fine after he rests a bit.

341
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,868
Oh, it seems like he saw that thing!

342
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:27,829
I heard that Mr. Hyeon Min has gotten a new nickname.

343
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:33,143
Rich Douchebag... douchebag... #douchebag... douchebag...

344
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:35,078
Douchebag!

345
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:37,581
It seems that he was quite flustered.

346
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,560
A Real-Life Cinderella is Born!

347
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,888
Honestly, I'm jealous of her. Was she flirting with Kang Hyeon Min?

348
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,923
She really must have saved the country in her past life.

349
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:57,776
I'd rather have Kang Hyeon Min confess his love for me than win the lottery.

350
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:59,645
I'm so jealous!

351
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,663
- Damn it!
- Ow!

352
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,642
What the hell are you doing?

353
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:10,114
Look at this! Everyone's saying that Eun Ha Won is some kind of Cinderella!

354
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:14,976
So why did you cause all that trouble at school, you stupid girl?

355
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:16,820
You pretty much dug your own grave.

356
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,806
Who knew things would end up like this?

357
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:26,880
Damn it, you got it all over my face!

358
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,915
You little ... look what you did to my face!

359
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:31,209
Whatever! Go wash your face with nail polish remover!

360
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,444
Hey!

361
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,963
I'm not even finished doing your toenails yet!

362
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:37,349
Whatever! I don't want to hear it!

363
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:42,496
It's unlucky to paint your toenails differently!

364
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:47,492
Damn it! It's all because of that damned Eun Ha Won!

365
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:49,277
Damn it!

366
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:54,299
You said that it would make me unlucky if you didn't finish.

367
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,659
You little!

368
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:02,641
All right, then.

369
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:16,179
Ji Woon left that behind for his father.

370
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:18,532
Oh.

371
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,869
Do you know what this flower means in the language of flowers?

372
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:25,330
"Respect." Right?

373
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:28,850
I see that you're familiar with the meaning.

374
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,362
This means that punk has begun to change.

375
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:49,371
What's this?

376
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:52,565
Open it. It's a gift, from me.

377
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,952
Just think of it as a vacation, a reward.

378
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,665
Oh. It seems to me like this isn't going to be a normal vacation.

379
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:14,129
People usually get closer by fighting when going on vacation together.

380
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,089
Who'll be going?

381
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:24,689
Well, you can take the boys, or bring whomever you'd like.

382
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:25,949
Really?

383
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,576
Of course!

384
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:32,781
Then, can I bring all 37 girls in my class?

385
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:36,601
Huh? Oh... um... sure.

386
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:39,154
That was a total lie.

387
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:45,260
Wow, I'm in for something huge, aren't I?

388
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,454
Yes, it does seem that way.

389
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:53,568
All right, then. Show me how skilled you are this time too, Ms. Ha Won.

390
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,861
The caller you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

391
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:25,267
I'm in front of your studio. I guess you're taking a day off.

392
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,839
Chief Jang from Cheongdam-dong

393
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:42,859
Shall I put the phone to your ear, ma'am?

394
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,636
Yes.

395
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,651
Hello?

396
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:55,380
Yes. Yes.

397
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,292
Well, it's best for her to be as young as possible.

398
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:01,353
But I don't like girls who are too pretty.

399
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:04,164
You understand what I mean, right?

400
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:07,792
It'll be bad if he falls for her before knowing her personality.

401
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:12,080
Of course, since I trust you, Chief Jang.

402
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,565
There's no need for him to see many women.

403
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:15,376
I want the first one to be the right one.

404
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:20,055
All right. Then, please arrange a meeting. Yes.

405
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:38,665
I think the Chairman's wife is arranging marriage meetings for her grandsons!

406
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,700
What? Marriage meetings?

407
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,561
What about me, then?

408
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:46,915
They need to marry for love if I'm ever going to have a chance with one of them!

409
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:50,277
Calm down! Don't you know how competent I am?

410
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:53,872
I took down the number of the person setting this up!

411
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,932
Really?

412
00:31:55,932 --> 00:31:59,127
All we have to do is swap you in on the day of the marriage meeting.

413
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,763
Don't underestimate your mother.

414
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:04,475
Just take care of your skin, in the meantime,

415
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:06,952
while fantasizing about which of the Kang Cousins you'll be seeing first!

416
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:07,853
Got it?

417
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:12,250
I wonder who will it be? It'll probably be Kang Hyeon Min, right?

418
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,077
Oh my gosh!

419
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:17,045
Mom, do a face mask for me when you get home later!

420
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:21,667
See? I bring you so much good luck!

421
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:26,363
Shall I prepare dinner, Queen Mother?

422
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:30,768
Just go and buy more nail polish remover, my daughter.

423
00:32:30,768 --> 00:32:33,979
This mother of yours used all of it this morning!

424
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,687
Do you think that the boys will want to come with me?

425
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:45,132
I'm sure that it's possible, if you're the one to do it.

426
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:49,469
You're the best, Ajussi!

427
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:54,766
Aw, man.

428
00:32:57,135 --> 00:32:59,438
Yes, this is Lee Yoon Seong.

429
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:04,568
No, thank you.

430
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:07,086
Goodbye.

431
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,410

00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:27,550
Hey, why didn't you pick up?

445
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,962
Why are you calling me, when we live in the same house?

446
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:31,347
Why are you so late—

447
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:33,880
♫  I didn't know your everything was mine ♫

448
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:39,246
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

449
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,252
Um, I have something to ask you.

450
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:51,666
Let's go on a trip. All of us.

451
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:56,830
Come on! Let's go on a trip together! We can sightsee and eat delicious food!

452
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,432
Eun Ha Won

453
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:01,443
The phone call is over.

454
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,567
Sheesh!

455
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,242
Ja Yeong!

456
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,268
I knew that you'd forget your things and leave.

457
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:28,470
What happened, exactly?

458
00:35:29,488 --> 00:35:32,858
Kang Seo Woo came all the way here to look for you!

459
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:35,844
Oh, um... there was a bit of a misunderstanding.

460
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:40,206
You're back at Haneul House now, then?

461
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,517
Yeah.

462
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,780
Diploma

463
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,268
Thank goodness. I'll show this to Mom!

464
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:55,447
Yeah, you should, considering the uproar you caused to get it!

465
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,835
Did I, now?

466
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:03,839
Sheesh. Stop smiling! You'll make me less mad at you.

467
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,374
What?

468
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,260
Thanks, Friend!

469
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,364
You know you don't need to thank me.

470
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:14,966
You know...

471
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:22,750
No way! What is this?

472
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,434
Is this Kang Seo Woo?

473
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:28,647
This is how Kang Seo Woo escaped our school in one piece!

474
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,399
I orchestrated this whole plan myself.

475
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,677
He went out... looking like this?

476
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:36,972
This makes my heart skip a beat...

477
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:44,680
to see my Seo Woo wearing the uniform that I wore every day for three years!

478
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:49,668
But, isn't this a bit much? This is just way too weird.

479
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,613
Consider it an honor that I'm showing you this!

480
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,173
If other people saw this, it would cause a lot of trouble!

481
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:57,718
Yeah, just keep that and pass it down as your family heirloom, why don't you?

482
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:03,664
Ja Yeong. Can you send me those photos?

483
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:04,674
Why?

484
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,478
I'll use them to make Kang Seo Woo do what I want.

485
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,847
What?

486
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:13,575
Hey, what's with that scary look in your eyes?

487
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:16,553
Hey, it's nothing like that! Come on, send them to me!

488
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:18,972
No. Never!

489
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,062
Then you come, too.

490
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:27,764
Where?

491
00:37:27,764 --> 00:37:30,042
Oh, just a certain somewhere.

492
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:44,857
He didn't get caught with nudes or anything like that, did he?

493
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:46,967
No, no.

494
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,936
Damn that punk!

495
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,403
I came here alone, as I promised.

496
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,563
Where are the goods?

497
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:25,689
Um... what is it that you want?

498
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:28,100
It would've been better if these were just nudes!

499
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,852
It's nothing major.

500
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,558
It's just as I expected.

501
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:40,078
How much money do you want? How much, huh?

502
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:42,781
- How much?
- I don't need money.

503
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,108
What?

504
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:49,154
All you have to do is clear Seo Woo's schedule for the next three days.

505
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:52,157
Three days? Just a second.

506
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:53,942
His schedule is...

507
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:05,812
That's one down!

508
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,368
I'm begging you, Doctor.

509
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:14,337
I'm in a super-serious situation right now.

510
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,366
So where do you want work done, exactly?

511
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:21,411
Everything.

512
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:23,997
Everything?

513
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:26,783
- All of it.
- All of it?

514
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:35,417
Did you see that video too, Doctor?

515
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:42,799
Well, I'm sure you understand how I must be feeling, then.

516
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:49,873
I can't walk around outside with this face anymore, Doctor.

517
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:53,160
Well, it does seem that way, but—

518
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,589
I keep getting angry, and I feel so frustrated!

519
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:02,485
Um, in my opinion,

520
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:06,957
how about you grow out your hair and see a therapist instead of getting surgery?

521
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:09,727
A... therapist?

522
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:13,572
That girl was your first love, huh?

523
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:19,044
Oh, what are you saying, Doctor? What do you mean, first love?

524
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,054
That's not it at all.

525
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:23,131
First love?

526
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,947
Somebody else is my first love.

527
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:42,943
Then...

528
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,722
Let's start dating, for real.

529
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:05,540
I'm in front of your studio. I guess you're taking the day off?

530
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,069
I'm worried about you. Call me back.

531
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:11,438
You're okay, right?

532
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,340
I'm thankful that you let me sleep over, so I want to see you.

533
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,666
Do you have time?

534
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:35,120
Sure. How about we meet at my studio?

535
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,340
I love her...

536
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,009
I love her not.

537
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:52,312
I love her...

538
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:56,691
I love her not.

539
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,971
I love her not.

540
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,860
I love her...

541
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,562
Sheesh.

542
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:11,690
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min! What are you doing?

543
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,158
I love her...

544
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:16,628
Don't talk to me. You'll distract me.

545
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:18,380
I love her not.

546
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,333
Hey, what's wrong with you? Seriously!

547
00:42:22,576 --> 00:42:24,578
Damn it, this is driving me crazy.

548
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:26,255
I love her not.

549
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:28,090
I can't leave you like this.

550
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:32,069
Kang Hyeon Min! Let's go on a trip together!

551
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:33,345
I love her...

552
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:37,991
Should I make a formal apology on YouTube for the entire country to see?

553
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:42,145
- Hey, Kang Hyeon Min!
- I love her not.

554
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,650
I love her...

555
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,862
Who are you thinking about while doing this?

556
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,744
I love her not.

557
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:02,165
Should I give him a shock to shake him out of this?

558
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,051
I love her...

559
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:19,157
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min!

560
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,351
I love her not.

561
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:51,156
Hye Ji

562
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,247
Why aren't you answering my calls? I'm going to your studio.

563
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,487
Wow, this place is so cool, too.

564
00:44:14,212 --> 00:44:17,991
So... you went back to Haneul House?

565
00:44:18,842 --> 00:44:23,271
Yeah. It just turned out that way.

566
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,924
I felt like I had to tell you.

567
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:31,646
Won't it make you uncomfortable to live with Hyeon Min?

568
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:35,634
Or maybe Hyeon Min would feel more uncomfortable?

569
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:40,789
So you saw that video too, huh?

570
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:42,474
Yeah.

571
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:46,937
I don't want you to misunderstand. There's nothing going on between us.

572
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,522
Good job.

573
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:52,768
Hyeon Min should experience getting rejected by a girl too, for once.

574
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:55,370
Well, um, it's not that I rejected him—

575
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,856
Everyone is talking about how cool you were.

576
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:02,251
Um... it's not like that. It's just—

577
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:06,289
It's not like you confessed, so you shouldn't feel sorry toward me.

578
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:08,275
So don't worry about it.

579
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:11,912
Yeah. Thanks.

580
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:17,959
But, is that why you wanted to see me?

581
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:24,424
Well, to be honest...

582
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:27,060
Ji Woon

583
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:52,211
I have a favor to ask of you.

584
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:55,672
Want to go on a trip together?

585
00:45:56,707 --> 00:45:57,691
A trip?

586
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:03,972
Yeah. You, me, Kang Hyeon Min, Kang Ji Woon, and Kang Seo Woo.

587
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,678
To be honest, I kind of have to get them to agree to go on a trip together.

588
00:46:09,678 --> 00:46:11,571
Where are you going?

589
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:13,982
Apparently, it's a vacation home that the people from Haneul Group use.

590
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:15,292
They say it's really nice!

591
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:16,343
A vacation home?

592
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:21,097
Getting them all to come with me on my own would be impossible.

593
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:23,842
That's true.

594
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,244
Exactly.

595
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:32,008
And if you say that you're coming, I think they'll come.

596
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:36,463
Kang Ji Woon and Hyeon Min, I mean.

597
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:45,973
Sorry. I guess I shouldn't have said anything.

598
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:48,900
Eun Ha Won.

599
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:51,854
Do you really have to go this far?

600
00:46:53,572 --> 00:46:55,974
Um, well, I just...

601
00:46:56,959 --> 00:46:58,877
I'll come.

602
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:01,196
Let's go on that trip together, then.

603
00:47:02,547 --> 00:47:04,432
And you come too.

604
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:06,643
I already said that I wasn't going.

605
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:11,290
Why do you have to be this way?

606
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,225
I was worried about you.

607
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:25,328
Sorry. I'll be going.

608
00:47:26,488 --> 00:47:28,690
I'll say this again.

609
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:33,261
I'm not going.

610
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:50,145
Are you really going to go?

611
00:47:51,263 --> 00:47:53,206
What, I can't?

612
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:57,994
- You—
- I've thought about this for a while.

613
00:47:57,994 --> 00:48:05,152
Should I like the fact that Hyeon Min got rejected, or be jealous?

614
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:07,846
Again with that? Stop dwelling on it so much!

615
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:11,099
Let's go on that trip together.

616
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:13,885
Why do you want to go?

617
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:18,899
I want to go visit Haneul Group's vacation home again.

618
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:21,985
You've been there before?

619
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:25,948
I went there a couple of times when I was younger,

620
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,660
with Hyeon Min and our families.

621
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,873
I'm really not up for it.

622
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:39,077
It's fine if you don't come if you really don't want to.

623
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:41,004
But you know, I...

624
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:45,383
I am not confident facing Hyeon Min by myself, just yet.

625
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:54,751
Of course! It's best for a woman to be as young as possible.

626
00:48:54,751 --> 00:49:00,190
And she's a woman who looks nice and modest, rather than super done-up.

627
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:04,695
Oh... her household?

628
00:49:05,787 --> 00:49:10,158
Well, she comes from an ordinary background, but she'd make a great wife.

629
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:15,747
What? Um, her occupation?

630
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:20,752
Um...

631
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:25,198
I'll call you back. Yes.

632
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:27,926
What, what?

633
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:35,058
You need to have something to offer, you know!

634
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:37,411
If you'd gotten into college, I could've said you were a student!

635
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:38,996
How could I tell him you're studying to retake college exams?

636
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:41,390
You could have said I was looking for a job!

637
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,409
- Whatever.
- What do we do now, then?

638
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:47,979
You said you'd get me into Haneul House, just like that damned Eun Ha Won!

639
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:49,723
Just wait, damn it!

640
00:49:57,864 --> 00:50:00,892
Honey! What brings you here without even telling me in advance?

641
00:50:00,892 --> 00:50:03,094
Oh, my construction job fell through.

642
00:50:03,094 --> 00:50:05,697
I missed you, Daddy!

643
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:07,349
Oh, really?

644
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:14,097
Um, about Ha Won. She hasn't come home once since that incident.

645
00:50:15,365 --> 00:50:18,160
I'm a bit tired after driving for so long.

646
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,370
I'm going to get some sleep first.

647
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,988
- Yes, do that.
- Yeah.

648
00:50:21,988 --> 00:50:24,182
What about your bag with your clothes in it?

649
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:28,712
Oh yeah. It's in the car, so grab it for me later, will you?

650
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:31,832
Okay. Go in and get some rest!

651
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:36,462
Go to the car and get Dad's bag.

652
00:50:36,462 --> 00:50:38,296
No way.

653
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:58,141
Oh, he left his phone here, too.

654
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:07,918
I found out where Kang Yeong Jin is. You're definitely paying me, right?

655
00:51:07,918 --> 00:51:09,527
Paying him?

656
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:14,224
And who's Kang Yeong Jin?

657
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:22,583
Searching for someone

658
00:51:27,905 --> 00:51:30,249
Searching for someone?

659
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:33,190
I am looking for Kang Yeong Jin, who was living in Apartment Building N° 308 at the time of the 2006 Yeongak Apartment Fire.

660
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:48,609
Ow! What?

661
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,987
What?

662
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,326
What? What?

663
00:51:59,111 --> 00:52:01,363
Here, look at this!

664
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:04,841
Kang Yeong Jin? Who is this?

665
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,818
The person that your dad is looking for.

666
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:14,392
2006, fire at Yeongak Apartments...

667
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:18,113
Yeongak Apartments? I've heard of that before.

668
00:52:18,113 --> 00:52:21,199
Eun Ha Won's mom died there because of this incident, remember?

669
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,109
Oh, yeah!

670
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:26,321
Apparently, someone that she trained with lived there.

671
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:30,783
A lot of people were saying, "Why did she die at someone else's place?"

672
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:32,669
It must have been at this man's house!

673
00:52:32,669 --> 00:52:33,737
Really?

674
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:38,825
- But, he's a man?
- Yeah!

675
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:45,791
Then, maybe this guy is Eun Ha Won's biological father?

676
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:50,854
Oh my gosh, Dad must be crazy! Why is he looking for him?

677
00:52:50,854 --> 00:52:51,772
Sheesh.

678
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,815
Don't you know what a good man your father is?

679
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:57,410
I'm sure that he's trying to find him to send her along to him.

680
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,206
Just how much money has he wasted, for her sake?

681
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,600
This pisses me off!

682
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:08,697
No.

683
00:53:08,697 --> 00:53:11,441
This is actually quite good for us.

684
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:14,052
What do you mean?

685
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,318
Shall we take this chance, and earn some money?

686
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:24,838
This can make up for the fact that you won't be able to live at Haneul House.

687
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:27,207
What are you talking about?

688
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,876
Let's use this chance

689
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:33,162
to make Eun Ha Won quit her rich girl charade, once and for all.

690
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,021
Wow. He's sleeping again?

691
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:58,405
How come all Hyeon Min does now is sleep?

692
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:03,110
He's a heavy sleeper. He wouldn't notice if someone carried him off somewhere.

693
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:07,071
- Wait, really?
- Yes.

694
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:17,124
Mom...

695
00:54:19,234 --> 00:54:25,332
I can't go to college. I'm sorry.

696
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:27,309
Eun Ha Won.

697
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,803
Do you really have to go this far?

698
00:54:29,803 --> 00:54:32,898
Well, um... that is...

699
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,409
I was worried about you.

700
00:55:05,322 --> 00:55:08,725
Kang Hyeon Min! Wake up!

701
00:55:15,198 --> 00:55:19,194
What the heck? Does he really not hear me?

702
00:55:20,437 --> 00:55:23,198
Kang Hyeon Min!

703
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:28,161
What are you doing?

704
00:55:29,346 --> 00:55:33,091
Oh. He's locked himself in his room, and won't go anywhere, so...

705
00:55:33,984 --> 00:55:36,203
Do you really think you'll complete the mission, at this rate?

706
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:38,538
Everyone will go, all right?

707
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,465
Everyone except you, anyway.

708
00:55:42,693 --> 00:55:47,305
How are you going to bring someone who has locked himself in his room?

709
00:55:49,174 --> 00:55:50,601
Are you going to kidnap him?

710
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:53,561
I'm not in the mood to joke right now.

711
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:58,958
Um, about before...

712
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:09,419
If you get him to come on the trip...

713
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:11,129
I'll come too. On the trip.

714
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,460
- Really?
- Yeah.

715
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,314
What, do you want me to pinky-swear or something?

716
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:24,968
Yeah. You better not change your mind later!

717
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:32,709
Okay!

718
00:57:03,315 --> 00:57:05,608
Kang Hyeon Min?

719
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,888
Kang Hyeon Min?

720
00:57:13,008 --> 00:57:16,511
Let's go on our trip! Please, Kang Hyeon Min?

721
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:21,483
I'll apologize to you. I was wrong!

722
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:27,747
Come on, can't you just listen to my favor? Consider it my last!

723
00:57:27,747 --> 00:57:29,424
Please?

724
00:57:29,424 --> 00:57:34,079
What the... Kang Hyeon Min!

725
00:57:35,614 --> 00:57:37,207
Kang Hyeon Min!

726
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:44,006
Kang Hyeon Min! Please?

727
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:52,080
What the... how is he in such a deep sleep?

728
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,211
Hyeon Min is such a deep sleeper that once he falls asleep,

729
00:57:58,211 --> 00:58:00,506
he wouldn't know even if someone carried him off somewhere!

730
00:58:00,506 --> 00:58:02,882
What, are you going to kidnap him, or something?

731
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:21,109
Have fun at your performance in Thailand!

732
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,780
You're coming tomorrow, right?

733
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,730
