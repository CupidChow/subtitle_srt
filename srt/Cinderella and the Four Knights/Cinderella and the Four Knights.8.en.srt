Damn it, he's so noisy.

15
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,579
Why is it so shaky? Sir, there must be a mistake!

16
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,232
This shouldn't be happening. I shouldn't be shaking around like this!

17
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,383
- This is a dream, right, Sir?
- Please have a seat.

18
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,786
Wait! Let me off! I wasn't supposed to be on this flight!

23

It's the first time I've been to a place like this!

24
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,122
Wow!

25
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:30,934
Oh, really? But hey, this isn't Thailand!

26
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,704
Sorry for deceiving you.

27
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:36,498
But why did you bring this girl?

28
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,358
What? The more the merrier!

29
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,494
- I don't like it!
- Ja Yeong!

Come on.

31
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,984
You're glad that you came too, right?

32
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,478
How could I be, when I came looking like this?

33
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:52,556
What? You look cool!

34
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:58,236
Since we came all the way here, let's have a good time.

All right.

Ta-da!

41
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:38,535
While staying together, we'll bond and get to know each other better!

42
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:43,807
Right? In other words, this trip will be a team-building trip, for all of us!

43
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,417
Team-building!

44
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:48,604
What's with the group uniforms? It's not like we're K-pop idols.

45
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:52,160
Even though you're a celebrity, seems like you don't know a lot of things yet.

We just arrived at the vacation home.

65
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,853
Ms. Ha Won prepared a lot for this trip,

66
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:57,039
but the response to her efforts is bit unenthusiastic.

67
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,107
You don't have to report with every little detail.

68
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,267
Excuse me?

69
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,496
You relax and have a good time too, Secretary Lee.

70
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:08,817
Is your health okay?

71
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,261
I should be at your side. I'm sorry.

72
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:15,866
I'm fine. So make sure you get some rest this time around, too. All right?

73
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,200
How could you check yourself into the hospital without telling anyone?

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,327
Seriously, I'm so upset!

75
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,815
The kids are all grown up now. They should be told what they need to know.

76
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:35,911
I'm sure that they won't feel good about having gone on vacation

77
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,622
when they find out later that you're very sick.

78
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:43,043
I did this so I could spend some quality time with my wife.

79
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,845
Didn't you know?

80
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:48,390
No, I didn't!

81
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:54,246
I'm not even sure those punks would be worried about me anyway.

82
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:57,124
But still, I don't want to make them come to the hospital

83
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,917
to visit an old man like me.

84
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:03,221
All right. I'll worry about you for them then.

85
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,591
It's Mom. I won't call you anymore.

86
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,610
But in exchange, could we eat a meal together, just once?

87
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:55,557
Looks like this place hasn't changed at all.

88
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,744
Hey, where are you going?

89
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,122

90

What the hell?

I'm having a good time.

00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:03,633
As if. What are you doing by yourself? Isn't that boring?

103
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,044
I'm having a ton of fun right now!

104

Hey. It's only fun when you have fun with others when you're on a trip!

105
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,201
Why do I have to do that when I already came out here?

106
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:17,506
Ms. Celebrity. I don't even have 10 days off in a year.

107
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,501
And today is one of those ten days! So don't bother me, okay?

Maybe he's on a diet?

115

Hey, are you mad because I kidnapped you?

121
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,298
I'll apologize for making you the laughingstock of the country

Hey, why did you tell me to reflect on what's in my heart, or whatever?

126
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:49,339
What would change if I truly liked you, and if I didn't?

127

Tons of things!

So what, exactly?

129
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,388
When a man and a woman really like each other, they can love one another...

130
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,916
- and start dating...
- You've never dated have you?

00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,858
What?

132
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,728
Damn it, I must have been termporarily insane!

133
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,214
A girl with zero dating experience, terrible taste in men

134
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:06,715
and old-fashioned standards when it comes to dating!

That's you, right?

I need to get some rest.

138

I'm really not the type to be too serious

139
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,301

We swam here a lot when we were younger.

You were a lot slower than me back then.

I don't know. I don't really remember.

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,200
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else?♫

162
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,960
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

Are you okay?

164
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,523
You got a cramp again, didn't you?

165
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:20,883
It's this side, right?

166

♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

Okay.

172
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,830
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

173

Thanks. I...

181
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,329
What is this? Sheesh!

182
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,381
Huh?

183
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,011
"Sour Strawberry?" Ugh. What's with these names?

184
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:25,848
What are you doing?

185
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,516
Are you looking for Ha Won?

186
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,651
Uh, no!

187
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,504
Did she, um, go somewhere, though?

188
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,531
She went out before.

189
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:35,499
Where?

190
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:36,941
I don't know.

191
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,911
"I don't know."

192
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:41,905
Sheesh. Why did she plan so much?

193
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:51,123
Then... if Eun Ha Won follows her biological dad, she'll leave Haneul House.

194
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:56,895
Of course. She wouldn't continue freeloading, if her real dad shows up?

195
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:58,755
She'll be done for then!

196
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,684
And with that, her relationship with us will be gone, too.

197
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:03,568
Huh?

198
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,421
It's not like she's your dad's biological daughter.

199
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:09,007
So her relationship with your dad would be over, too!

200
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:12,527
Then, we'll never have to look at her dumb face again!

201
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,721
Let's hurry and send her to her real dad!

202
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,733
Just wait. They said they would text me the address.

203
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,698
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

204
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,885
Address of Construction Site: Sangam-dong 1884, Mapo-gu, Seoul

205
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,204
All right!

206
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,525
I'm going to screw over that girl we're not related to whatsoever!

207
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,569
And I'm going to get back every penny that I wasted on raising her

208
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:38,904
if it's the last thing I do!

209
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,364
Good luck, Mom!

210
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,159
I'm going to get it all!

211
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,194
Let's send Eun Ha Won away to her real dad!

212
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,222
- Yes!
- Yeah!

213
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:59,299

217
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:13,071
Does it taste that good? All right, then, eat! Here!

218
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,457
Say "ah!"

219

- Does that taste good?
- Yeah!

220
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:20,620
Your kimbap is the best!

221
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,564
Oh, really, now?

222
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:23,649

No, this is mine!

What does that mean?

238
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,998
Divert your enemy's attention elsewhere!

239
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,993
That's right. Make sure you keep that in mind from now on!

Yeah!

256
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,270
Why did she make this sort of thing? It makes me feel bad for no reason.

257

Here, eat this!

258

What are you doing?

259
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,419
You call this "experiencing horseback riding?"

260
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,213
For me, this much counts as horseback riding.

261
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,792
I thought you wanted us to follow the schedule.

262
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:27,114
Well, I thought all of you probably have ridden before.

263
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,782
Let's go then. To experience horseback riding, that is.

264
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:32,085
Wait, no! I've never ridden a horse before!

265
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,421
You're not following your own schedule?

266
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,515
No! No! Please! Please, spare me!

267
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,493
You can't do that.

268
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:55,375
Enjoying freedom!

What?

271
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:06,603
Are you happy, enjoying your freedom and all that? Huh?

272
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:11,408
Of course. I am a bit annoyed that you and Eun Ha Won tricked me.

273
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:14,094
But it's been so long since I've taken a break, so this is awesome!

274
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,064
Do you even know how you managed to get this awesome break of yours?

275
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,041
What are you saying?

276
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,819
You traded your image in exchange for that freedom!

Wow, I didn't expect that you would be this scared.

280
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,008
Hey, it's obviously because this is my first time.

281
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,026
Let's slow down, please!

282
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,219
We're already going super slow as it is.

Should I speed up?

No, no, no. Hey, are you actually good at horseback riding?

Stuff for a barbecue. Can you get this set up?

301

What about you?

302
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,833
I'm going to go to the supermarket. I don't think we have enough food.

303
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,303
Damn it. Why don't we just buy food? This is too much effort.

Oh, my necklace! What should I do?

What?

313
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:29,079
I guess it fell off while we were horseback riding before!

314

You go on ahead.

♫  I can't take my eyes off of you. ♫

319
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,255
Is it important to you?

320
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,240
It belonged to my mom.

321
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,720
♫  Whisper which is heard by my close mind ♫

322
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,580
♫  Softly melts me. ♫

323
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,040
♫  My Shining Destiny ♫

324
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,251
What will you do for me if I find it for you?

325
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,619
What?

326
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:04,180
If I find it first, you have to grant me a wish!

327
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,575
♫  My dream's Romeo ♫

328
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,285
Hey, what kind of deal is that?

329
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,813
I wonder what I should ask for?

330
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:14,508
Oh, geez.

331
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:19,080
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

332
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,770
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? ♫

333
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,400
Hey.

334
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,527
You. You didn't show that photo to anyone, right?

335
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:28,997
I only showed Ha Won.

336
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:32,209
How close are you to Ha Won?

337
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,328
We've been best friends since middle school.

338
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,640
Then, you two know each other well, right?

339
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,101
Of course. There's nothing that I don't know about her.

340
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,604
Is her family doing that badly?

341
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,822
They're not super-poor, but

342
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:48,308
her stepmom never gives her any money.

343
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,186
That's why she has a crazy amount of part-time jobs.

344
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,215
And about her unni, Yoo Na. Why is she such a mean person?

345
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:58,310
Choi Yoo Na? Ugh, don't even get me started.

346
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,146
She's a piece of work, for sure!

347
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:04,858
She takes advantage of Ha Won like crazy, stereotypical stepsister.

348
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,928
What about Ha Won's dad? He just sits and watches as this happens?

349
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:11,873
He leaves the city a lot so he's not home a lot.

350
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,201
But honestly, the worst part of it all is that

351
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,204
her stepmom said Choi Yoo Na deserves her own room

352
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,882
so Ha Won is forced to sleep on the balcony.

353
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,700
- What? The balcony?
- Yes!

354
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,302
What?

355
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:30,900
Wow, that's terrible! Right?

356
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,105
Um, yes. They were way too mean to her.

357
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:42,212
But, um, has Eun Ha Won dated a lot?

358
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:47,201
Dated? As if! She's never dated in her life!

359
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,720
Really? Then, her ideal type—

360
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:54,533
Um, what's her ideal type of guy?

361
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:56,518
She doesn't have anything like that.

362
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:58,437
When would she have the time to develop an ideal type

363
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:01,122
when she's busy just trying to get by?

364
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:04,601
But, you seem to have a lot of interest in Ha Won.

365
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:09,515
Huh? Oh, well, that's... that's because we live together.

366
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,925
Well, figures.

367
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,796
But you know, Ha Won is quite a pitiful child.

368
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,023
Please be good to her.

369
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,492
Sorry. This is all because of me.

370
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,504
What do you mean?

371
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:44,341
You only came here because of Hye Ji, right?

372
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:48,011
And who is the person who tried to take advantage of that again?

373
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:51,681
I told you, it's not like that!

374
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,699
When I left Haneul House, Hye Ji let me sleep over at her place for one night.

375
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:05,195
Out of gratitude, I asked her to come with us.

376
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,032
And it was the first time I slept over at a friend's house, too.

377
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,879
It felt like we really became friends, and that made me happy.

378
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,900
This wasn't because it was a part of the Chairman's mission.

379
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,244
I really just wanted her to come with us!

380
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:25,424
Sure, okay.

381
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,485
Good job.

382
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:36,943
Oh man, my necklace! Where is it?

383
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,464
If only I hadn't talked so much with you...

384
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,803
I told you that I'd find it for you, didn't I?

385
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,114
Think about what kind of wish you'll be granting me.

386
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,409
Um... I'll clean your room for you.

387
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,621
I'll do your laundry!

388
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,107
I'm going to go.

389
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,633
Wait, no!

390
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,794
I'll do whatever you tell me to!

391
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,881
- Really?
- Yeah!

392
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:25,834
My necklace!

393
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,229
- You found it!
- Hey!

394
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,660
Hey, thank you. Thank you.

395
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:56,790
What is this? He works at a construction site?

396
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:05,499
Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang Yeong Jin!

397
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:07,350
- Yes?
- Come here for a second!

398
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,035
Just a moment.

399
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:14,216
Get one in this size to Mr. Kim on the third floor.

400
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:15,558
Yes, sir.

401
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:25,502
You're Mr. Kang Yeong Jin, right?

402
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,929
Who... are you?

403
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,800
Geez, she's really too much.

404
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,497
Her father is here like this, and yet she's playing house with some rich kids?

405
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:48,817
Who are you? What are you saying?

406
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:52,654
I'm the one who raised that kid, Eun Ha Won. I'm her stepmom.

407
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,198
Raised whom?

408
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:58,402
Eun Ha Won! Your daughter!

409
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,053
Listen, lady.

410
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:03,824
Why are you telling me about a so-called daughter, when I'm a bachelor?

411
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:08,820
What, you still couldn't forget Park Ok Seon, so you didn't get married?

412
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,248
What did you just say?

413
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:13,551
Did you just say, Park Ok Seon?

414
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:16,528
Yes! Park Ok Seon!

415
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:20,515
The woman that you ran the Tae Kwon Do dojo with ten years ago!

416
00:27:21,825 --> 00:27:25,821
I didn't even know that she was your daughter and raised her all this time!

417
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:28,998
Who said that she's my daughter?

418
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:32,703
I already looked into everything, so there's no need to play dumb!

419
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:36,006
You and Ha Won's mom had that kind of relationship, right?

420
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:38,717
- Just who said—
- You know,

421
00:27:38,717 --> 00:27:42,738
my husband is such a kind man that he tried to forget that for yten years

422
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:45,198
and raised Ha Won as his own!

423
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:48,602
But now that I know, I won't stand for it anymore!

424
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:50,779
Um, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

425
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:55,192
I'm the one who misunderstood, thinking she was my husband's kid!

426
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:59,095
Do you know how much we went through raising her when we're so poor?

427
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,589
I felt so annoyed that I raised someone else's kid as my own

428
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:03,267
and was going to demand money from you!

429
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:09,648
But oh, I don't think that's right. Just take the kid, already.

430
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:12,084
I told you, it wasn't like that.

431
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:15,112
I'm telling you, this isn't the time for you to be denying the facts!

432
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:19,208
That kid wanted to pave her own way in life and got in with Haneul Group

433
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,294
and is trying her hardest to become the wife of some rich guy!

434
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:25,180
And she doesn't even know that her dad is in this sort of state!

435
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,916
Wow, what a shameless girl.

436
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:31,078
Even if you two didn't know about each other before,

437
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:33,580
you, her biological father, is alive and well now!

438
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,467
So you need to get her the hell out of Haneul House! Isn't that right?

439
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:46,810
Damn it!

440
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,579
I couldn't even get any money from him!

441
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:53,400
At this point, I'd be happy enough if he just got Eun Ha Won out of Haneul House!

442
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,896
Hello?

443
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:13,103
I told you, give me until the end of this month!

444
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:16,406
I said I'll repay you! And I will!

445
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,784
Yes.

446
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,529
Thanks for finding my necklace for me.

447
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:45,702
Is this all I get in return?

448
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:49,915
Hey, don't you know how delicious this is?

449
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:53,844
But, what's with the necklace?

450
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:58,941
Oh, this? It's a ring.

451
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:00,592
A keepsake, from my mom.

452
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:03,019
Was it her wedding ring?

453
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:08,250
No, I don't think so, since Dad doesn't have one.

454
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:13,605
But I think that this was something that was really important to my mom.

455
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:19,119
Apparently, she was holding this tight in her hand when she passed away.

456
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:24,140
My mom didn't leave anything behind.

457
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:29,037
She left you behind.

458
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,026
Ugh, that gave me goosebumps.

459
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:37,379
Never mind, then. Sheesh.

460
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:40,382
I'm going on ahead!

461
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,243
Hey.

462
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:44,511
Let's go together!

463
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:04,072
I'll bet that he doesn't even have any clothes.

464
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,795
What are you doing?

465
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,423
Well, you got wet before because of me, so...

466
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,384
Whatever. I can just dry them and wear them later.

467
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,013
Don't do that. Borrow Ji Woon's clothes or something.

468
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,906
No thanks.

469
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:32,217
If you're here to hang out with Ji Woon, hang out with him

470
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,102
and leave me alone.

471
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:37,797
I came here because of you.

472
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,377
It's been ten years since we last came here.

473
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:46,890
Doesn't this make you feel anything, to come here with me?

474
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:52,496
No. All of this means nothing to me.

475
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,707
I went to check it out before...

476
00:31:56,433 --> 00:32:00,562
And it's still there. That wooden bench, I mean.

477
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,677
I really wanted to come back here.

478
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,387
But...

479
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,624
you're the same as ever.

480
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,390
♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

481
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:22,390
Yeah. So you should stop this, already.

482
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,810
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

483
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,100
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

484
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:38,670
♫  on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

485
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,580
Why did we have to come here, of all places?

486
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,090
♫  I can't live without you ♫

487
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,183
Hye Ji!

488
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:13,343
Oh. I'll head back first.

489
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:26,798
What's the matter?

490
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:31,795
Park Hye Ji.

491
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:34,139
What's wrong? What's with the serious expression?

492
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:39,769
You know... I had some expectations for this trip.

493
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:44,124
I thought about it, and it's like I didn't do anything up until now

494
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:48,470
and yet got upset that Hyeon Min never even glanced my way.

495
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:56,478
But... things aren't working out as I want them to.

496
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,220
You're pretty enough as you are.

497
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,660
Just continue being yourself.

498
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:32,531
All of the preparations have been made, Chairman.

499
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,791
No, not yet.

500
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,459
Excuse me?

501
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:38,111
I've gotten myself more family members

502
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,697
and things have gotten more complicated because of that.

503
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:44,376
I think that I'll have to get my will rewritten.

504
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,486
Yes, sir.

505
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:55,062
I hear that many executives have been seeking you out lately, Lawyer Kim.

506
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:57,698
Excuse me?

507
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:00,484
Oh. Well...

508
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:05,797
I think it'd be best to make a decision quickly regarding this

509
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:09,726
since the future of the company is at stake.

510
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:13,238
I'll have to choose a successor soon enough.

511
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:35,952
Oh, hello, Madame! I'm Lawyer Kim.

512
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:40,090
I couldn't make it to your wedding because I was on a business trip.

513
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,843
Oh! Lawyer Kim!

514
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:46,396
I've heard a lot about you from the Chairman.

515
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:50,825
Oh, yes. I just met with the Chairman, and am on my way out.

516
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,045
It must have been an urgent matter you two were meeting about.

517
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:54,171
I mean, you came here without prior notice.

518
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:56,957
The Chairman called me here all of a sudden, so...

519
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:01,178
I'll be seeing you again.

520
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:05,841
I feel as if we'll be seeing each other often, don't you think?

521
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:11,188
Oh, yes.

522
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,057
Why are you so late, ma'am?

523
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,601
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Something urgent came up.

524
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,578
Haneul Group's Chairman's wife will be coming in today, right?

525
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,113
No, she canceled her reservation.

526
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,123
Oh, really?

527
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,508
Please go to the VIP room.

528
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:34,962
The wives of the chairmen of Jaeil Group and Joonmyeong Group are both there.

529
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:36,421
Okay, okay!

530
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:43,871
Then, Samjin Group and S Group are going to be linked by marriage, now?

531
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:47,416
Apparently, they're keeping their wedding preparations a secret.

532
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:50,886
They're calling it a marriage, but it's just a merger and acquisition.

533
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:53,088
Well, of course. It's always like that.

534
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:57,767
But, isn't it about time to get Yeo Jin married, too?

535
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,479
There aren't any guys who are worthy of her.

536
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:04,191
I'd only marry her off if it was someone like one of the Kang Cousins.

537
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:11,314
Ow! Hey, stop massaging me so hard!

538
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,960
Well, it's true that every mother wants her daughter to get married into the Haneul Group.

539
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,978
But, I don't feel like I'd really want to, you know?

540
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:21,182
I mean, Chairman Kang just got remarried, and his wife is... meh.

541
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:23,869
You think so?

542
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:27,447
- Oh, did you hear?
- What?

543
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:31,210
Apparently, this isn't Madam Ji of Haneul Group's first marriage!

544
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,096
Oh, no way! They said that she was unmarried before she married him!

545
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:36,865
Isn't that why people were talking about it so much?

546
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,434
Because he was marrying a virgin?

547
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:41,011
That's what I'm saying! She lied to him, in order to get married to him!

548
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,771
Apparently, the housekeeper at the Chairman of Jangwon Group's home

549
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:45,598
used to live next door to Madame Ji a long time ago

550
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:48,602
and she said that Madam Ji was definitely a newlywed then!

551
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,772
Geez, how could you believe some housekeeper's gossip?

552
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:58,895
Wait... hasn't that housekeeper worked for that family for a long time?

553
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,257
So she must be trustworthy.

554
00:38:02,257 --> 00:38:03,450
Right?

555
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:07,662
Do you think she would've made something like that up?

556
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,846
Hello? Are you here?

557
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:29,451
This one with the red cap is rice wine that I made myself

558
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:33,055
and this one with the yellow cap is freshly-squeezed milk from the farm.

559
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:35,331
Please, have a taste.

560
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,067
Thank you.

561
00:38:41,396 --> 00:38:43,315
Also, I need to speak to you for a bit, Sir.

562
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:44,516
Yes, of course.

563
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:49,696
The one with the red cap is rice wine and the one with the yellow cap is milk.

564
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,700
My necklace!

565
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:21,320
Hey, why did you come in here?

566
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,355
You should've locked the door, then.

567
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:26,016
I did!

568
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,844
It was unlocked when I came in though.

569
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:30,662
Oh, it must be broken.

570
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:33,040
Whatever.

571
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,135
Why are you washing your face so vigorously, though?

572
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:38,862
Mind your own business

573
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:43,650
Yeah, you're right. I should.

574
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:58,498
How is it that the look in his eyes totally changed after seeing Hye Ji?

575
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,410
♫ Hey! ♫

576
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,380
♫  When you speak I, ♫

577

587
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:15,392
Hey, Kang Hyeon Min! Are you showering?

588
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:19,021
What the... what's going on?

589
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,815
I'm just here to look for my phone.

590
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:29,447
Hey... what are you doing?

591
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,700
No! Oh my gosh, what the hell?

592
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,703
Are you okay?

593
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:37,230
No!

594
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,793
Hey!

595
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:47,065
Um, I'm sorry, but can you get out?

596
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,468
Sorry.

597
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,127

Um... the door... is broken, so...

601
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:24,720
I was here... just in case someone else tried to go in.

602
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,189
Oh... oh.

603
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:28,799

606
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,595

- No, no. You go.

607
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:42,546
No! You go ahead!

608
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:44,180
All right, I'll go ahead, then.

Man, what do I do?

612
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,839
- Oh man.
- Hey, the barbecue...

613
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,183
What's the matter? Are you feeling hot?

614
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:06,895
Um, well... I just took a shower, so...

615
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:09,314
There's some milk in the fridge. Have some of that!

616
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:11,383
After all, drinking milk after a shower is the best!

617
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,477
Thank you!

618
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:17,656
Hey, the one with the yellow lid is milk!

619
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:33,138
We're all ready now!

620
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:34,781
- I'll get the others.
- Okay.

621
00:43:38,802 --> 00:43:41,388
Oh, it's Mr. Yoon Seong!

622
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,108
Are you... not feeling well, miss?

623
00:43:44,108 --> 00:43:49,888
Yes, I do! I totally do! Like, totally.

624
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:52,282
Then what seems to be the trouble?

625
00:43:52,282 --> 00:43:54,768
- You, Mister.
- Me?

626
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:59,097
Yes! Why do you keep talking to me so formally?

627
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:03,252
That's... due to the Chairman's orders.

628
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:05,170
The same damn "Chairman's order" excuse you always give me!

629
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,813
Hey, what's with Ms. Celebrity?

630
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:12,719
Sheesh, you're so stuffy! You're no fun at all!

631
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,483
Just ignore the Chairman's orders, and speak to me comfortably!

632
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:20,285
Speak comfortably to me!

633
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,312
Pardon?

634
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:27,792
Geez. Are you going to do it, or not?

635
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,255
I'll... do my best to try.

636
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:35,108
No, don't just try! Do it! Do it!

637
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:37,010
All right, try it! Say, "Ha Won!"

638
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,828
Come on.

639
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,448
Ha... Won...

640
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:45,752
What's with her? She's acting like she's drunk!

641
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:49,856
This is rice wine.

642
00:44:54,586 --> 00:44:57,147
Hey! Hey, Kang Seo Woo!

643
00:44:57,147 --> 00:44:58,390
Is this that funny to you?

644
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,385
Yeah. You're being so funny right now!

645
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:06,674
Was hanging out by yourself that much fun?

646
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:09,017
I didn't have a fun time at all by myself, though.

647
00:45:09,017 --> 00:45:11,753
Oh, you had to play by yourself, Ms. Celebrity?

648
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:17,492
Yeah! You all wouldn't play with me, so I had to keep myself company!

649
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,881
It was a dream of mine to go on a trip with my friends, too.

650
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:25,726
I've never done anything like this!

651
00:45:26,576 --> 00:45:29,313
I was looking forward to it so much, too.

652
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:32,015
But you wouldn't even hang out with me!

653
00:45:32,015 --> 00:45:35,903
Hey, I'm following your schedule and got the barbecue all ready okay?

654
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:40,073
Oh, whatever! This is recreational time, right now!

655
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:44,686
It was my dream to wear matching jackets with other people in my major

656
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:47,514
and going on a team-building retreat with them, in college.

657
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:53,420
Looky here. Ta-da! Ta-da! Ta-da!

Hey, girlfriend! Switch seats with me.

Hey, why are you calling me your girlfriend?

706
00:48:10,173 --> 00:48:12,884
We weren't really engaged!

707
00:48:12,884 --> 00:48:17,631
All you were to me was my employer.

708
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:20,651
Wait, you two weren't actually engaged?

709
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:24,721
Why are we playing the Truth Game now, all of a sudden?

Hey, I'm a victim here, too!

Thanks to you, everyone in the world knows what I look like!

712

People keep recognizing me on the street!

713

Damn it!

715
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:45,509
Well, it's true that you're a bit of an idiot.

You go around playing with me too.

Seo Woo!

731
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,864
I'll wash your sweats for you!

732
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,429
Maybe he went to the bathroom?

733
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,674
Hey, School Uniform!

734
00:50:13,071 --> 00:50:15,032
What were you just doing?

735
00:50:15,032 --> 00:50:19,494
Seo Woo, did you start having feelings for someone?

736
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:22,097
What are you saying?

737
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:25,216
Your lyrics are different than they were before.

738
00:50:25,216 --> 00:50:27,544
How do you know that, when I'm not even done with them?

739
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:30,831
There's nothing that I don't know about you.

740
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:33,825
I've been a fan of yours since your busking days.

741
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:39,531
You're loved by thousands and thousands of people, so don't date anyone, okay?

742
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:41,917
You can't like anyone, either!

743
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,710
Got that?

744
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:49,091
What is she saying?

745
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:58,792
I didn't know that when you smile, I smile too.

746
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:01,078
Your smile is like a white rose I wait for you every morning.

747
00:51:01,078 --> 00:51:03,981
My feet keep on trying to take me to where you are.

748
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,825
Sub-title: To Ha Won

749
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,028
Hey, you...

750
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:42,085
Stay here a bit longer.

751
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,039
Did you drink a lot?

752
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:04,041
No.

753
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,587
Thanks for before.

754
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,758
For rescuing me from the pool, I mean.

755
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:17,704
I told you, anyone else would've done the same.

756
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:24,920
Would the situation really have been the same if it'd been someone else?

757
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:49,402
I'll have to be sure to warm up properly next time.

758
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:54,007
Yeah. Do that, instead of inconveniencing others.

759
00:52:56,944 --> 00:53:01,306
We really used to come here a lot, when we were young.

760
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:08,555
Your family and my family would come here together, too

761
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:12,492
Yeah, we did. My dad liked this place.

762
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:18,840
Yeah. Your dad made us a wooden swing over there, too.

763
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,868
It's gone now.

764
00:53:21,777 --> 00:53:23,420
Hyeon Min loves Hye Ji

765
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,705
This is still here, though.

766
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:34,055
Do you remember...

767
00:53:34,055 --> 00:53:37,676
how my brother, Jeong Hyeon, teased us for being childish when we did this?

768
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:43,106
He used to be jealous about the fact that we were close.

769
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:47,510
And yet, he was the most childish one among us.

770
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:57,362
Nowadays, I find myself wanting to go back to those times a lot.

771
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:02,451
Not me.

772
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:05,570
I'm perfectly happy with the present.

773
00:54:07,472 --> 00:54:12,460
Kang Hyeon Min used to be a kind child when he was young.

774
00:54:14,438 --> 00:54:17,424
Why does it feel like all you do now is keep secrets from me?

775
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,677
I don't know what you're talking about.

776
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:25,015
Life is complicated enough as it is. Why keep secrets?

777
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:29,152
Then why did you act like you forgot about this spot?

778
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:34,733
Oh, that...

779
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:43,867
I just took a walk because I couldn't fall asleep, and I ended up here.

780
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:47,070
This doesn't mean anything.

781
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:02,018
Remember? We'd draw this on each others' hands when we couldn't fall asleep

782
00:55:02,018 --> 00:55:04,387
so that we wouldn't have any nightmares.

783
00:55:05,614 --> 00:55:07,366
All done.

784
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,380
♫  My heart hurts so much, ♫

785
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,990
All done.

786
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:30,750
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

787
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,459
Here, the two of us...

788
00:55:35,394 --> 00:55:38,012
I don't remember.

789
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:43,910
♫  Tears fall endlessly. ♫

790
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:51,080
♫  If you extend your arm, you could almost reach me. ♫

791
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:57,000
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

792
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,500
♫  Even if my heart were worn away I can't go ♫

793
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,590
♫  on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

794
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,670
♫  I can't live without you ♫

795
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:21,960
♫  If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

796
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,060
♫  You've become someone  ♫

797
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,013
You still don't remember?

798
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,260
♫ who can't give back ♫

799
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,352
Then...

800
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:37,789
can I like other guys now?

801
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:39,475
Why are you asking me a question like that?

802
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,460
♫  The one thing my tears say is ♫

803
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,630
Even if that other person is Kang Ji Woon?

804
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,450
♫  do you hear my love? ♫

805
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:11,781
I love you.

806
00:57:14,426 --> 00:57:16,761
Get lost!

807
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,701
I love you!

808
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:31,326
Get lost!

809
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:36,373
I said that I love you!

810
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:46,241
Really?

811
00:57:50,445 --> 00:57:52,238
Yeah.

812
00:58:06,503 --> 00:58:07,863
Hey!

813
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,616
Geez, why were you so surprised?

814
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,508
Who poured you this much wine?

815
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,050
Hey, that's mine.

816
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,070
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

817
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,960
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

818
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,980
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie pointing only at you ♫

819
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,030
♫  Why did you show up now? ♫

820
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,920
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

821
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,570
♫  I've bet my everything on you ♫

822
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,660
♫  You are so precious. ♫

823
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,670
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫

824
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,598
What did you just do?

825
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,850
♫  Even If I secretly must close my eyes ♫

826
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,002
Did you just kiss me?

827
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:07,060
No, you kissed me!

828
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,330
♫  my love love love. ♫

829
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,802
All right. Let's do that one more time.

830
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:15,040
♫  My love is growing bigger every day. ♫

831
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,870
♫  Truly you're the only one I know. ♫

832
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:20,860
♫  You're the only one for me. ♫

833
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,840
♫  Look only at me yet. ♫

834
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,680
♫  Even if the world is ending, I will run ♫

835
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,020
♫  So that I can protect you. ♫

836
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,830
♫  I'm the only one for you ♫

837
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,830
♫  I like it when you smile ♫

838
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,340
♫  I will only dream as brightly as you ♫

839
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,390
♫  I will love you with everything I've got ♫

840
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,440
♫  A jealous and petty spat ♫

841
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,970
♫  That's not a problem ♫

842
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,650
♫  Even though every start is clumsy and awkward ♫

843
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,030
♫  To the contrary I will be strong ♫

844
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,380
♫  Love is always a paradox ♫

845
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,750
♫  Whether it's serious or not ♫

846
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,960
♫  It is a restraint ♫
