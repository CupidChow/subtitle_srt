Here.

12
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,139
What is this?

13
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,907
Don't you see?

14
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,590

21

Of course I am!

30
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,545
I was going to marry the woman who gives me both of the chicken wings.

31
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:28,715
Well, I was going to marry the guy who gives me both of the drumsticks!

32
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,870
All you have to do is be with them, and smile with them.

33
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,882
Just like you're doing now.

34
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,952
There you go again, writing lyrics to another love song.

35
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,810

Where are you right now?

52
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,238
I have to see Grandfather. Where is he?

53
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,717
Where are you right now?

54
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,602
I'm heading toward the company.

55
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,821
Is Grandfather at home? Or is he at the company?

56
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,673
Neither.

57
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,450
- Where is he, then--
- He...

58
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,945
Collapsed.

59
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:48,313
What?

60
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,854
Um, where is Chairman Kang Jung Du?

61
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:57,656
I heard that he collapsed.

62
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:01,426
The Chairman was taken directly to the ICU.

63
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,529
The... ICU?

64
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,324
Oh no... is his condition really bad?

65
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:08,600
What happened?

66
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:10,769
Right now--

67
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:14,189
Where's Doctor Park? He's supposed to be here.

68
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,259
Doctor Park went back to his office not too long ago.

69
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,449
It's been a while.

70
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:29,288
What'll happen to the Chairman?

71
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,707
What will we do?

72
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,775
This is all my fault.

73
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,137
What do you mean by that?

74
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,132
What do you mean that this is your fault?

75
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:46,480
I disobeyed the Chairman and started dating Ji Woon.

76
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,201
The Chairman was very angry about that.

77
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,672
So... so, because of me...

78
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,033
What?

79
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,771
I met with the Chairman not too long ago...

80
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,824
If he became like this after I saw him, then...

81
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:11,663
You... what have you done?

82
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:13,665
Excuse me?

83
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,561
How dare some girl like you...

84
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:21,848
what did you say to him, that he's like that now?

85
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,276
I... um...

86
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:28,538
Do you even know what kind of condition the Chairman is in right now?

87
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,267
He's fighting for his life because of liver cancer.

88
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,704
He has no hope if he doesn't get a transplant!

89
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,082
Our only hope is finding a compatible donor for him.

90
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,768
And because of that, we're fighting against time.

91
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,830
All he had to do was bear it for a bit longer!

92
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,749
But you stole from him the little time that he had left.

93
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,451
Do you understand that?

94
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,747
I apologize. I didn't even know, and...

95
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,961
We gave you room and board because you had nowhere else to go.

96
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,888
And this is how you repay us?

97
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,844
So you were dating Ji Woon?

98
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,355
Yes.

99
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:13,058
All right. So what did the Chairman say about that?

100
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,221
He told me to choose between being paid for the work I did at Haneul House until now

101
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:21,883
or staying with Ji Woon.

102
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,036
Looks like you have a clear answer, then.

103
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,115
Leave immediately.

104
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,551
What?

105
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,078
Without a word.

106
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,749
Make sure that Ji Woon and the other boys know about you leaving.

107
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:45,480
Forget about the fact you came here, and what we talked about, too and leave.

108
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:55,157
If you do, I'll keep the fact that you made the Chairman like this a secret.

109
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,856
Everyone is worried sick about the Chairman right now.

110
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:06,036
Is your trivial relationship so important compared to that?

111
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:10,824
What, you can't find it in yourself to leave?

112
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,453
Everyone else will be here soon.

113
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,963
Shall I tell everyone, then?

114
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:22,461
That he collapsed because you deceived him?

115
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:24,671
N-no.

116
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,249
I apologize.

117
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:32,704
Don't ever come anywhere near Haneul Group or Haneul House ever again.

118
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,182
Got that?

119
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,936
What are you doing? Leave already.

120
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,866
Visiting hours are over for today.

121
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,234
What happened?

122
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:20,769
He's in hepatic coma.

123
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,355
They don't know when he'll regain consciousness.

124
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:26,449
He has liver cancer.

125
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,436
And we kept you all in the dark on purpose.

126
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,614
But... did you have something you wanted to talk to the Chairman about?

127
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,526
Yeah.

128
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,745
What is it that you needed to talk to him about? It's so late.

129
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,081
Nothing.

130
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,284
Hyen Min and Seo Woo
are on their way here, too.

131
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,445
Visiting hours are over, anyway,
so just sit outside.

132
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,063
I'll stay here.

133
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,290
What about Ha Won?

134
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,426
She said she'd come.

135
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,645
Okay. I'll wait outside.

136
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,775
The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

137
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,161
Why isn't she picking up?

138
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,455
Did you call Eun Ha Won just now?

139
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,764
Excuse me?

140
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:27,377
She won't pick up. No... she can't.

141
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,075
Your grandfather knew about your relationship.

142
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,387
So what?

143
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,500
She was really quite a rude girl.

144
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,039
She's someone who knows exactly what she wants

145
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,360
And does whatever it takes it get it.

146
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,937
Don't you dare speak about her like that.

147
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,330
I'm talking about money.

148
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,260
Well, your grandfather was a bit harsh, too.

149
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,950
She's so young, and yet he told her to choose between money and love.

150
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,002
What are you saying?

151
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:15,425
You don't understand why she's not picking up your calls?

152
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:21,331
That girl, Eun Ha Won, is being wise.

153
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,480
Your grandfather will never stand for you dating someone like her.

154
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:34,419
He must have been quite harsh toward her for her to leave at this time of night.

155
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:39,967
And yet, you're here, worrying about him because he's your grandfather.

156
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,743
Stop it, already.

157
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:47,182
No, I just... thought you were worrying so much, while not knowing the full story.

158
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,234
I'll be going now.

159
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,139
The only hope he has left is getting a liver transplant.

160
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:04,967
That's why he didn't want to let any of you know about this

161
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,477
so that you wouldn't feel pressured.

162
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,398
What'll happen to him if he doesn't get the surgery?

163
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,433
Will things get difficult for him?

164
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,487
Yeah.

165
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:21,182
So he really didn't want us to know, until the end?

166
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,268
Should I just keep pretending that don't know about this, then?

167
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,703
Calm down.

168
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,723
He was spouting out nonsense about family, or whatever, to us

169
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:31,251
and yet he was the one looking down on us the most. Right?

170
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,861
That wasn't his intention, and you know that.

171
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:36,973
I'm just going to ignore all this, until he tells me himself.

172
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,260
We're the only blood-related family he has.

173
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,622
That's why we've had such a hard time finding a donor.

174
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,142
But, why did he pass out all of a sudden?

175
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,194
Did something happen?

176
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,137
Well...

177
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,607
How did he end up like this? He was going to work, and everything.

178
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,985
Don't you know why his condition worsened so much?

179
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:02,449
I don't know either. I guess it just happened suddenly.

180
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,644
I'll have to go meet Doctor Park, first.

181
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:07,437
I'll come with you.

182
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,298
Kang Ji Woon

183
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,796
The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

184
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,156
Please leave a message after the tone.

185
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,468
You should've contacted me sooner!

186
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:34,164
Do you know how worried I was, after hearing about what happened on the news?

187
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,851
Stay here for a while.

188
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,321
I even cleared out a storage room for you to stay in.

189
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,475
I really didn't want to burden you like this.

190
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:46,243
Oh, it's fine!

191
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:51,773
There's no space at my place, so this is all I can do for you.

192
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,066
Thanks.

193
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,835
And... I'm sorry.

194
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,131
Liver transplants are difficult on the donor, as well.

195
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,383
And even if you're prepared for that

196
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:05,437
the procedure is impossible unless the two people are completely compatible.

197
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm aware of that, Doctor.

198
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,309
Can you finish running the tests as soon as you can?

199
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,252
Yes, I will.

200
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:19,501
On my way here, I left my car somewhere and took a cab the rest of the way.

201
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,948
I couldn't drive properly because my hands were shaking so much.

202
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:28,051
So even you can lose your cool sometimes, huh?

203
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:36,192
I lost my dad when I was 10, and Grandfather is all I've had since then.

204
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,921
Yeah...

205
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,359
I'm really worried about him.

206
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,486
Will they even be able to operate on him?

207
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,655
What are you doing right now?

208
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,341
Where are you planning to go?

209
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,778
I don't belong here.

210
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:04,746
What?

211
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,741
My part-time job here is over now.

212
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,377
What's with you?

213
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,281
I think I misunderstood.

214
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,475
When a guy like you said that he liked me

215
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:18,794
I thought I had become Cinderella, or something.

216
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,964
I only came here to work part-time.

217
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,966
I got kicked out of my houseand had nowhere to go

218
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,151
but he told me that he'd give me room and board, and even some money.

219
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:27,561
Who in my position would pass that up?

220
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,371
Stop it.

221
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,723
This is really hard for me to listen to.

222
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,435
So...

223
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,554
let's stop this, already.

224
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,892
Let me go.

225
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,329
Don't be like this, Ha Won.

226
00:15:55,831 --> 00:16:00,652
I'm having a hard time as it is, so why are you being like this to me too?

227

00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,843
Don't be like this. It doesn't suit you.

These things belong to Ms. Hye Ji, but she left them here.

272

It'd be a waste to throw them away, so I'm putting them away somewhere.

Are you with someone else?

I saw a car hit him, and then speed off.

289
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,701
I was scared, and didn't know what to do.

And that's why...

291
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,247

295
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,829
Someone who was my friend
a long time ago, when I was a kid?

296
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,555
Is that all I am to you?

297
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,417
It's only natural that things have changed. It's been ten whole years.

298
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:07,927
It's the first time we've been here in ten years.

299
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,210
The fact that you're here with me now really doesn't have an effect on you?

♫  The whole world was different. ♫

Or... the little sister of your dead friend?

307
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,517
We don't have any kind of relationship.

308

You call this "nothing"?

309

If you keep acting this way, I'll never see you again.

314
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:07,886
Nobody knows that we were at the place where the Chairman collapsed, right?

315
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,247
Yes.

316
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,712
How did he know that we were there?

317
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,073
Is that what you're worried about right now?

318
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:22,926
I met with Doctor Park.

319
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:26,738
We don't know when the Chairman will regain consciousness.

320
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,119
And what Haneul Group needs right now is a leader.

321
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,079
What are you saying?

322
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,872
Who else would be fit for that position if not you?

323
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:37,774
This isn't the time to be talking about that.

324
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:43,054
I'll finally put you in a place that suits you.

325
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,566
That's not for you to decide, Madam.

326
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:51,095
I'll make the judgment calls and act as your mother.

327
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,916
I'll do that from now on.

328
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,675
Mom.

329
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:12,217
The Chairman is in a really tough situation right now because of me.

330
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,092
Because of that, everyone is having a hard time.

331
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:28,099
They're all important to me.

332
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:40,254
And yet, because of me...

333
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,351
What do I do?

334
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,857
What do I do, Mom?

335
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,569
I'm so scared.

336
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:08,448
I don't know what I should do.

337
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,012
Yeah.

338
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,807
We've moved the Chairman to a hospital room, for now.

339
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,767
All right.

340
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,404
Neither of the individuals who were tested last time are a match.

341
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,590
Neither of them are a match?

342
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,818
Yes. No one was a match.

343
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:51,265
Does he not have any other blood relatives?

344
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:53,710
Statistically speaking...

345
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,015
it'll be quite difficult to find a stranger who is a perfect match.

346
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:00,375
Even if they're distant relatives...

347
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:08,892
I've bought so many new items that I don't want to keep any of my old ones.

348
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:11,028
That's why I brought them here.

349
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:13,572
I'll take a look at the goods, then.

350
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:15,624
We barely even used them.

351
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,001
Yes, they're pretty much brand-new!

352
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,729
I'll take a look at the condition, first.

353
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:30,071
Do you have the certificate of authenticity, by any chance?

354
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:33,734
Oh, I threw all of those things away.

355
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,177
Can't you tell just by looking?

356
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,987
It's obvious even without them

357
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:39,765
that all of these were bought at department stores, isn't it?

358
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:44,218
I don't think that this is authentic.

359
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:47,039
What are you talking about? Do you know how much that cost?

360
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,134
Wow, I can't believe you. You don't know about bags at all, do you?

361
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:58,007
Excuse me, but the authentic ones have even stitching throughout.

362
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:01,536
But look here. The stitching isn't continuous and it stops right here.

363
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:05,983
We can't buy these bags from you.

364
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:11,638
Um... you can pay us a little less, if you want.

365
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:15,592
How about 50,000 won per bag?

366
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,900
An Island in the Woods

367
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,214
Was this taken 21 years ago?

368
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:22,000
♬ If I'm sad, I smell a flower's scent ♬

369
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:29,700
♬ I try to remember your scent that I miss ♬

370
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,170
Welcome.

371
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:41,090
♬ It seems as if I'm reaching out to your breath in the wind ♬

372
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,420
♬ I know, that you don't know my feelings ♬

373
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,181
Hye Ji, can you put this on display for me?

374
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,517
Sure! Go do what you need to do.

375
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,077
Are you sure you can handle this on your own?

376
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:59,429
Of course! Don't worry.

377
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,890
- I'll trust you and go, then!
- Okay!

378
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:34,381
Hello. It's Hyeon Min. Could I see you for a bit?

379
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,391
Here's your coffee.

380
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,618
Yes, thank you.

381
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,317
Did you break up with someone recently?

382
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:56,486
No.

383
00:28:57,112 --> 00:29:01,741
There are tons of people who come back to find the notes they wrote, like you.

384
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,593
I can tell by just looking

385
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:07,289
that most of them are here because of someone they broke up with.

386
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,442
Oh. I'm not here because of me.

387
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,290
♬  My heart is scattered and blown off  ♬

388
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:17,616
Oh, that seems like quite an old photo.

389
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,301
May I take a look?

390
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:20,845
Sure.

391
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,470
♬  My love that was sweet  ♬

392
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:26,340
Wow. 1995, huh?

393
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,390
October 2, 1995

394
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,779
Oh, who's this?

395
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:33,224
My mother.

396
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:38,153
Oh, I see. I suppose that your father took the photo.

397
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,710
Oh, just a second. Wait right here.

398
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,870
♬  If it is cold with pouring rain  ♬

399
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,112
Here are the notes from 1995. Would you like to take a look?

400
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:00,467
Who knows? You might find the note that your parents left behind.

401
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,550
Thank you.

402
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,820
♬  It's leaving me  ♬

403
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,790
♬  Bye Bye Bye  ♬

404
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,150
♬  Even if I hate you to death  ♬

405
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:18,418
♬  I still love you  ♬

406
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:22,130
I'll never make you leave me again.

407
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,455
Thanks for finding me.

408
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:38,380
I'm sorry I ran away... but I've become so scared of everything.

409
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,049
- Excuse me, sir!
- Yes?

410
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:45,754
Can I see the ones from 1996, too?

411
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:48,899
Yes, I'll bring them over.

412
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:04,448
I keep coming back here in case I run into you.

413
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:13,323
I've named him Ji Woon. I can really see him in you now.

414
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:17,419
Whenever I come here, I think about you.

415
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,006
It's fine for me to not have a husband

416
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:26,720
but it's hard to see my child have no father.

417
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,515
Please encourage me.

418
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:36,313
Don't hate your father too much.

419
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:45,531
Also, I, who hid Ji Woon away, hated the Chairman a lot, too.

420
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,204
I want to make it so that my son can live with the woman he loves

421
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:57,234
without having to worry about social status.

422
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:02,572
That's why I can't go back to you, Honey.

423
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,892
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:10,138
I won't come here anymore, either.

425
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:19,272
So Grandfather... did that to Mom.

426
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,052
All the staff at Haneul Group wish you a speedy recovery.

427
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,714
They just sent him that one thing? That's it?

428
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:49,394
Poor Grandfather.

429
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,476
You're here?

430
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,854
What brings you here?

431
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,859
I couldn't sleep. What about your schedule?

432
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,653
I cancelled everything.

433
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:20,417
How long are you going to sleep, Grandfather?

434
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,229
I've been quite disobedient toward you over the years

435
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,940
so I can't force you to listen to me.

436
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:32,529
So just get up on your own, will you?

437
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,180
Go away!

438
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,550
What? What did you say wrench?

439
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,750
- I'm so embarrassed of you!
- No!

440
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,460
What? What did I do to you?

441
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:56,221
Yoon Seong. I'm going to go out for a bit.

442
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,880
Mom. Mom...

443
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,651
Wow, I really can't beat you.

444
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,437
What's your secret?

445
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:59,284
I just have something important that I truly wish to protect.

446
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:13,323
Hyeon Min!

447
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:15,910
- Oh, you're here?
- Wow, it's been a while.

448
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,995
Yes. Have a seat.

449
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:21,682
Wow, you've gotten even cooler since last time.

450
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,492
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:25,419
You had a fashion show in Korea for the first time in a while

452
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:26,820
and yet I couldn't even make it.

453
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,873
I sent you all the new clothes from this season. Did you like them?

454
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:33,543
Of course. I'm so grateful that you're always taking such great care of me.

455
00:36:33,543 --> 00:36:36,830
No, it's an honor for me to have my clothes worn by you.

456
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,992
I'll wear all of them happily.

457
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:45,088
But, what's the matter? I don't think you called me just to say hello.

458
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:46,723
Well, that is...

459
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,018
I have a favor to ask you.

460
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:52,045
A favor? From me?

461
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:54,339
Yes.

462
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,340
Drawing Book

463
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,490
Photo Album

464
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,399
Yes?

465
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:54,942
What is it?

466
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:57,152
I couldn't get in touch with Ms. Eun Ha Won.

467
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,130
Eun Ha Won? Why?

468
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:06,845
Oh, you didn't know? She said that she wanted to be a donor, if she could

469
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:10,824
and came to see me the morning after the Chairman was hospitalized.

470
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,542
Eun Ha Won did?

471
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:20,968
Unfortunately, she's not a match either.

472
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:32,479
Hello. I'll just check some things.

473
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:44,800
Oh, we got a call from a restaurant.

474
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,952
They said that they have some of the Chairman's things there.

475
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,896
All right.

476
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:03,076
I'm sorry. We should have contacted you sooner.

477
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,600
It seems that he dropped this while he was being taken away.

478
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,919
Thankfully, we picked it up right away

479
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:15,005
so we wanted to give it to the secretary who was there then

480
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:17,541
but he disappeared all of a sudden.

481
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:20,277
That's why we ended up calling the hospital.

482
00:39:20,302 --> 00:39:22,020
The... secretary?

483
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,849
Yes. The Chairman's secretary was already here with Madam Ji.

484
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:31,371
The Chairman came after that, and ended up collapsing.

485
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,162
Chief Lee Yoon Seong didn't come to work today.

486
00:39:39,162 --> 00:39:40,222
He didn't come to work?

487
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:44,451
Yes. He said he's going to the hospital with Madam Ji to visit the Chairman.

488
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,683
Hey, Hyung. Where are you?

489
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,322
I'm at work. Why?

490
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,108
Work, huh?

491
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:10,369
Yeah. Is something the matter?

492
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:17,400
Huh? No. I was just wondering when you'd be coming to the hospital.

493
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,503
I'll come by later. Is it an urgent matter?

494
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,981
No. See you later, at the hospital.

495
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,091
This is a document certifying the transfer of stocks.

496
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:46,696
If you sign this, my stocks will be transferred to you.

497
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:49,157
Must you...

498
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:54,145
Remember the first day that the Chairman introduced us?

499
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:55,873
I asked you a favor that day.

500
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:04,172
I told you I wanted to live happily as a woman, and for you to play dumb.

501
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:08,143
That wasn't the truth.

502
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,458
I didn't want to live happily as a woman. I wanted to live happily as a mother.

503
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:25,235
I wanted to act like a real mother to you, just once.

504
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,231
pSo... will you let me?

505
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:39,082
The choice is yours. I'll be waiting.

506
00:41:52,404 --> 00:41:54,615
She said that she wanted to show these children

507
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:58,219
the love that she couldn't show her own son.

508
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,320
That's what she told us.

509
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,207
I'm sure that all of these children calling her "mother"

510
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:07,903
doesn't quite compare to hearing her own son say it.

511
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:13,425
Seo Woo has canceled all his appearances for the next two weeks!

512
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:17,395
Let's cheer on our Seo Woo, who must be heartbroken over his grandfather!

513
00:42:17,395 --> 00:42:19,289
Look at you, slacking off again!

514
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,901
Hey, you knew about this, right?

515
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:24,219
About what?

516
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,839
About Seo Woo's grandfather.

517
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:31,927
Oh... yeah.

518
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,663
How could you not tell me about this?

519
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:38,074
What's the point? You'd just be worried, anyway.

520
00:42:38,074 --> 00:42:40,803
Is it really okay for you to be here doing this, though, after you've left?

521
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:43,605
The manager said she'd only let you sleep here for a week!

522
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,408
I can just go and find another place, then.

523
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,510
Don't be like that, just go back to Haneul House.

524
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,029
Hey, I told you! I'm fine!

525
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:58,335
Well, if it doesn't work out... I can work late nights at a movie theater. That is perfect ...

526
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:01,390
You'll get sick too, at this rate!

527
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:07,128
I know that you're suffering, even though you're smiling.

528
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:10,107
I don't know what happened, but--

529
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:14,820
Ja Yeong! I'm okay.

530
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,681
- You're not okay.
- Okay!

531
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:20,308
Welcome--

532
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:29,026
Have some of this, Dad. It's delicious!

533
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:32,487
Weren't you working at Haneul House?

534
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:37,618
Um... I have two jobs!

535
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,596
Are you doing okay over there?

536
00:43:41,596 --> 00:43:44,608
Are you eating and sleeping well?

537
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:47,911
Of course! I totally am.

538
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,058
I'm a bit worried that you're having a hard time spending so much time

539
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:55,419
with people that are so different from us.

540
00:43:55,419 --> 00:44:00,015
It's because you live with rich people that guys like Yeong Jin come after you.

541
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,983
I'm fine.

542
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,816
Oh yeah, Ha Won. Do you still have your mother's ring?

543
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,204
I have it right here.

544
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:15,705
Why?

545
00:44:16,623 --> 00:44:21,094
Well... apparently, that ring didn't belong to your mother.

546
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:27,793
What? But... Mom had this in her hand when she died.

547
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:31,955
I just heard this from Yeong Jin, but...

548
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:39,146
your mother died after going back in to try to save a woman who lived next door

549
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:43,892
She wanted her son to have that ring.

550
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:51,725
No way. I didn't even know that, and...

551
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:57,640
I misunderstood and resented your mother

552
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,270
for so long because of that ring.

553
00:45:02,277 --> 00:45:05,455
But still, it kind of seems like your mom's last will, to me.

554
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,959
How about we return that ring to its rightful owner?

555
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,466
Yes, Dad.

556
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,690
Hello?

557
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:34,526
What?

558
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:50,892
Ms. Park Hye Ji?

559
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,254
- Yes.
- Have a seat.

560
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,003
I saw your designs, Ms. Hye Ji.

561
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:07,500
I want to become your mentor.

562
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:13,506
I recommend a scholarship student to a fashion school in Paris every year.

563
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:16,092
And I'd like to recommend you for that this year.

564
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:22,349
Wow, I can't believe this. This feels like a dream!

565
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:26,286
But, um... how did you see my designs?

566
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:31,867
I'm always diligent about looking for promising designers.

567
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:35,879
It seemed you received quite a bit of attention in school for your work.

568
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:49,468
What are you doing?

569
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,354
Do you know what this is?

570
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:54,857
What is it? A cell phone?

571
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:57,233
It's Grandfather's.

572
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,902
Why do you have that?

573
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:02,072
It just ended up that way.

574
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:05,976
But, um... nobody came by today?

575
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:09,454
Yeah. Not a single person.

576
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:12,157
So you're saying that Hyung Yoon Seong didn't come by either, right?

577
00:47:12,157 --> 00:47:13,333
Nope.

578
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:18,021
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

579
00:47:18,021 --> 00:47:19,756
No, it's nothing.

580
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:23,594
I can't unlock this, though.

581
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:27,180
Really? Give it here.

582
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:33,937
Oh, I got it!

583
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:36,823
What the...

584
00:47:36,823 --> 00:47:38,567
I just tried the pattern that I use.

585
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:40,752
And what's that?

586
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:43,079
Just a basic "L" shape.

587
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:45,949
It's easiest to unlock your phone with that pattern.

588
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,244
I didn't know that Grandfather would have the same pattern as me.

589
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:52,122
Wow, you two really are similar.

590
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,300
Eun Ha Won went to the hospital without telling any of us and was tested.

591
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:10,707
What?

592
00:48:10,707 --> 00:48:12,643
But she's not a match, either.

593
00:48:15,037 --> 00:48:19,942
The only one left now is Kang Ji Woon... but where did that punk go?

594
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:31,036
You're supposed to take care of the sickly in the hospital

595
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:34,790
and those who aren't sick by staying by their side.

596
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:37,960
Thanks for all this.

597
00:48:38,894 --> 00:48:42,464
My dad was in the hospital for a few years because of cancer, too.

598
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,751
He's fine now, though.

599
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,261
He can't work yet, though.

600
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:48,971
I see.

601
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:53,575
I was in middle school, and my mom always had to work

602
00:48:53,575 --> 00:48:58,079
so I'd stay with him instead, and eat the leftovers from my dad's hospital meals.

603
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,275
And I'd lie to my dad that I bought meals from the cafeteria.

604
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:07,347
Oh! One time, Ha Won got me tons of food that were close to expiring

605
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:11,676
from the convenience store she worked at.

606
00:49:11,676 --> 00:49:14,979
All those foods were so delicious that day!

607
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:18,584
And we've been best friends ever since!

608
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,441
I'll eat as much as I can since you worked so hard to make it.

609
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:28,051
Really?

610
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:37,410
Thanks.

611
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:43,216
Let me go get some water.

612
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:53,911
My Seo Woo ate the lunch that I made for him!

613
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,570
Oh my gosh!

614
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,818
Compatibility with Kang Seo Woo: 95 percent

615
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:16,433
What? No way! We were meant to be?

616
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,768
95 percent?

617
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,289
What are you doing?

618
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:26,109
Oh, it's nothing. It looked like you had something smudged there, so I wiped it.

619
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:28,654
But, um...

620
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:29,955
Yes?

621
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,783
You know where Ha Won is, right?

622
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:38,372
Well, that's something I should keep a secret.

623
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:43,218
Welcome!

624
00:50:46,855 --> 00:50:49,466
I'll wait for you. Let's talk.

625
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:56,473
How's the Chairman?

626
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:03,856
He's the same. And in the meantime, time is cruelly passing by.

627
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,818
How could you ignore all your calls after you got tested?

628
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:12,656
Oh... did the results come out?

629
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:16,043
You're not a match either.

630
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:18,120
Oh... really?

631
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:25,251
So... Ji Woon is the only blood relative that Grandfather has left.

632
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:29,330
Ji Woon didn't get tested?

633
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:34,077
I haven't been able to get in touch with him since grandfather collapsed.

634
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:40,192
Because we can't get in touch with him, something's definitely up.

635
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:46,172
That's why I need you.

636
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,883
This is Grandfather's phone.

637
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:02,263
There's something in here that you have to show Ji Woon.

638
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:11,615
Eun Ha Won.

639
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:17,086
You're the only one who can bring Ji Woon back.

640
00:52:17,086 --> 00:52:18,388
Me?

641
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,469
I know about your relationship.

642
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,566
Oh... you do?

643
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:34,696
I was going to keep it a secret, since it'd be bad if Grandfather found out.

644
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:38,567
But now that I think about it...

645
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:41,194
we've been living together for a year

646
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:47,400
but I have no idea where or what situation he may be in.

647
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,233
That's why I came here to ask you this favor.

648
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,313
I'm having a hard time as it is, so why are you being like this to me too?

649
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:11,925
Eun Ha Won!

650
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:18,231
If you leave like this... I'll never see you again.

651
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:24,260
♫  My heart like a bad habit ♫

652
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,990
♫  seems to be putting on a brave face ♫

653
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:30,490
You're the only one who can bring Ji Woon back.

654
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:34,523
♫  hiding all it's feelings facing you ♫

655
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:37,943
To My Son Kang Suk Cheol:
His name is Ji Woon.

656
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:42,472
I hate his mother, but she gave him a good name.

657
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:49,571
He takes after you in that he's smart and likes fixing things.

658
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:55,068
How could you leave behind a son like him, and die?

659
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:02,510
♫  Even if you laugh louder ♫

660
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:09,390
♫  Without you I wouldn't feel good ♫

661
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:15,500
♫  Don't leave me anywhere alone anymore  ♫

662
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:22,530
♫  I want to say I love you just you ♫

663
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:27,292
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

664
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:31,463
Is... Ji Woon here, by any chance?

665
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:32,914
Yes, just a moment.

666
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:36,192
Hey, Ji Woon! Han Ji Woon!

667
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,570
Someone's here to see you!

668
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:13,288
Mr. Yoon Seong told me where you used to work, so I went there...

669
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:16,675
and they told me that this is where you first started working.

670
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:19,086
You've come a long way, so drink that before you go.

671
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:20,737
Here.

672
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:25,576
It's the Chairman's. There's something in here that you need to see.

673
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:28,136
I don't need it.

674
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:30,763
It has to do with your dad.

675
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,123
Go inside and read the texts.

676
00:55:50,993 --> 00:55:52,186
What is this?

677
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,758
The chairman sent your dad a bunch of texts.

678
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:05,298
He's been doing that every day since he found you.

679
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:22,466
Do you want to see your grandfather?

680
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:25,869
Everyone's waiting for you.

681
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:32,851
Don't misunderstand anything. No one there is waiting for me.

682
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:37,464
The Chairman is going through an extremely hard time right now.

683
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,915
So he definitely needs you.

684
00:56:38,915 --> 00:56:40,842
Well, I don't need him.

685
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:43,028
Kang Ji Woon!

686
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:46,031
Is this all that you amount to?

687
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:52,079
No matter how much you hate him, the fact that he's your grandfather won't change.

688
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:56,608
So what are you trying to pull here, by running away like a coward?

689
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,348
I have no idea what happened, but--

690
00:57:02,348 --> 00:57:06,785
You don't know anything, so don't you dare talk to me that way.

691
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:10,538
Sure, fine. I don't know anything.

692
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:15,102
But I do know that you're the Chairman's last hope now!

693
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:21,441
I was wondering if I could help, and even went to get tested.

694
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,526
But I wasn't a match.

695
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,780
Do you know why?

696
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:32,494
Because I'm not his family! Because I'm not related to him!

697
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,731
But you're his family. And yet, what are you doing here?

698
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:43,905
He's the one who didn't acknowledge me as his family.

699
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:49,352
Can't you tell what he really wants to say to you, after reading these texts?

700
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:54,057
It's because you've never properly heard him out!

701
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:57,536
Even if you want to cast everything aside and leave

702
00:57:57,536 --> 00:57:59,946
don't just do that by just running away!

703
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,859
Wait until you've saved your grandfather and he wakes up!

704
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:08,822
And then, hear him out! Get angry at him, and yell at him!

705
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:13,702
Face this issue between you and your grandfather directly!

706
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:24,379
We've descended into a state of crisis

707
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:27,257
as the news about the Chairman has spread to the press.

708
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:31,820
If we are to overcome this crisis as soon as possible

709
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,491
we need to have a fresh start.

710
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:39,778
What in the world gives you the right to talk about a "fresh start"?

711
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:42,781
Now, now. Let's hear her out first.

712
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:47,261
What's there to hear? She called me, a busy person, for this?

713
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:51,056
Do you think we're your puppets, or something?

714
00:58:51,056 --> 00:58:55,035
I didn't call you here today to hear me out.

715
00:58:56,328 --> 00:59:01,124
As of this moment, we will change the five major shareholders of Haneul Group.

716
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,460
Were you all aware of that?

717
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:07,030
What is she saying?

718
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,532
I've called that person here today.

719
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:43,500
The Chairman's liver is now in complete failure.

720
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,387
Then, what'll happen now?

721
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:49,731
We must perform a transplant as soon as possible.

722
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:52,033
We have no time to waste.

723
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:06,981
Let me introduce you all to the new major shareholder of Haneul Group.

724
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:18,744
Hello.

725
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,630
♫  While I keep looking only at you ♫

726
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,670
♫  It's the first time I've felt  ♫

727
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:56,720
♫  a trembling feeling like a lie pointing only at you ♫

728
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,710
♫  Why did you show up now? ♫

729
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,710
♫  It's the fate I was looking forward to ♫

730
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,350
♫  I've bet my everything on you ♫

731
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,150
♫  You are so precious. ♫

732
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,570
♫  I feel your heart heart heart. ♫

733
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,510
♫  From the first to the last, I wonder about everything. ♫

734
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:16,090
♫  Even If I secretly must close my eyes ♫
