9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,972
Hello.

10
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:03,405
I'm Lee Yoon Seong, the Chief General Secretary of Haneul Group.

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,725
You came.

12
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,561
I came to see

13
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,957
if I'm a match.

14
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,922
Moving forward...

15
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:57,242
in order for Haneul Group to reinvent itself under the new leadership

16
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,329
you will definitely need Mr. Lee Yoon Seong's help.

17
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:07,011
Because Chief Lee has had the Chairman's utmost trust

18
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:11,439
there won't be any problem for him to be our new leader.

19
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,152
Put some pressure on that.

20
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:18,129
You can go to the next examination room now.

21
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,060
You asked me what happened to me, right?

22
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,140
Huh?

23
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,940
Yeah.

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,278
When I first came to Haneul House, grandfather told me that he didn't know my mother.

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,324
But it turned out that wasn't the truth, at all.

26
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,247
Grandfather kicked my mom out of that house.

27
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,099
That made me angry.

28
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,338
That's why I was planning to never see anyone from Haneul House ever again.

29
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,858
But... you're right.

30
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,306
Since I've come all this way...

31
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,302
I'm going to ask my questions to Grandfather myself, so until then

32
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,870
No.

33
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,608
Leave me out of this.

34
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,503
Family matters should be settled among family members.

35
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,321
What?

36
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,101
This is all I can do. This was my mission this time around.

37
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:23,829
- I'll get going now.
- No.

38
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,589
Hold onto my jacket for me.

39
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,717
I don't think I'll be able to leave if I don't leave now, though.

40
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,116
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:48,253
- Can't you tell?
- We were waiting for you!

42
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,646
Don't wait up for me, and just go.

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,357
Go home, or go to grandfather.

44
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,710
What's with you two?

45
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,303
We're not leaving.

46
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,505
Why do you keep telling us to leave?

47
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:09,108
We're not going anywhere until you're done here.

48
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:10,951
What's gotten into you two?

49
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,195
At any rate, just deal with it until the end okay?

50
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,430
That's how you are, anyway.

51
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,009
But... did you come here because of Eun Ha Won?

52
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,845
No.

53
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,575
I have to save grandfather if I can.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,813
He's family after all.

55
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:51,725
Good work. We'll notify you as soon as we get the results.

56
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,143
Yes.

57
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:56,513
The Chairman told me a lot about you, Mr. Ji Woon.

58
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,259
You really do take after your late father.

59
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,009
He said that he always felt sorriest towards you.

60
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,778
He said that he was always worried about you.

61
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:25,358
I have something that I want to ask you and hear from you

62
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,702
for the first time in my life...

63
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:32,624
So why are you lying here like this?

64
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,719
I'll...

65
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,611
forgive you on Mom's behalf.

66
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,248
So wake up.

67
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,539
Are you all done here?

68
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,916
Yeah.

69
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:17,203
All right, then. Let's go.

70
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:20,547
I waited for this guy for so long today, which is quite unlike me.

71
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,424
I never asked you to do that.

72
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,636
You're going home, right?

73
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,595
I'll drop her off.

74
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,243
You can get home on your own, right?

75
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,437
I brought my car here too, you know!

76
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,114
Also, I'm really busy.

77
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:40,192
Figures. We're not the types to look after one another, anyway.

78
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,052
Right?

79
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,624
Kang Seo Woo!

80
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,827
Drive safely, okay?

81
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,520
Are you on your way home after visiting your grandfather?

82
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,808
How is it that you seem busier after Grandfather collapsed?

83
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,977
And you too, Hyung.

84
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:23,293
I'm sorry. I haven't been around much despite the Chairman being ill.

85
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,453
No need to be sorry to me.

86
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,923
But it's a different story when it comes to the Chairman.

87
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:31,359
He may be unconscious, but he'd be really disappointed if he knew.

88
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:38,300
I was just out looking for potential donors, just in case.

89
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:40,919
But it really isn't easy.

90
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,714
Kang Ji Woon got tested today.

91
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,428
But nothing's certain as of yet.

92
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,516
We have to continue looking or donors until we know for sure.

93
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,936
It almost sounds as if you want something to go wrong.

94
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:03,692
Leave this to me now, and go home.

95
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,631
Leave what to who?

96
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:12,309
You're the one I'm most worried about.

97
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,512
Let me escort you back home now, Madam.

98
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:17,831
Wow, you've sure been busy, haven't you?

99
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,034
Keep up the good work, then.

100
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,481
Here.

101
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:47,119
You're done getting tested, so take your things back.

102
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,495
No.

103
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,663
Give it back when we get home.

104
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,932
I told you this already, but...

105
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,937
- I'm not going back to Haneul House.
- I told you, no!

106
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,941
There's nobody to give you missions now, anyway.

107
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,674
Just stay by my side until Grandfather wakes up.

108
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,892
Kang Ji Woon!

109
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,594
What, you don't want to?

110
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,464
Stop being so stubborn.

111
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,499
Then tell me that it's not true!

112
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,520
Fix this misunderstanding that I have.

113
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,734
What misunderstanding?

114
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,405
You want to be by my side too, don't you?

115
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,470
I know you well enough to know that.

116
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:45,952
I don't have anything else to discuss with you, so go.

117
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,796
I'm sorry!

118
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,400
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

119
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,044
I'm sorry for letting you leave like that, that day.

120
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:03,620
I don't believe anything you said then.

121
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,830
♫ A sad dream always fills your reddened eyes. ♫

125

144
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,862
I've canceled all of your concerts in Seoul, and in other cities.

145
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,939
I'm also going to send the press a statement

146
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:56,508
saying your next album's release date will be delayed.

147
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,139
You can finally get things done without me having to tell you, huh?

148
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,377
These were the biggest concerts you would've had since your debut.

149
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:10,288
Don't just smile like that and act as if you're okay.

150
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,126
I'm sorry that things ended up this way all of a sudden.

151
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:15,927
Why are you sorry?

152
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,714
There are a ton of articles about your grandfather's situation being released.

153
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:22,309
It would have been too much to have you go out there singing and laughing.

154
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,415
Yeah and singing is something that I can always do.

155
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,645
Are you being too simple or just overly optimistic?

156
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,165
Ji Woon came by, saying that he'd save Grandfather if he could.

157
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,760
And you know what a terrible temper he has, on top of his stubbornness, right?

158
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,746
But he came anyway.

159
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:47,442
I have a good feeling about all this. I'm sure things will be okay.

160
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:02,933
Yeah. I'll break up with him when the time comes.

161
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:06,311
But I still need some time to sort through my feelings.

162
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,082
So just until then...

163
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,710
If you want to cast everything aside and leave...

164
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,312
don't just do that by just running away!

165
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,633
Wait until you save your grandfather, and he wakes up!

166
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,904
And then, hear him out! Get angry at him, and yell at him!

167
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,876
Face this issue between you and your grandfather directly!

168
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,988
I came back, Mom.

169
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,611
I did the right thing, right?

170
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,435
The results are out and you can do the surgery.

171
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,079
Really?

172
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,373
Yes.

173
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,577
Thank you, Doctor.

174
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,229
However...

175
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,562
It'll be dangerous?

176
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,724
It seems that you're allergic to anesthetics.

177
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:02,510
Have you ever received surgery while on general anesthesia?

178
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,322
No, I haven't.

179
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,667
We don't know what kind of response

180
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,527
your body will have to the general anesthesia.

181
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,354
And there is a possibility that your body

182
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,748
will go into shock during the surgery.

183
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,375
Go... into shock?

184
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,003
And in the worst case scenario, you may never wake up again.

185
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:25,792
You must make the decision yourself.

186
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,930
Will you go through with the surgery?

187
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,852
Oh, Mister.

188
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,579
Oh, Ms. Ha Won.

189
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,382
Are you all right? You don't look well.

190
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,126
Did something happen?

191
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,946
No. Please go ahead and go in.

192
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,477
Are the results out?

193
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,216
They told me I can go through with the surgery.

194
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:25,627
Really? That's great!

195
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:28,221
Isn't that great, Mister?

196
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:33,118
I'll tell Madam Ji about this.

197
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,710
Let's go.

198
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,448
He's having the surgery!

199
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,614
Ji Woon got his results.He's a match!

200
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,767
Oh my, oh my! This is wonderful!

201
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,085
That's a relief.

202
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,254
I can't just stand here like this, then.

203
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:03,915
I'll have to pack him some clothes, toiletries, and food!

204
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:06,835
There's tons to prepare!

205
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:08,779
Um, boys.

206
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,823
Help me okay?

207
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,268
You can get your surgery done now.

208
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,623
I hope you wake up soon, Chairman.

209
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:47,433
The boys are waiting for you.

210
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,109
I was just here to visit.

211
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,514
I'll get going now.

212
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,183
Ha Won.

213
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,227
Just when are you planning on leaving?

214
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:27,190
The Chairman will wake up soon after the surgery.

215
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,446
Just until the day of the surgery.

216
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:37,284
As soon as it's over, I'll disappear quietly.

217
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,021
So, how did things go?

218
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,693
They've decided on a date for the surgery.

219
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,780
How interesting.

220
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:17,023
Excuse me?

221
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,034
Remember that date.

222
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:24,089
That day is the day we'll be having the special shareholders' meeting.

223
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:31,380
When the Chairman wakes up, everything will have changed.

224
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,092
Patient Consent Form

225
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,888
Patient Name: Kang Ji Woon

226
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,212
You must remain calm and stress-free until the surgery.

227
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:49,147
You already mentioned that before.

228
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,776
You must remember that the donor's condition is the most important thing with transplant surgeries.

229
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,770
And you've warned me enough about that, too.

230
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,473
And as I've mentioned before--

231
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:59,074
Doctor.

232
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,446
At any rate, let me know if you experience any discomfort.

233
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:05,722
Yes, I will.

234
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,709
I'll leave Mr. Kang Ji Woon to you, then.

235
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,377
Don't worry, Doctor.

236
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,676
What was that about?

237
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,778
What are you talking about?

238
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:21,571
You hid something from me just now.

239
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,273
What are you talking about?

240
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:25,417
I saw it all, you know!

241
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,169
You're hiding something from me, right?

242
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,862
No, it was nothing.

243
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,524
If you don't tell me, I'm going to go and ask the doctor myself!

244
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,426
He was just telling me to take care of myself.

245
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:36,745
It's a huge surgery, after all.

246
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,491
They're all just formalities.

247
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:47,664
The things all patients are told no matter the type of surgery they get.

248
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,608
Just normal advice doctor's give.

249
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,086
I'm worried about you.

250
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:00,219
Don't worry. The surgery will be just fine.

251
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:08,677
If you're that worried, go out and buy something for me.

252
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:11,188
Being nervous made me so hungry!

253
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,833
Okay. I'll be back soon.

254
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:44,855
I recommend scholarship students for a fashion school in Paris every year.

255
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,374
And this year, I want to recommend you, Ms. Hye Ji.

256
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:21,908
Um... I'd like to meet you now, if I can.

257
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,026
You came to a decision earlier than I'd expected.

258
00:22:40,803 --> 00:22:43,155
Your answer is yes, of course. Right?

259
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:49,328
Do you perhaps know Kang Hyeon Min?

260
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,332
You do know him, don't you?

261
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,378
I promised that I'd keep that a secret.

262
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,508
Yes, that's right. Hyeon Min asked me for a favor.

263
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,686
But don't misunderstand, Ms. Hye Ji.

264
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:08,763
I only made you this offer because was impressed by your skill.

265
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,726
Thank you so much for this offer.

266
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,253
But I'll have to refuse.

267
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:19,525
Hyeon Min only did this because he feels bad for what he did to me.

268
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,427
It seems that he did something unnecessary out of guilt.

269
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:27,299
If this is all because of his request, I'll have to politely refuse.

270
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,077
Do you know what kind of opportunity you're giving up on right now?

271
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,606
If you meet with Hyeon Min, could you please tell him

272
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:37,192
that there is no need for him to go out of his way like this for me?

273
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,878
That won't do.

274
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:44,675
Do you think that I made such an exception towards you just because of him?

275
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,637
I put my name on the line with whatever I do.

276
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:51,306
So I wouldn't make this kind of offer to just anyone.

277
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,084
I came to this decision after seeing your talent.

278
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,335
But Hyeon Min--

279
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:56,620
Isn't it normal?

280
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,872
Isn't it only natural for a man to cheer on and support the woman he likes?

281
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,266
What's so strange about that?

282
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:10,576
But... who is this woman?

283
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,479
She was my first love.

284
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:18,091
My first love, who I couldn't protect.

285
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,328
My first love, whom I still have feelings for.

286
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,608
I know I'm being a coward

287
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:29,344
but it's kind of my style to help people out in secret.

288
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:33,990
Hey, why do you look surprised?

289
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,678
So... not only is she talented, but she also stole Kang Hyeon Min's heart?

290
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm really curious about her.

291
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,859
Fine.

292
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,742
My offer still stands, though, so call me if you change your mind.

293
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:55,303
I don't want talent like yours to slip past me.

294
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,232
Stop it right now, all of you!

295
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:36,611
What are you all doing, ruining the sanctity of his hospital room like this?

296
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:38,280
Come on, he's bored!

297
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,074
He has to be locked in here until the surgery!

298
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:43,610
Yeah, totally! We have to help make him less nervous!

299
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,172
I chose the most upbeat of the songs that I wrote to play for him!

300
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,510
Yes, of course! He has a huge surgery coming up, so he has to be well-fed!

301
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,578
Isn't that right?

302
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:53,462
- Yes, yes!
- Yes, yes!

303
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:55,689
No. None of this is allowed.

304
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,295
The doctor told him many times

305
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:04,356
that he needs to be completely calm until the surgery!

306
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,519
Are you going to be responsible if he plays games all night, like you

307
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,612
and it affects his health?

308
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:13,423
And you!

309
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:15,384
Your music just makes people get more worked up!

310
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:16,785
Hey, are you insulting my music?

311
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:20,038
And you, Ajumma. The staff here are taking care of his meals

312
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,832
so I'll eat all of this! Thank you very much!

313
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,326
You can't do that!

314
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:28,322
I made those especially for Mr. Ji Woon!

315
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,524
No. Visiting hours are over now!

316
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:33,051
Visiting hours are over! No more visiting for today.

317
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,721
All right. Please leave, everyone.

318
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:36,722
- What?
- Now!

319
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,223
Wait! He didn't even get to have a bite!

320
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:39,692
- Hurry it up, folks!
- Wait!

321
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:42,019
Thank you! Bye!

322
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:52,813
Wow. It's not like she's the doctor!

323
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,332
Doctor? She's more like a nagging mother-in-law!

324
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:56,909
It would've been nice if Mr. Ji Woon

325
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,053
could've tasted the marinated beef that he likes so much.

326
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,547
Who can win against Eun Ha Won, though?

327
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,434
Man. I was being super generous and bought a bunch of limited edition games!

328
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:08,353
I won't ever pack him lunch and bring it here again.

329
00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:10,339
And I'll never let him listen to my music!

330
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,757
Me too!

331
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,097
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

332
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:22,475
Oh, you both go on ahead. I'll be right behind you.

333
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,235
Please call together a special shareholders' meeting.

334
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,945
To discuss what subject?

335
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,948
The dismissal of the Chairman from his position.

336
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:39,952
But... will you really be able to get them all to agree to that?

337
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:42,204
Don't worry about that.

338
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,943
Chief Lee Yoon Seong is persuading the opposition as we speak.

339
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:11,316
This is Kang Hyeon Min. Did you look into what I asked you about?

340
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,136
Yes. It's like you assumed.

341
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:18,131
Ms. Ji Hwa Ja's stocks have been transfered over to Mr. Lee Yoon Seong.

342
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,813
I have a lot of work to do on the Chairman's behalf.

343
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,865
If it's not urgent, let's talk later, at the hospital.

344
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,193
What the hell are you up to?

345
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,420
What are you talking about?

346
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,772
I know everything so tell me.

347
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,906
Did you know that woman is preparing to get Grandfather dismissed from his position?

348
00:28:55,527 --> 00:29:01,591
It seems like you were with with her when Grandfather collapsed too.

349
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:03,727
How did you find out about that?

350
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,539
Why did you lie?

351
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:11,944
Calm down.

352
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:13,629
Do you love money that much?

353
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:19,134
Is that why you took that woman's stocks and became her little puppet?

354
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:25,724
Were you conspiring to do this all along?

355
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:28,477
Stop your whining!

356
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:31,171
The Chairman spent his entire life making this company what it is now.

357
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,448
Do you know how much this company is suffering right now?

358
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:34,916
So you're just going to get rid of him ?

359
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,235
Then protect his position yourself!

360
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:42,241
Or did you think that it would just protect itself?

361
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,453
Of course, since this is Grandfather's position!

362
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,122
Don't delude yourself.

363
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,642
What did you say?

364
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:55,379
You still don't know how many people desire this position?

365
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:58,932
This is the type of position that can be taken over by anyone, at any time!

366
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:02,602
Someone else can take this spot before you even get a chance to sit here!

367
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,490
You still call yourself an heir

368
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,225
when you don't even know that.

369
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:13,988
That fact alone makes you entirely unqualified for this role.

370
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,139
I'll just have to prove it to you, then.

371
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:32,490
I'll show you just how well I protect the things that belong to me.

372
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:00,252
Hey, get up.

373
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:02,529
Why are you sleeping? It hasn't even been that long since you last ate!

374
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,839
Stop it.

375
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:10,412
No! If you keep sleeping and eating like this, you'll gain weight!

376
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,331
I'm still at a normal weight.

377
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,108
That's what you think.

378
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:18,212
The doctor told me to protect you from sudden weight gain before the surgery!

379
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,330
You're being really overprotective!

380
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,300
Oh well. This is all for your sake. Come on, get up!

381
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,180
♫  When you smile brightly, I ♫

382
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,185
You can't.

383
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,503
What now?

384
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,696
You can't use these.

385
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:37,832
I can't even blow my nose?

386
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,616
♫  When you are walking ♫

387
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:41,635
If you're going to blow your nose, use the tissues in the bathroom.

388
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:42,719
This is mine.

389
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,639
Then why did you leave it here?

390
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,325
I didn't put it there. Ms. Beolgyo did!

391
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,326
Then it is mine. Give it here!

392
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,019
No!

393
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:54,081
Hey, now you're even getting jealous of a tissue box?

394
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:59,027
Hey, who said that I was jealous?

395
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:02,981
- Give it back, then!
- No!

396
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,055
This was your intention all along, wasn't it?

397
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,207
Huh?

398
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,226
Because you wanted to kiss me.

399
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,521
N-no, not at all!

400
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,841
Don't lie.

401
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,234
Here, go ahead.

402
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:25,863
Oh, you little... no thanks!

403
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:27,406
Just watch some TV!

404
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,266
Geez.

405
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:32,744
It has been revealed today that there will be a special shareholder's meeting

406
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:37,040
this afternoon to discuss the dismissal of Chairman Kang Jong Du.

407
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,452
This has attracted much attention as to who the successor of Haneul Group

408
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:43,338
will be as Chairman Kang continues to be in a comatose state.

409
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:48,869
Some believe it may be the newly appointed 3rd ranked member

410
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,872
at Haneul Group, while others believe that it may be one of the Kang Cousins.

411
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,777
The special shareholders' meeting has just been announced.

412
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:09,214
We're gone too far to go back now. You know that, right?

413
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:12,767
All you need to do now is what must be done.

414
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,715
Chairman of Haneul Group Kang Jong Du

415
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:38,994
Special Shareholders' Meeting, 2016

416
00:33:38,994 --> 00:33:41,855
We hope that you can attend.
The date and time will be announced soon.

417
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,941
Did you see the text?

418
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:47,036
They're dismissing grandfather? What the hell is this about?

419
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,513
They're basically saying that they'll take him down.

420
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,850
Wait... you knew about this?

421
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,729
Then... everyone is betraying grandfather, now?

422
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:00,599
Be quiet. I need to think.

423
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,644
They'll never get enough people to agree to dismiss grandfather.

424
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,089
No. We're at a huge disadvantage here.

425
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,274
What?

426
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:11,718
The other side has already begun making their moves.

427
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,930
They're in the process of convincing those on our side to switch over.

428
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:18,392
Wait... who...

429
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,562
It's Hyung Yoon Seong.

430
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:26,616
What... did you just say?

431
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,594
Hyung was orchestrating all of this behind the scenes.

432
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,740
Go meet the shareholders from the entertainment side.

433
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,827
I'll meet with those related to the chemical and construction industries.

434
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:43,642
We have to hang on until Grandfather wakes up, no matter what.

435
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:44,918
Got that?

436
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:46,995
Yeah.

437
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,457
One Day Before Haneul Group's Special Shareholders' Meeting

438
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,125
Will Chairman Kang of Haneul Group have to step down?

439
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,027
One Day Before Haneul Group's Special Shareholders' Meeting

440
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:55,429
Top News Story: Haneul Group's Special Shareholders' Meeting

441
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,630
It's Kang Seo Woo!

442
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,829
- Please say something! Do you have any comments?
I'm sorry. Excuse us...

443
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,923
- Please say something!
- Any comments?

444
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,775
Will Chairman Kang of Haneul Group have to step down?

445
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:34,927
The reason I called you all here today is to protect Haneul Group.

446
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:38,888
I'm sure you may have doubts

447
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:42,600
about what a person like myself can accomplish in this situation.

448
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:47,230
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

449
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,910
However, I'm not so incompetant as to allow the company

450
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:56,381
that my grandfather has protected for fifty years to slip through my fingers.

451
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:59,543
Furthermore, I'm not immature enough to be unaware of the hard work

452
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:01,203
that all of you have put in

453
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,621
since the founding of this company.

454
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:10,862
I know just how much of a burden this position is.

455
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:17,152
Therefore, I want to take responsibility for it all, as the heir to Haneul Group.

456
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:30,566
I humbly ask that you believe in my earnestness.

457
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:39,408
I want to protect Haneul Group which is not just mine and the Chairman's

458
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:41,618
but yours as well.

459
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:56,024
What's so strange about him wanting to cheer on and support the woman he likes?

460
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:58,193
What's so strange about that?

461
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,008
You don't need to worry anymore.

462
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:07,102
Your father wanted this to be given to you.

463
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:12,316
As for this, Kang Hyeon Min was the one who put it in the storage unit.

464
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,827
He asked me to take you there.

465
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:20,265
That guy ... really worries a lot about you.

466
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:27,039
The management rights for Haneul Group will be the main issue of this meeting.

467
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,275
According to a related source

468
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:32,352
one of those who is vying for the role of successor

469
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:34,229
is Chairman Kang's grandson, Kang Hyeon Min.

470
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,998
-I have to step out for a bit.
-What?

471
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:38,592
I'm sorry. It's really urgent.

472
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:39,885
Well, okay.

473
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,096
Thanks!

474
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:53,398
I worked really hard.

475
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,235
Grandfather.

476
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,174
Please say I did a good job when you wake up.

477
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:17,840
Seo Woo told me that you've been putting in a lot of effort these days.

478
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,509
Are you trying to piss me off?

479
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,594
Any results yet?

480
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,432
I'm only holding back right now because your surgery is tomorrow.

481
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,109
What's this?

482
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,643
My power of attorney.

483
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:42,531
Despite everything, I'm a shareholder of Haneul Group, too.

484
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,652
Did you call me out to give me this?

485
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:50,289
I'll be in the middle of my surgery tomorrow, anyway.

486
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,712
Wow, how unexpected. To think that you, of all people, would step up and help me.

487
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,739
This doesn't only concern you. This concerns me, too.

488
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,152
I'm helping Grandfather live by giving him a piece of my liver

489
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:08,523
but if he finds out that he's lost his position, he'll just collapse again.

490
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:10,933
I can't let that happen.

491
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,582
Make sure you protect him tomorrow.

492
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,717
Why did I even come here?

493
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:51,717
Wait!

494
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,711
I told you, I really don't have an appetite.

495
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,855
Just look at how much weight you've lost!

496
00:39:56,855 --> 00:40:00,917
I got my paycheck today, so let's have three whole pizzas today!

497
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,611
What? Three whole pizzas?

498
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,488
Hey, wait!

499
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,746
You're really not going to eat?

500
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:18,544
How could I just eat by myself, when everyone else is suffering?

501
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:24,916
Grandfather and Ji Woon are having their surgeries tomorrow.

502
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,218
Seo Woo.

503
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,598
There's the thing with the company, and with Ji Woon and Grandfather.

504
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:35,018
But there's nothing I can do to help with any of that.

505
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,704
I have no idea what I should do.

506
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:39,022
Sing!

507
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:43,944
What did you need most when you were going through tough times?

508
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:48,323
It was someone to cheer you on, right?

509
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,185
So you can cheer them on with your best song.

510
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,787
That's what everyone needs the most from you right now.

511
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,081
You still haven't realized that yet?

512
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:59,242
But the funny thing is...

513
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:02,713
why were you the first person I thought about at a time like this?

514
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,883
Really?

515
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:10,829
Figures. We were fated to be together!

516
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:14,625
Hurry up and eat.

517
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,226
Eat up!

518
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,616
I need to talk to you.

519
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:37,206
Can you leave? I'm really tired today.

520
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,667
You can stop now.

521
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:47,674
You don't need to feel sorry anymore.

522
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:56,349
Toward my brother... or to me.

523
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,870
♫  You are messing with my head, ♫

524
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,920
♫  You're shaking my heart up, and ♫

525
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,420
♫  Why do you keep looking somewhere else? ♫

526
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,160
♫  I'm looking at you right in front of me ♫

527
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,300
♫  I am wanting you so badly but ♫

528
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,210
♫  why do you keep doing this? ♫

529
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,500
♫  While you have a smile on your face ♫

530
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,140
♫  with one of your tears my heart aches ♫

531
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,890
It wasn't your fault, Hyeon Min.

532
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,720
♫  Yes, that's how I always feel about you. ♫

533
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:46,650
I'm sorry that I didn't know about this before.

534
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,610
♫  As much as the sighs behind the clumsy smile ♫

535
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,810
♫  As much as my tears which I secretly wipe away ♫

536
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,590
Sorry. I'll head in first.

537
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,920
♫  My one and only you ♫

538
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,910
♫  If slowly someday you can see how I feel ♫

539
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:15,250
♫  Like a dream, like a miracle ♫

540
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:22,130
♫  You will be there in the time that I dreamed of ♫

541
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,650
♫ I believe ♫

542
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,880
♫  Do you know? My two eyes always steal a glance at you. ♫

543
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,940
♫  When my everything was filled ♫

544
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,660
♫  The whole world was different. ♫

545
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,190
♫  My unstoppable heart ♫

546
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,320
♫  When I walked as I was told ♫

547
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,720
♫  You already had become my everything ♫

548
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,348
It was hard for me.

549
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:03,810
I have to protect Grandfather and the company now.

550
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:08,440
But I've never once protected anything that belonged to me.

551
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,737
I couldn't protect what was most important to you.

552
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:19,785
And I felt like all I ever did was hurt you, which made me miserable.

553
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:26,410
That's why I pushed you away and shut myself off.

554
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:31,330
♫  Why are you innocently smiling mischievously? ♫

555
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,131
But I don't want to do that anymore.

556
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,317
♫  I am barely living. ♫

557
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:40,021
I was wrong to run away from you before.

558
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:43,016
Hyeon Min.

559
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,026
Now...

560
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,060
♫ If you extend your arm,  ♫

561
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,780
I'll protect you properly.

562
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,890
♫  you could almost reach me. ♫

563
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:57,860
♫  Why is it such a long way? ♫

564
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,040
♫  Even if my heart were worn away  ♫

565
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:11,550
♫ I can't go on a path which doesn't lead to you ♫

566
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,490
♫  I can't live without you ♫

567
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:23,000
♫  If this wait were a long punishment, I would accept it. ♫

568
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:29,188
In the worst-case scenario, you may never wake up again.

569
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,466
Will you still go through with the surgery?

570
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,190
♫  Come into my heart. ♫

571
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:47,956
What if...

572
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,505
something goes wrong during my surgery tomorrow?

573
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,260
Are you really going to say things like that?

574
00:46:02,154 --> 00:46:04,347
If you do, I'm really going to tell you off!

575
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:07,842
Looks like the almighty Eun Ha Won is scared.

576
00:46:07,842 --> 00:46:10,354
That won't happen, so don't say things like that.

577
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,414
I'm not scared at all.

578
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:16,384
You're by my side, after all.

579
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,112
Oh, stop it.

580
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:25,911
Do you remember the first day we met, at the columbarium?

581
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,008
Thinking about it now, I think my mom led me to meet you that day.

582
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:35,754
That was the anniversary of my mom's death.

583
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,966
Really?

584
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,136
That day was my mom's, too.

585
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:46,098
Really?

586
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:52,312
Wow, that means we were both in the same place on that day every year.

587
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:05,342
What's the matter?

588
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:06,910
Tonight's the last night.

589
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,021
You know...

590
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:39,209
there's tons of things that I want to do with you.

591
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,228
Like what?

592
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,199
I want to sit next to you and see a movie...

593
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:48,418
and go for a walk in a park with you.

594
00:47:48,418 --> 00:47:52,414
And I want to eat tteokbokki at a street stall with you, too.

595
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,235
Why are the dates you want to go on so simple

596
00:47:56,235 --> 00:47:58,612
when you're a third-generation chaebol?

597
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,049
Oh yeah.

598
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:06,611
You still haven't granted me my wish.

599
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:08,446
A wish?

600
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:14,319
If I find it first, you have to grant me a wish!

601
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:24,429
Grant me my wish.

602
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:26,740
And what's your wish?

603
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,200
Let's go on a date.

604
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,852
When?

605
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:34,790
Right now.

606
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,060
Hello!

607
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,111
- Hello!
- Hello!

608
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:43,749
You all are working so hard, so I wanted to give you this.

609
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:46,160
Wow! You didn't need to. Thank you!

610
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,370
I'm so thankful for all the hard work that you do!

611
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,981
- Thank you!
- No, thank you!

612
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:52,207
Thank you!

613
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:55,152
- Please try this.
- Thank you!

614
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:57,050
How good is it?

615
00:48:57,813 --> 00:49:01,208
Drink up! It's great for your skin, too!

616
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,226
You'll be totally re-energized!

617
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,508

Why are there so many animals here?

621

Because the Little Mermaid lives underwater.

642
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,045
Oh, shush.

643
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,810
♫  The day the cold tears stopped. ♫

644
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,590
All right. One, two, three!

645
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:27,800
♫  It was you. In my heart ♫

646
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:29,112
Hey!

647
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,450
♫  My paradise is wherever you are. ♫

648
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:36,950
♫  Stay with me forever. ♫

649
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:38,730
Does that taste good?

650
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,632
Yep, totally.

651
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,009
And you're not even sharing.

652
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:45,011
You're the one who wanted to come here!

653
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:46,621
All I did was grant your wish.

654
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:48,523
But I can't eat this!

655
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,484
Of course you shouldn't be eating!

656
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:53,845
You can't eat when you're getting surgery tomorrow. No, you can't.

657
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:55,806
Then we'll have to come back here and eat it together next time.

658
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,516
Must you really eat that by yourself today?

659
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:04,798
What, do you not want to come back with me next time?

660
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:09,786
Why aren't you answering me?

661
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,282
Of course we should come back together next time!

662
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:14,867
Yeah. Let's come back.

663
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,754
Hey, it's the green light! Let's hurry up and go!

664
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:21,606
Hey, wait for me!

665
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:24,751
Hurry up!

666
00:51:25,827 --> 00:51:28,397
Wait, my phone! I think I left it there!

667
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:32,308
Way to go. Hurry up and cross over. I'll get it.

668
00:51:32,308 --> 00:51:33,552
- Okay.
- Hurry!

669
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:40,700
Idiot.

670
00:51:47,015 --> 00:51:49,201
I got your phone right here!

671
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:00,078
Kang Ji Woon!

672
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,990
♫  Don't come any closer. ♫

673
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,140
♫  Don't make me dream. ♫

674
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:16,428
Don't be surprised if I'm not there after you wake up from the surgery.

675
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,431
What did you say?

676
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,220
♫  A sad dream always ♫

677
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:23,610
I'm sorry.

678
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,720
♫  fills your reddened eyes. ♫

679
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:28,073
I can't really hear you!

680
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:32,310
♫  In my frozen heart ♫

681
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,530
I said that I love you!

682
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:40,860
♫ like a strong wind blowing ♫

683
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:47,310
♫  Even each moment I take a breath hurts ♫

684
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:55,510
♫  My love cannot be stopped. ♫

685
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:06,710
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

686
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:12,476
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

687
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:14,052
Did you hear my voice?

688
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,360
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

689
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:26,520
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

690
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,760
♫  Without you ♫

691
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,130
♫  Without you ♫

692
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,300
♫  Without you ♫

693
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,600
♫  I'm not confident I can let you go ♫

694
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,820
♫  Without you ♫

695
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,970
♫  Without you ♫

696
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:49,100
♫  Without you ♫

697
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:55,820
♫  I will wait for you forever. ♫

698
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:10,530
♫  Even the reason that I breathe ♫

699
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:16,840
♫  is you is something you don't know. ♫

700
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,300
♫  Saying I love you is not enough. ♫

701
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,180
♫  My love only for you. ♫

702
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,369
Don't worry.

703
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:37,386
I'll definitely return to your side.

704
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,810
♫  How much more painful will it be? ♫

705
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:49,310
♫  If I could hold you in my arms ♫

706
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:55,590
♫  I will wait forever. ♫

707
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:02,580
♫  You're the only reason to live. ♫

708
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,900
♫  Without you ♫

709
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:14,240
♫  I'll always love you. ♫

710
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,130
Make sure you protect your grandfather's position.

711
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,383
Just like you promised you'd protect me.

712
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:53,829
Why'd you go all the way to the market just to buy 2,000 won worth of sprouts?

713
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:56,315
There's tons of supermarkets around here!

714
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:59,618
It's a lot cheaper at the market.

715
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,169
It's nice, isn't it? We're getting some exercise, too.

716
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:04,122
Exercise? My legs hurt!

717
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:05,490
Really!

718
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:09,811
Get it together! You don't even have a job!

719
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:11,455
I did some part-time jobs!

720
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:16,402
Oh, you mean that part-time job where you kept falling asleep, and got fired?

721
00:56:16,402 --> 00:56:19,246
Hey, those people were the weird ones!

722
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:23,191
They should've drawn my sleeping form! That in itself is still a work of art!

723
00:56:23,191 --> 00:56:29,881
Really, how are you going to live when you can't do anything? Huh?

724
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:33,192
I'm sure that Dad will earn some more money.

725
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,319
Why, you little--

726
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,688
do you know how hard of a time your dad is going through right now?

727
00:56:38,724 --> 00:56:41,918
It would've been a bit better if I hadn't gotten fired.

728
00:56:41,918 --> 00:56:46,865
He's working himself to death right now! I'm so worried about his health.

729
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:49,701
Oh, look at you and your lovey-dovey words!

730
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:58,017
Who could this be?

731
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:01,088
Hello?

732
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:08,428
What?

733
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,390
We're all done here now.

734
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:00,989
We will now be starting

735
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:04,693
the 2016 Haneul Group Special Shareholders' Meeting.

736
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:14,194
The topic for discussion today is the dismissal of Chairman Kang Jong Du.

737
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:18,565
We will now begin the voting process.

738
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:51,890
Good work.

739
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,594
It's almost all over now.

740
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:28,602
We will now announce the results

741
00:59:28,602 --> 00:59:32,697
regarding the dismissal of Chairman Kang.

742
00:59:50,098 --> 00:59:51,492
We will now begin the operation.

743
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:52,930
Scalpel.
