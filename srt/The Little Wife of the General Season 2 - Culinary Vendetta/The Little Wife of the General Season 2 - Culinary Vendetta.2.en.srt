=Culinary Vendetta=

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,630
Try it.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,480
Madam Chu,

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,000
First Madam, Second Madam,
there's trouble!

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,280
What happened? Speak.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,510
While delivering a meal to Miss Su,

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,920
I saw her bring a man back with her.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,560
At this moment, the two of them

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,360
are engaged in improper behavior.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,110
Look, this pair of adulterers.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
Someone,

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,080
arrest them.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,780
There's been a murder!

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,430
Madam Chu.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,940
Someone!

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,120
Drag him out now!

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,430
Qianqian.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Are you all right?

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,960
Qianqian,

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,150
what happened?

24
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,710
Su Qianqian,

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,710
have you lost your mind?

26
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,450
Sister-in-law, what are you waiting for?

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,910
Do you want this scandal

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,890
to become public knowledge?

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,120
I don't know this man.

30
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,350
He broke into the room with ill intent.

31
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,840
I had no choice
but to defend myself with a hairpin.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
You all saw it too.

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,470
That is merely your own account.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,760
You must've realized
your crime was revealed,

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,560
so you killed him to escape punishment.

36
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes, I can testify to this.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,630
I saw it with my own eyes.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Silence!

39
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,750
You insolent maid!

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,710
You laced the medicine
with an aphrodisiac,

41
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,680
and forced me to drink.

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,120
You even brought someone to humiliate me.

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,630
Second Madam,

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,870
she's slandering me. I didn't do it.

45
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,960
Su Qianqian,

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
at this point,

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,000
no matter how convincingly you speak,

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,520
you can't deny the truth
of your affair and crime.

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Sister-in-law,

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,750
arrest her first, and question her later.

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,280
The soup is right there.

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,710
You can test it freely.

53
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,960
If I speak even half a lie,

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,590
I shall end my life to atone.

55
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Someone.

56
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,670
Fetch the family doctor.

57
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,590
No need for that.

58
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,510
I have my own method.

59
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,800
Seize this vile maid at once.

60
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,870
Force her to drink this soup.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Drink.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Open your mouth.

63
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,560
(Someone plotting my demise)

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
(is surely among these people.)

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,750
(It's most likely
my ruthless mother-in-law.)

66
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,150
(Even if I marry into the Chu Family,)

67
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,360
(the road ahead
will be fraught with danger.)

68
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,030
(Tianze's plan)

69
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,750
(seems to have failed.)

70
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,550
Speak.

71
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,240
Who ordered you to do this?

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
Speak up!

73
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,710
First Madam is asking you.

74
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,710
Why won't you answer?

75
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,840
You insolent servant!

76
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,960
Su Qianqian is such a pitiful soul.

77
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,590
She has no family left.

78
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,600
How could you have no conscience?

79
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,560
Do you want to end up with no family too?

80
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,480
Answer me!

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,870
Madam, please forgive me.

82
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,160
I admit my mistake.

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,020
I accepted someone else's bribe.

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,950
But the one who bribed me

85
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,240
was wearing a mask.

86
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,360
I couldn't see his face clearly.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,070
I don't know who he is.

88
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Shameless one!

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,270
Mistakes must be punished.

90
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,160
At least she seeks to correct her wrongs.

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,310
Spare her with leniency.

92
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,830
Sister-in-law,

93
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
you are kind and compassionate.

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
What do you think about this?

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Guards!

96
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,630
Break her legs.

97
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,070
Expel her from the General Mansion!

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,920
Madam, please spare me! I was wrong.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Qianqian.

100
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,110
Qianqian.

101
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,360
You silly child,

102
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,480
although you are the victim,

103
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm afraid Madam Chu would become

104
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,870
squeamish about you.

105
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,480
What crime have I committed?

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,830
Silly child, there's no one behind you,

107
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,630
yet you dare to enter such perilous danger.

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,830
Where did you find such courage?

109
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
First Madam,

110
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,720
I have long been living in hell.

111
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,240
Why should I fear any danger?

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Take care of yourself.

113
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,070
Who are you?

114
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,310
Didn't you always want to marry me?

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,560
How could you not even know who I am?

116
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,920
Chu Tianze.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,310
Who calls their husbands
by name so directly?

118
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,190
Sir, please mind your manners.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,630
You will belong to me sooner or later.

120
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,950
Why not let me cherish you now?

121
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,510
Come on!

122
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,440
According to the agreement
of the older generation,

123
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,310
I have long been your wife.

124
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,510
It just hasn't been consummated.

125
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,190
Such behavior is improper,

126
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,360
and spreading it
would only be a laughingstock.

127
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,040
It would disgrace
the Chu Family and Madam Chu.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Get up!

129
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,030
Listen,

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,790
how can you, shameless woman, marry me?

131
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,390
I didn't expect you,

132
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,550
a member of the Chus, to be so disgraceful.

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,120
If you find me so disgraceful,

134
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,870
why would you still marry me?

135
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,840
What exactly is your scheme?

136
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,840
If you marry me,

137
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,240
I'll wait for you in hell.

138
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,990
If not,

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,910
your plans will come to nothing.

140
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,840
Either way, you're trapped.

141
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,080
I didn't expect her to be so bold.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,360
She visited Madam Chu alone
to claim her marriage,

143
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,720
risked her life
to prepare a meal for Lord Heng,

144
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
and killed the one who insulted her.

145
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,630
She can stay calm in the face of danger.

146
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,840
Interesting.

147
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
But she wants to marry into the Chu Family.

148
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,630
That's nothing short of wishful thinking.

149
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,750
My father has requested
His Majesty for marriage.

150
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,270
The decree will likely arrive by tomorrow.

151
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,270
Chu Junyao, this stumbling block.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,030
It still requires me to remove him myself.

153
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,080
The Tiger Tally of the Chus
can command the Frontier Army.

154
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
If it weren't to obtain the tally,

155
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,200
I wouldn't care for someone
as useless as you.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,440
General,

157
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,870
several female corpses were found.

158
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,480
They were the Sus.

159
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,470
Rest assured.

160
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,750
Miss Su is not among them.

161
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,480
The one who buried the bodies

162
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,910
must be a member of the Sus.

163
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,000
Was it Qianqian?

164
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,550
If it were Miss Su,

165
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,200
she'd have gone to the General Mansion.

166
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,150
I didn't reveal my true identity to her,

167
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,790
so she couldn't have gone there.

168
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,870
Commander,

169
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,960
Miss Yingying you asked about

170
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,270
has not been exiled.

171
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,790
Instead, she was sold to a brothel.

172
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,750
That's good, that's good.

173
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,910
What?

174
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,480
Sold to a brothel?

175
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,110
General!

176
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,960
Go.

177
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,240
(Qianqian, I will find you.)

178
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,790
His Majesty has decreed.

179
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,220
The daughter of Ning'an Marquis,
Princess Mingzhu,

180
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,690
(Imperial Edict)
is virtuous

181
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,200
and talented.

182
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,360
I believe that she and Chu Tianze
of the Chu Family

183
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,150
is a perfect match.

184
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,570
This is a blessing for the dynasty.

185
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,150
Thus, I grant this marriage

186
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,960
to express my royal will.

187
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,150
Let it be decreed.

188
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,770
Have you seen her?

189
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,700
No, truly I haven't.

190
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,020
Look carefully.

191
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,700
General,

192
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,340
I have been on duty these days.

193
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,780
I truly haven't seen her.

194
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,460
(Given Qianqian's situation,)

195
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,340
(she'd disguise herself
to enter the city.)

196
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,460
(Qianqian,)

197
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,180
(where are you?)

198
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,180
(I am so worried.)

199
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,900
Search the entire city discreetly.

200
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,100
Understood.

201
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,620
Qianqian,

202
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,940
You had a tough day.

204
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,940
Although the Chu Family failed
to fulfill the agreement,

205
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,460
rest assured.

206
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,740
Madam Chu has already entered the palace

207
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,780
to request His Majesty's decree

208
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,700
to pardon you.

209
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,540
Don't worry.

210
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,580
For now, stay here for the night.

211
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,420
We'll wait for news tomorrow,

212
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,220
then someone will escort you
out of the city.

213
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,900
Thank you, First Madam.

214
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,940
Don't cry.

215
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,860
Get some rest early.

216
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,060
(Without the help of the Chu Family,)

217
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,620
(how can I clear my family's name?)

218
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,260
(There's no one to discuss this with.)

219
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,940
(I wonder how Yingying is doing.)

220
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,390
(Chunhua House)

221
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,580
Steamed Buns!

222
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,780
- Stay back.
- Don't run!

223
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,620
Don't come near me!

224
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,100
Control yourself!

225
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
Stay back!

226
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,180
Don't come closer!

227
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,060
I said, stay back!

228
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,540
Don't run away!

229
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,800
Why are you running?

230
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,150
Oh my goodness!

231
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,040
I can't run anymore.

232
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,540
You...

233
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,340
Stay still, or I'll ask
the Brothel Keeper for a refund.

234
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,160
She said you had great stamina,

235
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,140
good at setting a mood.

236
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,540
This is false advertising, you know?

237
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,380
Am I lacking stamina?

238
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,380
I haven't let you catch me yet.

239
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,460
I paid to enjoy myself!

240
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,740
You suggested playing
Eagle Catches the Chicks.

241
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,540
Are you a chick?

242
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,760
You're more like an eagle!

243
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,300
(Knock him out,
then escape through the window.)

244
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,340
I knew you'd try to run.

245
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,420
What a coincidence.

246
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,020
Let's go.

247
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,700
Help! Someone help me!

248
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,340
Princess.

249
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,540
Su Qianqian has left the General Mansion.

250
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,420
I will destroy everything she has.

251
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,660
Yes.
