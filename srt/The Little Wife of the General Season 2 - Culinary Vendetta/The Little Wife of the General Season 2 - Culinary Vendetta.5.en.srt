00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,060
=Culinary Vendetta=

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,830
What? Wearing mourning clothes
at her wedding?

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,830
Su Qianqian is truly outrageous!

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
How unlucky!

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,000
Sister-in-law,

7
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,000
Junyao's wedding is certainly unique.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,470
Anyone who didn't know
might think it's a funeral.

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,380
(General Mansion)

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,870
Honey.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,000
Both are in mourning attire.

12
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,840
This Chu Junyao...

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Let's go.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
Mother,

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,280
today is also the Sus' Seventh Day Mourning.

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,070
I hope you can understand.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,640
Dear friends and relatives,

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,070
and neighbors,

19
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,510
it's truly unfortunate
that weddings and funerals

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,510
have coincided like this.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,710
The bridal

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,760
wearing mourning attire

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
might be laughable.

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,400
Exactly!

25
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,200
For our Chu Family,

26
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,680
it's actually an honor.

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,310
An honor, even in mourning clothes?

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,310
Indeed, it's so inauspicious.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,920
Well, don't say that.
This could be fun to watch.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,790
After all, my daughter-in-law, Su Qianqian

31
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,210
lost all her family just a few days ago.

32
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,560
That's why
she's wearing mourning attire today.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,150
What does this signify?

34
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,190
It signifies that Qianqian
cherishes old bonds,

35
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,520
but embraces a new beginning.

36
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,630
My son, Chu Junyao,

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,120
to marry someone so loyal, devoted,

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
dutiful and filial, is truly

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,240
an honor

40
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,310
for our Chu Family.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,920
She's right.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,400
This person is beautiful,
with a kind heart.

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
Filial piety that moves the world.

44
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,150
Good fortune indeed.

45
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,710
Let us welcome

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,190
the brides enter the Chu Family.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Halt!

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,190
- Enter what?
- Ridiculous.

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,360
Sister-in-law, Junyao

50
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,970
is marrying a concubine.

51
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,560
They can't use the main entrance.

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,680
Brother, what are you doing?

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,430
Don't you think this is inauspicious?

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,220
You and I are both brothers.

55
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,680
Our weddings are on the same day.

56
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,310
As the saying goes,
"Elder brother takes precedence."

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,530
Naturally, you should enter first.

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,310
And of course, you...

59
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,880
He's carrying her.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,710
I haven't even finished yet.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,250
- Are you listening?
- You.

62
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,000
Chu Junyao.

63
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,680
- You, you...
- Chu Junyao!

64
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,120
Good.

65
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,400
You.

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,800
Chu Junyao, how dare you!

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,030
Honey, don't be anxious.

68
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,680
The real show has just begun.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,150
Let's wait and see.

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Honey, please.

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Young Master.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,150
I put poison on his wedding banquet.

73
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,360
He will definitely drink much tonight,

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,910
so he won't be on guard.

75
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,680
This will surely kill him.

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,200
Useless fool!

77
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,360
Today is my wedding day.

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,000
Would it be auspicious if someone died?

79
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,560
Why are you so brainless? Get lost!

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,830
Yes, I'll have them remove it right away.

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
A perfectly fine wedding

82
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
was completely ruined by Su Qianqian,

83
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,600
turning it into a joke
across the capital.

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,310
She's trying to drive a thorn
into my heart.

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Greetings, Princess.

86
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,590
How dare you!

87
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,360
Wearing this into Princess's bridal chamber.

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,270
Get out now!

89
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,630
Yue'e.

90
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,030
Princess.

91
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,190
A guest is a guest.

92
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,630
- Serve the tea.
- Yes.

93
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,270
On behalf of the hundreds of deceased members

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,480
of the Su Family, I bring a gift to you.

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
I wonder if you dare to accept it.

96
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,680
(It seems Su Qianqian is not foolish.)

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,870
(She has already begun to suspect me.)

98
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,870
If you bring the gift on your behalf,

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,390
I would naturally be delighted.

100
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,040
But if it represents those traitors,

101
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,240
I cannot possibly accept this gift.

102
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,480
Every member of my family
upholds utmost loyalty,

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
dedicated to the country,

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,270
and the welfare of the people.

105
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,600
We are certainly not traitors.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
What use is it to tell me such things?

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This case is already known to all.

108
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
You should explain it to the world,

109
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,120
and see whether they believe it or not.

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,870
Please rest assured, Princess.

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,430
I will uncover the truth

112
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,510
and bring justice to the Su Family.

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
The truth about the Su Family,

114
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,360
to me and the world,

115
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,830
is merely a storyteller's script,

116
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,430
completely insignificant.

117
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,350
People neglect it,

118
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,510
if it's not their concern.

119
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,720
Such is human nature.

120
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,040
But if someone suffers injustice,

121
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,040
without cries or voices,

122
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,630
the world will fall into
endless darkness.

123
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,680
I believe in our nation,

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
in the rule of law,

125
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,160
in fairness and justice.

126
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,880
They can break through the darkness,

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,430
give a voice to the weak,

128
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,830
fight for the powerless,

129
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,680
and those who disregard lives

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,390
and wrongfully harm others

131
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,390
will be held accountable eventually.

132
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,600
Even a tiny firefly dares to
challenge the dark.

133
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,600
It seems you have grand ambitions.

134
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,310
I truly admire that.

135
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,070
However,

136
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,390
even if the Su Family was wronged,

137
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,750
what difference would it make?

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,310
After all, the dead cannot
return to life.

139
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,360
Don't you agree?

140
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,190
Indeed, the dead cannot return to life.

141
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
But the truth brings solace
to the departed,

142
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,560
and serves to uphold
fairness and justice.

143
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,120
Moreover, it delivers punishment to evil.

144
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,190
Even in the depths of darkness,

145
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,040
if there is but a single firefly,

146
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,510
it can still scorch away evil.

147
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,270
So, I hope you find the firefly
and truth soon,

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,750
but do not let the darkness consume you.

149
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,360
Thank you for your guidance.

150
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,920
No need for such formality between us.

151
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,160
From this moment on,

152
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,920
we are a family as sisters-in-law.

153
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,430
There will be more time to grow close.

154
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,430
You may simply call me sister-in-law.

155
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,030
Sister-in-law, you're right.

156
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,790
As the saying goes,
"Daughters-in-law are outsiders."

157
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,240
So we should naturally
support each other more.

158
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,440
(Although I haven't found evidence,)

159
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,360
(I'm certain she is the mastermind.)

160
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,960
(I will crush you like an ant.)

161
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,030
(You won't live for long.)

162
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
Sister-in-law, you're right.

163
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
My lady.

164
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,370
Why must we hold the wedding today?

165
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,120
It clashes with the other wedding.

166
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,150
You are even in mourning.

167
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,030
You can't even wear new attire.

168
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
The Wedding Night might be ruined.

169
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,030
I think the Ning Family
isn't the only suspect.

170
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,910
I planned to plant a thorn
in her heart first,

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,720
then provoke her further.

172
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,440
I thought she'd slip up under pressure,

173
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,870
but it seems I underestimated her.

174
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,600
Are you sure it's her?

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
Almost certain.

176
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,120
She's not easy to deal with.

177
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,960
From now on, in the Chu Family,

178
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,510
you must stay vigilant.

179
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,790
Never let anyone catch you off guard.

180
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,270
In the inner quarters of such a family,

181
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,630
it is full of schemes.

182
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,510
A single mistake,
and you could lose your life.

183
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,790
My lady, I have a timid nature.

184
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,030
I won't cause trouble.

185
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,840
Silly girl,

186
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm not afraid of that.

187
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,030
I'm afraid trouble will find you.

188
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,910
I understand.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
First Madam.

190
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,630
Greetings, mother-in-law.

191
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Do you still regard me
as your mother-in-law,

192
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,910
or care about the Chu Family?

193
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
I was reckless today.

194
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,630
Please forgive me.

195
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,120
Oh, so you know it was reckless?

196
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,390
Do you know Madam Chu
values reputation most?

197
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,870
What you did today

198
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,670
has drained all her goodwill toward you.

199
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,270
I've deeply disappointed her.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,550
Your actions today,

201
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,390
anyone with a discerning eye
can see it.

202
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,910
I truly hope you won't come here

203
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,670
only to bring chaos and turmoil.

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,550
However,

205
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,120
if anyone dares to disrespect you,

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,120
I, as your mother-in-law,
will not tolerate it.

207
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,790
Mother-in-law.

208
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,510
To tell you the truth.

209
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,320
I publicly expressed my approval of you

210
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,430
on purpose.

211
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,170
If you think I'm doing this
just to save face,

212
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,560
then you're wrong.

213
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,360
This is truly how I feel in my heart.

214
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,870
You've endured so much suffering.

215
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,240
But rest assured,

216
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,870
from this day forward,

217
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,000
our Chu Family

218
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,270
will be your haven
against all storms.

219
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,030
Junyao and I will protect you well.

220
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,670
You remind me of my birth mother.

221
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,110
I...

222
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,030
Thank you, mother-in-law.

223
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,630
No need to thank me just yet.

224
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,000
I have my conditions, you know.

225
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,120
Since we've spread the word,
saying you're expecting,

226
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,200
you must truly give birth to a child.

227
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,440
Though Junyao isn't the first young master,

228
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,260
my grandson must not fall behind.

229
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,670
The two of you married on the same day,

230
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,990
so you started on equal footing.

231
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,320
You'd better give it your all,

232
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,480
and try your best.

233
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,880
Mother-in-law,
this is really hard to say.

234
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,200
Why would it be?

235
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,390
For other matters,

236
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,790
I'll help you with them.

237
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,150
There's been some progress.

238
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,670
The officials providing evidence
against the Su Family,

239
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,440
though not from Ning Mansion,

240
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,630
are all intricately connected to it.

241
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,960
The so-called evidence of treason

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,000
has already been sealed.

243
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,080
But when I tried to verify it,

244
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,270
I found it had all been destroyed.

245
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,630
It was all fabricated from the start.

246
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,000
To hide the truth, it had to be erased.

247
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
To overturn the case,

248
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,870
we must target these officials.

249
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,150
Some measures will be inevitable.

250
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
Zi Xuan.

251
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,310
- Let's start with
- Changsheng,

252
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
Constable Zhang's testimony.

253
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,150
See? It still listens to me.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Tonight is our Wedding Night.

255
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,960
What exactly are you two up to?

256
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
General,

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,360
you do know it's the Wedding Night, right?

258
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Discussing a case today...

259
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,840
Is that appropriate?

260
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,240
If we don't talk about cases,

261
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,870
what shall we talk about?

262
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,910
Of course, with the flowers and moonlight,

263
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,870
the newlyweds should enjoy the love,

264
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,320
the lingering affection,

265
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,440
and a priceless night of joy.

266
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,510
General,

267
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,150
this is your fault.

268
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,720
Although you are righteous,

269
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,390
courageous,

270
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,080
and pure at heart,

271
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,200
but...

272
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,030
the marriage should be consummated.

273
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,720
Yes, my lady,

274
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,330
a moment of such a night
is worth 1,000 gold.

275
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,600
Zi Xuan, let us return first.

276
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
My lady.

277
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
Let's go.

278
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,920
Qianqian,

279
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,360
Zi Xuan does make a valid point.

280
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,720
After all, today is our wedding.

281
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,080
I can't afford to neglect you.

282
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,440
It's already late.

283
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,320
Come here.

284
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,510
Let me help you remove your robe.

285
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,550
Honey, I forgot to tell you.

286
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,440
I'll observe mourning
for my family for 3 years.

287
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,790
Three... years?

288
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,750
Yes. Is there a problem?

289
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Of course, no problem.

290
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,670
But what about my mother?

291
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,270
It might be hard to explain.

292
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,400
It doesn't have to take 3 years.

293
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,040
At least wait until
my family's name is cleared.

294
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,570
Honey, what do you think?

295
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,270
What's going on with Zi Xuan?

296
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,150
I'll let him investigate right now.

297
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,350
Honey,

298
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,920
after all, today is our wedding day.

299
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,510
Can't we make an exception just this once?

300
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,270
Although we are already married,

301
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,400
but during mourning,
intimacy is forbidden.

302
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,250
However, this is a special case.

303
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,550
We will...
