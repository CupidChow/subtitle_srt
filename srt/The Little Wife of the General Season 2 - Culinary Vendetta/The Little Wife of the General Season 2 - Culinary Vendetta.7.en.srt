=Culinary Vendetta=

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,320
I don't think you're worried.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,710
I think you're just crafty and scheming.

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,470
We are husband and wife.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,430
All those sneaky thoughts

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,710
are actually justified.

8
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,520
It is

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,350
so hot today.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,790
I feel the medicine is too strong.

11
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,710
Why is the door still locked?

12
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,310
What are you doing?

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
I am...

14
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,630
I am studying.

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Studying?

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Then let me study too.

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
No need.

18
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,710
Once I learn it, I'll teach you.

19
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,800
You don't need to study.

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,910
Let's go back now.

21
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,150
I'll go back and teach you.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,310
Honey, I'm so sorry.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,310
This soup is truly incredible.

24
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
I need to go out and calm down.

25
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,800
(This soup...)

26
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,520
(We mustn't drink it again.)

27
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,590
You just extinguished the blazing fire.

28
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
General,

29
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,630
you truly are beyond human.

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,240
You've been surrounded
by too much Yin Energy.

31
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,840
Yang Energy is too weak.

32
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,910
You've become even more erratic,

33
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,430
and need to be properly disciplined.

34
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
Not at all.

35
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,710
Oh, by the way, General,

36
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,470
I sent someone to
find that Constable Zhang,

37
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,000
but he's gone missing.

38
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,070
Missing?

39
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,910
Yes,

40
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,920
no one has seen him
at his office or home.

41
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,040
What about his family?

42
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,120
They were sent away
before the Sus' incident,

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,870
probably to avoid others
exploiting his weaknesses.

44
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,800
This Constable Zhang

45
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,830
is a key clue in the Su Family's case.

46
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,430
We must find him.

47
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,950
If alive, bring him here.

48
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,600
If dead, find his body.

49
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,590
Understood.

50
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,920
Princess, please forgive me!

51
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,720
That First Madam is truly formidable.

52
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,750
With just a few words,
she uncovered our plan.

53
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,680
She even

54
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,070
tracked down my family.

55
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,230
Princess,

56
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,560
I was truly left with no choice.

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,390
(Tactical, astute, and meticulous.)

58
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,560
(This person is a formidable opponent.)

59
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,920
Physician Wang,

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,240
isn't it true
that Su Qianqian isn't pregnant?

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,830
No pregnancy.

62
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,480
Physician Wang.

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
You've ruined my grand plan.

64
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Princess, please spare me!

65
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,950
Princess, I beg for mercy.

66
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,480
I have a family to care for.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,520
Princess, please...

68
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,480
My lady.

69
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
You are now the general's wife.

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,750
There's no need to
handle everything yourself.

71
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,000
The vast General Mansion

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,430
is full of cooks.

73
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
If you think this way,

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,160
you won't be far from danger.

75
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,310
Whatever others put in,

76
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,360
you'll have to eat it in your meals.

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,100
Your life won't be under your control.

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
Remember this,

79
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,070
we only eat food we prepare ourselves,

80
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,000
and test it with silver needles
before eating.

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
We need to be thorough,

82
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,190
and tread carefully.

83
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Only then can we protect ourselves.

84
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,830
My lady, I will remember this.

85
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Let me help you.

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,660
These should be enough.

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,760
Oh, alright.

88
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,660
Let's head back.

89
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,750
Though Mingzhu is a noble princess,

90
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,680
she still needs to secure her place here.

91
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,750
She's still far from ready.

92
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
Spoiled since childhood,

93
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,430
she's never faced any real hardships.

94
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,480
The main branch is scheming.

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,630
It's not easy to deal with.

96
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,830
Bring her here.

97
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,070
I can give her some guidance.

98
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,190
Understood.

99
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,030
Greetings, mother-in-law.

100
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
Please, take a seat.

101
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,030
I wonder what instructions
you have for me.

102
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,910
Mingzhu,

103
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,050
you are the daughter of Ning'an Marquis.

104
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,440
You come from a prestigious family.

105
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,270
Our Chu Family is also
a noble household.

106
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,600
After marrying Tianze,

107
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,120
you became a part of our Chu Family.

108
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,510
The Chu Family
will belong to both of you.

109
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,000
So you must be cautious and thoughtful.

110
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,270
If there's anything you don't understand,

111
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,150
seek advice from the elders often.

112
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
But some elders

113
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,390
tend to act superior because of their age.

114
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,870
Don't let them influence you negatively.

115
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,360
But don't worry.

116
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,030
In the Chu Family,

117
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,030
we respect the old
and care for the young.

118
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,390
As your mother-in-law,
I'll treat you fairly.

119
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,270
(This old woman is clearly warning me.)

120
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,390
(She wants me to understand my place.)

121
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,600
I humbly accept your guidance.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,510
Today, Physician Wang's move

123
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,320
was truly a brilliant strategy.

124
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,440
But you lacked thorough consideration,

125
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,270
and startled the enemy beforehand.

126
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,440
You almost got yourself exposed.

127
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,360
Thank you for guiding me.

128
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,720
How dare this maid!

129
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,510
Are you mocking me?

130
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,470
No, I'm not.

131
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,720
Who am I to mock you?

132
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,040
Slap her.

133
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Yes.

134
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,390
Princess.

135
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,750
Slap yourself.

136
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes.

137
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Mother-in-law.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,390
Yue'e has offended you.

139
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,150
I failed to discipline her.

140
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,750
I will ensure stricter discipline
in the future.

141
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,200
Please don't misunderstand me.

142
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,390
You'll be managing
the Chu Family one day.

143
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,390
If you can't even manage a maid,

144
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,270
how will you handle
the household affairs?

145
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,790
Don't you agree?

146
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,960
You're absolutely right.

147
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,840
When I married into this family,

148
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,790
Madam Chu gave me this as a gift.

149
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,670
Now, I'm passing it on to you.

150
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,510
Thank you, mother-in-law.

151
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,390
Thank you, Princess.

152
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
Princess.

153
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,080
Today, Madam slapped my face.

154
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,030
But in truth, she was targeting you.

155
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,360
How could I not understand?

156
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,550
However, considering the current situation,

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
we'll still need her support.

158
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,960
When Tianze becomes
the head of the family,

159
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,870
I'll take a chance
to acquire the Tiger Tally.

160
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,790
Then, I'll settle scores with her.

161
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,790
Sorry, sorry.

162
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,840
It's freezing!

163
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm really sorry.

164
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,270
I twisted my ankle just now.

165
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,670
You should be more careful
while walking.

166
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,990
Where are you going?

167
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,600
My clothes are completely soaked.

168
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,550
I'm going to change.

169
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,750
Be sure not to wander aimlessly.

170
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,180
According to the rules here,

171
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,720
servants losing decorum
will face punishment.

172
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,750
If you walk through the courtyard like this,

173
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,150
you'll definitely be punished.

174
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,960
What should I do then?

175
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,720
This isn't even my fault.

176
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,390
My room is over there.

177
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,960
I'll get you some clothes.

178
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,600
That works, thanks a lot.

179
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
You're so kind.

180
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,870
Let's go.

181
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,320
Su Qianqian!

182
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,750
Get out here right now!

183
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
My lady.

184
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,790
Aunt, what's the meaning of this?

185
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
Su Qianqian.

186
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,080
Serves your Su Family right to face ruin!

187
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,960
You can't even manage a lowly maid.

188
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,320
Does she deserve
to wear silk and satin?

189
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,390
How is she worthy?

190
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Ugh, disgusting!

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,440
My lady, I didn't do it.

192
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,000
You still dare to argue?

193
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,840
I saw you wearing it with my own eyes.

194
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,440
Could anyone have framed you?

195
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
You... How can you...

196
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,750
Su Qianqian!

197
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
You've offended me,

198
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
calling me by name directly.

199
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,670
You should be punished.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,030
Su Qianqian!

201
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,360
You, a concubine,

202
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,080
dare to scold my maid?

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
A concubine is still a mistress.

204
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,270
As for your maid,

205
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,630
she's just a servant.

206
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,560
If a servant offends a mistress,

207
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
shouldn't they be punished?

208
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,910
Don't twist the argument with me here.

209
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,200
Today, we are discussing

210
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,440
your personal maid,

211
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,790
wearing my clothes, huh?

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,910
Now the clothes are already on her.

213
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,270
What is there left to deny?

214
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
I believe in Yingying.

215
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,120
Her origins are humble,

216
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,510
but she cherishes her dignity.

217
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,960
Clothes worn by others,

218
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,850
even if they're made of silk,

219
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,960
or golden threads,

220
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,720
she would never care for them.

221
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm going to be a grandmother.

222
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,560
And you'll be a great-grandmother.

223
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,150
These second-hand clothes
might have an odor,

224
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,840
or even carry contagious diseases
from the owner.

225
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,270
She'd end up suffering for it.

226
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,390
Aunt, don't you think that's reasonable?

227
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,230
Bah!

228
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,240
Su Qianqian,

229
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,090
since my sister-in-law isn't here today,

230
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,360
I'll take her place for now.

231
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,480
Let me teach you how to behave.

232
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Aunt, are you resorting to violence?

233
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,320
- My lady!
- I'll hit you if I must!

234
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,200
Stop it, Yang Cuihua.

235
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,270
How dare you strike a pregnant woman?

236
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,590
Qianqian.

237
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Are you alright?

238
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,360
- Quickly, help her up!
- Yes!

239
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,120
- Yang Cuihua, wait there.
- My lady!

240
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,630
- My lady.
- I didn't use that much force.

241
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,670
Qianqian, are you okay?

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,680
It hurts so much.

243
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,110
There's blood.

244
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,510
My lady!

245
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,470
My lady!

246
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,080
You're bleeding.

247
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,680
This...

248
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,390
The child...

249
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Save my child.

250
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,270
Please, save my child.

251
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,230
Quickly!

252
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,790
Go fetch Nanny Zhang!

253
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,360
Mother-in-law.

254
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,080
Madam Chu.

255
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
I've failed in my duties.

256
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,150
I failed to protect the child.

257
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,120
Aunt, how cruel you are!

258
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,110
You wanted to take my child's life!
