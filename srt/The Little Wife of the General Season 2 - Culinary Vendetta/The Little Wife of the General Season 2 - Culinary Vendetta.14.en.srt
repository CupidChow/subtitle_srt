2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,710
You just can't abandon a life of opulence.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,710
Oh honey, my dear.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
Please listen to me.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,030
If I have to go to the frontier,

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,710
it'll be harder for me
to climb any higher.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Besides,

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,750
I can't bear to leave you here alone.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,710
Honey, I must take you with me.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
You and I are husband and wife.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,710
We share honor and glory together,

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,750
and bear losses as one.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,200
Naturally, we cannot be separated.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,560
Tell me,

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,600
isn't that right?

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,310
If we want to persuade General Lei,

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,590
we must have First Madam step in.

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,070
Ask your mother to beg First Madam.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,000
It would be even more difficult.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Mother has already fallen out with her.

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,510
How could it work?

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,000
For the sake of her son's future,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,510
your mother is willing
to sacrifice her dignity.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,780
Yeah.

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,990
You're right.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
What?

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,590
You expect me to beg her?

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,070
No way. Absolutely impossible.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
Besides,

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,020
even if I beg her, she won't agree.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,400
Fine.

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,070
Then just stand by,

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,790
and watch your only son
walk to his death.

35
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,400
If something happens to me,

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,120
there won't even be anyone left to bury you.

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,550
You...

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,630
No, Tianze.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
I still have some belongings left.

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,240
Let's go find General Lei.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Should we bring him gifts?

42
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,680
That wicked man

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,960
doesn't even respect Ning'an Marquis.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,190
Would he even accept our gifts?

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Then...

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
What should we do?

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,840
Mother...

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,860
Tianze.

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,560
Our only option now

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,750
is to plead with my aunt.

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Mother.

52
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,000
Sometimes, one must learn to
bend and endure.

53
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,980
No.

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,400
I just had a fallout with her a few days ago.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,030
Now you want me to beg her?

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,680
I can't bring myself to do it.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Fine.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
Fine.

59
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,960
What are you doing?

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Stay away!

61
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,910
Early or late, death is still death.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,310
If I die now,

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,240
Mother, at least you can bury me whole.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
No, no, no!

65
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,870
I'll go and beg her.

66
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,030
I'll go and beg her.

67
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,280
You... you put it down.

68
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Alright.

69
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll swallow my pride and beg her.

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,750
I'll swallow my pride and beg her.

71
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,430
Shaoqing, Shaoqing!

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Madam.

73
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,030
Quick, fetch the physician.

74
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes.

75
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,020
(Light Tavern)

76
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,870
Please come inside.

77
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
After you.

78
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,430
Master.

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,630
Master.

80
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,750
So many nobles have arrived.

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
You all go take care of things.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,310
Leave the rest to me.

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
- Got it.
- Got it.

84
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,550
Let's go.

85
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,680
General Chu, it's just
a newly opened restaurant.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,480
Why are you so impressed by it?

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
The dishes here

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,480
don't seem any different from other inns.

89
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,120
Exactly, exactly.

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,950
We have a very picky palate here.

91
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,910
That's perfect.

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,680
Today, I'll fix that.

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Give it a try.

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,080
- Alright.
- Okay.

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,750
Nothing special about it.

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,310
But the flavor is incredible.

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,270
What do you think, Lord Jia?

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
Does it suit your palate?

99
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,600
Do I even need to say it?

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,310
Look at them,
eating like they've been starving.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
My father-in-law's birthday is coming.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,480
I've decided to hold the celebration here.

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,500
Please come by then.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,750
Of course, of course.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,070
Come on, everyone.

106
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,510
- Thank you, General.
- Thanks.

107
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,170
Ah, what a day it is today.

108
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,000
It's truly beautiful.

109
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,800
Sister-in-law,

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,160
enjoying the sunshine here, I see.

111
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,870
Chuntao, Chuntao.

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,950
Enjoying the sun, are you?

113
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,750
Chuntao still holds a grudge against me.

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
A few days ago,

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,920
it truly was my fault.

116
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,380
It's all because of Shaoqing.

117
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,350
She was gossiping behind my back.

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,830
She tricked me.

119
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,680
You know I'm quick-tempered.

120
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,750
Sister-in-law, you know that, right?

121
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
I've apologized to you, all right?

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,240
You're being too serious.

123
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,590
(Ungrateful maid!)

124
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,480
(I already apologized to you,)

125
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,430
(yet you still act high and mighty.)

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,510
(Just wait and see how I'll deal with you.)

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,240
An apology should at least look sincere.

128
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Yes, yes, sister-in-law, you're right.

129
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
Chuntao,

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,800
the other day, I slapped you a few times.

131
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,030
How about...

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,390
You take it back to me.

133
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,630
I dare not.

134
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
But if you sincerely apologize,

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,750
there might be another way.

136
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,230
Chuntao,

137
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,480
what nonsense are you saying?

138
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,610
Are you suggesting that Second Madam

139
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,120
slaps herself twice publicly?

140
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,870
That'd be humiliating if word spread.

141
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,890
It's not shameful, not at all.

142
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
After all, I made a mistake,

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,840
so I must accept punishment.

144
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,240
Are you satisfied now?

145
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,480
As long as you're satisfied.

146
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,080
Alright, enough.

147
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,150
After all, you are the second mistress.

148
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,670
What kind of behavior is this?

149
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,510
Sister-in-law,

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,240
I was wrong.

151
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
Please forgive me.

152
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,670
For the sake of our decades
of sisterhood-in-law.

153
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,120
Help me, will you?

154
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,210
Me?

155
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,260
What can I possibly do to help you?

156
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,600
You can, you absolutely can.

157
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,670
It's about General Lei.

158
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,080
He insists on sending Tianze
to the frontline.

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,200
No matter what I say, he doesn't listen.

160
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,360
You are the head of the General Mansion.

161
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,910
If you talk to him, he'll listen.

162
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,320
Oh.

163
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,320
Really?

164
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
If Mother hadn't entrusted
the Chu Family to me,

165
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,670
I...

166
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,120
How could I be worthy of
leading the family?

167
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,860
Why couldn't you?

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
It was my careless words back then.

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,600
Oh, sister-in-law,

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,910
please don't hold it against me.

171
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,200
Of course, you are capable of

172
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,870
leading the Chu Family.

173
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,480
Tianze is going to the frontier
for training.

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,790
That's what he's supposed to do.

175
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,750
What's wrong with that?

176
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,310
Sister-in-law,

177
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,870
he's never endured much hardship since young.

178
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,320
If he goes to the frontline,

179
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,260
and something happens to him,

180
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,320
how am I supposed to live?

181
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Do you still remember how you forced Junyao

182
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
to go to the battlefield?

183
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,670
Have you forgotten?

184
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
Of course,

185
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,550
it was the path he chose for himself.

186
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,150
But...

187
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
you were the one who pushed him.

188
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,360
I only had the Chu Family in mind.

189
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,520
I didn't think it through.

190
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,240
But now...

191
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,630
Now that it's my turn,

192
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,750
I finally understand
how hard it was for you.

193
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,840
Now that we're both mothers,

194
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,120
I can deeply empathize
with your feelings.

195
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,840
But after all, we're still family.

196
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,270
Oh, now you realize we're family?

197
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,150
We are.

198
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,150
Back when you targeted Junyao,

199
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,120
why didn't you think about us
being family?

200
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,670
I didn't do anything to Junyao.

201
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,960
I swear.

202
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,360
If I ever harm him,

203
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,510
I'll face a terrible fate.

204
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,320
May heaven strike me down.

205
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,320
Let me tell you this.

206
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,440
From this day forward,

207
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,750
if there is any infighting
in this household,

208
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,260
I will show no mercy.

209
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,510
It won't happen.

210
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,200
It won't, sister-in-law.

211
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,390
Please...

212
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,480
believe in me.

213
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,390
Then,

214
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,750
about Tianze's matter...

215
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,150
Sister-in-law,

216
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,080
could you...

217
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,270
I'll arrange a meeting
with General Lei for you.

218
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,670
But whether it works out or not,

219
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,550
it is beyond my control.

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
Master, do you have a minute?

221
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,910
Oh, here's today's account book.

222
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,010
Please take a look.

223
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,480
No need to be so meticulous.

224
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,030
Just show it to me once a month.

225
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,390
Got it.

226
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,390
By the way, Master.

227
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,080
Here's some recent confidential news.

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,840
Yingying.

229
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,390
I'm here.

230
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,630
Put it away.

231
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I'll go hide it.

232
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,390
Master,

233
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,630
well...

234
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,080
I'll go to Xiaojuan's
for a proposal tomorrow.

235
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
Will you be free to join me?

236
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,080
Didn't we already agree on this?

237
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,600
I'll go with you tomorrow.

238
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,080
It's settled then.

239
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,000
Thank you, Master.

240
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,240
Yingying, where's the bowl?

241
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,980
(General Mansion)

242
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,390
General Lei,

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,320
I invited you here today,

244
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,480
because I have an important request.

245
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Xiaojuan.

246
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,320
Juan.

247
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,630
Xiaojuan.

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Xiaojuan.

249
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
What's going on?

250
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,080
Didn't you explain it clearly to Xiaojuan?

251
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
I told her beforehand.

252
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,840
Then why is no one answering the door?

253
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,360
Xiaojuan!

254
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,440
Xiaojuan, Xiaojuan!

255
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,360
What are you doing?

256
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,670
Sir, it's me, Du Ziteng.

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm here to propose.

258
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,440
A powerless and penniless man like you?

259
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,790
Better give up on that idea.

260
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,720
I will never let Xiaojuan marry you.

261
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,270
Watch your mouth.

262
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,270
Ziteng is the owner of the Light Tavern.

263
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,280
Him?

264
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,600
If he's truly the owner,

265
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,320
then I must be his boss's father-in-law!

266
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,750
Sir.

267
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,000
Who does he think he is?

268
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,550
Master, what should we do?

269
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,590
Ziteng.

270
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,910
I just saw a carriage at the entrance.

271
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,020
It seems you've met your match.

272
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,350
I...

273
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,790
Oh dear, my goodness!

274
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,510
This matter is really difficult to handle.

275
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
Let me tell you something.

276
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
The bond between me and the Chu Family

277
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,480
means I will definitely do this favor.

278
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Exactly.

279
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,670
However,

280
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,870
I just turned down Ning'an Marquis.

281
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,510
If we rashly sell this favor to you,

282
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,890
the Chu Family

283
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,870
is bound to offend the marquis.

284
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,670
Ah, there's no way to explain this to him.

285
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,240
(You've already offended him, you brute.)

286
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,390
(Why fear offending him again?)

287
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,440
Indeed,

288
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,630
we're now related
to the marquis by marriage.

289
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,370
This matter

290
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,160
is truly difficult to handle.

291
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,440
Who wouldn't agree with that?

292
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,400
This won't be easy.

293
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,070
Even if it's hard, it must be done.

294
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,960
General Lei, please show some leniency.

295
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,800
Help us find a way out of this.

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,920
Well, this...

297
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,490
Showing leniency...

298
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,160
It isn't entirely impossible.

299
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,440
As long as you help me with something.

300
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,270
I'll risk my face to help you.

301
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,510
What is it?

302
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,680
Please speak, General Lei.

303
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,790
Ah, about the frontier...

304
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,110
It is a bitterly cold region.

305
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,700
Resources are severely lacking.

306
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,070
The soldiers there...

307
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,240
are short on clothing and food.

308
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,000
Life is unbearably difficult for them.

309
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,480
If you could show some compassion

310
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,400
and provide a bit of support,

311
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
everything would be easier to handle.
