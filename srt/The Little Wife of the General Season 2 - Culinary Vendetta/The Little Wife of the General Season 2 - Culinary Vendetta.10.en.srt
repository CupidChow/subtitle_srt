00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,440
I already have someone in mind.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,120
Who is it?

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,000
Those who once challenged me.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
What's your name?

7
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,990
Stop!

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,000
Who told you to tie her up?

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,840
Boss, I am sorry.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,000
Get out of my sight.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,920
Sorry, Miss.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,070
I just wanted to
challenge your cooking skills.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,670
Let's see who is better.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,350
These are all my signature dishes.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,950
The pork wasn't blanched.

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,960
The caramel is overcooked.

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,070
It's a failure.

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,020
The fish is too dry. Another failure.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,520
- Vinegar Ribs...
- Wait a moment.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,200
That's Sweet and Sour Ribs.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
Failure.

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,230
Bitter Melon with Eggs, failure.

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,070
Spicy Chicken.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,090
The ultimate failure.

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,210
You're talking nonsense!

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,760
Our boss is the best chef in Heixi Town.

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,800
That's an insult to cooking,

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,920
a waste of ingredients.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Hold on.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,680
You little girl.

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,710
Did I offend you?

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,120
Cooking is my specialty.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,230
I'm known as the best in town.

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,590
Why are you insulting me?

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Stewing, braising, frying,
roasting, steaming...

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,270
Which one are you skilled at?

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
What did she say?

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
I didn't understand.

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,230
Today, I'll show you something amazing.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Just a minor trick.

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,710
It doesn't look that special.

42
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,870
You two try it first.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,240
This Dongpo Pork...

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
is truly delicious!

45
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,590
Rich but not greasy, full of flavor.

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,400
Even better than my mom's cooking.

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,360
Oh my.

48
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,870
This is Spicy Chicken.

49
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,960
What I had before was just trash.

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,840
Alright, no need to exaggerate.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,470
If it's not as good
as you said,

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,960
you're done.

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
How about it?

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,710
It's just so-so.

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Average level.

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,400
Boss.

57
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,650
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
Boss.

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,190
Are you okay?

60
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,270
Master.

61
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,240
Please accept my humble bow, Master.

62
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,000
It's time to meet my team.

63
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,600
How many times
have we made this Dongpo Pork?

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Yet it still falls far short of Master's.

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
I must find a chance
to ask her for guidance.

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,670
Indeed.

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,830
But Master just got married.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,630
They're enjoying their time together.

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,630
She probably doesn't have time for us.

70
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,470
Ziteng.

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,330
Master.

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,390
- Master.
- Master.

73
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,560
I was just looking for you.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,840
You.

75
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,480
What do you think of this Dongpo Pork?

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,400
What is it missing?

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Color, aroma, and taste.

78
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,500
It lacks heat control.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
It's fine.

80
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,830
I'll make an hourglass later.

81
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,560
So you can precisely manage your time.

82
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,070
Thank you, Master.

83
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,310
Today, I came here

84
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,800
to share something with all of you.

85
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,670
I plan to open
the finest restaurant in the capital.

86
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,870
But it's inconvenient for me
to take the lead.

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
Ziteng, you will be the owner.

88
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,340
(General Mansion)

89
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,230
General,

90
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,920
I've found Constable Zhang's whereabouts.

91
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,710
Where is he?

92
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,920
Mount Ban in North City.

93
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,310
Our people are monitoring it secretly.

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,420
But it isn't suitable to take action.

95
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,470
Please make the decisions.

96
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,270
Qianqian, about choosing
the restaurant site...

97
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,830
Wait for me to return.

98
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
I want to personally
arrest Constable Zhang.

99
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
Leave the restaurant to me.

100
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,270
Junyao, be cautious.

101
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,030
What's wrong?

102
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,800
Before the battle,
the troops are always rewarded.

103
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,150
Zi Xuan.

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,760
Let's go.

105
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,260
(General Mansion)

106
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,600
Yingying, get on the carriage.

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
Carriage?

108
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,120
My lady, I really can't
get on the carriage.

109
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,510
If I say get on, then you'll get on.

110
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,680
Should we lower the price a bit more?

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,190
Bitten to death in one go.

112
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,310
The deal may not go through.

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Yes, that's true.

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
It's rare for us to get a buyer.

115
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,870
Naturally, we should make a big profit.

116
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,870
Don't you all agree?

117
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,240
Let's earn the money.

118
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,110
Yes, yes.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,600
Manger, they're here.

120
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Master.

121
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,120
The shopkeepers are all waiting inside.

122
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Lanterns for sale!

123
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,830
How much does it cost?

124
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,270
The price is 100 taels of gold, no less.

125
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,390
And two buyers are competing for it.

126
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's go take a look first.

127
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,790
Alright.

128
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,600
As for my shop here,

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,950
it's in a prime location
with great business.

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,750
You know that, right?

131
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
Indeed.

132
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,040
If I weren't in urgent need of money,

133
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,920
I wouldn't even think of selling this.

134
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,830
One hundred taels of gold,

135
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,120
that's my bottom line.

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
Mr. Li,

137
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,360
this is the person I mentioned to you,

138
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,200
my boss.

139
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,510
Her surname is... Wang.

140
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,980
Ms. Wang, a pleasure to meet you.

141
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,870
Since all three of you are here,

142
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,600
I'll speak frankly then.

143
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,720
Less than 100 taels of gold,
no deal to negotiate.

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Alright.

145
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,080
100 taels it is.

146
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
I'll take it.

147
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,790
But 100 taels of gold isn't a small amount.

148
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,370
Can I have two days to gather it?

149
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,630
Sell it to me instead.

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
By tomorrow, I'll deliver the money.

151
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,240
This...

152
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,750
Ms. Wang, what do you think?

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,360
100 taels of gold are indeed possible.

154
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,320
But I don't think
it is worth that price.

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,150
Then... how much
are you willing to offer?

156
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,350
Forty taels.

157
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Forty taels?

158
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,270
Are you joking?

159
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,750
Aren't you just bargaining drastically?

160
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,480
Isn't business about
asking for an exorbitant price

161
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,390
and bargaining.

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,120
Since they're willing to
offer 100 taels of gold,

163
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,270
it seems this restaurant
is not meant for me.

164
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,670
Farewell, then.

165
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,000
My lady, you bargained too hard just now.

166
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,670
It was only slightly lower
than the normal price.

167
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,390
They were asking for too much.

168
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,200
But there's no need for us to leave.

169
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,960
Negotiating business takes time, doesn't it?

170
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,270
I think this place is quite nice.

171
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,080
The hustle and bustle is quite lively.

172
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,150
Business deals don't succeed in one go.

173
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,910
Their price is way too high.

174
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,390
There are others competing.

175
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,030
It's clearly suspicious.

176
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,000
Or maybe it's just a coincidence.

177
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,440
I seemed quiet earlier.

178
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,030
But I was closely observing.

179
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,120
Those two other buyers

180
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,360
are exchanging subtle glances.

181
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,000
They don't seem like competitors.

182
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,510
Perhaps they planned it together.

183
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,990
Is that so?

184
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,760
Master, I've inquired
about this restaurant.

185
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,610
Nor for sale.

186
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,520
It doesn't matter.

187
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,870
You two head back.
I'll stay with Master.

188
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
Okay.

189
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,910
Welcome, this way, please.

190
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,550
Sir, call your owner here for a talk.

191
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,710
Owner.

192
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,000
Is the owner here?

193
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,870
The owner is not here.

194
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,390
Please wait a moment.

195
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,910
I'll go fetch the manager.

196
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,500
Manager, this lady is looking for you.

197
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,790
May I ask why you're looking for me?

198
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,120
Manager, I want to buy the restaurant
across from you.

199
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,630
I'd like to ask for your help.

200
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,320
If you buy that restaurant,

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,670
we'll become competitors.

202
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,460
Do you think I'd help you with this?

203
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,750
No matter who owns
the opposite restaurant,

204
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,440
it's all the same for you.

205
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,320
But if you help me put on a show,

206
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,800
I'll give you one tael of gold.

207
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,360
I want two taels.

208
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,390
That depends on how well you act.

209
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,060
How is it going?

210
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,580
I asked around a bit.

211
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,020
Two people tended to
offer 100 taels of gold.

212
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,860
But they need a few days
to gather the funds.

213
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,060
Meanwhile, the Young Madam

214
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,700
wanted to buy that restaurant for 40 taels.

215
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,620
So, the negotiation fell apart.

216
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,740
She has now gone to another restaurant.

217
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,300
Forty taels...

218
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,500
That indeed seems a bit too low.

219
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,460
Well, it's fine.
Let her face some setbacks.

220
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,140
Once she fails, I will step in.

221
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,740
When you take charge, no one can resist.

222
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,700
How much do you think it will take?

223
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,340
50 taels is the market price.

224
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,820
If I step in, 45 taels will seal the deal.

225
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,820
First Madam, you're truly remarkable.

226
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,900
Go.

227
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,780
Keep a close eye on it. Hurry.

228
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,820
Understood.

229
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,420
(Sifang Winery)

230
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,060
Ms. Wang,
no need to rush off just yet.

231
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,220
It is negotiable.

232
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,140
Let's head inside
for a proper discussion.

233
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's have a detailed talk. Please.

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,980
Let's discuss this.

235
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,040
Manager.

236
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,180
Is it also up for sale?

237
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,580
I haven't heard any news about this.

238
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,980
Their business isn't doing well either.

239
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,060
Yes, it's been months
and they still haven't sold it.

240
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,180
If it doesn't work this time,

241
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,340
the next buyer...

242
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,820
It's hard to say when it will be sold.

243
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,430
We can really discuss this further.

244
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,580
Ms. Wang, Ms. Wang.

245
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,220
Let's talk privately for a moment.

246
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,700
Is that okay?

247
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,380
Mr. Li, just say whatever it is here.

248
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,820
Well...

249
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,120
How about you add a little more?

250
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,380
I can't.

251
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
Mr. Zhang's restaurant
is similar to yours.

252
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,340
I also offered 40 taels.

253
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,260
And he's in a hurry to sell.

254
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
So I thought I'd wait a bit longer.

255
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,980
(Zhang really has a pig brain.)

256
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,940
(How can anyone be so hasty in business?)

257
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,900
40 taels is indeed a bit too low.

258
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,900
Why don't you add a little more?

259
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,340
Mr. Li,

260
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,740
why not wait for the two buyers
to gather funds?

261
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,220
You can still sell it later.

262
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,180
Today, in front of you two,

263
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,260
I might as well speak plainly.

264
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,980
I'll only offer 40 taels.

265
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,460
Deal.

266
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,620
40 taels it is. I'll sell it.

267
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,300
You should respect the order of things.

268
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,140
She took an interest
in my restaurant first.

269
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,580
Ms. Wang, I'll sell it for 40 taels.

270
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Li!

271
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,020
I've disliked you for a long time.

272
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,700
If it weren't for you

273
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,780
stealing my business,

274
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,720
I wouldn't have sold it.

275
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,660
Ms. Wang, don't listen to him.

276
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,400
I'll offer 39 taels.

277
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,260
You're trying to go against me, huh?

278
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,800
Fine, fine, 39 taels, huh?

279
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,410
I'll sell it for 38 taels and 9 coins.

280
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,900
Mr. Li, your strategy is airtight.

281
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,190
Look at you being so stingy.

282
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,340
38 taels.

283
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,490
Dare to match me?

284
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,700
If you do, I'll make you lose.

285
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,690
You!

286
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,080
He actually looks down on you.

287
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,580
Don't know your character.

288
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,920
If it were me, I couldn't take it.

289
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,220
He's selling it at 38 taels.

290
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,340
Why can't we?

291
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,620
Who does he think he is?

292
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,900
Who does he think he is?

293
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,460
Keep going, 37 taels and 9 coins.

294
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,140
Are you seriously challenging me now?

295
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,940
I, I, I...

296
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,380
I'll go 36 taels.

297
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,420
36 taels will ruin you.

298
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,260
I'm happy to do it.
I've got the money.

299
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,260
It's all about pride for me.

300
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,300
(Is this guy seriously backing out?)

301
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,780
(Then won't I lose the rest of my gold?)

302
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,480
(How could that be acceptable?)

303
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,860
(If I didn't know this old man,)

304
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,940
(I'd have thought he was her plant.)

305
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,740
(If I lose momentum today,)

306
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,340
(I'll lose face completely.)

307
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,780
(What should I do?)

308
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,860
Old man,

309
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,010
are you going to follow?

310
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,180
You've always had
the upper hand over me.

311
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,620
Today, I must outdo you no matter what.

312
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,720
Don't ever think about
holding your head high.

313
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,140
Ms. Wang, since Mr. Li has withdrawn,

314
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,340
let's settle on 36 taels.

315
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,820
Settled on the spot.

316
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,500
Alright.

317
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,580
36 taels it is.

318
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,980
This is already a tremendous concession.

319
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,580
I am not someone who demands more.

320
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,180
Let's finalize the land deed exchange here.

321
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,540
- Got it.
- Hold on.

322
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,540
35 taels.

323
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,660
I'm risking it all today!

324
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,020
35 taels.

325
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,420
Do you still dare to match it?

326
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
Don't rush me, let me think.

327
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,780
Think all you want.

328
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,140
Ms. Wang, let's make the deal now.

329
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,180
Mr. Li, why not wait a bit longer?

330
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,980
Let Mr. Zhang think it through.

331
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,820
No need.

332
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,300
The land deed is right here.

333
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,300
Leave him there.

334
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,820
We'll proceed with our transaction.

335
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,940
Alright, Yingying, hand over the money.

336
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,020
Alright.

337
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,820
Hand it over slowly.

338
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,560
What if Mr. Zhang lowers the price again?

339
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,220
Ms. Wang, that's impressive.

340
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,540
Alright, money for the deed.

341
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,740
Once I get the money,
this restaurant will be yours.

342
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,100
You!

343
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,980
You are ruthless.

344
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,020
So what?

345
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,060
Young Madam secured it for 35 taels.

346
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,660
What?

347
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,020
Just 35 taels of gold to secure it?

348
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,060
Yes, Young Madam is truly remarkable.

349
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,220
Of course,

350
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,940
compared to you,
she still has a ways to go.

351
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,750
Today, I'll cook a great meal for you.

352
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,420
Let's take our restaurant to new heights.

353
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,300
Great! We're in for a treat.

354
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,660
I'll lend a hand, Master.

355
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,780
- Alright.
- We'll help too.

356
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,100
My lady, what should I do?

357
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,820
Wash the vegetables.

358
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,740
Got it.

359
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,380
My lady, your hand...

360
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,780
What is it, Master?

361
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,740
Master.

362
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,700
Master, are you alright?

363
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,860
I'm fine.

364
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,220
My lady, you've never
cut your hand before.

365
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,940
Master, what's wrong with you?

366
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,460
You seem distracted.

367
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,460
It's nothing.

368
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,220
How about this?

369
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,340
Master, why don't you rest for today?

370
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,940
As your apprentice, I'll prepare

371
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,820
a proper meal for you.

372
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's see if my cooking has improved.

373
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,460
Alright.

374
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,420
Get to work then.

375
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,420
Alright.
