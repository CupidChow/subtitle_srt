00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,920
Your wife thinks too highly of herself.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,440
She never greets me properly each day.

5
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,350
I don't care about her noble background.

6
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,110
In the Chu Family, she only has one role.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,240
She's my daughter-in-law.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,030
Can you manage her properly?

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,070
Why should I manage her?

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,570
If I want to climb higher,

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,710
I still need to rely on
her father's influence.

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,230
Mother.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,240
You shouldn't bother with her.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,710
Just pretend she's not your daughter-in-law.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,200
If you're truly feeling
lonely and bored,

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,920
I'll ask Father

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,470
to take a few more concubines.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
They can play cards with you.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,890
Then you won't feel so bored anymore.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,120
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,230
To put it bluntly,
you're not strong enough.

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,120
Look at Chu Junyao next door.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,920
He's brave and skilled in battle.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
He's earned military merits.

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,790
Other than His Majesty,

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,840
he doesn't take anyone seriously.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,920
Who does Chu Junyao think he is?

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,640
Starting today,

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,560
there will be no place for him
in this world.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,480
What do you mean by that?

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,350
Impressive, truly impressive.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,150
That Qin woman lost her husband,

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,200
and if she loses her son...

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,150
Let's see how arrogant she can still be.

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,380
(General Mansion)

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,280
Has the general returned?

37
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,960
Madam, he has not returned yet.

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,870
Qianqian.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
- What?
- Mother-in-law.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,630
This morning, Junyao went to North City
to arrest someone.

41
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,030
He still hasn't returned yet.

42
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,520
Don't worry about it.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
His martial arts are unparalleled.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,080
Even an army couldn't stand against him.

45
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,710
Besides, he's just gone to
capture someone.

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
From here to North City,

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,000
the journey is very far both ways.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
It's bound to take some time.

49
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,000
I know that.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,120
But I can't help

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,000
feeling uneasy.

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,270
Chuntao.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,160
Yes.

54
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,630
Send someone to North City

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,240
to Mount Ban to find the general.

56
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,400
Alright.

57
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,190
Put your mind at ease.

58
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,920
As for Junyao, he is blessed.

59
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,800
You must believe he'll be fine.

60
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,360
Come on, have some tea.

61
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,030
Oh, sister-in-law,
I'm just looking for you.

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,240
Su Qianqian, you look so pale.

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,440
It's as if you've lost your husband.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,240
Yang Cuihua!

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,870
Watch your mouth!

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,310
As an elder,

67
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,680
speak with more restraint.

68
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,590
Sister-in-law,

69
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,240
I was just worried out of concern.

70
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,280
You know how I am.

71
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,910
Don't take it to heart.

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,470
Where is Junyao?

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,270
I've missed him these past few days.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,190
Junyao? He's doing quite well.

75
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,830
No need for your concern.

76
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,780
Sister-in-law,

77
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,340
you don't need to be so formal.

78
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,980
After all, he's my own nephew.

79
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,540
Now he's even become a general.

80
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,980
Tomorrow,

81
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,980
I'll go to the temple to get a Peace Amulet.

82
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,780
May it keep him safe and sound.

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,580
As a general,

84
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,340
it's inevitable for him to face fights.

85
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,700
If anything happens to him, at least

86
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,620
there will be something to hold onto, right?

87
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,460
You!

88
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,140
Aunt,

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,500
have some tea.

90
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,820
Aunt.

91
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

92
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,900
I didn't notice the step here.

93
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
Truly, I'm so sorry.

94
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,900
How careless can you be, Shaoqing?

95
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,420
Help Aunt rinse with cold water.

96
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,060
It might leave a scar.

97
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,980
Sister-in-law,

98
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,980
go ahead and laugh to your heart's content.

99
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,100
Your turn to cry will come soon enough.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,740
I can't stop laughing!

101
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,300
Qianqian, you are amazing.

102
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,340
Here you go.

103
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,740
Well done!

104
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,860
(General Mansion)

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,860
My lady, it's freezing outside.

106
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,020
You should go inside first.

107
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,020
As soon as he returns, I'll inform you.

108
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,140
(Junyao, you must return safely.)

109
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,980
(You are my only support in this world.)

110
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,860
(Heavens, please bless us.)

111
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,820
(I hope both the general
and Zi Xuan return safely.)

112
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,140
(General Mansion)

113
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,780
Sister-in-law,

114
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,780
it's such a cold day.

115
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,700
Why are you standing out here alone?

116
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,060
You must be waiting for Junyao, right?

117
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,140
Seeing how deeply you two
care for each other

118
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,860
truly makes me envy you.

119
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,940
What's there to envy?

120
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,180
We are the ones destined to be together.

121
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,260
She

122
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,260
is just all alone.

123
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,340
Honey, she must be worried about Junyao.

124
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,020
You shouldn't make things
harder for her.

125
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,020
On the way back just now,

126
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,140
I saw so many homeless people
freezing to death,

127
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,060
with no one
to even collect their remains.

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,860
It was truly heartbreaking to see.

129
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,460
What if one of them was Junyao?

130
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,940
How much that would pain me!

131
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,900
Don't worry, honey.

132
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,140
If something

133
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,580
truly happens to him,

134
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,540
I will ensure his funeral
is grand and dignified.

135
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,940
Junyao will definitely be fine.

136
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,700
No need to make such cold remarks.

137
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,370
That would certainly be for the best.

138
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
Sister-in-law,

139
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,660
don't let this endless snowstorm

140
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
chill your heart.

141
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,140
The general is back.

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,340
(General Mansion)

143
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,060
I knew you would return.

144
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,360
With you here,

145
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,700
no matter how far away,

146
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,460
I will always come back to you.

147
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,580
I was so afraid of losing you.

148
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,060
Silly girl,

149
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,900
you will never lose me.

150
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,420
Zi Xuan.

151
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
He's unharmed.

152
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,780
Everything was planned so well,

153
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,660
but he still managed to escape.

154
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,340
Young Master,
Chu Junyao is unstoppable.

155
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,700
He killed many of our men.

156
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,200
He even took Constable Zhang away.

157
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,140
We truly couldn't defeat him.

158
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,180
Useless fools.

159
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,540
I told you we should've killed Zhang.

160
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,660
At the very least,

161
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,900
you shouldn't have used him
to lure Chu Junyao.

162
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,140
If we use a fake one,

163
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,740
how could it possibly fool Chu Junyao?

164
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,020
Now you understand

165
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,540
what it means to lose on both ends, right?

166
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,940
We have lost,

167
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,260
but they haven't won either.

168
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,940
What?

169
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,180
What do you mean?

170
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,540
You truly plan to burn bridges.

171
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,540
You're quite clever,

172
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,980
but also very foolish.

173
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,300
You rely on sheer luck.

174
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,620
As long as you stay in the capital,

175
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,380
how could you escape my notice?

176
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,180
Since I've fallen into your hands,

177
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,740
then I implore you,

178
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,940
for the sake of my service to you,

179
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,980
to grant me a swift end.

180
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
I was considering giving you a swift end.

181
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,060
But you still have some use left.

182
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,260
Does that mean

183
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,860
I won't have to die?

184
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,060
Guards!

185
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,100
Take out his eyes.

186
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,540
Pierce his ears.

187
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,140
Cut out his tongue.

188
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,780
Break all ten fingers.

189
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,900
Yes.

190
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,900
Vicious woman! Vicious woman!

191
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,460
You will face a grim fate.

192
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,500
Vile woman.

193
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,980
So, in that case,

194
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,300
what they took was merely
a useless person.

195
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,980
Naturally, that is the case.

196
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,180
Honey, your foresight
is truly remarkable.

197
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,980
However,

198
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,100
it will be much harder
to kill Chu Junyao.

199
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,580
Then let's wait and see how things unfold.

200
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,020
It hurts, doesn't it?

201
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,780
It doesn't.

202
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,220
But my heart aches for you.

203
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,060
Then,

204
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,060
how much does it ache?

205
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,100
It aches deeply.

206
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,300
This person is truly ruthless.

207
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,620
Zhang had his eyes gouged out
and his tongue cut.

208
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,420
Even his hands and feet were crippled.

209
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,140
Not only cruel and merciless,

210
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,340
but also meticulous.

211
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,320
Bringing him back is pointless.

212
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,420
It's clearly a trap to kill the general.

213
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,940
It seems this path won't work.

214
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,220
Though we are surrounded by darkness,

215
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,300
we are the sparks of hope.

216
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,500
What we must do is to grow stronger,

217
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,100
to become our own sun.

218
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,380
Then the darkness
will be pierced entirely.

219
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,420
And light will shine upon the world.

220
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,020
Trivial efforts are not worth it.

221
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
Putting lives at risk.

222
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,420
Threatening the foundation
of the Chu Family.

223
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,100
This cannot be tolerated.

224
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,540
Let's go.

225
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,980
Follow me to the Chu Ancestral Shrine.

226
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,100
Yes.
