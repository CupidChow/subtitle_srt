00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,060
=Culinary Vendetta=

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,920
Although we are married,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,030
but during mourning,
intimacy is forbidden.

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,800
However, this is a special case,

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,190
so we will

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,560
share a room, but not a bed.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,240
Honey,

9
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,070
you'll have to endure this for now.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,350
It truly feels unfair.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,880
If you feel lonely,

12
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,310
just...

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,350
cuddle with Changsheng.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Changsheng.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,960
Changsheng.

16
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,510
Qianqian.

17
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,490
Go, go, go.

18
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,230
No barking. Quiet.

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Go somewhere else.

20
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,560
You like it, don't you?

21
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,840
You're always welcome
to play with me and Changsheng.

22
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,030
Changsheng.

23
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,150
Yes, that's the elegant name I gave it.

24
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,630
Did you think it was a general?

25
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,910
(Did you know?)

26
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,800
(I liked you from the moment I saw you.)

27
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,020
(Gentle Breeze)

28
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,160
Madam Chu, please have some tea.

29
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,680
I wish you health, prosperity,

30
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,120
longevity, and happiness.

31
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,630
Alright, alright.

32
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
Thank you, Madam Chu.

33
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
From this day forward,

34
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,720
you are the Chu Family's
granddaughter-in-law.

35
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
Set a good example.

36
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,390
Always prioritize the honor
of the Chu Family.

37
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,110
I will strictly follow your teachings,

38
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,390
assist mother and auntie
in managing the household,

39
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,390
and safeguard the honor of the Chu Family.

40
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
Mingzhu,

41
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
you're absolutely right.

42
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,720
We must always remember
the words of Madam Chu.

43
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,630
Don't be like some people

44
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,480
who lack respect for hierarchy,

45
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,800
and fail to understand priorities.

46
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,390
Am I right?

47
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,920
Yes, indeed.

48
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,420
My lady.

49
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,230
Madam Chu,

50
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,630
this is the nourishing soup
I made for you.

51
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,750
I wish you good health

52
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,750
and happiness.

53
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Behave yourself.

54
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,830
I want to live longer.

55
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,670
Yes.

56
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,830
Thank you, Madam Chu.

57
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,270
Madam Chu, I heard
my sister-in-law is expecting.

58
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,190
I know a physician,

59
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,510
who can prepare fetal-stabilizing meds
based on the pulse.

60
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,750
Oh.

61
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,740
That's very thoughtful of you.

62
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,250
The physician has prescribed medicine.

63
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,930
There's no need to trouble you further.

64
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,600
Why be so distant, dear sister-in-law?

65
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,090
This physician I found
is truly extraordinary.

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,770
He can determine gender
with just a pulse.

67
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,680
What a miraculous skill!

68
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,160
Quickly, call the physician over.

69
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,390
Have him check Qianqian's pulse.

70
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,390
Mother, I don't think it's necessary.

71
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
It is, of course.

72
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,720
Sister-in-law, this is great news.

73
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,790
Mother, you must understand

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,650
the child in her womb,

75
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,040
regardless of the gender,

76
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,190
is still a descendant
of the Chu Family, right?

77
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,600
Besides, what if the prediction is wrong?

78
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,950
Wouldn't that be unfair

79
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,920
to the child in her womb?

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,680
No harm in checking, it's fine.

81
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,000
Whether it's a boy or a girl,

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,390
we will never mistreat it.

83
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,800
Madam Chu is right.

84
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,240
Physician Wang has arrived.

85
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
(So quickly.)

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,720
(It seems they're targeting me.)

87
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,510
Greetings, Madam Chu.

88
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,430
Greetings, masters, and madams.

89
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,040
Physician Wang,
we'll leave it to you then.

90
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,950
I'm flattered.

91
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,830
Please ensure

92
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,550
Junyao's wife's child

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,510
is kept safe and secure.

94
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,120
If the pulse is stable,

95
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,320
my sister-in-law surely owes a red packet.

96
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,480
Don't you think so?

97
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,440
I will do my best to examine the pulse.

98
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
Physician Wang.

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
Physician Wang.

100
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,200
What does that frown mean?

101
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,840
What is going on here?

102
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
Tell us about it.

103
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,360
Strange...

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,360
Why can't I figure it out?

105
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,870
Could it be a false alarm?

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,240
Su Qianqian.

107
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,600
If this is a fake pregnancy,

108
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,390
it would be so humiliating.

109
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
And now,

110
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,000
the entire General Mansion knows.

111
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,510
Madam Chu, how can you save face?

112
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Sir,

113
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,390
please examine carefully.

114
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,080
It's truly unclear
if it's a boy or a girl.

115
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,720
But the pulse surely indicates pregnancy.

116
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,440
Physician Wang,

117
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,790
are you absolutely certain?

118
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,600
This concerns my sister-in-law's honor.

119
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,150
You mustn't make any mistakes.

120
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,000
There's no mistake.

121
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,000
Perhaps it is still small.

122
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,990
Its pulse isn't strong,

123
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
so it cannot be confirmed yet.

124
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
Forget it.

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,270
The gender is destined by the heavens.

126
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,750
Qianqian,

127
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,270
take care of your pregnancy.

128
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,270
Everyone, you may leave now.

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Let's go.

130
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,790
Honey, what happened just now?

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,870
That Physician Wang
was clearly invited by Mingzhu

132
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,630
to target me, but why didn't he expose us?

133
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,840
Was he intimidated by my presence?

134
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,910
So he dared not confront me?

135
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,000
That must be it.

136
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,650
But it shouldn't be entirely the case.

137
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,630
This physician is bound to offend Mingzhu.

138
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
He won't have an easy outcome.

139
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,510
It seems Mingzhu is difficult to deal with.

140
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,440
Thinking this way is absolutely correct.

141
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,320
Mother.

142
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,110
Mother-in-law.

143
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,080
When I suggested
that Qianqian was pregnant,

144
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,870
I already anticipated
someone would exploit this.

145
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,960
The people brought by the princess

146
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,790
are already under surveillance.

147
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360
Even Physician Wang is under my control.

148
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,750
Otherwise,
it wouldn't be this easy to cover.

149
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,000
You truly thought it through.

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,910
You two,

151
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,000
follow me.

152
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,130
Come on.

153
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,960
Have some soup.

154
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,120
What kind of soup is this?

155
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,240
It's nourishing and healthy.

156
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,550
It's the Fertility Immortal Soup.

157
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,390
Why are you standing there?

158
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,080
Drink it while it's warm.

159
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,030
(What kind of fertility soup is this?)

160
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,240
(Just a random mix of ingredients.)

161
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,750
(This smells so bad.)

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,480
(He definitely won't drink it.)

163
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,910
(Let's see how he reacts first.)

164
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Qianqian,

165
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,590
drink it while it's warm.

166
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,030
Why haven't you drunk it yet?

167
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
I'll drink it now.

168
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Come on.

169
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,550
That's more like it.

170
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,870
Come on.

171
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,510
Quick, pour another bowl.

172
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,790
One more bowl.

173
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,440
Alright, alright.

174
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,510
Good.

175
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Let me do it.

176
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,240
Junyao, he... he loves drinking.

177
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,110
Alright.

178
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,030
Alright.

179
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,200
Good.

180
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,790
This is wonderful.

181
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,440
Wonderful.

182
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,870
I didn't expect my son to love it so much.

183
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,800
Chuntao,

184
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,600
make a bit more next time.

185
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,180
It's not even enough
to fill his teeth gap.

186
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,670
(There's even a next time?)

187
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,500
(My mother-in-law is...)

188
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,360
The soup is all gone,

189
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,720
so why not handle the important matter?

190
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,990
What important matter?

191
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,440
Qianqian,

192
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,670
come here, have a look.

193
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,080
Take a look.

194
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,270
This room here,

195
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,840
I had a Fengshui Master adjust it.

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,910
The bedhead must be placed here.

197
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,360
The master said only this way,

198
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,240
you'll conceive quickly.

199
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,270
I just want a grandchild.

200
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,480
Qianqian, it's all up to you.

201
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,480
Don't disappoint me.

202
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Mother,

203
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,070
I've just thought it over carefully.

204
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,750
I think she's still
in her mourning period.

205
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,270
All these may be inappropriate.

206
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,510
Don't be bound by
formalities or conventions.

207
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,510
Think about it.

208
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,960
If people find out
she is faking her pregnancy,

209
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,110
it would be deceiving His Majesty.

210
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,590
Qianqian.

211
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,160
Now, you need to

212
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,400
let go of your worries, relax completely,

213
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,920
and enjoy the deep affection with my son.

214
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,790
Only then can new life be nurtured.

215
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,590
Mother, I still think that...

216
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,270
Enough.

217
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,790
On this matter, my word is final.

218
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,630
Come here.

219
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,630
Give it to me.

220
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,920
Make good use of the time.

221
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,000
Madam, aren't you being a bit too pushy?

222
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,680
I want the eldest great-grandson.

223
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,790
I must fight to regain my pride.

224
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
Back then, I was too lax with Yunfei,

225
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,480
and had Junyao too late,

226
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,000
so he isn't the first grandson.

227
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,630
Madam.

228
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,920
The younger generation
needs more discipline.

229
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,480
Qianqian,

230
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,830
I think Mother is making sense.

231
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,550
We...

232
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,110
dare not deceive His Majesty.

233
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,590
I don't think you're worried.

234
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
I think you're just crafty and scheming.

235
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,640
We are husband and wife.
