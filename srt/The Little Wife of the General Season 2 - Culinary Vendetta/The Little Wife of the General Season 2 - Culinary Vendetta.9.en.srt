00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,760
So much!

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,880
Don't overthink it.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,670
This is just to show you

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,670
the strength of "the left pocket".

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Your means are unfathomable.

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,040
Indeed.

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,070
Of course.

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,320
Well then, let's talk.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,390
What do you want to do?

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,990
Mother-in-law,

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,320
we want to open a restaurant.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,840
We need your support.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,920
Opening a restaurant?

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,840
That's a great idea!

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,750
Her cooking is so good.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,120
It will surely bring fortune
from all directions!

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,950
Right? I think so too.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,150
Alright, alright, alright.

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,350
Mother,

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,230
actually, we need your support,

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,790
specifically your actions.

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,510
Qianqian, let me tell you something.

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,280
We are already living

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,200
quite comfortably.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
Speaking of money,

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
how much will ever be enough?

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,760
You are now the lady
of the General Mansion.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,640
Just enjoy a happy life at home.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,220
You don't need to worry about anything.

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,280
Isn't this good?

33
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,920
You're right.

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,510
But I have my reasons.

35
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,280
The reason Junyao has no money

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,350
is that he uses his stipend

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,070
to aid the orphans
of the fallen soldiers.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,870
I understand his desire
to bring prosperity to all.

40
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,560
But we also need money to survive.

41
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,080
As his wife,

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,280
it is natural for me
to share his burdens.

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,310
Once we open the restaurant,

44
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,150
earn money,

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,280
and accumulate our wealth
to a certain level,

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,290
we can use it to aid the common people,

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,190
support the nation

48
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,190
and the military stipend.

49
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,680
This is also a way to defend the nation.

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,520
Well said.

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,470
That's wonderful.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
My daughter-in-law having such thoughts

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,360
puts my mind at ease.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,630
Ah, this is truly wonderful.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,910
Qianqian,

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,910
if you have any ideas,
pursue them boldly.

57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,750
From now on,

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
the Chu Family
will always have your back.

59
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,150
So, don't be afraid of anything.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,470
Here you are.

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,630
That's very good.

62
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,270
Take this.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Is she always this cautious?

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,560
My lady, are you saying Madam is stingy?

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,310
Why not just say it outright?

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,310
It's all for preserving
the general's dignity.

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,520
But there's no money for food.

68
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,250
Can dignity fill an empty stomach?

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
It cannot.

70
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,280
- Can it open a restaurant?
- It cannot.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,400
Can it bring revenge?

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
It cannot!

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
What are you trying to say?

74
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,630
I have three things to say.

75
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,830
Only if you abandon your pride,

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,630
can you get money from Madam.

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,510
Is what you just said true?

78
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
That's what I said.

79
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,430
But it's not us losing face.

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,160
Madam.

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,190
The general and young madam
request an audience.

82
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,270
I won't see them.

83
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,680
Have you hidden my chest properly?

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,000
First Madam, rest assured.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,950
I have.

86
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,160
I used three locks.

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,750
Good.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
You may leave.

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
General, Young Madam.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,310
First Madam is resting.

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Why don't you come back another time?

92
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,910
Mother,

93
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,390
I know you haven't had any rest.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,040
Please help us this time.

95
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,150
Mother.

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Mother-in-law.

97
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,190
Don't you want grandchildren?

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,480
Of course, I do.

99
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,390
I've always wanted

100
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,870
to be a grandmother.

101
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,040
I think about it every day.

102
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,750
Look at the two of you.

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,870
How could you open a restaurant
at such a crucial time?

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,190
This is completely against my wishes.

105
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,190
Don't worry.

106
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,870
I will fulfill your wish.

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,630
Junyao and I will work tirelessly
day and night.

108
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,870
We will try our best.

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Here you go.

110
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,540
Quickly, drink the soup.

111
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,040
Finish your drink and get back to work.

112
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,310
To be honest,

113
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,120
shamelessness actually works sometimes.

114
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,870
They are indeed impressive.

115
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,350
Alright.

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
You all keep drinking.

117
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,630
Would you like a bowl too?

118
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
General!

119
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,790
There's a thief!

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
Don't run!

121
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,000
How dare the thief!

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
The general only drinks a bowl.

123
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,800
You drink on his behalf.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Come on.

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Drink it up.

126
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,480
Once you're done,

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,510
he'll catch the thief.

128
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Come on.

129
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
Good.

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,750
(It's not that I like it,)

131
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,630
(but she put in so much effort.)

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Keep drinking.

133
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,320
I really can't drink anymore.

134
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,120
The effect of this med
gets stronger each time.

135
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,670
Honey.

136
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,200
Why do you feel so slippery?

137
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,840
Come here.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And you're cool to the touch.

139
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,910
How did such a large eggplant grow?

140
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,910
A large eggplant.

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,920
Honey,

142
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,240
are you alright?

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
Changsheng.

144
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,390
Why did you shave?

145
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,390
What Changsheng?

146
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,480
What shaving?

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,840
I am your husband.

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Honey,

149
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,120
I feel so dizzy.

150
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,670
Honey, carry me.

151
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,600
Carry me.

152
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Giddy up!

153
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Honey.

154
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,030
You smell so nice.

155
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,240
With you here,

156
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,510
there will be no more danger.

157
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,600
Qianqian,

158
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,150
if you keep doing this,

159
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,670
it's dangerous right now.

160
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,630
What danger?

161
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,360
Has he not returned yet?

162
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
Princess,

163
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,550
young master has recently taken a liking

164
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,360
to a woman named Xiulian
at Tianxiang House.

165
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,790
Indulging in frivolity,

166
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,000
he's unfit for great causes.

167
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,280
Exactly.

168
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,150
How did you come to
choose him back then?

169
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,230
Princess.

170
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,120
After all, he is still my husband.

171
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,840
It's not your place to criticize.

172
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,030
Princess, please calm down.
I was wrong.

173
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,080
My lord, don't go back tonight.

174
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,870
I can't bear to part with you.

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,120
I must go back.

176
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,440
There's a tigress waiting at home.

177
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,390
Why not just get rid of her?

178
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,200
Compared to her, I only care for you.

179
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
Even so,

180
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,390
she is still my lawfully wedded wife.

181
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,910
How can I get rid of her casually?

182
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,750
I knew you were someone
I could entrust my life to.

183
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,550
All I ask is to stay by your side.

184
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,550
That alone would make me happy.

185
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,670
You're so obedient.

186
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,290
Then I'll cherish you properly.

187
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
Why did you suddenly run into my arms?

188
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,720
Honey, why have you come here?

189
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,790
The winder is coming.

190
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm worried about you.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,550
Staying outside too long
will leave you cold.

192
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,030
It seems I was overly worried.

193
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,200
You two seem unaffected by the cold.

194
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
Come to think of it,

195
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
it truly is getting a bit chilly.

196
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,870
This girl seems to have too much energy.

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,510
Remove her outer garments.

198
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,240
Take her outside to cool off.

199
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,220
- What are you doing?
- Move.

200
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,840
My lord, please save me!

201
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,240
Help me!

202
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,120
No matter how many women you find,

203
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,960
I don't mind at all.

204
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,120
But you shouldn't indulge in brothels

205
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,720
while your future is still bright.

206
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,720
If our affair is ever exposed,

207
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,870
what awaits us will be hell.

208
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,670
Honey.

209
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,320
Honey.

210
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,750
I'm very aware

211
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,080
of what you mean.

212
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,360
I noticed you've been tired lately.

213
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,080
I just want you to rest well.

214
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,920
In my heart,

215
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
you are the priority.

216
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,390
Constable Zhang has been caught.

217
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,680
That's great.

218
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,550
Execute him.

219
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,720
What use is a dead man?

220
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,030
Only the living have value.

221
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,790
Do you mean...

222
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,480
We use him to set the trap,

223
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,080
luring Chu Junyao into it,

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,080
and then eliminate him.

225
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Brilliant.

226
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,160
Truly brilliant.

227
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,510
Honey, you truly are
the smartest woman alive.

228
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,270
If I were to lose you,

229
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,150
what would I ever do?

230
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,910
I've already told you what to do.

231
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,270
From now on,

232
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,390
I'll leave the rest to you.

233
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Honey.

234
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,390
Honey.

235
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,080
Qianqian.

236
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,880
Actually, this can't be rushed.

237
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,440
Opening a restaurant needs a team.

238
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,790
We should first build our own team.

239
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,200
I already have someone in mind.

240
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,870
Who is it?

241
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,750
Those who once challenged me.
