00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,030
Mother-in-law.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,800
Madam Chu.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,670
I've failed in my duties.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,830
I couldn't protect the child.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,750
Aunt, how cruel you are!

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,720
You wanted to take my child's life!

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,600
I didn't do it!

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,070
That's impossible!

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,110
Fake.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,640
It's absolutely fake.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,470
Su Qianqian.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,790
You framed me!

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,320
Yang Cuihua!

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,880
How dare you harm the Chu Family's heir!

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,560
I won't let this go!

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Madam.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,240
I did not!

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,040
Kneel before our ancestors and repent!

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,790
Madam Chu.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,070
Get lost.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,150
My child...

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,640
Speak up.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,200
What happened?

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,950
First Madam, this is what happened.

27
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,640
While I was doing laundry,

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Shaoqing deliberately
splashed water on me.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,590
Then, she pretended
to offer me clothes kindly.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,950
That's how she set me up.

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,070
Later, Second Madam arrived.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,230
She even bullied my lady.

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,790
Mother-in-law,

34
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,710
the miscarriage was intentional
on my part.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,230
I feared that
if my fake pregnancy spread out,

36
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,410
it would harm the Chu Family.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,040
After much deliberation,
I decided it was better

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,430
for everyone to believe
I had a miscarriage.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
So, I bribed Nanny Zhang early on

40
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,080
to confirm the story of my miscarriage.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,030
I never intended to frame Second Madam.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,840
But she truly went too far.

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
So I simply went with the flow.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,630
Still, doing this

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
is indeed deeply satisfying.

46
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,190
However,

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,960
it may not be entirely appropriate.

48
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,320
Let me tell you this.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
For such important matters,

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,000
you must consult me first, okay?

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,590
Do you understand?

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
I was planning to discuss it with you.

53
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,680
But it happened all of a sudden.

54
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,750
Sudden?

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,390
You even informed Nanny Zhang.

56
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,280
Please quell your anger.

57
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,400
I promise

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,030
I will consult you on everything,
big or small.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,840
It seems I am not valued enough.

60
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,240
After all, you only make broth
for Madam Chu.

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,590
I'm just a mother-in-law.

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,080
Whatever you want to eat or drink,

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
just tell me.

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,000
I will make it for you.

65
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,630
You said it yourself.

66
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,890
This much?

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,380
This is for a month,

68
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,900
without repeating a single dish.

69
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,630
If you regret it now, there's still time.

70
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,080
How could I regret it?

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,400
To be valued so highly by you

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,960
is truly my honor.

73
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,560
Now that's my good daughter-in-law.

74
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,400
(I absolutely cannot offend
my mother-in-law.)

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
How wonderful this is.

76
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,040
(I planned to teach Su Qianqian a lesson,)

77
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,950
(and show Mingzhu how formidable I am.)

78
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,390
(But I ended up
shooting myself in the foot,)

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,870
(and lost face in the process.)

80
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,830
(Su Qianqian, just you wait.)

81
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,870
Praying for the ancestors' blessings.

82
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,630
May Mingzhu soon bear a Chu Family heir.

83
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,680
Second Madam.

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Mother-in-law.

85
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,310
I just saw someone
kneeling here from afar.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,950
I thought it was a servant
who'd done wrong.

87
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,120
Why is it you, mother-in-law?

88
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,480
I came to petition the ancestors.

89
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,920
Praying for you two to live peacefully

90
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,510
and to bear a noble child soon.

91
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,750
You are so considerate.

92
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,230
Thank you, mother-in-law.

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,390
It is turning cold.

94
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,580
The ground is damp and chilly.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,270
Mother-in-law, please stand up.

96
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,950
Yue'e, help Second Madam up.

97
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,350
Yes.

98
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,240
Thank you for your concern, Mingzhu.

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,180
That won't be necessary.

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,480
You have to kneel here
for two hours to plead.

101
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,950
Otherwise, it won't work.

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Mother-in-law.

103
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,680
I heard
that Su Qianqian had a miscarriage.

104
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,040
(Mingzhu is deliberately trying to
provoke me.)

105
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm not sure about that.

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Mingzhu.

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,720
This place is cold and damp.

108
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,830
You should go back and rest.

109
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,430
Yes, I shall take my leave.

110
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,030
Princess.

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,920
This can't be true.

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,630
Physician Wang checked
Su Qianqian's pulse,

113
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,800
and said she wasn't pregnant.

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
So this miscarriage must be fake.

115
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,270
(I'm so furious!)

116
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,480
(Su Qianqian indeed did this on purpose.)

117
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,600
(Why didn't I hold my ground?)

118
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
(It's all Mingzhu's fault.)

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,830
(How could she not inform me of this?)

120
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,870
(She made me lose so much face.)

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Those who bullied you,

122
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,600
I will make them pay double the price.

123
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110
Come here.

124
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Does it still hurt?

125
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,190
Any progress on Constable Zhang?

126
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,310
It seems Constable Zhang has vanished.

127
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,360
There are no leads at the moment.

128
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,230
Honey,

129
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,000
I think we should change our approach.

130
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,080
What do you mean?

131
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,720
Many officials are tied to the Ning Mansion.

132
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,750
This is an impenetrable and intricate web.

133
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,430
Since we can't break through one point,

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,430
we must unveil the entire web.

135
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,310
But doing so involves too many people.

136
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,750
It would not only alert the enemy,

137
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,090
but if they unite to counterattack,

138
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,870
we'll be overwhelmed.

139
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,240
Aim for the weakest spot.

140
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,430
We must know
both our enemy and ourselves.

141
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,190
I plan to open a restaurant secretly.

142
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,800
It will become the best in the capital,

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,390
the most sought-after restaurant,

144
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,070
attracting dignitaries
and nobles to dine.

145
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,830
Whether for meetings or discussions,

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,270
or forging connections,

147
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,040
it will be the most prestigious restaurant.

148
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,600
They say
people speak the truth after drinking.

149
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
We can take advantage of that fact,

150
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,830
gather secrets,

151
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,920
then conduct a targeted investigation.

152
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,240
At that time,

153
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,190
the vile deeds
of those high-ranking officials

154
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,000
will become our weapon for justice.

155
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,670
It is possible,

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,670
but using eavesdropping to invade privacy

157
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,510
feels morally questionable.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,630
Some methods,
when used righteously, are just,

159
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,150
when used wrongly, are evil.

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,550
For the innocent souls of the Su Family,

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,440
what's wrong with me
being the villain for once?

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,790
Of course,
if you don't support my decision,

163
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,790
I can still rely on myself.

164
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,360
If anything happens,
I'll bear the consequences.

165
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,270
What nonsense are you saying?

166
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,390
You and I are husband and wife.

167
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,270
We must work together.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,240
I support your decision.

169
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,100
Just saying it isn't enough.

170
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,910
We need to take real action.

171
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,200
Running a restaurant costs a fortune,

172
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,750
especially the finest restaurant.

173
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,300
Why not contribute from your secret stash?

174
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,840
You're all talk and no action.

175
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
That's not true.

176
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,670
I genuinely support you, my dear.

177
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
It's just that...

178
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't you have money?

179
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,720
How could he possibly have any?

180
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,870
Across the whole capital,

181
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,820
he's probably the poorest official.

182
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,960
His entire savings and stipend

183
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,240
were all given to
the families of fallen soldiers.

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,550
Let me tell you a secret.

185
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,720
His waterproof garment

186
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,630
has been torn and patched repeatedly.

187
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,510
General, you're truly noble.

188
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,550
In one's position,
one must fulfill one's duty.

189
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,840
These are the responsibilities
I must uphold.

190
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,510
Zi Xuan.

191
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,600
Didn't I already tell you

192
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,360
there's no need to mention this?

193
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,200
Madam is one of us,

194
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,200
so she has the right to know.

195
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,590
Madam,

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,200
don't be fooled by his cold demeanor.

197
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,200
He looks brave and dashing,

198
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,030
and he's also upright and kind-hearted.

199
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,790
That's why his soldiers respect him,

200
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
and why he wins every battle.

201
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,230
Alright.

202
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,840
So, there's truly no money.

203
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,660
Yes, yes, exactly.

204
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,080
Yes, yes, exactly.

205
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,320
(Second Madam is usually so hateful.)

206
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,600
(Today, I shall stand for justice)

207
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,910
(and deliver a forceful reprimand to her.)

208
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,360
(How dare you bully Yingying!)

209
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,750
What nonsense.

210
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Honey.

211
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
Honey,

212
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,000
why did you hit me?

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,840
My dear.

214
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,630
My face...

215
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,030
My face is burning hot.

216
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,230
This...

217
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,120
Princess,

218
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,840
Su Qianqian is constantly guarded.

219
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,360
It's hard to make a move.

220
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,200
Even if we want to follow her,

221
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,080
the difficulty is quite high.

222
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,030
Su Qianqian has started suspecting us.

223
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,790
If we don't eliminate the couple,

224
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,550
they will become a threat.

225
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,440
Let her suspect if she likes.

226
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,960
Anyway, that matter,

227
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,390
the evidence has already been destroyed.

228
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,720
I doubt they can find anything now.

229
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,510
Any news of Constable Zhang?

230
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,750
He is extremely cunning.

231
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,510
After presenting evidence,
his whole family vanished.

232
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,390
They still haven't been found.

233
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,280
Oh,

234
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,840
it is reported

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
that a mysterious faction

236
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
is also searching for Constable Zhang.

237
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,840
It must be Chu Junyao's people.

238
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,000
Assign more personnel.

239
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,030
We must not let them find him first.

240
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,110
Understood.

241
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,760
It's him again, Chu Junyao.

242
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
This is everything we could gather.

243
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,960
But it is far from enough.

244
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,120
This Sword of Nation was bestowed
by the Late Emperor.

245
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,600
Pawn it tomorrow.

246
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,560
Understood.

247
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,470
General.

248
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
You mustn't do this.

249
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,960
This Sword of Nation is your...

250
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,410
Your...

251
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,750
- Your...
- Take it.

252
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,230
It's not worth much anyway.

253
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,670
It won't solve the problem.

254
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,710
Alright.

255
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,080
- Honey.
- Hmm.

256
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,910
I plan to prepare a meal tomorrow

257
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,080
for my mother-in-law.

258
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,080
What do you think?

259
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,870
You mean...

260
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,480
I know what she means.

261
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,750
It's like a weasel
paying respects to a chicken.

262
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,390
Do you even think before you speak?

263
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,910
You offended three people just for a joke.

264
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,960
Three people? Really?

265
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,030
Where's the feast you promised?

266
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,670
Why is there only this bowl of noodles?

267
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,750
To be honest,

268
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,870
we've been eating noodles for days.

269
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,270
Noodles are good.

270
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,480
I love eating noodles.

271
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,150
I don't mind.

272
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
But Junyao has lost weight.

273
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,590
Really?

274
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
What happened?

275
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,640
I didn't eat enough.

276
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,830
I can't even lift the spear.

277
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,400
Haven't you pawned everything you should?

278
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,270
How is it still not enough?

279
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,310
So you already know.

280
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,200
Why are we standing so far away?

281
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,640
It's too close even standing here.

282
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,480
Look at that awkwardness.

283
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,830
It's practically overflowing.

284
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,590
Let's just slip away.

285
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,110
Alright, just say it already.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,240
Today, with this bowl of noodles,

287
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,920
how much are you hoping to gain?

288
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,070
Oh, mother-in-law, that's too formal.

289
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,070
This is merely a matter of

290
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,720
moving money
from the left pocket to the right.

291
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,030
Why not move it
from the right to the left?

292
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,960
Because there's nothing in the right.

293
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Really?

294
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,960
You are the "right side".

295
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,870
Chuntao.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,550
So much!
