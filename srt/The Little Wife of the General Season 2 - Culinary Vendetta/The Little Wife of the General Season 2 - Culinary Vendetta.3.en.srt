00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,800
If you dare to escape again,

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,270
I'll break your leg.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,230
After all, some guests like imperfections.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,670
That's not imperfection.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,070
It's a disability.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,350
How dare you talk back!

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,920
Let me ask you,

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,750
will you take guests?

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,350
(My lady, are you alright now?)

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,030
(I'm about to be forced into disgrace.)

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,150
I will,

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,640
all 24 hours of the day.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,000
But I have a small request to fulfill.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,510
Speak.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,200
I only serve handsome men.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,330
Are you saying I'm the handsome one?

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
Zi Xuan.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,920
Zi Xuan.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
From this moment on,

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,760
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,040
Who is this random nobody?

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,790
Do you think we're just decoration?

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,950
You even dared to storm into this place!

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,040
Today, I'll show you arrogance.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,710
Her face.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,430
Who hit her?

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
It was me.

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,560
Kill him for me!

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
- Yes!
- Go on!

32
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,230
Well done, that's so satisfying!

33
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,400
Teach her a lesson.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
That's my man, no doubt about it.

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,750
So handsome.

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,590
So reassuring.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,630
Princess.

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,800
Princess, news from the palace.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Madam Chu of the General Mansion

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,960
has requested a pardon for Su Qianqian.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,910
Su Qianqian lives alone in this world,

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
which is truly not easy.

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,240
Once she leaves the General Mansion,

44
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,400
how about I reunite her with her family?

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,710
Princess, you're truly kind.

46
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,280
I will give the order right away.

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,800
I take my leave now.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,560
(Madam Chu and First Madam
have treated me well.)

49
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,080
(I'll repay you when there's a chance,)

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,310
(For now,)

51
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,310
(I can only focus on making good dishes)

52
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,840
(to express my gratitude.)

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Madam Chu.

54
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,310
First Madam.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
For your immense kindness,

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,190
I have no way to repay you,

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,310
so I specially cooked a few dishes

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,270
to convey my gratitude.

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,650
You truly are so considerate.

60
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,600
I had thought of keeping you here.

61
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,680
Wishing you both good health,

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,390
and a prosperous life.

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
I take my leave.

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
Qianqian,

65
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,270
wait a moment.

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,870
I'll arrange for someone to escort you out.

67
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,270
Why not stay at my brother's home
for a few days?

68
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,790
Is that okay?

69
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,600
Greetings, Grandmother, Mother.

70
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,160
Junyao, you're back.

71
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,270
Have a seat.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Let me take a good look at you.

73
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,120
Junyao,

74
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,560
I heard you just returned victoriously
a few days ago.

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,830
Why must you leave?

76
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,230
Grandmother,

77
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,270
Mother,

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,430
I have something important to share with you.

79
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,630
If it's so important, speak quickly.

80
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,390
Grandmother, can you request His Majesty
for a marriage?

81
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,310
It should have been this way long ago.

82
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,160
His Majesty also intends
to marry Princess Xiyao to you.

83
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,950
Grandmother, the one I admire is not her.

84
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,240
It is the daughter
of the former Imperial Censor,

85
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,430
Su Qianqian.

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,600
Junyao, as for Su Qianqian...

87
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,310
I've heard the Su Family women were exiled.

88
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,920
Their safety is uncertain.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
This matter might be difficult to handle.

90
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,920
I already learned about their misfortune.

91
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,070
I believe they are loyal, not traitors.

92
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,600
So, I hurried to Hanshan Town.

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,390
On the way, I found
that apart from Qianqian,

94
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,560
all other women were killed.

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,270
I found some clues.

96
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,590
Qianqian has already returned.

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Did you find her then?

98
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,080
No, I didn't.

99
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,990
I'm worried about her safety.

100
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,270
So, I want you to
ask His Majesty for her pardon,

101
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,950
and bestow a marriage upon me.

102
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,310
Junyao.

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,630
This matter is of great importance,

104
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,070
and requires careful deliberation.

105
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,390
You've had a tiring journey.

106
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,830
Come on, have something to eat first.

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,630
Indeed, this is a serious matter, so...

108
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,130
Mother,

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,870
this is Chrysanthemum Tofu.

110
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,110
Who made it?

111
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,160
Only Qianqian could make it.

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,070
Has she visited here?

113
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Where is she now?

114
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,070
Tell me where she is.

115
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,800
Junyao.

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,240
I arranged for her to leave the city.

117
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,390
She'll stay at your uncle's for a while.

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Junyao.

119
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,270
Junyao!

120
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Mother.

121
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
This child...

122
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,360
What a fateful entanglement.

123
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,600
An imperial decree of marriage
will arrive soon.

124
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,720
The imperial order cannot be defied.

125
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,840
Princess, Su Qianqian has left the mansion.

126
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,440
But someone is guarding her closely.

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,120
Send the Shadow Guard.

128
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,730
Make it swift and clean.

129
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,270
They will ensure no mistakes.

130
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,750
I will destroy everything she has.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,840
I want her to know

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,510
what "a fate worse than death" truly means.

133
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,590
Understood.

134
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,440
General, the other side is too cautious,

135
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,630
leaving no clues behind.

136
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,000
I have ordered men to track them.

137
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
General.

138
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,790
There is no sign of Miss Su's body,

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,630
which means
they don't intend to kill her yet.

140
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Who are you people?

141
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,360
I heard you're a cook.

142
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,840
How about tasting the salt I prepared?

143
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,910
Not flavorful enough, huh?

144
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,790
I just bought the spiciest chilies
from the marketplace.

145
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,230
Here, try it.

146
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,790
What skillful hands you have!

147
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,240
No wonder your cooking is so amazing.

148
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,510
You... Who are you?

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,510
Untie the ropes for her.

150
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
Yes.

151
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,750
I gave orders before,

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,720
"Leave no one alive."

153
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,120
And yet, you still escaped.

154
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,790
You... you are the one
who harmed my family.

155
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,670
I merely used a small trick

156
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,080
to wipe out nearly a hundred of your family.
