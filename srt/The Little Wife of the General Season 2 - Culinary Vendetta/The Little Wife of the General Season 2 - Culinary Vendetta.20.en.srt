00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,550
You won't even deserve to live.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Despicable.

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,670
Even if I must die,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,670
go to hell with me.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,920
Young Madam!

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,760
My lady!

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,720
Madam.

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,200
I said

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,120
I will kill you myself.

12
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,120
Ziteng.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,680
Juan.

14
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,990
Dad.

15
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,150
Mom.

16
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,560
Aunts.

17
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,950
All my Su Family relatives,

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,200
I've avenged you.

19
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,510
My lady...

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Qianqian!

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,200
My lady.

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
Zi Xuan.

23
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,030
Qianqian.

24
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,190
The rebels have been dealt with.

25
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,080
We made it.

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,870
We've avenged ourselves.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,120
Tomorrow,

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,430
let's honor the Su Family ancestors together.

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

30
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,680
Dad. Mom.

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,150
Aunts, Uncles, and other relatives.

32
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,560
Junyao and I came to visit you.

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,360
I cooked your favorite dishes.

34
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,630
I also brought your favorite drinks.

35
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,120
Now the major grudge is settled.

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,630
You can rest in peace now.

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
Junyao.

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,590
Have you and Qianqian discussed
the wedding?

39
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,870
I really didn't expect this.

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
I thought our contributions

41
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,560
could make His Majesty
revoke the marriage edict.

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
But His Majesty not only refused,

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,870
but also ordered me

44
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,750
marry Princess Xiyao in three days.

45
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,070
Our Chu Family has outstanding achievements.

46
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,750
Naturally, His Majesty wants to
keep it under control.

47
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,870
Forcing Princess Xiyao to marry

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,240
is also to better restrain the Chu Family.

49
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,070
In my opinion,

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,000
Qianqian is a good girl.

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,920
Talk it through with her.

52
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,190
I trust she'll understand you.

53
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,040
Mother.

54
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,430
My heart belongs only to Qianqian.

55
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,430
If I marry Princess Xiyao,

56
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,560
it would be unfair to all three of us.

57
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,680
You're so wise.

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
Please help me find a way.

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
It's hard to defy the Imperial Command.

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,710
Since it's the Imperial Edict,

61
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,920
we cannot defy it.

62
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,270
Qianqian.

63
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,790
Qianqian.

64
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,070
Mother.

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,750
Junyao.

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,310
Thank you
for clearing the Su Family's name,

67
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,000
and for looking after me.

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,490
I don't want to make things hard for you.

69
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,600
Just divorce me.

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,680
You know what I mean.

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,160
We pledged to be each other's one and only.

72
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,390
I disagree.

73
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,750
I knew His Majesty intended to

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,870
marry Princess Xiyao to you.

75
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,750
I still wish to join the Chu Family,

76
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,270
to use its power to avenge my family.

77
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,270
This is just my selfish side showing.

78
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Now, it shows itself again.

79
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,430
I don't want to share my husband.

80
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,190
I hope you understand.

81
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,830
Let go.

82
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,160
Let go, please.

83
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm your husband.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,240
Then you'll always be my wife.

85
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,310
We know the edict mustn't be defied.

86
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
Otherwise, execution awaits.

87
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
So...

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,270
this matter is unsolvable.

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
Junyao.

90
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,340
I want you to be happy.

91
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,430
Didn't we agree

92
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,120
to face any major issues together?

93
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,270
This is the major issue.

94
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,240
I didn't expect you'd be so unreliable,

95
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,360
still thinking of abandoning me.

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,270
I won't let you have your way.

97
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,310
Let go.

98
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Chu Junyao.

99
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
You...

100
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
What are you doing in broad daylight?

101
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,040
My wife is about to leave.

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,480
Am I not doing anything?

103
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
Get up.

104
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,900
You're not a child anymore.

105
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,240
Is this how you handle things?

106
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Is avoiding the answer?

107
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,390
Anyway, I absolutely won't...

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,750
General Lei.

109
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,840
Thank you for your help this time.

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,670
Otherwise, the Chu Family...

111
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,240
really might suffer heavy casualties.

112
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
Oh, Madam.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,630
You can't put it that way.

114
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,030
If Junyao hadn't warned me early,

115
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,270
I might have met King Yama by now.

116
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,390
Speaking of which,

117
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,600
the Chus are my lifesavers.

118
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,510
To show my gratitude,

119
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,240
I prepared a small gift for you.

120
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,840
If you were to give it,
it should be to Junyao.

121
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,630
I can't take this.

122
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,720
No, no.

123
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,080
I especially got this for you.

124
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,440
I just remembered something.

125
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
I have something important to handle
at home.

126
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,480
I have to go now.

127
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
Alright.

128
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,870
I won't see you off.

129
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,080
It's alright.

130
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,910
Yunfei and Lei Yue

131
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,440
are lifelong friends.

132
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,370
After Yunfei left,

133
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,270
General Lei cares a lot for me and Junyao.

134
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,240
Actually, I understand his thoughts.

135
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,670
Madam.

136
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,600
Actually, I can see it.

137
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,200
General Lei

138
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,360
is a very caring person.

139
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,870
Yes.

140
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,630
He is a good man.

141
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,030
But what can we do?

142
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,960
True, you're the head of the Chu Family.

143
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,670
General Lei is the head of the Lei Family.

144
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,440
If you truly get married,

145
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,990
it's hard to say who will take charge.

146
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,270
That will be a problem.

147
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,630
What are you saying?

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
Ah, these are my true feelings.

149
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,710
How did it come out?

150
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
Honey, your hair is beautiful,

151
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,720
straight and smooth.

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
Always trying to please.

153
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,270
So, what do you plan to do about this?

154
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,390
I've really thought about this a lot.

155
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,600
First, I could pretend to be
sick or dead.

156
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
Then, we could both retreat
to the mountains,

157
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,440
live a carefree life,

158
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,790
and have lots of Junior Yao and Qian.

159
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,790
Easy for you to say.

160
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,240
You have to protect our country.

161
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,840
You can't neglect that
due to personal matters.

162
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
You have a heart of gold.

163
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,790
I fall short.

164
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,240
Stop teasing me.

165
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,870
So I came up with a second plan.

166
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,670
After Princess Xiyao marries me,

167
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,440
I won't enter her chamber.

168
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,480
I'll show my ugly side.

169
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,200
I'll make her dislike me,

170
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,360
and initiate divorce with His Majesty.

171
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
What do you think?

172
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,960
Isn't that typical of a heartless man?

173
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
Harming a girl for no reason.

174
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,550
Yeah, Zi Xuan came up with this plan.

175
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,670
I rejected it.

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,670
Xuan, what's wrong?

177
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,440
Have you caught a cold?

178
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,840
No, I think I'm blamed again.

179
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,750
I told you, the general isn't a good man.

180
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,440
He's never satisfied with what he has.

181
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
You must never...

182
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
Handsome guy.

183
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,870
Where?

184
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,200
I believe we can talk this through

185
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,030
with Princess Xiyao.

186
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,240
It's better to be done before marriage.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Have her ask His Majesty for a divorce.

188
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,510
I heard she is His Majesty's favorite.

189
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,150
His Majesty should listen to her.

190
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,510
It's a way.

191
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,320
I'll head to the palace now to see her.

192
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,630
You come with me.

193
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,600
I won't go.

194
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,270
I'll stay home
waiting for your good news.

195
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,670
If you can't bring back good news,

196
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,200
I'll give you bad news.

197
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,600
Understood.

198
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,390
Lord Chu, a letter from the capital.

199
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,150
Dear Tianze,

200
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,390
there's been a major change.

201
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,870
The Nings, the rebels, are put to death.

202
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,200
Mingzhu brutally dismembered your mother.

203
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,150
Please return quickly upon reading this.

204
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,720
By the rules,

205
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,960
we shouldn't meet before marriage.

206
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,870
I don't know why you're seeking me.

207
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,240
Princess, I presume you know

208
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,910
that I've been married.

209
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,600
I heard it from the maids around me.

210
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
Your concubine, from the Su Family,

211
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
is graceful, kind

212
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,510
and is good at cooking.

213
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,030
I've been eager to see her.

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
It's almost time for us to meet.
