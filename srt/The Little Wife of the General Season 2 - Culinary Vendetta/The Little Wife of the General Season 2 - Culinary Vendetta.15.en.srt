=Episode 15=

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,830
If you could show some compassion,

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,760
and provide financial aid,

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
everything would be easier to handle.

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,240
How much are we talking about?

7
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,350
Of course, the more, the better.

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,710
(This sly fox.)

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,750
It was a beggar knocking on the door.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,430
Lord Zhang, just ignore it.

11
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,280
Bring your daughter out.

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,950
Today, I'm taking her with me.

13
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,150
Hurry up and bring Xiaojuan over.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,400
Rest assured, she'll be out soon.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,040
Brother Ziteng.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,880
Zi...

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Juan.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,870
Let go of me!

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,170
I said, let go!

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,310
I'm warning you.

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,170
Your parents accepted my betrothal gifts.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,710
From now on, you belong to me.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,000
I already have someone I love.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,230
I could never marry you.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,120
What use is your so-called love?

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,710
Can he let you live a life of luxury?

27
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,920
Can he afford the finest furs?

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
I don't care.

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,040
I only want Brother Ziteng.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,310
You, you, you...!

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,430
"Brother Ziteng"? He...

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,950
Does he look as handsome as me?

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,400
He's way more handsome than you.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,790
- You...
- Pig-head!

35
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,590
Take her away!

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,150
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

37
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,310
- Let me go!
- Xiaojuan!

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,150
Brother Ziteng!

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
Brother Ziteng!

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Let her go!

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,710
Who are you?

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,630
Get lost, pig-head.

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,910
Let her go!

44
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
How dare you hit me?

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,210
Hit him!

46
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,750
Brother Ziteng!

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,750
You...

48
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,990
Take him down!

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Take him down!

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,960
- Stop hitting!
- Hit him harder!

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Stop fighting!

52
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,280
Stop it.

53
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,950
Stop, you two!

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,430
Stop it, stop it.

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
Brother Ziteng.

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
Are you okay?

57
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm fine, I can handle it.

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,470
How dare you!

59
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,680
Do you even know who I am?

60
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,630
Let me tell you!

61
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,360
My son is the Vice Minister of Personnel.

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,280
Forcing on a young lady?

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
Even the minister couldn't justify this.

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
That's nonsense!

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,240
In what universe do I force her?

66
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,030
I paid for her fair and square.

67
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,750
What are you all doing here?

68
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,190
Release Lord Zhang immediately!

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,710
Du Ziteng, are you courting death?

70
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,910
How dare you peasants provoke Lord Zhang!

71
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,870
Get out immediately.

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,910
Make him shut up.

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Shut up!

74
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,310
My lady, they've gone to call for help.

75
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,630
Easy, easy, easy.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,840
Ziteng, hang in there!

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,470
I'll have Junyao handle this.

78
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,310
Alright.

79
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,840
Pretend I was never here.

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
My lady.

81
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,470
Soon the general will arrive.

82
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,120
He'll put those arrogant people.

83
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,430
How could I miss such a glorious moment?

84
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,360
Ziteng is now officially recognized

85
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,120
as the owner of the Light Tavern.

86
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,000
I must remain low-key.

87
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,800
Ah, my lady, you are so clever.

88
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,430
- Gently, gently!
- Don't move.

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,470
General Lei, this is all I can offer.

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,960
Would this be sufficient for you?

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,000
It's still enough, isn't it?

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,190
Ah, though it is a bit less than expected.

93
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,720
But it might be your savings
of half a lifetime.

94
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,950
Or rather, most of my lifetime.

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,360
Since you're so generous,

96
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,750
and so sincere about it.

97
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,830
Exactly!

98
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,980
Then I

99
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,000
will come up with a compromise for you.

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
What kind of compromise?

101
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,070
This will preserve the dignity of both sides.

102
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,680
- Great.
- And it will uphold my principles.

103
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,870
I have decided

104
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,270
to take Tianze to the frontline,

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
to lead the charge.

106
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,080
What?

107
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,040
Second Madam,

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,750
you need to stay calm.

109
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm only taking Tianze as a formality.

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,750
In two or three months,
I'll bring him back.

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,600
There's no danger at all.

112
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,170
Do you think this will work?

113
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,390
No, no, no, it won't.

114
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,720
Then, how about this?

115
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,830
If this doesn't work,

116
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,630
you should keep the money.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Find someone else.

118
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,830
I can't help anymore.

119
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,870
Wait, wait! General Lei, General Lei!

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,240
This is all yours.

121
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,600
It's all yours.

122
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,920
Now that's more like it.

123
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,360
Master,

124
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Master Chu,

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,480
we owe it all to you this time.

126
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,070
Your immense kindness,

127
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,510
Xiaojuan and I have no way to repay you.

128
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,360
Then let's just

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,490
give you a proper bow of gratitude.

130
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,360
- Please, get up.
- Get up.

131
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
For the one you love,

132
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,430
you fear no authority.

133
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,490
Your master didn't misjudge you.

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
Master Chu,

135
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,410
my master truly has great judgment.

136
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,830
She always chooses the right disciples,

137
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,190
let alone choosing her husband.

138
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,710
Don't you agree?

139
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,430
You sly one.

140
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,510
I'm starting to like you more.

141
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
- I'm good at reading people.
- Master.

142
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,120
A few guests have arrived.

143
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,680
One of them is from the Ning Mansion.

144
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,720
Ziteng, go and entertain them.

145
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,600
Bring two jars of fine wine.

146
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,820
Understood.

147
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,580
(Room IV)

148
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,510
Let me tell you something.

149
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,270
Following the marquis is never a mistake.

150
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,870
The Ning Family

151
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
will undoubtedly become
the most powerful one.

152
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,160
As for the Chu Family,

153
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,680
they won't enjoy the success for long.

154
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,310
Do you still remember the Su Family?

155
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me tell you this.

156
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,600
The marquis merely used a trick,

157
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,600
and wiped out the entire Su Family.

158
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
Impressive, isn't it?

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Indeed.

160
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
Brother Han.

161
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,070
Please put in a good word for us
with the marquis.

162
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,240
The justice division
is willing to follow him.

163
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,870
You have good judgment.

164
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
Your minister

165
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,800
has been visiting the Ning Mansion lately.

166
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,390
Come on, let's drink.

167
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,040
The food here is truly delicious.

168
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,270
Come on, let's drink, drink!

169
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,390
With these in hand,

170
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,800
we can start making arrests,

171
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
accuse Ning'an Marquis of forming factions

172
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,710
for treachery.

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
It won't work yet.

174
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,360
We haven't found crucial evidence.

175
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,670
Acting rashly now

176
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
will only alert the enemy.

177
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,550
That makes sense.

178
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,560
Then,

179
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,550
I have an urgent matter at hand

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,680
that needs attention.

181
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,510
What is it?

182
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,670
Family matters.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,030
The Ning Family has been eyeing up for us.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,390
How can you still think about
"family matters"?

185
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,910
So improper.

186
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,630
Even if surrounded by danger,

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,480
I will avert it with strength

188
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,840
to ensure your safety.

189
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,000
Honey.

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
If we can win with wisdom,

191
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,480
don't use force.

192
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,960
I don't want you to fall into danger.

193
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,510
Alright.

194
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,240
Now, I need to think about
Ziteng's wedding.

195
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,960
We need to prepare a marital home for them,

196
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,200
a place to settle and build their life.

197
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,960
Staying at the tavern forever isn't ideal.

198
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,270
What do you think?

199
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,480
I think your suggestion
makes perfect sense.

200
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,440
Shouldn't you show some support?

201
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,750
How?

202
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,750
I recall today is your payday.

203
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
You have a good memory.

204
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,920
Give me a kiss.

205
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Who is it?

206
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
It's me.

207
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,360
Mother.

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,270
Immortal... Soup.

209
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,670
Fertility Immortal Soup.

210
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,510
Mother-in-law, it's late.
You should rest.

211
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,240
Thanks, but no thanks.

212
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Look at you two.

213
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,150
You make me worry.

214
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,750
Who was it that promised me back then?

215
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,150
Said you'd dedicate yourself wholeheartedly.

216
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,080
Working tirelessly every day.

217
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,790
Now that the heirloom is in your hands,

218
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,200
are you going back on your word?

219
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,870
How could such a thing happen?

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,390
You're right.

221
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,510
But...

222
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,390
we've all been so busy lately, mother-in-law.

223
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,670
Call me "Mother".

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,910
In the Chu Family, just call me "Mother".

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
Mother.

226
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,000
Alright, alright, have a seat.

227
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,390
Have some soup.

228
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,390
Honey, you can't refuse
a gift from the elders.

229
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,440
I'll drink it all. Suit yourself.

230
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,440
Good.

231
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,750
That's right.

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,970
Good.

233
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,680
Junyao.

234
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,590
Well done!

235
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,680
You two.

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
Make the use of time.

237
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,240
I'll leave you alone.

238
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
Go, go, go.

239
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,910
Honey, one more.

240
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,790
Honey, calm yourself.

241
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,000
Junyao is about to marry Princess Xiyao.

242
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,320
I hope Qianqian can conceive
at this time.

243
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,690
Only then can she become
Junyao's lawful wife.

244
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,320
I hope she can understand

245
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,910
my efforts in all of this.

246
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,390
Madam.

247
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,270
Young Madam will surely understand.

248
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,200
(General Mansion)
Mother. Honey.

249
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,710
Two months.

250
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,550
I will return in two months.

251
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,790
Wait for me.

252
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,870
- Alright.
- Alright.

253
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Tianze.

254
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,320
You must stay safe
while you're out there alone.

255
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,670
Avoid causing trouble whenever possible.

256
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,200
If money can solve it,
it's not a real problem.

257
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,870
Your life is what matters most.

258
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,910
I understand.

259
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,390
Tianze.

260
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,870
Life in the frontier is tough,
unlike in the capital.

261
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,440
Take care of yourself.

262
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,480
Honey, let's go.

263
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,510
Chu Junyao.

264
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,270
Drop the act.

265
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Mother.

266
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,840
Honey, I bid you farewell.

267
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,630
Tianze.

268
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,080
I'll wait for your safe return, Tianze.

269
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,910
I'm leaving.

270
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,510
Such cold indifference!

271
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,200
What kind of nonsense princess?

272
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,720
What high-ranking officials?

273
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
Honey,

274
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,510
take care of renovating Ziteng's house.

275
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,000
I need to head to the tavern.

276
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Someone is following us.

277
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,160
Remember to get changed at the usual spot,

278
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,360
then go to the tavern.

279
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,780
Alright.

280
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,510
Have Su Qianqian and Chu Junyao
made any moves?

281
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,590
No.

282
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,270
Lately, they've been indulging in leisure.

283
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,440
Nothing unusual so far.

284
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Something's off.

285
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,680
Chu Junyao achieved success at a young age.

286
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,310
Su Qianqian carries a deep vendetta.

287
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,440
Neither of them would indulge in pleasure.

288
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,920
Something's off.

289
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
Increase the surveillance.

290
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,750
Understood.

291
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,350
By the way, Princess,

292
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,310
the guards in the manor have increased.

293
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,550
This is unfavorable for our recent plans.

294
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,750
It's all your fault.

295
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,920
You alerted the enemy.

296
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,750
It seems that obtaining the Tiger Tally now

297
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,880
is likely to fail.

298
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,320
Come in.

299
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,680
Princess, a letter from the marquis.

300
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,510
(Father plans to host
Yang tonight at the Light Tavern.)
