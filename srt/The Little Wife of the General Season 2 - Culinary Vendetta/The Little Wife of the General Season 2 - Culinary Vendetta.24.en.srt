00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Yu'er.

4
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,350
I think I was wrong.

5
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,430
Your Highness, why do you say that?

6
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,920
I thought if I was good enough,

7
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,670
he would care about me,

8
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,000
pay attention to me.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,560
But in his eyes,

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,710
there has only been one person.

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,040
He won't love anyone else.

12
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,710
I think

13
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,120
I understand true love now.

14
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't understand.

15
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,280
First Madam, regardless of status or looks,

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,590
is not as impressive as you.

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,790
Why does the general...

18
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,310
If

19
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,920
we had met earlier,

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
would it...

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
have a different ending.

22
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,420
(Late Mother, Yang Cuihua, R.I.P.)

23
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,270
Mother.

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm being unfilial.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
If I hadn't trusted Mingzhu like that,

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,430
you wouldn't have died.

27
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,590
I was wrong.

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,750
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,960
I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong...

30
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,270
That's not right.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
If there's someone to blame,
it must be Chu Junyao.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
He's fortunate.

33
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,910
He's become a general.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,910
He even married Princess Xiyao.

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,310
I am the eldest heir of the Chu Family.

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,520
All of this should have been mine.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
It was him.

38
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
It was him.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,870
It was him.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,520
He is the one who took everything from me.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm going to kill him.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,910
I'm going to kill him.

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,310
Honey.

44
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,080
I'm telling you, don't scare me.

45
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,520
If you scare me now,

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
it's probably the two of us.

47
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,740
(General Mansion)

48
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
General.

49
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,870
General.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,150
- Bad news!
- What is it?

51
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,800
Two madams have been kidnapped.

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,190
Chu Junyao, if you want them alive,

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,030
come alone.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,280
Junyao.

55
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,560
Junyao.

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,070
Brother.

57
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,560
Vent your anger on me.

58
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,360
Release them.

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,000
Chu Junyao.

60
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,920
Since childhood,

61
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,160
you're better than me at everything.

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,190
I've summarized it.

63
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,600
One word.

64
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,510
Unfair.

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm the Chu Family's eldest grandson.

66
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,510
The one in the spotlight

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,510
should be me.

68
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
What are you up to?

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't move.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,870
Don't do anything rash.

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
What did you give them to eat?

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,430
This isn't good.

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,070
I gave them Heartbreak Herb.

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,510
Within an hour,

75
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,920
if there's no antidote,

76
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,870
they'll die in agony.

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,310
Chu Tianze.

78
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,480
Relax.

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I didn't say
I wouldn't give you the antidote.

80
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,190
But there's only one pill.

81
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,800
How do you want to allocate it?

82
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,390
To give it to Su Qianqian.

83
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,800
Then the princess might die.

84
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,000
If the Princess dies,

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,120
His Majesty will definitely be angry.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,160
When His Majesty gets angry,

87
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,870
he will destroy the entire Chu Family.

88
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,480
Chu Tianze.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,270
You're disregarding our family's safety.

90
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,950
You are unworthy
of being one of the Chus.

91
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,390
Aren't you also a member
of the Chu Family?

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Have you looked after its safety?

93
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,630
If you give this antidote

94
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,680
to the princess,

95
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,240
this will only cost Su Qianqian's life.

96
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,070
It's better than
the whole Chu Family's downfall.

97
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,430
How do you choose?

98
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
It's up to you.

99
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,920
Give the antidote to the princess.

100
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,120
Save the Chu Family.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Junyao.

102
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,070
Give Qianqian the antidote.

103
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,950
Hand over the antidote.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There's only one antidote.

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,950
You want to kill me?

106
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,520
Go ahead.

107
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,790
Kill me.

108
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
Killing me won't work.

109
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Oh, by the way,

110
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,510
I forgot to tell you.

111
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,800
The longer the poison
stays in the body,

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,750
the more toxic it becomes.

113
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,480
Time is running out.

114
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Don't let both of them die then.

115
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,430
Junyao.

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,870
Save the princess.

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,390
Save Qianqian.

118
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,800
If I die,

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
I can reunite with my parents.

120
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
It's quite good.

121
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,790
I owe the Chus.

122
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,790
Just think...

123
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,390
of it as repaying your kindness.

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Junyao.

125
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,030
I've met you and loved you,

126
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,510
I have no regrets in this life.

127
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,720
Don't say silly things.

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,720
Don't push me.

129
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,150
I can't do it.

130
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Junyao,

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,320
there's no time left.

132
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,720
Junyao.

133
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Junyao.

134
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,790
Think about your mother.

135
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,000
She can only rely on you now.

136
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,960
Junyao.

137
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,790
Please save Qianqian.

138
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,240
Honey.

139
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,910
Let's die together.

141
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,600
I won't let you die.

142
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,120
If you die,

143
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,080
I'll hate you even as a ghost.

144
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,960
Silly girl.

145
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,790
If you are gone,

146
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,080
how can I survive alone?

147
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
Even if you hate me,

148
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,360
I'll still cling to you.

149
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,720
In the next life,

150
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,960
let me meet you again.

151
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,870
Is that okay?

152
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,000
Qianqian.

153
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,030
Qianqian.

154
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,200
Honey.

155
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,630
I'm here.

156
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,440
Junyao.

157
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,150
Qianqian is alive.

158
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,840
Check her pulse.

159
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
What's going on?

160
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,120
That's truly touching.

161
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,080
Actually, it's not a poison.

162
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,790
It's just an ordinary sedative.

163
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,600
As long as you use inner power to heal her.

164
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,030
She will recover.

165
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,840
Junyao.

166
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,870
He truly wanted to capture us
to target you.

168
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,480
He first captured Sister Su.

169
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,670
But when he tried to capture me,
he was captured instead.

170
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,000
Under interrogation,
I discovered his intentions.

171
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I was the one
who didn't believe in true love.

172
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,000
That's why I used Chu Tianze
to set this up.

173
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
But...

174
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,320
Now I believe.

175
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,790
I'll ask my father to grant us a divorce.

176
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,870
But if you want to satisfy him,

177
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,270
you must give up your military power.

178
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,840
Alright.

179
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,000
Chu Junyao.

180
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,390
You've won.

181
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
In my life,

182
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,320
no one has ever loved me so much.

183
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,910
Of course, I haven't loved anyone either.

184
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
(General Mansion)
We are friends.

185
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
No need to bring gifts.

186
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,870
- Wait, Junyao.
- Let's go.

187
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,720
Wait, wait, Junyao.

188
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
- Junyao, don't push me.
- Let's go.

189
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,750
- Junyao, don't push me.
- What's wrong?

190
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,000
I just feel like

191
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,840
a rabbit is breaking into

192
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,630
my heart,

193
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,840
bouncing around.

194
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,000
Why are you jumping around?

195
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,510
Do you want to be my dad?

196
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,440
Yes.

197
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,320
I dream of being your dad.

198
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,790
But I'm a general.

199
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,550
What if your mother says no?

200
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,870
My old face...

201
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,870
My mother isn't more important

202
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,030
than your face, huh?

203
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,600
Then you go back.

204
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,510
- Hey, no.
- Go back.

205
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,350
No, no.

206
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,870
By heaven's sake,

207
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,550
your mother is like a goddess

208
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,790
in my heart.

209
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,080
Many pretty women pursue me.

210
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,270
I turned them all down.

211
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,870
I am very committed to your mother.

212
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,710
Hmm.

213
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,270
My mother may look down on you.

214
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,000
She doesn't like cowards.

215
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,840
Coward? Are you saying I'm a coward?

216
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,840
Facing a massive enemy army,

217
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,200
I didn't even think about retreat.

218
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
Do you think your Chu Family
is more dangerous?

219
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,080
I must make a move today.

220
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,000
For my future happiness,

221
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,830
I'll just leave my face behind.

222
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,640
Is Madam at home?

223
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,240
Madam.

224
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,200
It's born! It's born!

225
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,920
Madam, she has given birth.

226
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,400
Madam, she has given birth.

227
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,070
- Madam has given birth?
- What?

228
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,400
Wouldn't the general become a brother then?

229
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,200
That's just nonsense, no sense.

230
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Who gave birth?

231
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,590
Hurry, hurry, let's go.

232
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,310
Madam, Young Madam has given birth.

233
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Really?

234
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,160
I heard there are two boys and two girls.

235
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,350
Oh, that's wonderful.

236
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,200
Quick, let's go and see!

237
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,440
- Please slow down.
- That's great!

238
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,270
- Oh, come here, let me see.
- So cute!

239
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,680
- Hurry, show me.
- So adorable.

240
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,430
Mother, look.

241
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,720
Don't they look like their mother?

242
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,190
What?

243
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Are you out of your mind?

244
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,200
You never make things clear.

245
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,350
This...

246
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,030
Looks like the messenger got mixed up.

247
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,910
Mother.

248
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,750
Oh, Qianqian.

249
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,510
You're pregnant.

250
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,790
Why are you walking back and forth?

251
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,720
This could lead to a premature birth.

252
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,510
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, Mother.

253
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,000
I can take care of myself.

254
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,830
That's so good, so good.

255
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,110
- My stomach hurts.
- Here.

256
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,600
Are you okay?

257
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,830
- My stomach hurts.
- My lady.

258
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,440
- Hey, hold on.
- Let's go!

259
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,590
Quick, fetch a midwife.

260
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,000
Run! Run faster!

261
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,160
- Come here.
- My lady.

262
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,550
- Are you okay?
- Slow down.

263
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,480
- Help out.
- Help her.

264
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,320
- Here.
- Slow down.

265
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,590
- Quickly.
- Be careful.

266
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,720
What a good sign.

267
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,200
What a good sign!
