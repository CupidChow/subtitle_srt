2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,870
(Divorce Letter)
I want a divorce with Tianze.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,510
From today onward

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,790
I have no further ties with the Chu Family.

6
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,870
Master.

7
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,270
Master Chu.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,880
Well, I...

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,110
I plan to marry Juan.

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,240
I've also picked an auspicious day
for the wedding.

11
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,920
If you have time,

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,280
you can come and...

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
witness our wedding.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,480
Of course.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm your officiant.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,920
Ziteng and Juan are married,
what about us?

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,070
I... I don't have the money
for that right now.

18
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,640
The general took all my money.

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,590
But I have money.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,760
I have some private savings.

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,950
Why don't I marry you instead?

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,280
Matrilocal husband?

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,070
No way.

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,760
I would have a tough life.

25
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,240
Use my money.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,710
I can save up a little more.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,920
Why wait for a perfect day?

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,590
Let's get married today.

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's do it together.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,280
Then there's no need to

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
give each other cash as wedding gifts.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
My lady...

33
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,680
- Ziteng.
- Juan.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,470
- Ziteng.
- Juan.

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,550
Ziteng...

36
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,470
Ziteng...

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,560
My lady.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
General,

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
it's a standard weapon.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,590
It should be the military's doing.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
Juan.

42
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,990
Ziteng.

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,710
Ziteng...

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,470
Get up quickly!

45
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,400
I still have unique techniques to teach you.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,910
Juan.

47
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
Ziteng.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,030
Junyao.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm the one who got you all into this.

50
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,840
It's all my fault...

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,040
What's going on?

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,510
How did the happy event turn into a funeral?

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,070
I was just passing by.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,390
I was even planning to bring a gift.

55
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,560
You, murderer!

56
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
Murderer!

57
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,480
Murderer!

58
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,000
Why call me a murderer?

59
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,870
Don't slander me.

60
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,000
Why accuse me again?

61
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,480
Why are you staring at me?

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,830
Do you think glaring at me will save them?

63
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,040
You're not welcome here. Please leave.

64
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,040
Since I've come,
I should present my gift.

65
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,720
General, are we not ready to act yet?

66
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,360
Acting now can indeed take down the Nings.

67
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
But some factions remain unexposed.

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,830
We're waiting for the right moment,

69
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,220
when they can no longer
conceal their ambitions.

70
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,790
Father.

71
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,430
Everything is set.

72
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,510
Just give the word.

73
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,270
We can usurp the throne,

74
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,310
and shift the regime.

75
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,120
Chu Junyao is highly skilled at fighting.

76
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,830
He holds military power.

77
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,830
He's an outlier.

78
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,390
I'll arrange to
transfer him from the capital.

79
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,190
This is indeed a solution.

80
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,680
I'll draft the letter now.

81
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,830
Let the neighboring country act like

82
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,630
they intend to attack our nation.

83
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,830
When the time comes,

84
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,270
the emperor will surely send him
to oversee.

85
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,750
Father, this plan is brilliant.

86
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,240
Also, Lei Yue

87
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,480
is dedicated to the Chu Family,

88
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,950
and has strong ties with Qin.

89
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,870
We'll eliminate them both
when the time comes.

90
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,560
Father, rest assured.

91
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
Leave the Chu Family to me.

92
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,190
I will ensure all of them are wiped out.

93
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Alright.

94
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,480
Once Chu Junyao is reassigned,

95
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,560
we'll strike.

96
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,500
(General Mansion)

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Grand General Chu Junyao
receives the decree.

98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,270
I acknowledge the decree.

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,240
From Heaven's blessings,

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,950
at the behest of His Majesty:

101
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,000
I've heard from the borderlands

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,430
that the bandits repeatedly attack.

103
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,920
They disturb our people.

104
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
They disrupt our territories.

105
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,720
I hereby order
Grand General Chu Junyao to go there,

106
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,200
defend against enemies,

107
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,030
and ensure the safety and peace

108
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,510
of our country.

109
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,910
May Heaven bless our nation
with peace and prosperity.

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
The end.

111
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,750
I, Chu Junyao, have received the order.

112
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
General Chu.

113
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,320
His Majesty orders you to leave now.

114
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,510
No room for any delay.

115
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,510
Understood.

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Uncle.

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,600
I entrust the Chu Family to you.

118
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,840
Just focus on defending the realm.

119
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,840
Leave the Chu Family to me.

120
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,480
Madame, something happened.

121
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,030
Why so panicked?

122
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,550
News from the Lei Mansion.

123
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,670
General Lei died of poison.

124
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,240
Kneel and beg.

125
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,750
I'll have you die in one piece.

126
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,840
How reckless!

127
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,870
How dare you be so arrogant!

128
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,440
We, the Chus,

129
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,550
only know how to fight til the end.

130
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,910
We won't surrender.

131
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,550
Today, I'll tear you apart

132
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,150
to avenge Cuihua.

133
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,200
Uncle, calm down.

134
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,150
Although I have evidence

135
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
to prove you framed the whole Su Family.

136
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,320
But I still want to ask in person.

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,120
Is it only to marry Chu Tianze

138
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,510
that you plotted to kill my entire family?

139
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,630
"Marry Chu Tianze"?

140
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,360
Do you really think
Chu Tianze is worth it?

141
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,200
You!

142
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,270
Su Qianqian, don't you understand yet?

143
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,240
Your Su Family and the Chu Family

144
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,200
are obstacles to my Ning Family's rise.

145
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,200
You are destined to be wiped out.

146
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,030
I just used a little scheme

147
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,840
to crush your group of ants.

148
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,910
Your enemy is right in front of you.

149
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,080
So what can you do?

150
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,630
You beast.

151
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
Ning Mingzhu, you're really awful!

152
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,910
You truly deserve harsh punishment.

153
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Alright.

154
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,790
Then I'll punish all of you.

155
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
Guards!

156
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,160
Eliminate them.

157
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,510
Everybody, stop it now.

158
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,790
Screw you.

159
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,240
I'm here.

160
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,390
Who dares to move!

161
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,670
Lei Yue, you're still alive.

162
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I did die, though.

163
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,030
But Lord Yama didn't take me.

164
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,550
And he sent me back.

165
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,840
So you're disappointed, huh?

166
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,790
Let's see who dares to move.

167
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,480
Put down your sword now.

168
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,960
Otherwise,

169
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,030
I'll chop your heads

170
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,910
like slicing watermelons.

171
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,600
Do you think you'll win like this?

172
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,200
My father has stormed the palace
to seize power.

173
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,000
If you don't surrender now, you'll die.

174
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,960
Go on, live in your daydream fantasy.

175
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,270
Junyao has set up a trap in the palace,

176
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,550
waiting for you rebels to make your move.

177
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,080
Your father is dead now.

178
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,240
No way. Impossible.

179
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,550
Old man, you're definitely lying to me.

180
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,510
I can't possibly lose.

181
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm not lying to you.

182
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,840
I never lie.

183
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,080
Take them away.

184
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,240
Yes, take them away.

185
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
Move.

186
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,110
Go.

187
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
Hurry up and move.

188
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Madam, I'm late.

189
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,320
You aren't hurt, right?

190
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,480
You always act so superior,

191
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,590
and have no respect for others.

192
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,750
You're so arrogant.

193
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,480
You treat lives as meaningless.

194
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,600
Now you're about to become a prisoner.

195
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,510
You're worse than the "ants"
you talk about.

196
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,200
You'll live forever in a dark dungeon.

197
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
No.

198
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,440
You won't even have the right to live.

199
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,710
You are despicable.

200
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,550
Even if I must die,

201
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,550
go to hell with me.

202
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,790
Young Madam!
