=Episode 22=

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,390
My lady, help me!

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,120
Yingying!

5
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,220
(Su Qianqian, I love you.)

6
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,260
(Su Qianqian, I love you.)

7
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,700
(Su Qianqian, I love you.)

8
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,070
I, Chu Junyao,

9
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,560
swear that

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,870
in this lifetime,

11
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,510
I only love Su Qianqian.

12
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,040
If I break this vow.

13
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,150
I'll face retribution.

14
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Qianqian.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
I didn't fully

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,150
understand you until now.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
I didn't do enough before.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,710
From now on,

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,710
I will love you even more.

21
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,710
I was too greedy.

22
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,750
I've already lost so much in my life.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm so scared of losing you.

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,750
But I believe God always watches over me.

25
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,870
That's why I still have you in this world.

26
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,310
You won't lose me.

27
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,430
Do you remember when I was surrounded

28
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
at North Mountain?

29
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,520
It was almost a dead end.

30
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,120
But if I'm gone,

31
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
who will protect you then?

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,360
At the thought of it,

33
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
I gave it my all to fight

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,750
for being by your side.

35
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,430
So you see,

36
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,630
it's me.

37
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,870
I need you more.

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,870
Qianqian.

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,870
I love you.

40
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,240
Uncle Lei, you can't drink.

41
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
No way, you.

42
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,750
You've got married again.

43
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,510
Enjoying all the good things.

44
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,430
I really envy you.

45
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,160
This isn't anyone's blessing.

46
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,510
You wouldn't understand.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,870
Uncle Let.

48
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,430
You've never married.

49
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,380
I have never married.

50
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,240
How could you not know?

51
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,430
That's right.

52
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,190
At least you have no worries.

53
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,070
Stop pretending with me.

54
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,160
I like your mother, didn't you know?

55
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,160
You just admitted it.

56
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,680
I consider you a brother.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
You actually want to be my father?

58
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,270
Junyao, my feelings for her are genuine.

59
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,070
You want to, but you're not brave enough.

60
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,070
You're a grown man.

61
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,830
If you like her, go pursue her.

62
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,240
You've had too much to drink.

63
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,240
Talking all this nonsense.

64
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
It's so late, why not go back to bed?

65
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,750
Oh, I told you to keep it down.

66
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,870
Oh, my goodness!

67
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,110
Where do I put my face?

68
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
You, you...

69
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,750
Drinking too much and babbling nonsense.

70
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,680
Still not going back to bed?

71
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,240
Which room am I heading back to?

72
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,000
Whatever you like.

73
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,510
Stop drinking.

74
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,270
It's so late already.

75
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,040
Why isn't the general here yet?

76
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,270
Yes, this must be reported to His Majesty.

77
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Perhaps there are too many guests.

78
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,830
Yu'er, go prepare some tea

79
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,630
to help Junyao sober up.

80
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,920
Yes, Your Highness.

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Dezi, you can rest for a while.

82
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes.

83
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,360
It's midnight now.

84
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,360
Why are you still staying here?

85
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm just staying here.

86
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,680
Don't keep Princess Xiyao waiting.

87
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
She has performed the ceremony with you.

88
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,310
You didn't lift the veil.

89
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
What does that mean?

90
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,750
After lifting the veil, I'll come back.

91
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,920
General.

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
You're finished this time.

93
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,870
If you leave after lifting the veil,

94
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
you're a heartless man.

95
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,000
If you don't return,

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,510
you're still a heartless man.

97
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,030
One wife might be a trouble.

98
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,320
And two wives... bring greater trouble!

99
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,470
Shut up.

100
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,600
Alright, go find her first.

101
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,030
Honey.

102
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,320
Your Highness.

103
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
Why are you saying this?

105
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,480
You know about

106
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,320
my situation.

107
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
As a woman,

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
I have to get married eventually.

109
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,480
If that's the case,

110
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,870
there's no avoiding feeling wronged.

111
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Moreover,

112
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,550
the Chu Family can nurture
good men like you.

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,670
Marrying into such a family,

114
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,600
how can I say it's a hardship?

115
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,600
Right?

116
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,030
When you say it like that,

117
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
I feel even more guilty.

118
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,240
This must be my fate.

119
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,240
Your Highness,

120
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,540
it's late at night.

121
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,440
You should get some rest.

122
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,120
Could you stay?

123
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,440
Just for tonight.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,790
If word gets out that you're not with me

125
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,360
on our wedding night,

126
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,120
it could become a joke in the capital.

127
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,790
I know this is tough for you.

128
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,120
Let's just have a chat.

129
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,840
Alright?

130
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
Alright.

131
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,390
But I have a request.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,390
I hope you can agree.

133
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,120
As long as you stay.

134
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,030
I agree to anything.

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,030
My lady, are you sure
you don't want me to stay?

136
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,000
You haven't slept until now.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,550
Are you waiting for the groom?

138
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,510
Why am I waiting for him?

139
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,440
He should stay
in the princess's room tonight.

140
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,790
Or it would disgrace the princess

141
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,960
and His Majesty if it spreads out.

142
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,390
He should be aware

143
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,270
of what to do.

144
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,960
Then why aren't you angry?

145
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,150
Are you here
just to let me vent my anger?

146
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Ah, I'm suddenly feeling sleepy.

147
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
My lady, I'm going to sleep.

148
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,270
Changsheng.

149
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,790
Take good care of my lady.

150
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,110
Who?

151
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm Yu'er, Princess Xiyao's personal maid.

152
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,960
Is First Madam here?

153
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,360
Grand General is spitting blood
and passed out.

154
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,390
Tonight...

155
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,600
It's definitely not going to be peaceful.

156
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,630
- Madam.
- What?

157
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,080
Young Madam has hurried
to the princess's room.

158
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,910
They won't be starting a war now, right?

159
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,320
Hurry, hurry!

160
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,550
Go keep watch now.

161
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,480
If anything comes up,
let me know right away.

162
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,910
- Remember,
- Yes.

163
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,910
keep it quiet.

164
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
Hurry, hurry, go now.

165
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,030
Junyao, you...

166
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,270
Aren't you...

167
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
If I didn't

168
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
use that as an excuse,

169
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,790
you wouldn't come, right?

170
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,790
Sister, don't be angry.

171
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,030
That was my idea too.

172
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

173
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,320
No need to be so formal.

174
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,030
We're under the same roof.

175
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,750
We'll be family from now on.

176
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,720
You married Junyao first.

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,790
So I call you "Sister".

178
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,000
It's so late, yet you called me here.

179
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,320
Is something up?

180
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,510
I didn't know Junyao and you
had such a close bond.

181
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,390
I didn't want him to stay here.

182
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,960
But for the sake of reputation,

183
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,630
I had to insist he stay.

184
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,960
But he is worried

185
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,750
that you might misunderstand,

186
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,320
so I called you to witness.

187
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,910
Princess, no need to bother.

188
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,960
What's there to witness?

189
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,600
After the ceremony, you're lawfully married.

190
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,920
You'll be together.

191
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,000
Nobody can interfere.

192
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,320
It's late.

193
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,870
I won't disturb you further.

194
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,240
If you leave, I'll leave too.

195
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,150
You know I'm helpless.

196
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,270
You are.

197
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,800
Let it go.

198
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,910
Sister, please stay.

199
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,200
We talk late into the night.

200
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,360
Such a complex situation.

201
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,960
Why can't I get it?

202
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,240
Why do I feel

203
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,870
that this princess is quite nice.

204
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,390
Looks like they won't fight.

205
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,750
Hmm.

206
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
Sister.

207
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,390
Actually, my views on love
are the same as yours.

208
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,630
"We're each other's one and only."

209
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,200
Too bad things don't always go as we hope.

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
The fact that I married in
can't be changed.
