00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,140
=Culinary Vendetta=

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,060
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,190
(My father is an imperial censor,)

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,000
(overseeing all officials.)

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,800
(He's always incredibly busy,)

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,440
(often nowhere to be seen.)

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,350
(Today is Winter Solstice.)

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,520
(Su Qianqian)
(A chance for the family to dine together.)

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,240
(I want to prepare the meal in person.)

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,700
(Yingying, maid)
Bad news, my lady.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,640
Soldiers have surrounded the mansion.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,310
They accused the lord of treason,

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,040
all male members of our family beheaded,

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,480
and women exiled to Border City.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,430
Move faster!

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,430
Hurry up!

17
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,040
- Faster!
- Hurry up!

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
Mother!

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,520
Sister!

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,160
We are paid

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,640
to destroy the Su Family entirely.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
This place is desolate,

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,510
perfect for burying bodies.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,520
Qianqian!

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,840
Aunt!

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,200
Qianqian.

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,150
Qianqian, run quickly!

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,070
Mother.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,790
Qianqian, run quickly.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,000
Hurry, leave now!

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,520
Mother!

32
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,170
The Su Family

33
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,190
must never bear the shame of treason.

34
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,630
We cannot carry such a disgrace for eternity.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
Mother!

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Go to the General Mansion
to see Madam Chu.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,590
- Mother.
- Hurry.

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,360
I know you have someone you care about,

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,520
so I didn't tell you
about the marriage arrangement

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,680
between you and the general's family.

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,430
You must marry into the general's family,

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,910
and clear the Su Family's name.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
Mother,

44
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,080
I promise you.

45
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,150
My good girl.

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,470
Qianqian.

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,000
Mother!

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,680
(That Censor Su doesn't know his place.)

49
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,750
(He's been submitting memos
against Ning'an Marquis.)

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,840
(With a small trick,
I can destroy his whole family.)

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,230
(Princess Mingzhu, Ning Mansion)

52
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,800
(Once this obstacle is removed.)

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,630
(Next, it will be the General Mansion.)

54
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:39,140
(General Mansion)

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,560
I, Su Qianqian, daughter of the former
Imperial Censor Su Yuanshan,

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,240
requests to see Madam Chu.

57
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,680
Indeed, this Marriage Contract
was written by Lord Heng.

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,750
It states that the first grandson
of the Chu Family shall marry you.

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,710
(Second Madam, General Mansion)
No, Madam Chu.

60
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,120
The Su Family has betrayed the country.

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,740
Su Qianqian is the daughter of a traitor.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,870
How is she qualified
to marry into our family?

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
Guards!

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,070
Arrest the daughter of the traitor!

65
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,910
Stand down.

66
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,950
Madam Chu has spoken.

67
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,190
(First Madam, General Mansion)
Our Chu Family will honor this marriage.

68
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,190
For what reason?

69
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,600
The Chu Family's first grandson
is my son, Chu Tianze,

70
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,190
not your Chu Junyao.

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,070
If she enters our family,

72
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,240
Tianze's future career will be ruined,

73
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,600
and it will harm our entire family.

74
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,000
If I do not approve of this marriage,

75
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,950
what will you do?

76
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,190
If that's the case,

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,360
I'll have to shed blood in the Chu Family,

78
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,510
and become a departed soul
of the Chu Family

79
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,240
to fulfill my grandfather's wish.

80
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,360
Alright.

81
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,040
Then I will give you this chance.

82
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,870
Lord Heng.

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,750
Lord Heng loved the dishes
your grandfather made.

84
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,000
Now, he is nearing the end of his days.

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,950
He hasn't eaten for several days.

86
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,950
If you can restore his appetite,

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,800
I will petition Your Majesty
for your pardon,

88
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,750
and allow you to marry into the Chu Family.

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,720
Su Qianqian, think carefully about this.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,950
If you fail to restore
Lord Heng's appetite,

91
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,160
we'll have to turn you in.

92
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,510
I'm willing to assist Madam Chu.

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,830
(Only chicken soup? Ridiculous.)

94
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Take a look.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,190
(My grandfather, Su Xinghe,)

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,920
(was renowned for his Boiled Cabbage Soup.)

97
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,390
(It's fragrant and light,
perfect for Lord Heng.)

98
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,510
Honey, time to eat.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
Come on.

100
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,600
Someone, come quickly!

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
Arrest Su Qianqian immediately.

102
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,880
Yes.

103
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,230
Honey.

104
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,150
This...

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,920
See? What did I tell you?

106
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,360
Su Qianqian.

107
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,750
How dare you offend Lord Heng!

108
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,830
Take her away. Punish her severely.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Move.

110
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,830
See? I was right, wasn't I?

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Seeking attention.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,480
You, a lowly nobody,
like a featherless hen,

113
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,950
wish to marry into the Chu Family?

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Pretending to be some divine chef,

115
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,630
have you even weighed your own worth?

116
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,870
(Mother, I was useless.)

117
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,560
(I couldn't clear the Su Family's name.)

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Stop!

119
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,870
Sister-in-law, are you shielding her?

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,390
Lord Heng finally ate something.

121
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,360
What? Impossible.

122
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,950
Her credit? I don't believe it.

123
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,160
Eat...

124
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,830
I want to have Xinghe's dishes.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,430
Let go quickly.

126
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
You...

127
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,440
Qianqian.

128
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Madam Chu has promised you

129
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,120
to stand up for you,

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,790
and marry you into the Chu Family.

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,960
(The one who framed the Su Family)

132
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,320
(must have immense power.)

133
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,960
(I must rely on the power
of the General Mansion)

134
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,910
(to gather solid proof
of the Sus' innocence.)

135
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,440
(I need to establish myself here)

136
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,080
(and build my own strength.)

137
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,670
(Junyao, I'm sorry.)

138
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,550
(The old Su Qianqian is already gone.)

139
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,120
Congratulations, General Chu.

140
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,150
Grand General Chu Junyao
has returned victorious.

141
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,910
I can finally meet him I long for.

142
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,300
(Grand General Chu Junyao)
This is Chu Junyao.

143
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,840
So powerful and brave!

144
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,960
Stop daydreaming.

145
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,740
(Seal by Jingzhao Prefecture)

146
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,900
(Su Mansion)

147
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,110
General,

148
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,510
I just found out Miss Su was exiled.

149
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,510
Since when?

150
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,510
Which town in Border City?

151
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,750
It's been three days,
and it's Hanshan Town.

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,200
(Qianqian, you must wait for me.)

153
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,200
So, Su Qianqian is actually alive,

154
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,030
and even entered the Chu Family.

155
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,510
Madam Chu plans to
enter the palace in 3 days

156
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,360
to request an Imperial Edict for marriage.

157
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,700
(Chu Tianze, General Mansion)
If that edict is issued,

158
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,320
I will have to marry Su Qianqian.

159
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
What should I do then?

160
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,030
I have a plan

161
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,840
to ruin her reputation.

162
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,790
She won't have a place
for a proper burial.

163
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Please come in.

164
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,200
Miss Su, the meal is ready.

165
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,910
Thank you.

166
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
Miss Su, enjoy your meal.

167
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll take my leave.

168
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,280
Thank you.

169
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,630
Beauty.

170
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,050
Come here.

171
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,910
Little beauty.
