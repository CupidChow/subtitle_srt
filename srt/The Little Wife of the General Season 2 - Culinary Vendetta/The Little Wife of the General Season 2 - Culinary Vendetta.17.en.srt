2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,920
You... you...

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
Take it back.

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,470
Stop fooling around.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,520
Take it back, stop.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,750
Stop it.

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,750
Wicked woman!

9
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,710
I curse you to always have to pee!

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Wait until I get better,
I'll deal with you.

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,070
We're in trouble.

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,380
First Madam has arrived.

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
Wicked woman!

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,310
Master, Master.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,480
Ziteng.

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,070
Lord Wang.

17
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,870
The Light Tarven is owned
by the Chu Family.

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,760
He's one of my people as well.

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,280
How dare you use such harsh torture methods.

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,790
Master.

21
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,590
I can't feel my arm.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,280
I think that wicked woman
severed the nerve.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Ziteng.

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,040
You must explain this today.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,870
Otherwise, I'll seek justice
from His Majesty.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,560
Don't worry, Madam.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,470
I'll definitely investigate it.

28
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,470
Guards!

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
Arrest everyone involved.

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,400
Yes.

31
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,710
Ziteng, don't worry.

32
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,240
I'll definitely fight for your justice.

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Master.

34
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,080
That vicious princess.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
She crippled one of my hands.

36
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,630
When I recover,

37
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,310
I'll disable both of her hands.

38
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,840
Take good care of your injuries.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,630
Leave the rest to us.

40
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,560
When you've healed,

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,150
I'll arrange your wedding with Xiaojuan.

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,870
Thank you, Master.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,520
Juan, you've worked hard
caring for me these days.

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,000
Honey, they're already on high alert.

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,280
We must take swift action to control,

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
interrogate them and gather evidence.

47
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,460
(Roster; Record Book)

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,470
This is a big deal.

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,780
Many people are involved.

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,630
I need to inform His Majesty.

51
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Without further ado,

52
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,080
I'll see him at once.

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
First Madam is really something,

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,960
bringing down the Vice Minister
who's in favor of us.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,750
Princess, how about

56
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,680
resorting to drastic action?

57
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,030
Alright.

58
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,240
Since we're going to kill,

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,630
we might as well kill more.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,710
It's better to wipe out the Chus.

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Yue'e.

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
You...

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,750
You, scoundrel!

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
How dare you!

65
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,590
You really want to destroy my Chu Family.

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
What was your real intent
on marrying Tianze?

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,870
Mother-in-law.

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,190
You must have misheard earlier.

69
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,000
How could I harm my own family?

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you think I'm a fool?

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,190
You've done so many despicable things.

72
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,070
I won't stoop to your level.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,830
But you're trying to shake
the Chus' foundation.

74
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,390
I absolutely won't allow it.

75
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,270
Princess Mingzhu.

76
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,560
I'll keep a close watch on you.

77
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,870
You are a scoundrel!

78
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,680
You won't get away with it!

79
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,830
No one has dared to
insult me all my life.

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,560
You old grinch.

81
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,950
You deserve this.

82
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,350
Princess.

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
This corpse...

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
How should we handle this?

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,120
The Chus will soon find her gone.

86
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
The gatekeeper didn't see her leave.

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,390
They will likely search
the mansion thoroughly.

88
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,270
We might not be able to hide any longer.

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,680
There's a bigger issue.

90
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,310
We still can't leave the General Mansion.

91
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,360
Mince her.

92
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,800
How's the meeting?

93
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,720
His Majesty is furious.

94
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,950
He ordered me
to secretly investigate the Nings.

95
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,360
That's great.

96
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,720
The day to clear the Sus' name is near.

97
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,720
Don't worry, honey.

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,510
Nobody who harms the Su Family will get away.

99
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,920
(Master Chu Yunfei, R.I.P.)
Yunfei, it's been twenty years.

100
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,070
Our child is also married now.

101
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,560
But I don't know why.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm getting...

103
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,310
more tired...

104
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,600
(Master Chu Yunfei, R.I.P.)

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,390
I just wanted to stay home, support Junyao,

106
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,070
and live an ordinary life.

107
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,510
But I didn't expect

108
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,310
that I'd become
the head of the Chu Family.

109
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,430
I'm passively involved

110
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,040
in the vortex of power struggles.

111
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:12,040
But our child has grown up.

112
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,600
The tallest tree in the forest

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,430
is sure to be blown down.

114
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,830
Yunfei.

115
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
Pray with me

116
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,600
for the safety

117
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,480
of our child.

118
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,140
Yunfei.

119
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,150
Let's see

120
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:58,910
how he grows into... a towering tree.

121
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
First Madam.

122
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,870
Yes?

123
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,720
Second Madam is missing.

124
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,240
Erya said when she delivered meals,

125
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,360
there's no one in the room.

126
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,030
I've made inquiries about it.

127
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,120
The gatekeeper said
Second Madam hadn't left.

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,510
I've sent several groups to search.

129
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,440
They didn't find her.

130
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,870
Have you asked

131
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,670
Second Master about it?

132
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,000
He hasn't returned yet.

133
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
Chuntao.

134
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,320
Have Butler Yan increase the guards.

135
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,440
Meanwhile, search the mansion.

136
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,910
You must find Second Madam for me.

137
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,910
If she's alive, I want to see her.

138
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,170
If she's dead,

139
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,870
I want to see the body.

140
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,120
Yes.

141
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Come in.

142
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,030
Princess, Second Madam has gone missing.

143
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,170
I'm here for the search.

144
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,550
Go ahead.

145
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,960
Sorry to disturb you.

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,270
Thank you for your hard work.

147
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,480
Even if they're digging deep,

148
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,030
they won't find anything they want.

149
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,630
Madam.

150
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,960
Where else are you going?

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,790
Father-in-law, any news
about my mother-in-law?

152
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,390
Mingzhu, since when does your relationship

153
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,240
get so good?

154
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
Father-in-law, you're joking.

155
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,960
I've always respected her.

156
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,200
She suddenly disappeared.

157
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm very sad about it.

158
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,390
Tianze is in a distant cold place.

159
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
If he knew his mother had an accident,

160
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,840
he would be heartbroken.

161
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,360
I didn't care for my mother-in-law well.

162
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,030
I truly feel deep guilt.

163
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
Your mother-in-law seems strict.

164
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,910
But she's actually timid.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,320
She usually stays home.

166
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,240
Then, does she have enemies?

167
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,750
How could she have enemies?

168
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,480
She and the first branch never get along.

169
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,840
Especially after Su Qianqian arrived.

170
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,630
The tensions grew even worse.

171
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,270
Previously, Tianze was reassigned.

172
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,910
Mother-in-law suspected it was their doing.

173
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,000
Now, Tianze has just left.

174
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,870
Mother-in-law has disappeared.

175
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,000
My poor mother-in-law.

176
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,200
Junyao.

177
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,120
Your aunt still hasn't been found.

178
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,910
It may not end well.

179
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,270
She just vanished from the mansion.

180
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,320
Clearly, the culprit is very meticulous.

181
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,120
Zi Xuan, dispatch troops to help.

182
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,440
Increase guards in the mansion.

183
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
Post guards every ten steps

184
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,240
on round-the-clock shifts.

185
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
Yes.

186
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,280
Mother.

187
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,590
Junyao.

188
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,080
I suspect it might be her.

189
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,270
Su Qianqian, you are dead!

190
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,710
Uncle.

191
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,680
What are you doing?

192
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,790
She deserves to die.

193
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,710
Stop it.

194
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,870
Sister-in-law.

195
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Tell me.

196
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,240
Did you kill my wife?

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
At the General Mansion,

198
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,000
only you guys can make people

199
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,390
disappear without a trace.

200
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,720
Second Master.

201
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
You're being foolish.

202
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,120
If I want to harm her,

203
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,600
she would've been dead long ago.

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Yes.

205
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,600
Maybe you didn't.

206
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,510
But now,

207
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,720
you must be influenced by her.

208
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,200
Ever since she arrived,
she's been clashing with my wife.

209
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,790
Uncle, you got me wrong.

210
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,200
I've never disrespected Aunt.

211
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,910
All this time,

212
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,630
she's always targeted me.

213
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,510
And I only fought back appropriately.

214
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
I never intended to kill her.

215
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Today, in front of everyone,

216
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,150
I, Su Qianqian, swear by the Su Family.

217
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,630
If this was done by me,

218
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,270
then let the Su Family lineage end here.

219
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,550
Yang Cuihua may be stubborn by nature,

220
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,320
but she is not utterly irredeemable.

221
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,960
Second Master, don't worry.

222
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,840
We Chu Family won't turn against each other.

223
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,470
Uncle.

224
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,480
I will uncover the truth.

225
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,840
I'll give you an answer.

226
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,840
Sister-in-law.

227
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,910
I hope

228
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,840
you make the Chu Family your priority.

229
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,670
Go ahead.

230
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,200
Mother.

231
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,070
Since there's no trace,

232
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,270
we can get hound dogs
from the authorities.

233
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
Chuntao, go get a hound dog.

234
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,870
Yes.
