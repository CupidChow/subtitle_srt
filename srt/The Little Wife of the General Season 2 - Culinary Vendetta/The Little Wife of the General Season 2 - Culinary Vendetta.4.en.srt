00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,700
Listen,

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,110
a new gambling market just opened.

5
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,290
Let's go try our luck.

6
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,280
Cut off her limbs,

7
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,640
and turn her into a human stump.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Yes.

9
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,680
Qianqian.

10
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,200
Qianqian.

11
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,310
Qianqian.

12
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,470
Qianqian.

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,030
Let's go home.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,710
I'll take you home.

15
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,360
I'll take you home.

16
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,150
General.

17
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,840
Kill them all.

18
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,150
Kill them.

19
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,680
(I, Chu Junyao, swear to the heavens)

20
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
(in this life and the next,)

21
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,960
(I will never let you get hurt again.)

22
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,120
(Anyone who dares to harm you,)

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,520
(I will make them
pay back a hundredfold.)

24
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,630
(If I break this vow,)

25
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,430
(may the earth's doom fall upon me.)

26
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,150
Young Master,
Central Secretariat has drafted

27
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
the edict for the marriage

28
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,800
of Second Young Master and Princess Xiyao.

29
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,960
It will be officially announced soon.

30
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,710
What makes Chu Junyao
worthy of this honor?

31
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,950
His Majesty has married Princess Xiyao
to him.

32
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,870
If this marriage really happens,

33
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,390
the position
of the Chu Family head will be his.

34
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,720
What do you think I should do?

35
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,510
Young Master, I do not know.

36
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,560
Fool!

37
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
Find someone to kill him.

38
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,230
Young Master.

39
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,920
Second Young Master is skilled in combat,

40
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,510
and his personal guards are formidable.

41
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,190
This assassination plan won't work.

42
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,870
There are countless ways to kill someone,

43
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,920
yet you insist on
using the most foolish one.

44
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,680
Young Master, I will find another way.

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
Get lost.

46
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,630
Yes, I will take my leave.

47
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,430
Chu Junyao!

48
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,600
If one day
you come to Su Mansion to propose,

49
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,870
offering Changsheng
as your betrothal gift will suffice.

50
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,270
You've never asked about my identity.

51
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,310
Aren't you afraid I'm from a poor family?

52
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,640
Fine then.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Junyao, the humble-born,

54
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,680
listen carefully to me.

55
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,110
If you ever dare betray me,

56
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,440
I will never let it...

57
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,960
Who gave you permission?

58
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Changsheng, bite him now!

59
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
Bite him!

60
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,230
Qianqian.

61
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,360
- Qianqian.
- Don't touch me!

62
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
Qianqian.

63
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,510
It's me, it's me.

64
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,200
I am Junyao.

65
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,270
I am Junyao, Qianqian.

66
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
I am your Junyao.

67
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,190
Junyao.

68
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
It's me.

69
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Junyao.

70
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,360
It's you.

71
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,120
Yes.

72
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
It's me.

73
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,510
Junyao.

74
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,120
You are...

75
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,920
the Grand General.

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,070
The general from the Chu Family,

77
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,040
Chu Junyao.

78
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,070
I am Chu Junyao from the General Mansion.

79
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,040
You never cared about my true identity.

80
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
So, I never had the chance to tell you.

81
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
After learning about your troubles,

82
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,070
I searched for you everywhere,

83
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,000
but every time, fate played tricks on me.

84
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,720
I was always a step behind.

85
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,560
Fortunately, the heavens showed mercy,

86
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,040
and finally led me to you.

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
Junyao,

88
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,070
the Su Family never betrayed the nation.

89
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,040
I know.

90
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,160
I know.

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I will investigate

92
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,680
the Su Family's matter,

93
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,390
and give the Su Family justice.

94
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,720
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

95
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,590
General.

96
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,150
The ones who kidnapped Miss Su

97
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,440
may be from
Ning Mansion.

98
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,080
Ning Mansion?

99
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,960
The Su Family has no ties to them.

100
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,360
Could it be...

101
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,600
It's because of
my engagement to Chu Tianze.

102
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,790
Ning Mingzhu wants to marry Chu Tianze,

103
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,600
so she plotted to kill my entire family.

104
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,510
Send someone to secretly monitor

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
everyone in the Ning Mansion.

106
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,670
Investigate the Su Family's treason case.

107
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,480
All officials involved in the case

108
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,000
must be checked discreetly.

109
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,320
Yes.

110
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,320
I will seek justice for the Su Family.

111
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,140
(Gentle Breeze)
Junyao.

112
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,440
I can't marry you.

113
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,750
I chose to come here
and marry Chu Tianze

114
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,200
to use the General Mansion's power

115
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
to clear the Su Family's name.

116
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,750
But now, I can't marry you.

117
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Because you are the future of the Chu Family.

118
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,600
You are my true future.

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
General,

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,840
something bad has happened!

121
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,390
What's wrong?

122
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,910
His Majesty has bestowed

123
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,480
marriage upon you and Princess Xiyao.

124
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,600
Madam Chu has accepted the decree.

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,030
Now,

126
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
the entire city knows about it.

127
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,590
Qianqian,

128
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,840
you are the only one I love.

129
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
I will find a way to cancel this marriage.

130
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,750
But the imperial order is hard to defy.

131
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,360
Su Qianqian, I only want you.

132
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,600
This is merely the first challenge we face.

133
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,240
Even if I must defy the imperial order,

134
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,790
I will never part from you.

135
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
Madam,

136
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,150
what else troubles you?

137
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,180
Princess Xiyao is beautiful,

138
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
and her character is admirable.

139
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,270
The General will surely be pleased.

140
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,150
You do not understand.

141
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,670
What Junyao decides

142
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,600
is hard for others to change.

143
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,840
His temperament mirrors his father's.

144
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,360
This time, it might be difficult.

145
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,660
Mother,

146
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,420
Qianqian and I have long pledged our lives.

147
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,670
She is frail with no support.

148
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,830
If I abandon her now,
am I not heartless?

149
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,120
Then what do you expect me to do?

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,630
To defy the Imperial Edict
for your sake?

151
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,870
Do you want His Majesty
to wipe out our family?

152
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,030
The decree can't be defied,

153
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,790
but we can find another way.

154
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,480
I only hope you accept Qianqian.

155
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,630
Accepting Su Qianqian

156
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,870
means embracing the storm behind her.

157
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,890
His Majesty only decreed the marriage,

158
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,670
but set no other restrictions.

159
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,360
I wish to marry Qianqian first.

160
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Alright.

161
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,630
Alright.

162
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,910
Then Su Qianqian can only enter
as a concubine.

163
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,750
Moreover,

164
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,510
we must create public sentiment.

165
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
How about this,

166
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,360
let's say she's with a child.

167
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,510
We must let the world know,

168
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,270
that our Chu Family

169
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,440
reveres His Majesty,

170
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,720
and values loyalty and honor.

171
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,670
This way,

172
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,630
His Majesty on the surface

173
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,440
won't openly target our Chu Family,

174
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,120
but in secret,

175
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,120
he'll surely suppress us.

176
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
Mother, you're right.

177
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,270
Sister-in-law.

178
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,510
Sister-in-law.

179
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,720
Aren't you going too far?

180
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,150
About the third of March,

181
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,550
it's the great day for Tianze's marriage.

182
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,630
If Junyao is to marry a concubine,

183
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,910
it shouldn't be scheduled
on the same day, right?

184
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,840
This month

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,670
only has one auspicious day.

186
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
If they insist on choosing this day,

187
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,040
what can I do as a mother

188
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,390
besides giving my support?

189
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,440
What else can be done?

190
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
Can Su Qianqian even compare
to Princess Mingzhu?

191
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,150
They must change the date.

192
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,990
Oh!

193
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,120
Sister-in-law, what do you mean?

194
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,440
Why can't they be compared?

195
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,270
Does Princess Mingzhu have extra limbs

196
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,750
and extraordinary abilities?

197
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,870
Sister-in-law, stop this nonsense.

198
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,750
I'll go speak to Mother about this.

199
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,870
Alright, enough, enough!

200
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,510
This is an auspicious date.

201
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,550
Mother has already been informed.

202
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,790
She knew you would cause trouble.

203
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,550
She specifically told me to remind you.

204
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,080
Remind me of what?

205
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,550
Two blessings at once.

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
You!

207
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,780
(General Mansion)

208
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,260
(Happiness)

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,960
I heard the bride, Su Qianqian,

210
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,790
is the daughter of Su Yuanshan,
a traitor who was executed.

211
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes.

212
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,870
If it weren't for the arranged marriage

213
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,840
between these two families,

214
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,630
Su Qianqian might have already been dead.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,870
She's really lucky.

216
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,550
But even if she marries the general,

217
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,770
she probably won't be welcomed.

218
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,000
Exactly, exactly.

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,390
One as the main wife,
the other as the concubine.

220
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,150
Things are going to get interesting.

221
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,550
Wouldn't that cause chaos?

222
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,200
The bride steps down.

223
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,390
(General Mansion)

224
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,790
The bride exits the sedan.

225
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,630
The bride is about to come out.

226
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,910
What? Wearing mourning clothes
at her wedding?

227
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,910
Su Qianqian has defied all traditions.
