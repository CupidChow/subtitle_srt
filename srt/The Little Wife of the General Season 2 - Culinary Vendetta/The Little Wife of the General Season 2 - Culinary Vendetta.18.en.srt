00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,720
Uncle.

4
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,560
I know your aunt
isn't quite a good person,

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,870
selfish and self-serving,

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
always looking for small gains,

7
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,150
and causing trouble.

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,320
But...

9
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,870
After so many years together,

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,870
I suddenly lost her.

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,510
I just have a feeling deep inside,

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,950
as if it's been emptied out.

13
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,120
Uncle, don't worry.

14
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,150
I promise I will find my aunt.

15
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,400
Another human bone...

16
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
The sixth site, right?

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Fetch the coroner.

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,360
Understood.

19
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Let's go search elsewhere with the dog.

20
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
Princess.

21
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,750
They brought in a hound dog.

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,680
They are now searching the mansion.

23
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,190
Don't come near, stay away.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,030
Why are you staring at me, dead dog?

25
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Stay away.

26
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Stay away.

27
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,120
Princess, I'm afraid of dogs.

28
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Help me.

29
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,430
Guards, take her away!

30
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,080
You...

31
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,590
Why are you arresting me?

32
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,630
Why arrest me?

33
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,960
- Let go.
- Speak up.

34
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Where is she?

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Who?

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,470
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,400
Take her away.

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,750
Interrogate thoroughly.

39
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,280
Princess, Princess!

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Princess, save me.

41
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,550
Wait.

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Yue'e.

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,470
Don't worry.

44
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,680
It'll be alright.

45
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,480
I told you,

46
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
if you work for me,

47
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,720
you and your family will be okay.

48
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
Take her away.

49
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,110
Yes.

50
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,240
Princess.

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640
First Madam.

52
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,830
You took my maid without proof.

53
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,510
Shouldn't you explain yourself to me?

54
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,680
An explanation is warranted.

55
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,390
- Someone.
- Yes.

56
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,600
Take good care of the princess for me.

57
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,950
No one may enter or leave her room,

58
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,510
except for meals,

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,160
until the matter is resolved.

60
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,710
You!

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,800
You, scoundrel.

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,430
I suggest you honestly confess.

63
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,070
So you won't face further punishment.

64
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,910
Confess?

65
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,270
What should I confess?

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,950
Only because of a mad dog,

67
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,040
you're trying to force a confession.

68
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,040
Let me tell you,

69
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,430
I haven't done anything wrong.

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm a maid from the Ning Mansion.

71
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
You dare target the Ning Family like this.

72
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,360
The marquis won't let you off.

73
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,070
That hound dog is trained.

74
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,160
He's barking at you.

75
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
This means...

76
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,390
he... he saw Second Madam.

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,270
Second Madam must have been haunting you.

78
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,950
You agree, right?

79
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,070
Yes, yes, yes.

80
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,150
You...

81
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,360
Stop...

82
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,040
Stop scaring me like this.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,120
I heard

84
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,310
that if someone dies unjustly,

85
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,270
she'll become a Vengeful Ghost,

86
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
seeking revenge on her enemies.

87
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,800
Why did that dog

88
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,190
only bark at her?

89
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,800
Why?

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,750
Because the dog
can communicate with spirits.

91
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,160
He definitely saw
that Vengeful Ghost on her.

92
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,950
There aren't real ghosts, are there?

93
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,160
Did you hear anything?

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,920
Why do I feel a chill around my neck?

95
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,950
It's a bit chilly.

96
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
There's no sound.

97
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,790
The fire.

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Look.

99
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,480
It's really coming.

100
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,040
A ghost!

101
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,950
What are you doing?

102
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,160
What did you see?

103
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,510
I died so badly.

104
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,680
Why do you want to hurt me?

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,270
Get away, stay back.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,360
Why do you want to hurt me?

107
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,750
Second Madam.

108
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,240
Stay back!

109
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Stay back!

110
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,310
Stay back!

111
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,670
Go away.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
Why are you trying to harm me?

113
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,630
It's none of my business.

114
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,600
It was the princess.

115
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,950
Every grievance has its cause.

116
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,070
Go find her.

117
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,000
See? She admitted it.

118
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,910
Your testimony has been fully recorded.

119
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,510
Explain yourself properly.

120
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,630
You can still survive.

121
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,360
How dare you deceive me.

122
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,030
Survive?

123
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,270
I do want to survive.

124
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,240
Who doesn't?

125
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,960
All my family is in her hands.

126
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,720
How can I survive?

127
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
So what if you have the evidence?

128
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,750
As long as I die.

129
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,790
These testimonies would be useless.

130
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,670
My family can survive.

131
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,750
Oh on.

132
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
She committed suicide.

133
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,720
What do we do now?

134
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,150
The evidence became useless.

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,750
I'll inform my lady.

136
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,320
At this point,

137
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,750
you remain so composed.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,390
I really admire you.

139
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,320
You're making it sound like
the sky's falling.

140
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,390
Speaking of admiration.

141
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,550
I really admire you.

142
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,440
I thought you were just a nobody.

143
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,510
I could easily crush you.

144
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,480
But I didn't expect you
to be a venomous snake.

145
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,150
For my Su Family,

146
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm willing to become a venomous snake.

147
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,720
Anyone who harmed my family
won't live well.

148
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,270
Your personal maid Yue'e has confessed.

149
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,120
You even killed your mother-in-law.

150
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Are you still human?

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,480
You dare to falsely accuse me.

152
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,600
You threatened her
by putting her family in danger.

153
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,270
But you've overestimated her.

154
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,510
It's human nature to be selfish.

155
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,630
(Yue'e, how dare you betray me!)

156
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,390
You think by bribing Yue'e,

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,030
falsely accusing me,

158
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
I would fear you, huh?

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,200
Do you think the Nings
are easy to push around?

160
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,510
You're getting angry out of shame.

161
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
I know you'll deny everything.

162
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,840
But this won't change

163
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,600
the fact that you're the murderer.

164
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,480
If the law can't punish you,

165
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,630
then I'll bring justice into this.

166
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,390
Su Qianqian, you jerk.

167
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,480
I want you to pay.

168
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,080
And Yue'e, that servant.

169
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,320
I'll kill your entire family.

170
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
(I suppose Father should be here by now.)

171
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,800
Marquis.

172
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,270
Marquis, please have a seat.

173
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,080
The Chu Family
is really on the decline now.

174
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,320
When did a woman ever take charge?

175
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,630
Marquis, you're joking.

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,720
If the Chu Family is truly in decline,

177
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,550
then why marry off your beloved daughter?

178
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,120
That's exactly

179
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,630
why I came here today.

180
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,600
Since your family can't treat Mingzhu well,

181
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,960
then I'll take her back today.

182
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,910
She is involved in a murder case.

183
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,510
I'm afraid you can't take her today.

184
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,910
A murder case? Is there evidence?

185
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,870
The investigation is ongoing.

186
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,480
Then there's no evidence.

187
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,480
How dare you detain her without proof.

188
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,270
Do you think you can bully the Nings?

189
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
Marquis, please calm down.

190
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,080
We haven't detained her.

191
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,510
We're serving her great food and drinks.

192
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,560
However,

193
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,270
her maid, Yue'e,

194
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,000
admitted involvement in the murder.

195
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,550
Mingzhu is naturally involved.

196
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,390
Don't worry.

197
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,270
The authorities will investigate fairly

198
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,000
to give her justice.

199
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,910
What if I must take her away today?

200
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,710
Three days.

201
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,030
If no evidence is found in three days,

202
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll send her back to the Ning Mansion.

203
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,750
But if you insist on taking her today,

204
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,320
I'll escalate it to His Majesty.

205
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,320
I'll fight to restore honor
for the Chu Family.

206
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
Alright.

207
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,790
Three days.

208
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,000
If you don't release her after three days,

209
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,150
don't blame me for being mean.

210
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,000
Currently, there's no evidence
of her wrongdoing.

211
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,550
In three days,

212
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
we still have to release her.

213
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,870
It's so frustrating.

214
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,080
We know the killer is that vicious woman.

215
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,080
But we can't do anything about her.

216
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,600
Compared to the Ning Family, Mingzhu

217
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,870
is completely insignificant.

218
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,790
If we bring down the Ning Family,

219
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,000
she'll be easy to deal with.

220
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,790
We have gathered important evidence,

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,390
waiting for a right time
to bring them down.

222
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,670
We're at a crucial moment.

223
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,790
We need to stay calm.

224
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,030
Honey, I understand.

225
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,510
I won't act on impulse.

226
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
Releasing Mingzhu in three days

227
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,320
makes them drop their guards.

228
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,710
Juan.

229
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Thank you.

230
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,270
No need to thank me.

231
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,910
Well...

232
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,790
One of my hands is crippled.

233
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,510
Yet you still choose to stay by my side.

234
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,510
In this world,

235
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,840
there aren't many women

236
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,200
as good as you.

237
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,200
Though there are plenty of good women,

238
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,910
I won't abandon you.

239
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,360
Because you truly care for me.

240
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,790
You bravely chased away the bandits for me.

241
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,630
I've decided
I'll never marry anyone but you.

242
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,030
Juan.

243
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,280
Yes?

244
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,440
Actually, I need to confess something.

245
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,270
That hero rescue scene...

246
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,390
I set it all up.

247
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,200
You would...

248
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,790
be about to marry me.

249
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,750
I couldn't bear to deceive you anymore.

250
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,120
Actually, I already knew that.

251
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,150
I recognized Xiaoming and his friends.

252
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,840
If I wasn't with you every day,

253
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,790
do you think you can be the hero?

254
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,110
You... you...

255
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,270
What do you mean by that?

256
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,550
Actually, I've liked you for a long time.

257
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,880
One time I saw you give your money

258
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,110
all to a beggar.

259
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,000
That's when I knew

260
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,000
I want to be with you forever.

261
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,910
This...

262
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,270
That means a lot.

263
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,350
I'm so moved.

264
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,270
Don't worry, Juan.

265
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,200
I'll always take good care of you.

266
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,590
Even though your arm is useless,

267
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,920
you have me.

268
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
What are you afraid of?

269
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,910
I'm not.

270
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm not afraid of anything.

271
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,070
I just want to be with you.

272
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,590
Brother Teng.

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,480
Let's have a simple wedding,

274
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,750
and invite Master, Master Chu,
and some friends.

275
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,790
That works, no problem.

276
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,880
It's up to you.

277
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,110
(Divorce Letter)
I want a divorce with Tianze.
