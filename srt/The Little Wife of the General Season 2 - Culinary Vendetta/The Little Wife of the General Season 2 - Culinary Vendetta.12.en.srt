00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,060
=Culinary Vendetta=

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,230
Ancestors,

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,350
the Chu Family is filled with heroes,

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,160
loyal and brave,

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,900
and has produced remarkable figures.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,470
Every descendant is outstanding.

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,350
But now, brothers
stand against each other,

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,710
turning on their own blood.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,560
I have failed my late husband,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,600
and shamed the ancestors
of the Chu Family.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,110
Chu Junyao, the fifth generation of the Chus,

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,250
has achieved numerous victories.

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,150
He's been appointed
as Grand General.

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,040
His future is promising
as a national hero.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
No matter who it is,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,200
if they dare to harm Chu Junyao,

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,150
they're shaking the foundation
of the Chu Family.

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,230
Then I

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,840
will surely strike them down.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,710
Qin.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,510
I'm here.

23
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,640
After all these years,

24
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,400
you've endured so much.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,040
Now,

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,400
I entrust the Chu Family

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,640
to you.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,400
Everything

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,030
must prioritize the family.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,080
I will bear that in mind.

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,030
(It's the Tiger Tally.)

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Mother-in-law, this...

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,590
How could you forget again?

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,960
There's no mother-in-law
in the Chu Family.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,910
Just call me

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
"Mother".

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Mother...

38
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,080
Please open...

39
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,750
the window.

40
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,710
Open it now.

41
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,240
Let me take a look

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,190
at the final snowfall.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,470
Back then,

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
when I first met

45
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,870
Lord Heng,

46
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,800
it was snowing

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,630
heavily...

48
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,890
Mother...

49
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,540
Mother...

50
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,190
First Madam goes back to her family home.

51
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,430
This is a rare opportunity.

52
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,600
I understand.

53
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
(Where would she hide the Tiger Tally?)

54
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,750
What are you looking for?

55
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,070
Who sent you here?

56
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,350
Princess.

57
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,390
I have been exposed.

58
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
Useless fool.

59
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,040
Please forgive me.

60
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Rest assured.

61
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,870
I will never admit to it.

62
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,410
They can do nothing about it.

63
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,720
They didn't catch you.

64
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,830
Even if you are caught,

65
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,070
it makes no difference to me.

66
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,270
At most, I lose just you.

67
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,310
But now you've been exposed,

68
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,390
alerting the enemy.

69
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,920
To secretly obtain the Tiger Tally

70
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,720
is now impossible.

71
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,020
Useless! You only know

72
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,000
how to mess things up.

73
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,830
I'm willing

74
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
to take punishment.

75
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,200
Would killing you now solve anything?

76
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,590
Fool.

77
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,960
Please calm your anger.

78
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
What did Yue'e steal
from First Madam's room?

79
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,550
Money?

80
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,510
No, nothing valuable was taken.

81
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,910
The heirloom of the Chu Family.

82
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,030
Madam Chu's Tiger Tally.

83
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,030
The Seal of the General of the State.

84
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,390
What use is there in stealing it?

85
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,480
It can mobilize the Frontier Army.

86
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,770
What do you think it's for?

87
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,600
That's incredible.

88
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,480
It seems Mingzhu married into this family

89
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,480
just for the Tiger Tally.

90
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,090
Such intentions are truly despicable.

91
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,120
It seems the Ning Family
has grand ambitions.

92
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Junyao,

93
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,000
for the sake of the people

94
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
and for the Su Family,

95
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,870
we must bring her down.

96
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
General Lei,

97
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,390
come in.

98
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
Welcome, welcome.

99
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,510
Please, have a seat.

100
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,790
Have some tea.

101
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,670
The finest tea.

102
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,750
I drank it too quickly.

103
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,910
Please don't mind it.

104
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,150
What business do you have with me?

105
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,870
General Lei,

106
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
Tianze

107
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,120
has been serving under you.

108
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,750
We've troubled you all these years.

109
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
Thank you.

110
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
Oh, Madam.

111
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
You're being too formal with that.

112
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,840
Back then,
when old General Chu was alive,

113
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,480
he treated me with great kindness.

114
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,080
What I've done is not worth mentioning.

115
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
By the way,

116
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,550
I heard that within the army,

117
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,510
there have been some changes in positions.

118
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,240
Is that true?

119
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,150
Madam, your information
is quite accurate.

120
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,240
I plan to promote Tianze

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,240
to the Deputy Commander
of the Imperial Guard.

122
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,630
This might not be appropriate.

123
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,910
What?

124
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
It's a great opportunity!

125
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,720
You should be happy about this.

126
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,270
This position

127
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,150
is of critical importance.

128
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,630
How can you entrust it to someone

129
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,030
who has not experienced
trials and hardships?

130
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,320
The Chus must gain experience
on the battlefield,

131
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,390
face more challenges,

132
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,750
and serve the nation more actively.

133
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,750
In my opinion,

134
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,390
only by enduring trials of blood

135
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,910
can one grow to become like you,

136
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
a formidable soul of the army.

137
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,360
Hold on, Madam.

138
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,320
Why do I find this harder to understand?

139
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,630
Are you suggesting I send Tianze
to the borders?

140
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,870
Yes.

141
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,440
That is exactly my intention.

142
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Good.

143
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,510
"When heaven bestows
a great task upon someone,

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,670
it first tests their willpower,

145
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,750
makes their body endure hardship,

146
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,360
leaves them hungry,

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,480
and deprives them of comfort."

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,670
The sons of the Chu Family

149
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
must always lead by example,

150
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,490
and dare to be the first
in all endeavors.

151
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,960
Your words are more enlightening

152
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,480
than a decade of study.

153
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,600
I feel like my understanding
has improved.

154
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,080
We'll do as you suggested.

155
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,710
Alright.

156
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,630
It's good that those two old folks are gone.

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,120
But it benefits Qin too much.

158
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,720
Our days ahead will be even tougher.

159
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,750
Madam,

160
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,440
if First Madam is no longer around,

161
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
you will be the hostess of the Chu Family.

162
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,390
That's obvious.

163
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,550
You think I don't want to?

164
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,550
I've been battling that Qin for years.

165
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,150
Victory's been scarce, defeats frequent.

166
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,240
In the past,
that old woman kept her in check.

167
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,120
Now that she has passed away,

168
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,630
she's become even more reckless.

169
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,320
It's funny when you think about it.

170
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Su Qianqian has been here
for less than a month.

171
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
Two have already died.

172
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,240
Shaoqing, spread the news.

173
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,630
On Su Qianqian's wedding,

174
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,030
she entered the main gate
in mourning clothes,

175
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,240
which supposedly led to
the death of two elders.

176
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,270
Madam, this plan is truly clever.

177
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,750
I'll handle it right away.

178
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,910
Each room will have a person-wide gap.

179
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,510
I'll explain its purpose to you later.

180
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,350
- What's this?
- It's...

181
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,790
Yes.

182
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,840
Every room must be checked.

183
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,690
Understood.

184
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,670
Next, find some helpers.

185
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,630
Make sure they are trustworthy.

186
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,970
Their identity, background,

187
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,150
and character must be clear.

188
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,420
Don't worry, Master.

189
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,850
My comrades from my bandit days

190
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,080
are very resourceful.

191
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,720
We can't just shout and fight like that.

192
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,720
Of course not. Look how cultured I am.

193
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
As for the painting...

194
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,240
Draw a circle in each room.

195
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,320
General,

196
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,360
do you feel like you've married
a great wife?

197
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,790
Absolutely.

198
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,910
Madam is so clever and capable.

199
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,150
It'll be hard for you
to keep private savings.

200
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,840
Not like my Yingying, who's so naive,

201
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
she gives me money instead.

202
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,080
Why would I need private savings?

203
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,510
What's the point?

204
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,320
You wouldn't understand this.

205
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,670
When you meet friends for tea,

206
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,270
literature and martial arts,

207
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,600
or talk about romance,

208
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,270
those are all expenses.

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,600
That makes sense.

210
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,110
Not at all!

211
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,670
Hand over your savings.

212
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,580
Or I'll make Yingying break up with you.

213
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,360
General, isn't this going too far?

214
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,550
Too far? Me?

215
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,790
Why didn't I see you

216
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,750
contribute any money to the restaurant?

217
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,150
You heartless scoundrel.

218
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,390
That... that was all my secret money.

219
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,840
General, here, take it.

220
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,750
Su Qianqian is nothing but bad luck.

221
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,440
She's been here for a month,
and two elders passed away.

222
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,080
Indeed, getting married
in mourning clothes.

223
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,720
Isn't it defying the heavens?

224
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,080
The Chu Family is about to face disaster.

225
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Exactly.

226
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,030
Can't believe First Madam

227
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,440
let the concubine in mourning
enter through the main gate.

228
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,550
That surely invites endless misfortune.

229
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,720
I heard a few days ago,

230
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,270
the general almost lost his life.

231
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,550
Maybe it's because of this.

232
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,200
Exactly.

233
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,600
We should stay away from her.

234
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,410
Su Qianqian is a bringer of misfortune

235
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,960
and a disgraceful woman who seduces men.

236
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,000
Who are you talking about?

237
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Of course, it's...

238
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,510
First Madam.

239
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,710
First Madam.

240
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,510
Tell me, who is the disgraceful one?

241
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,680
This... this...

242
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,110
Speak up!

243
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
First Madam,

244
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
it's Second Young Madam.

245
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,550
Who spread this?

246
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,960
It was Xiaoyu from West Courtyard.

247
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,510
Chuntao, bring Xiaoyu to the main hall.

248
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Yes.

249
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,200
Today, I'll investigate one by one

250
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,880
until I find the person
spreading rumors.

251
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,300
(Gentle Breeze)

252
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
First Madam, I'm sorry.

253
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,480
It was Second Madam's maid,

254
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,790
Shaoqing, who spread the word.

255
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,720
She paid me to say this.

256
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Chuntao.

257
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Bring Shaoqing to me.

258
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Understood.

259
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,030
How dare you spread rumors

260
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,830
and slander your lady!

261
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,030
What benefit does this bring you?

262
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,160
Short-sighted, every single one of you.

263
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,960
Doing vile deeds that harm
others and yourself.

264
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,790
Listen carefully.

265
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,750
This isn't the only matter at hand.

266
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,960
No rumors are allowed to spread here.

267
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,240
If I catch it,
I will punish it severely.

268
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,310
Think about it.

269
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,750
Those who have been slandered by you

270
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,640
struggle to prove their innocence,

271
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,750
and may even take their own lives.

272
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,160
Does that make you murderers then?

273
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,640
We dare not, never again.

274
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,720
We dare not anymore.

275
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,790
This time, I'll be lenient.

276
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,590
A month's wages will be deducted.

277
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,750
If it happens again,

278
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,840
there will be severe punishment.

279
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

280
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
Now the entire household knows.

281
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,000
Everyone says
Su Qianqian brings misfortune.

282
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,340
They even call her immoral.

283
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,030
If she finds out,

284
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
she'd be furious
to the point of collapse.

285
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,000
Good, well done.

286
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,110
It must be spread far and wide.

287
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,200
Madam, you can rest assured.

288
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,880
Good deeds rarely spread,

289
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,550
but scandals travel fast.

290
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,270
In just a few days,

291
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,590
it will be spread everywhere.

292
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,720
That's wonderful! Truly wonderful!

293
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,480
Oh my, this is incredible.

294
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,310
Arrest them and take them away.
