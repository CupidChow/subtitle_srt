3
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,630
Marquis, please.

4
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,630
Commander Yang, please.

5
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,000
Honored guests.

6
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,150
This is our prized treasure.

7
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
Dragon Soaring Across the Seas.

8
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,150
It symbolizes
a prosperous official career,

9
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,750
abundant wealth,

10
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,560
a bright future,

11
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,430
and a smooth path to success.

12
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,310
Please enjoy your meal.

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,840
Recently, this restaurant

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,960
has become the talk of the capital.

15
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,710
Even someone from the palace

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,400
praised the dishes here endlessly.

17
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,110
Yes, I visited a few days ago,

18
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,190
and haven't stopped thinking about it.

19
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,750
This time, I'm fortunate thanks to you.

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,470
Not at all, not at all.

21
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,590
I toast to you, Marquis.

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
How beautiful!

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Do you like it?

24
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,560
Father, this dragon looks so lifelike.

25
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,840
You do like it.

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,030
Such craftsmanship,

27
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,800
it is truly masterful craftsmanship.

28
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Marquis,

29
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,400
this was carved by my daughter Qianqian.

30
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,590
She loves studying these things.

31
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,630
Your daughter is only eight or nine.

32
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,800
What a genius she is!

33
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,840
You're flattering me.

34
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,400
(Father always praises me
in front of others.)

35
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,520
- Come on.
- (This time, he praised someone else.)

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
Father,

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,650
this dragon carving is exquisite.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Doesn't it look a bit familiar?

39
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,910
Familiar?

40
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,280
Who could carve such a unique dish?

41
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,800
Truly extraordinary.

42
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,190
I can't recall it for now.

43
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,030
Commander Yang, please try it.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
After you, Marquis.

45
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Father.

46
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,030
Commander Yang.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,840
Excuse me.

48
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,870
Go ahead.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,870
Commander Yang, have some food.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Miss.

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,510
Are you looking for the privy?

52
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,680
The dishes here
are indeed the best locally.

53
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm very interested in your head chef.

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,270
Could you take me to meet this chef?

55
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,110
Well,

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,000
miss,

57
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,040
please return to your room.

58
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,600
I'll ask our head chef to come and toast you.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,920
No need to go to such lengths.

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
You can simply take me to the kitchen.

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,310
Miss, the kitchen is quite smoky.

62
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,270
Moreover, there's no precedent for this.

63
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,360
(If the cook is Su Qianqian,)

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,120
(then this tavern must have an issue.)

65
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,040
Lead the way.

66
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,120
This way, miss.

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,190
- Here we are.
- Stop.

68
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,510
You stay outside.

69
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,040
Su Qianqian.

70
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,800
Who are you looking for?

71
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,390
(That shouldn't be wrong.)

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,390
(It's said that Su Qianqian
is a skilled cook.)

73
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,390
(This restaurant must be connected to her.)

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,510
Is there someone named Su Qianqian here?

75
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Su Qianqian?

76
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,950
Never heard of her.

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Who carved the dragon
of the Room Heaven?

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,510
(Only Master can do that.)

79
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,040
(Though I've tried a few times,)

80
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
(I failed.)

81
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,950
(Looks like we're exposed.)

82
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,630
(There's something fishy.)

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
I carved it.

84
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,830
What's wrong?

85
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,190
Carve it again.

86
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,000
Who are you?

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,270
Why would I do what you said?

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Unbelievable.

89
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,750
Take him inside.

90
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,600
Brother Teng.

91
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,830
- You...
- Juan.

92
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,680
Are you carving now?

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,160
Fine. I'll carve right now.

94
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,270
Who taught you to carve dragons?

95
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,790
I think dragons look beautiful.

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,720
So I just figured it out on my own.

97
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,910
I've been practicing for a long time.

98
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,240
Juan, are you alright?

99
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,550
Brother Teng,
I was just scared to death.

100
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,670
Luckily, I've been learning from Master.

101
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,510
It's all fine now.

102
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,510
Let me tell you something.

103
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,790
Mr. Du has the Chu Family backing him.

104
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,840
Last time, I fancied a woman.

105
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,270
Who knew Mr. Du also took a liking to her?

106
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,390
We almost got into a fight over it.

107
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,910
If General Chu hadn't stepped in,

108
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,080
I would've dealt with Mr. Du by now.

109
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,350
You could say,

110
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,670
a bond forms after a clash.

111
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,360
- Cheers!
- Have a drink.

112
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Alright.

113
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,030
Sister-in-law,
why are you still up so late?

114
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,030
Tianze has gone to the frontier.

115
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,030
There's no one around to talk to.

116
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,870
I thought I'd come to chat with you.

117
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,790
Well, Junyao has been training recently.

118
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,960
You're also here to keep me company.

119
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,870
Speaking of which,
we share quite a bond.

120
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,480
What do you mean by that?

121
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,360
I heard about you when I was young.

122
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,870
Back then, my father took me
to meet Lord Su.

123
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,870
During the banquet,
a dragon carving dish was served.

124
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,960
It left a deep impression on me.

125
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,030
Because you were the only person,

126
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,510
other than me, my father ever praised.

127
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,390
I'm flattered.

128
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,960
Speaking of which,

129
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,320
tonight I went to the Light Tavern
with my father.

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
The chef there also prepared a dragon.

131
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,030
She was carving that dragon
right in front of me.

132
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,670
But she is far worse than you.

133
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,960
It may look the same.

134
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,320
But the details
are not as refined as yours.

135
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,840
Oh, really?

136
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,870
If I didn't know
you married into the Chu Family,

137
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,440
I would have thought you were the chef.

138
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
Being a chef isn't a bad thing.

139
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,750
After all, I am a chef myself.

140
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,720
A chef is still just a chef in the end.

141
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,960
Always tied to that small plot of land.

142
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,030
Unfit for grand and noble occasions.

143
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,080
How could it compare to
marrying into a noble family?

144
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,080
You must be joking.

145
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,510
Even the mistress of a grand family
has her troubles.

146
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,120
Otherwise, you wouldn't be weary
and visit me late at night.

147
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,870
Speaking of being weary,

148
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,910
I do feel a bit sleepy now.

149
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,320
Then I'll take my leave and rest first.

150
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,440
I won't disturb you any longer.

151
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Oh, by the way,

152
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,790
Junyao and Princess Xiyao's wedding
is approaching.

153
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,910
Once Princess Xiyao marries Junyao,

154
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,720
we'll have someone new to chat with.

155
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,440
It will be even more lively.

156
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,150
Well then, I'll head back first.

157
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
Take care.

158
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,390
Princess Pig! Coming over just to annoy us.

159
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,670
Really deserves a scolding.

160
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,990
My lady.

161
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,630
Luckily, we made it back just in time.

162
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,200
Otherwise, she would've caught us.

163
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,510
She already knows.

164
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
Yingying,

165
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,000
inform Ziteng.

166
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Seal off all hidden chambers
and secret passages.

167
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,630
Don't leave evidence behind.

168
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,470
Understood.

169
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,870
Use the back door.
Be careful not to be followed.

170
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,230
Got it.

171
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,240
Keep an eye on that tavern.

172
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,750
Especially on Mr. Du.

173
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,120
Understood.

174
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
Notify my father immediately.

175
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,390
Let him have the authorities find an excuse

176
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,630
to shut down that tavern.

177
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,000
Investigate it.

178
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,000
Maybe we'll uncover something.

179
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,230
Understood.

180
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,660
(Light Tavern)

181
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,910
I'm fine, guys.

182
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,270
I'm okay.

183
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,440
Why was he taken away?

184
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,360
What crime has he committed?

185
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,300
(Seal by Jingzhao Prefecture)

186
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,750
Changsheng.

187
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,270
What is this?

188
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,670
Do you want to eat this?

189
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,320
Want it?

190
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,790
Give me a hug.

191
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,030
Trying to run?

192
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
You can't escape.

193
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,960
Come here.

194
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let me hold you.

195
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
My lady, something's wrong!

196
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,370
The tavern has been shut down,

197
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,270
and Ziteng arrested.

198
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,270
Master, please save Brother Teng!

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,790
Xiaojuan, get up.

200
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,480
Don't worry, I won't let anything
happen to him.

201
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,670
Junyao is training soldiers in the camp.

202
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,670
I can only ask Mother for help now.

203
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,080
Stay here in my room.

204
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
Don't go anywhere.

205
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Let's go.

206
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,840
Stop it! Stop it!

207
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,910
Stop it! Stop it!

208
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,870
Tell me, why did you poison the food?

209
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,960
And who instructed you to do it?

210
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,750
Are you framing me?

211
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,270
We get so many customers daily.

212
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,550
If there was poison,
it would've shown by now.

213
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,670
Do you even have a brain?

214
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
If you want to frame me,

215
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,550
come up with a smarter plan.

216
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,870
We suspect you used a slow-acting poison.

217
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,870
You're really testing my patience!

218
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,910
Are you about to claim next,

219
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,120
that the poison takes 100 years to work?

220
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,480
You've got a stubborn mouth!

221
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,390
Admit your crime!

222
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,600
I...

223
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,150
I hold grudges, I admit it.

224
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,550
I remember you clearly.

225
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,910
You treacherous woman!

226
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,320
You're jealous of
my restaurant's success.

227
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,550
You just want to ruin me, don't you?

228
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
I like dealing with smart people.

229
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,360
Playing dumb leads only to destruction.

230
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,510
Fine, I'll spell it out for you.

231
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,720
You've got the wrong person.

232
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,630
I'm a tough man.

233
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,320
Say whatever you have to say.

234
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,120
Your backing is Su Qianqian and Chu Junyao.

235
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Su who?

236
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,840
Yao who? I have no idea.

237
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,870
But let me tell you this clearly.

238
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,270
The one supporting me is far more powerful.

239
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,150
It's not them.

240
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,030
Then who is it?

241
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,670
I want to see who's backing you

242
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,030
to make you so arrogant.

243
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,800
Malicious woman.

244
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,550
Listen carefully.

245
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,110
The one behind me is

246
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,920
faith.

247
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,750
How dare you toy with me!

248
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm not afraid of you.

249
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,240
What are you doing?

250
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,110
You... you...

251
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,350
Take it back.

252
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,680
Stop fooling around.
