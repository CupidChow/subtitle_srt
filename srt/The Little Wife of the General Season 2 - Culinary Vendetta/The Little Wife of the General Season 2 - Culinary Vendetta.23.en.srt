2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,190
Too bad things don't always go as we hope.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,710
The fact that I married in
can't be changed.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,030
So to outsiders,

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
we appear to be a family.

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,350
No matter what you think,

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,350
we need to maintain this facade.

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,710
As for privately,

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,790
I will respect my husband and your views.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,030
Now that you've moved in.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
You're a member of the Chu Family.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,430
Putting myself in your shoes.

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,710
I understand your feelings.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,640
A woman's husband

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,640
doesn't truly love her.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,230
She still has to think about him.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,950
You have a big heart.

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,400
That's very admirable.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
If not,

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,510
what else can I do?

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,870
I just wish you would treat me better.

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,350
I heard you have a complicated history.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
Can you tell me about it?

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,560
It's not really that complicated.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,870
I fell in love with him at first sight.

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,840
I didn't even know his status then.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,680
Later, the Su Family was wronged.

29
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,000
I was exiled.

30
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,640
He traveled far to find me.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
We still missed it in the end.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
Fortunately,

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,070
I used my sharp mind.

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,310
In the end, I found her.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,280
True lovers always end up together.

36
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,990
That's great.

37
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,470
Princess.

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,150
How about you tell me
about life in the palace?

39
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,190
Sure.

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,430
It was quite boring
living in the palace,

41
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,750
I had to attend lectures every day.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,630
I just can't figure it out.

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,840
What's Princess Xiyao thinking?

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,190
Hope she's as others say,

45
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
kindhearted

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
and gentle.

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,630
Otherwise, the household will be in turmoil.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,990
General.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,710
Last night's wedding left you so exhausted.

50
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,680
Having two wives
must be quite an experience.

51
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,520
You have too little to do, huh?

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Not really.

53
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,470
I'm here to invite you to the military camp.

54
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Do you think

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,280
Qianqian and Princess Xiyao can get along?

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,910
Of course not.

57
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,470
Even teeth and tongues can clash,

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,840
let alone two women.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,750
I can't go to the camp recently.

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,000
You need to be sharp,

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,870
always ready to put out fires.

62
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,780
I need to train the troops.

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,470
Get me some breakfast.

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
Princess, what do you think of
the general and First Madam?

65
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,840
Naturally, they're a great pair.

66
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,400
Your Highness, what's your view?

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Striving for happiness and guarding it,

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
are both rights of women.

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,430
Since I have married into this family,

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,240
naturally, I will strive for it.

71
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,270
However,

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,070
I disdain using underhanded tactics

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,270
against anyone.

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,190
I think Miss Su is somewhat petty.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,630
You're a princess,

76
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,390
yet you're willing to share a husband.

77
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,950
You even call her "Sister".

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
She should feel honored.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
She is not an ordinary person,

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,040
and cannot be judged
by common standards.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,430
What kind of person she is?

82
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,750
I am also curious about that.

83
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,190
How she could make such a good man
like my husband

84
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,870
resist all temptations

85
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,830
and be devoted to her.

86
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,870
So, Your Highness still wants to compete?

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,480
Competing easily leads to degradation.

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,480
Not competing

89
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,950
is actually the higher path.

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't quite understand.

91
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,510
How can one achieve the goal
without competing?

92
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,040
Be a light that others admire,

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
and he will inevitably

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,750
want to get closer.

95
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,070
Qianqian,

96
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,920
I haven't had your cooking in ages.

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,040
Could you cook today?

98
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,940
What would you like, Mother?

99
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,160
Lately,

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,310
I have a big appetite.

101
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,070
Here, I've prepared the menu for you.

102
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,310
Good luck and happiness.

103
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,750
Fortune shines upon us.

104
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,390
Peace in the household.

105
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,630
May your home be prosperous.

106
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,470
Family...

107
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,360
Family harmony.

108
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,720
Harmony and joy.

109
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,270
Mutual respect and love.

110
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,750
Children and grandchildren around.

111
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,270
Mother, are you ordering food?

112
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,390
Or are you ordering me?

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,600
Of course, ordering food.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,070
Isn't that obvious?

115
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,800
All the dishes are listed here.

116
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,270
How about today,

117
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I help you out personally?

118
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,270
How could that be?

119
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,240
You are the head of the family.

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,750
How could you assist me?

121
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,630
Look at you,

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,560
assisting our Qianqian,

123
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I am more than happy.

124
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,160
You must think my old arms and legs

125
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,630
are not agile anymore.

126
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,510
Mother, what are you saying?

127
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,310
I understand your kindness.

128
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,790
Thank you.

129
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,110
Alright.

130
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,830
The ingredients are ready.

131
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's go.

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Oh, I'm going to enjoy a feast today.

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
Great.

134
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,120
My mouth is watering.

135
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,830
Oh, what do you need me to do?

136
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,310
Mother, beat two eggs.

137
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,150
Okay.

138
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,040
Madame, let me do it.

139
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
Go away.

140
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
Is it done?

141
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,600
You're doing great.

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
What's next?

143
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,120
Once this is done, we can start cooking.

144
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Just use your hands.

145
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,510
OK.

146
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,360
Alright.

147
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,550
Look at the knife skill.

148
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,150
Come on.

149
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,510
Mother, pass the fish slices and chili.

150
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,600
Alright.

151
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,490
- Here.
- Just a moment.

152
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,250
Okay.

153
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,200
My mouth is watering.

154
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,600
Today is our family's first banquet.

155
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,600
With our culinary genius Qianqian

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,670
making so many delicious dishes,

157
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,320
and Xiyao bringing imperial wine,

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,910
it's truly

159
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,510
perfectly complementing each other.

160
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,630
That's great.

161
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,870
(Still, Madam remains superior.)

162
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,510
(With her here,)

163
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,240
(there won't be a good show to watch.)

164
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,320
(They flirting
don't seem like good people.)

165
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,910
(Is this not a trap?)

166
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,710
Come on,

167
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
let's raise our glasses together.

168
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
Wishing us

169
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,870
harmony,

170
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,390
love,

171
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,480
and family prosperity.

172
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Come on.

173
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,510
Yes, yes, yes.

174
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,600
Family prosperity.

175
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,960
Mother and Junyao are right.

176
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,080
Sister, what do you think?

177
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,630
They are right.

178
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,750
Come on.

179
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,510
Good wine.

180
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,270
(He said good wine, he's finished for.)

181
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,150
(Xiyao's imperial wine)

182
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,390
(is indeed good.)

183
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,480
With good dishes.

184
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,960
That's right.

185
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,360
Start eating, come on.

186
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,600
Here, Mother.

187
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,360
Okay.

188
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,030
Really good.

189
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,720
You are all

190
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,120
obedient and good.

191
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,030
Good, good, good.

192
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
Delicious.

193
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,390
Thank you, thank you.

194
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,870
(General, how can you still smile?)

195
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,270
(Which piece to eat first
to not offend anyone?)

196
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,200
(If His Majesty finds out
I neglected the princess,)

197
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,840
(he would tear me apart.)

198
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,510
(Looking at me won't help.)

199
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,390
Honey, why aren't you eating?

200
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,550
Why aren't you eating?

201
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,750
I will.

202
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,470
I will.

203
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,510
(The general is impressive.)

204
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,720
(Impressive.)

205
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,440
(The general is doomed.)

206
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,270
(Looks like he still cares
for the princess)

207
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,200
(Each one is tougher than the last.)

208
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,720
(Now we'll see what the general will do.)

209
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,720
(He has to choose one first.)

210
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,630
(This is where the fight begins.)

211
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,390
Mother.

212
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,440
Don't you love chicken legs?

213
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Yes, yes, yes.

214
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,440
I love chicken legs the most.

215
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,000
I love them.

216
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,200
It's delicious.

217
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,750
I'm feeling a little unwell today.

218
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,150
You go ahead and eat.

219
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,630
Okay, okay, okay.

220
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,470
Here you go.

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,200
Yingying, we're going back
to the Su family.

222
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,910
You've lost, my lady.

223
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,600
What do you mean by "lost"?

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,960
Then think about it.

225
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
If we leave,

226
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,720
they will be lovey-dovey.

227
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,840
Isn't that losing?

228
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,870
There are two chickens in the coop.

229
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,000
If one leaves,

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,670
the whole coop belongs to
the remaining one.

231
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,670
Can you not use such metaphors?

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
Then, are we still leaving?

233
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,350
Leave by yourself.

234
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,370
Watch how I deal with her.

235
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,550
Oh, my lady,

236
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,870
you not only can't deal with her,

237
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,120
you have to coax her.

238
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,960
Otherwise, that general will run away.

239
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,870
That's better.

240
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
Honey.

241
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,790
You're jealous.

242
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,080
To ensure the Chu Family's loyalty,

243
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,360
His Majesty has sent Dezi to keep an eye.

244
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,080
Any slight mistreatment
of the princess

245
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,720
will be reported

246
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,400
to His Majesty.

247
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,070
So what do you want me to do?

248
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,550
Then treat her better.

249
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,110
I won't serve.

250
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,200
Princess Xiyao has arrived.

251
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Honey, don't have to worry about Dezi.

252
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,460
I have already taken care of it.

253
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,970
He won't report to my father.

254
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,270
I don't want you two to fight
because of me.

255
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,200
(The princess is too good.)

256
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160
(It's simply perfect.)

257
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,320
(No, no.)

258
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,310
(I feel like I'm about to switch sides.)

259
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,150
Princess.

260
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,030
I love Qianqian.

261
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
I feel indebted to you.

262
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,800
Princess.

263
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,680
You don't have to feel that way.

265
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
As I said,

266
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,350
this is my fate.

267
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,550
I'll leave you two alone now.

268
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,350
She must be very sad.

269
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,590
It's clear she really likes you.

270
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,110
I feel so guilty.

271
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,200
Did I do something wrong?

272
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,110
I'm protecting the only you in my heart,

273
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,920
but ended up hurting others.

274
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
We are not at fault.

275
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,400
Neither is the princess.

276
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,920
Maybe,

277
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,750
it's the world that's wrong.
