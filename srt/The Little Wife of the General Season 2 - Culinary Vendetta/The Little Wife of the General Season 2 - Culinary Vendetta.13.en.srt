00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,960
Arrest them and take them away.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,440
What are you doing?

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,350
What are you doing?

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,760
- Madam.
- Let go of her!

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,350
Are you just standing there?

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
Didn't you hear? Do you want trouble?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,040
Release me!

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,470
Second Madam.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,150
First Madam asked me to take her away.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,430
Second Madam, please...

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,150
Who do you think you are?

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,070
How dare you speak to me like that.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,590
Get lost now.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you defying First Madam's orders?

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,350
Take her away.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,000
- What are you doing?
- Move!

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,950
Madam!

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,870
Madam!

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,150
Second Madam, please wait.

22
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,070
Wretched woman.

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,000
First Madam, Shaoqing is here.

24
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,680
Very well.

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,640
Greetings, Madam.

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,030
The one who caused you
to lose a month's wage

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,630
has been brought over.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll send her
to the authorities for investigation.

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,910
Before that,

30
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,030
if you bear a grudge against her,

31
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,630
suit yourself to seek revenge.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
Madam, please spare me.

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,630
Please have mercy.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,170
It's you who incited us to spread rumors.

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,240
You deserve this.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,400
Are we really going to attack her?

37
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,840
Isn't this a bit too much?

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,800
What's wrong with that?

39
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,280
When she hurt others,

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
she might have been hurt in return.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,470
She cost us more than a month's allowance.

42
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,590
That's right.

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,400
No, what she cost us

44
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,870
was a compassionate heart.

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,310
Now is the time to make amends.

46
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,150
Exactly.

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,870
It's all your fault.

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
It's your fault.

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,030
You truly

50
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
deserve this!

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
You're truly despicable!

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,870
You deserve it.

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
Qin, stop right there!

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
What do you mean by this?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
Madam Chu just passed away.

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
And now you're targeting me already?

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
Even a dog deserves respect.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,910
Who are you to deal with my maid?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,870
You show me no consideration at all.

60
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,400
Yang Cuihua!

61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,630
Watch your status, will you?

62
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,000
Stop acting like a shrew.

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,470
A shrew? Me?

64
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,240
If I'm a shrew, then you're a wicked woman.

65
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,400
Mother told us to value harmony.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,520
But look at you.

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Using despicable schemes to eliminate me.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,630
Hah! You're unworthy to take charge
of this family.

69
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,310
Yang Cuihua, oh Yang Cuihua.

70
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,120
Take a good look at yourself.

71
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,630
"A crooked leader corrupts the rest."

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,750
Are you not aware of your own actions?

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Let me tell you,

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,800
today, I only punished your servant.

75
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,070
That was already a great show of respect.

76
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,510
And yet, you still refuse to relent.

77
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,480
Do you want me to invoke the Family Law?

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,040
Those were all baseless accusations.

79
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,680
Who knows?

80
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,750
Ah, you call it "baseless".

81
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,430
About who said what and when,

82
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,070
I have inquired thoroughly.

83
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,270
Crystal clear.

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,630
- Well.
- What?

85
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,580
Are you trying to deny it?

86
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,480
Who can be certain?

87
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,800
Perhaps you're winning people over,

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,240
and framing me for the blame.

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Listen,

90
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,310
if you dare commit such vile acts again,

91
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,070
you'll be punished by the Family Law.

92
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,040
Qin, this isn't over between us.

93
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,560
This is too much to bear!

94
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,140
(Fang La Fish)

95
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,680
Master, it keeps spinning.

96
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,270
Hang all of them first, then adjust.

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,300
Place Buddha's Temptation in the center.

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,340
- Signature dish.
- Okay.

99
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,350
Honey.

100
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,270
Have some tea.

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Are you tired?

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,070
The general really dotes on my lady.

103
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,270
Zi Xuan, I want it too.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,640
Well...

105
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,310
There are too many people here.

106
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,830
Let's talk about it at home.

107
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,380
Why must it be at home?

108
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,360
Dinner's ready!

109
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
Juan!

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Juan!

111
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,790
Come here.

112
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,190
Master, her name is Xiaojuan.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,160
She is, well, my...

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,830
Why are you suddenly shy?

115
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,070
That's not like you at all.

116
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,360
Juan is my fiancée.

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
She's my master.

118
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,240
Greetings, Master.

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Nice to meet you.

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,430
This restaurant has just opened.

121
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,830
I don't have anything valuable on me for now.

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Take this bracelet as a gift.

123
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,000
This...

124
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,390
She gave it to you, so just accept it.

125
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,480
Thank you, Master.

126
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,360
Wishing you a loving marriage.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
And may you have children soon.

128
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,620
Oh, right,

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,090
you aren't married yet, Master.

130
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,800
If the proposal happens in the future,

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,040
could help me with something?

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,200
No problem.

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
Oh, Juan,

134
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,800
this is Master's husband.

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,200
Call him Master Chu.

136
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,830
Greetings, Master Chu.

137
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,080
Nice to meet you.

138
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,390
Greetings, Master Chu.

139
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,480
You're truly kind.

140
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,720
A pleasure to meet you.

141
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,720
I didn't prepare any grand gifts.

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,270
Just some ordinary items.

143
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,000
(Using my private savings
to show goodwill.)

144
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
No, no, that won't be necessary.

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,920
She doesn't understand.

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,120
Ordinary things suit ordinary people.

147
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,750
Ah, Master Chu, you're too kind.

148
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
Thank you, Master Chu.

149
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,480
It... it's for her.

150
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Thank you, Master Chu.

151
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,310
All the same.

152
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,100
Dinner is ready.

153
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,390
Dinner is ready.

154
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,430
Did your father agree?

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's eat first.

156
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,240
Hurry, come on.

157
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
Take a seat.

158
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,870
You've been through so much.

159
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,630
Not at all.

160
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
Don't worry.

161
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,670
All the grievances you endured today,

162
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,120
I will make it up to you in the future.

163
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,030
Thank you, Madam.

164
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,390
Let me take a look.

165
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,270
Does it hurt?

166
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,870
It doesn't.

167
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,200
Here.

168
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,840
Madam, I can manage by myself.

169
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,030
Hold it.

170
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,030
Chuntao.

171
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
You've worked so hard for me.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,120
You've been caring for me wholeheartedly.

173
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,550
I've kept it all in my heart.

174
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
With Junyao not by my side,

175
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,200
you've been with me every single day.

176
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,630
I've always treated you
like my own daughter.

177
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,270
Madam.

178
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,440
Good girl.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
Rest assured.

180
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,480
I'll find you a good match.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,270
We'll give you a grand wedding.

182
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Get married and have children.

183
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,550
You must live a stable life.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
No.

185
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,600
I will not marry.

186
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,510
I want to serve you for life.

187
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,910
Silly you.

188
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,790
You have your own life to live.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
How can you not marry?

190
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,750
You must live well.

191
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,390
Live for yourself.

192
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,440
Besides, even after you get married,

193
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
who says you can't still

194
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,790
take care of an old lady like me here?

195
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,920
Nobody says that.

196
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,390
Of course.

197
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,590
Good.

198
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,820
Honey, bullying has gone too far!

199
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,270
Why are you reading all this nonsense?

200
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,960
What are you doing? What's going on?

201
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,030
Listen.

202
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,200
Qin handed over my maid
to the authorities.

203
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,460
How am I supposed to
save face after this?

204
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,120
If word gets out about this,
everyone will know!

205
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,550
I... I can't go on living like this!

206
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,440
What have you done this time to upset her?

207
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
If you want others to respect you,

208
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,750
you must act in a way
that earns their respect.

209
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,720
Whose man are you supposed to be?

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,550
Yet you are speaking up for others!

211
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,270
I'm standing by reason, not favoritism.

212
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,270
What?

213
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,390
Do you expect me to join you

214
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,270
in committing such wicked deeds?

215
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,670
I must have been blind

216
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,080
to marry such an unworthy man like you.

217
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
You...

218
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,910
If only you were half as capable as Qin...

219
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,990
Forget it.

220
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,200
I won't say anything more.

221
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,030
Why won't you?

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
In what way am I worse than her?

223
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,480
Why are you suddenly so angry?

224
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,190
That old man Lei!

225
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,670
He ordered me to go to the frontline.

226
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,040
What?

227
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,480
Didn't my father agree with him

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,320
that you'd join the Imperial Guard
as Commander?

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,790
Why the sudden change to the frontline?

230
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,960
How would I know?

231
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,550
Why don't you ask your father?

232
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,790
Why did Lei

233
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,390
suddenly change his mind?

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,550
It's already so late now.

235
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,000
If you want to ask, do it tomorrow.

236
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,510
Something agreed upon suddenly changed.

237
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,790
Someone must be meddling behind this.

238
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,030
I need to find out who it is.

239
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,870
I'll never let them off the hook.

240
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,200
Lei Yue is the backbone of the military.

241
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,320
Not many people can influence him.

242
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,390
The Chus are among them.

243
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,030
I understand now.

244
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,310
It must be that scoundrel Chu Junyao!

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,030
He wants me to die on the battlefield.

246
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,960
Then, he'll become the master
of this family.

247
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,360
I will kill him!

248
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,030
Kill him! I must kill him!

249
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,480
Whether it's Chu Junyao or not,

250
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,960
we won't let him go either way.

251
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,630
But look at you.

252
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,360
Losing composure over minor setbacks.

253
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

254
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,240
Disappointed in me?

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,600
This happened to me,

256
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,120
that's why you can act so calm!

257
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,000
Who do you think you are?

258
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll have my father negotiate with Lei Yue.

259
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,270
If you have the energy for this,

260
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,670
better to plan
how to deal with Chu Junyao.

261
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,000
Immortal Shiitake with Lotus.

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,720
Osmanthus Chicken Wings.

263
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,320
Dongpo Pork.

264
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,240
I know about Dongpo Pork.

265
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,960
What about the other two?

266
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,120
The descriptions are on the back.

267
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,390
Wow, my lady,
your handwriting is exquisite.

268
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,670
And your cooking is sublime.

269
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,790
You're not only beautiful
but also talented.

270
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,720
My lady, you are absolutely perfect.

271
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,550
Stop teasing me.

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,480
The tavern will be renovated tomorrow.

273
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,910
You go clean up the place.

274
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,670
Oh no, my lady,

275
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,200
I can't bear to part with you.

276
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,090
It's fine.

277
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,120
As long as I can.

278
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,280
Honey,

279
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,780
you've worked hard lately.

280
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,170
This is Duck Blood and Vermicelli Soup
for you.

281
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,230
Come over quickly.

282
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,900
Here you go.

283
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,670
Open your mouth.

284
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,510
It's still a bit hot.

285
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,110
Have you thought of

286
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,080
the names I asked you?

287
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,930
Yes, I have.

288
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,390
If it's a boy,
he'll be called Chu Xiaoyao.

289
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,150
If it's a girl,
she'll be called Chu Xiaoqian.

290
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,360
I asked you to think of
a restaurant name.

291
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,320
The name of the restaurant...

292
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Even though we are in darkness,

293
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,240
we are like a spark of hope.

294
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,390
What we must do is to grow stronger,

295
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,200
and become our own sun.

296
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Then the darkness will be pierced completely.

297
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,960
And the light will shine upon the world.

298
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,440
How about calling it Light Tavern?

299
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,000
Alright, let's call it that.

300
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,020
(Light Tavern)

301
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,240
Today marks the grand opening
of my tavern.

302
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,120
Thanks to all of you for your support.

303
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,350
Everyone gets a drink!

304
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,350
Welcome!

305
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,440
Get the drinks ready!

306
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,510
Come in, please, welcome!

307
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,750
- Welcome.- This way.

308
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,030
Take care of our guests.

309
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,200
May this tavern live up to its name.

310
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
To bring light to everyone.

311
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,790
It definitely will.

312
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
Honey.

313
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,550
Those officials
have their regular restaurants.

314
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,670
We might need to come up with an idea

315
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,000
to bring them here to dine.

316
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,160
What kind of idea?

317
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,630
There's one right now.

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
It requires your work.

319
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,080
Please invite more colleagues.

320
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,200
Whether they are acquaintances,

321
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,510
or those we rarely interact with,

322
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,590
invite them all.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,510
Once they've eaten at my table,
they won't leave.

324
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,630
By then,

325
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,510
our plan can be carried out even faster.

326
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,640
Come, come, please come in.

327
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,080
Welcome.

328
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,350
Honey, rest assured,

329
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,640
I'll do everything for you.

330
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,110
Welcome, this way.

331
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,480
Father.

332
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,720
With you stepping in,
General Lei still refused.

333
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,110
Then whose favor is he respecting?

334
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,480
None.

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,310
That old scoundrel.

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,750
I initially thought of taking a step back,

337
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,400
transferring Tianze
to the Ministry of Personnel.

338
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,440
But he still turned me down.

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,920
It seems this person is important to him.

340
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,400
Even your dignity was disregarded.

341
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,070
Any progress on the Tiger Tally?

342
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,110
Not yet.

343
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,950
Honey.

344
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Honey, you're finally back.

345
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,150
Please, have a seat.

346
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,590
Honey.

347
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,270
Father-in-law...

348
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
What did he say?

349
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,270
General Lei turned our request down.

350
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,270
That old man Lei is so despicable.

351
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,110
He's clearly making things hard for me.

352
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,510
What should I do, honey?

353
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
I don't want to go to the frontier.

354
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
Besides, we just got married
not long ago.

355
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,510
I can't bear to leave you.

356
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,440
You just can't abandon a life of opulence.

357
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,440
Oh honey, my dear.

358
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Please listen to me.

359
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,750
If I have to go to the frontier,

360
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,440
it'll be harder for me
to climb any higher.

361
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Besides,

362
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,480
I can't bear to leave you here alone.

363
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,440
Honey, I must take you with me.
