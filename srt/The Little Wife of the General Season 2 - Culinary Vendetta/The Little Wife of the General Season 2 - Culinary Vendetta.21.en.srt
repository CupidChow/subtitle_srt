2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,980
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,160
Your concubine, from the Su Family,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,350
is graceful, kind,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,550
and good at cooking.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,070
I've been eager to see her.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,640
It's almost time for us to meet.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
Your Highness, let me be honest with you.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,240
Qianqian and I are truly in love.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,160
We only have each other in our hearts.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,000
We made a promise.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,640
We'll be each other's

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,280
one and only.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,840
His Majesty wants to arrange our marriage.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,840
I feel guilty towards you.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,440
Grand General.

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,880
I understand what you mean.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I've never met you before.

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,200
I only heard that you're a young hero.

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,510
Today, I met you.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,560
Your character and your approach to love

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,150
made me admire you greatly.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,430
I also want to find someone
who truly loves me

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,920
to spend a lifetime together.

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,480
What a pity. I'm from a royal family.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,230
My marriage is out of my control.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,760
Sorry for making things difficult.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,120
I'll ask Father to annul our wedding.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,840
But...

30
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,200
Whether it succeeds or not,

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,920
it's not up to me to decide.

32
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,870
If it doesn't work,

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,400
I hope you and your wife won't blame me.

34
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,070
Thank you, Your Highness.

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
I owe you a great favor.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,800
I won't bother you further.

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,470
Grand General, take care.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,030
Your Highness, among all the officials,

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,630
I'm afraid only he is worthy of you.

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,970
Are you really breaking the engagement?

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,840
What else can I do?

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,960
If I truly marry him,

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,280
I'll just be their thorn.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,190
Su Qianqian is only a concubine.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,710
You will lead the Chu Family in the future.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,630
The Chu Family is at its peak.

47
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,680
The general's reputation spreads far.

48
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,240
I think you have to marry him.

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,910
His Majesty won't allow you
to call it off.

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,630
You're right.

51
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,800
I'm just a pawn

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,680
to balance the Chu Family.

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
The general made a poor move.

54
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,240
Declining this marriage

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,840
will arouse His Majesty's suspicion.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,430
Chu Junyao and Su Qianqian's relationship

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,120
makes me envious.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,560
Yao, are you thinking about your husband?

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,630
Greetings, Father.

60
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,360
Are you already thinking about Junyao?

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,870
No, I can't bear to leave you, Father.

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,080
I would rather not marry.

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
I want to stay by your side forever.

64
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,590
I haven't cherished you for no reason.

65
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,840
So, I've chosen the best man for you.

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,430
He'll be your husband.

67
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,470
Father.

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,520
I really don't want to marry.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,950
Please, Father, revoke the order.

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,430
You have always been gentle and sensible.

71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,270
Has Chu Junyao reached out to you?

72
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,790
No.

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,550
It's just that

74
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,190
I don't want to marry someone
who often fights.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
I only want a peaceful life,

76
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,950
and to be by your side.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,120
I am very curious.

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,270
How did Chu Junyao persuade you?

79
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,360
Making you ask to
end the engagement regardless.

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
Father.

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,800
He accomplished something great
the other day.

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Yet he insisted on
calling off the engagement.

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
And you're helping him now.

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,680
Where has my imperial authority gone?

85
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,000
Please calm down.

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
I was wrong.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,840
Rise.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,870
Chu Junyao is a good husband.

89
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,720
The Chus are all loyal members,

90
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,950
having a profound heritage.

91
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,790
You should marry him.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,070
I trust him.

93
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,270
You've already helped Chu Junyao.

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,890
Even though it didn't work out,

95
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,270
they must honor your favor.

96
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,120
Besides, I will do them a favor.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll appoint Su Qianqian
as Second Rank Lady of Honor.

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,310
Let her be Chu Junyao's secondary wife.

99
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
What do you think?

100
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,870
It all depends on your orders.

101
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
Someone.

102
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,790
Yes.

103
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,360
Tell Dezi.

104
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,830
Stay at the Chu Family
to protect the princess.

105
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,120
Tell Chu Junyao,

106
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,000
if they neglect the princess,

107
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,750
they have no reason to exist.

108
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,070
As you command.

109
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,660
(General Mansion)

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,390
This time, you entered the palace.

111
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,190
The wedding didn't get canceled.

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,360
We also owe His Majesty
and the princess a favor.

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,120
That would be
"losing Lady Li and our troops".

114
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,430
Believe me, I'll abandon you first.

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,120
General, you should think of

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,630
how to face Madam now.

117
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,310
Before meeting Qianqian,

118
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,120
how about I send you to the border first?

119
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,040
No, no, no, no, General.

120
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,830
It's all rebelliousness causing this.

121
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,670
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,070
Then why don't you find a way?

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,070
My lady.

124
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,270
The general hasn't returned yet.

125
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,680
Why don't you eat first?

126
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,870
Go check if the general is back.

127
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,750
Okay.

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,870
Honey.

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
General.

130
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,760
The general is drunk.

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,310
It's okay.

132
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,230
Junyao.

133
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,920
I love you, I just love you.

134
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,190
Why is he drinking so much?

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,750
He is troubled inside.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,680
He insists on

137
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,920
breaking the engagement.

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,000
He finally convinced the princess

139
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,270
to ask His Majesty.

140
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,950
But His Majesty became furious.

141
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,270
He scolded the princess.

142
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,390
Even the general was harshly criticized.

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,600
His Majesty even broke the Crystal Lamp.

144
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,950
The general didn't know
how to explain to you.

145
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,270
He could only drown his sadness.

146
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,750
The general got drunk.

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,870
He told everyone

148
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,430
that he loves you,

149
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
and he misses you.

150
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,070
The general's love for you

151
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,190
made everyone cry

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
when they heard about it.

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,390
Qianqian.

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,490
I heard Princess Xiyao is a great beauty.

155
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,700
Maybe the general is secretly pleased.

156
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,110
How can you say that?

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
That's a disservice

158
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,870
to the general and Madam,

159
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,600
a desecration of their steadfast love.

160
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,870
Then tell me, what is true love?

161
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,120
Maybe we can discuss it elsewhere?

162
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,000
That's what I was thinking.

163
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,480
Let's go.

164
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,870
(Unreliable...)

165
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,670
Qianqian.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,360
I...

167
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,390
Come here and let's talk.

168
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,270
What should we talk about?

169
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,200
You...

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
It's your turn to speak.

171
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,670
Go ahead, I'll listen.

172
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,310
Let's have a breakup dinner.

173
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,390
What breakup dinner?

174
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
His Majesty has named you Lady of Honor.

175
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,910
Breaking up dishonors His Majesty.

176
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Fine.

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Then we'll sleep in separate rooms.

178
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,810
How is that different from breaking up?

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
I don't agree.

180
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
Is this your approach?

181
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,870
Not parting with you is my bottom line.

182
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,510
Please understand me a bit.

183
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
I understand.

184
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
The Imperial Edict cannot be disobeyed.

185
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,390
We're both powerless.

186
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,670
So I don't blame you.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,270
Instead, I'm grateful to you,

188
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
because I didn't misjudge you.

189
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm truly proud of you.

190
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,360
But I can't share you with others.

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,440
I just can't do it.

192
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,030
If I need to share you with others,

193
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I can't do it either.

194
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
But I really don't know what to do.

195
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,630
So let's both calm down first.

196
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,550
You should get married.

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,630
Let's leave the road ahead

198
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,240
to the future.

199
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,510
Junyao, worrying about your marriage?

200
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,790
I've tried every possible way.

201
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
The princess will still marry me.

202
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,600
It's a good thing

203
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,270
that she marries you.

204
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,790
Our Chu Family

205
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,720
can thrive.

206
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,510
If she doesn't marry into our family,

207
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,600
His Majesty

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,480
might become suspicious.

209
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,150
Our family's future is uncertain.

210
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,870
Think about how few people we have.

211
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,510
After Xiyao married into our family,

212
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,030
she can help Qianqian relieve some burden.

213
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,320
Easy for you to say.

214
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,440
Then what should I say?

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,750
Say "After Princess Xiyao marrying you,

216
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,320
it's caused turmoil in our household.

217
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,630
There's tension at home."

218
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,910
Don't you have any solutions?

219
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,360
As you know.

220
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,200
Qianqian is so stubborn.

221
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,960
She can endure humiliation

222
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,550
and heavy burdens for revenge,

223
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,480
fighting against the Nings on her own.

224
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,320
She's feeling her lowest right now.

225
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,240
I believe you should be there for her now.

226
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,910
You should really try to understand her.

227
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,670
I know I am trying to understand her.

228
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,390
You're troubled.

229
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,790
But she's even more troubled.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,630
You should really be there for her,

231
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,510
instead of asking me what to do.

232
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,600
She just kicked me out.

233
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,670
Maybe you could comfort her for me.

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,670
How am I supposed to comfort her?

235
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,790
You said you understand her.

236
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,510
I think you still don't understand her well.

237
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,630
You...

238
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,750
You should put yourself in her shoes.

239
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,270
Think about her needs.

240
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,870
Why haven't I considered her?

241
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,240
Listen, let me finish.

242
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,390
You are now the only man

243
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,200
she loves the most in the world.

244
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,510
She even has to share her favorite man.

245
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,840
Think about how she'll feel.

246
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
She now...

247
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,080
She... she feels insecure.

248
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,320
She's more worried you might change.

249
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,080
So you have no better option now.

250
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
You, just stay by her side.

251
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,840
Spend quality time with her.

252
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,000
Let her open up to you.

253
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Give her peace of mind.

254
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,510
My lady, help me!

255
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,230
Yingying!
