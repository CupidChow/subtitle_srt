1
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:27,988
What?

2
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,624
Isn't this a magazine
that you rich people read?

3
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,758
Why throw it at me?

4
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,527
Open your eyes.

5
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,661
Read the cover.

6
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,165
There's her biography inside.

7
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,499
Teng Tangjing.

8
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,735
The only daughter of the president
of Teng Corporation.

9
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,037
She can play five musical instruments,

10
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,372
and has her sailing license.

11
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,774
She's now studying in France.

12
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,079
She was even given the title
of Miss France.

13
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,480
Did you see that?

14
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,415
What an amazing biography.

15
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,917
Who is she?

16
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,386
She is the one that Huaze Lei loves.

17
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,991
And she will graduate soon
and will come back from France.

18
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,727
You're not worthy of loving Huaze Lei.

19
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,897
Look at Teng Tangjing on the cover,
then look at yourself.

20
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,901
You can't even match one strand
of her hair.

21
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,038
What right do you have to talk
to Huaze Lei or even to love him?

22
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:18,939
Tell me.

23
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,242
What's wrong?

24
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,311
What?

25
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,448
Aren't you pretty aggressive?
What's wrong with you now?

26
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,150
Too shocked to think.

27
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,052
Let me tell you,

28
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,821
no matter how hard you act cute
and attract him,

29
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,623
you don't deserve the F4.

30
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,627
A weed like you shouldn't be allowed
to be here.

31
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,963
You'll ruin our image.

32
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,899
Get it? Now get lost.

33
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,736
Daoming Si.

34
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,506
Who allowed you to bring her here?

35
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,978
I'm telling you.

36
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,213
This woman belongs to me.

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,349
If I see you lay a finger on her,

38
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,118
the red card will be in front of you
the next day.

39
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,221
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,392
You're safe now.

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,529
Relax, I got you.
They won't bully you anymore.

42
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,030
Get lost!

43
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,298
What are you doing?

44
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,300
Who do you think got me in this situation?

45
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,501
You big idiot!

46
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,503
Why are you treating me like this?

47
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,871
I'm here to save you.

48
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,373
I didn't ask you for this.

49
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,241
Nobody dares to speak to me like this.

50
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,843
That's because everyone is an idiot!

51
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,178
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,380
Is there a more perfect man than me
in this world?

53
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,481
Perfect?

54
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,149
You call yourself perfect?

55
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,151
I hate your stupidity!
I hate your lifeless eyes!

56
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,953
I hate that you think you're perfect!

57
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,689
I hate everything about you!

58
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,492
You're the most hateful type
in those psychological tests!

59
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,493
I hate you!

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,794
I hate you the most!

61
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,737
PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST
BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS

62
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,211
Hurry. Keep asking me questions.

63
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,312
Okay.

64
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,546
Okay.

65
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,715
Young Master, this is the question.

66
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,485
"Inside a coffee shop,

67
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,920
there's a couple.

68
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,090
The man told the woman,

69
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,493
'You're really a...'"

70
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,994
There are three choices.

71
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,396
"One, cute person.

72
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,799
Two, person who's hard to understand.

73
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,268
Three, troublesome person."

74
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,236
Please answer.

75
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,570
Troublesome person.

76
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,905
How childish. Next question.

77
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,507
Okay, troublesome person.

78
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,508
Okay.

79
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,742
Next question.

80
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,614
"If your girlfriend

81
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,317
is walking closely with another man,

82
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,387
what would be your reaction?"

83
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,990
There are four choices.

84
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,859
If my girlfriend is with another man,
what are you all doing here?

85
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,161
We're...

86
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,865
Young Master, that was just the question
in the book.

87
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,968
And you don't have a girlfriend right now.

88
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,069
What?

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,639
So if I have a girlfriend now,
you'll allow her to be with another man?

90
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,707
Yes. No!

91
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,042
Young Master.

92
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,078
Please, that's just a question
in the book, okay?

93
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,048
What kind of lousy book is that?

94
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,618
-Didn't you buy this yourself?
-What?

95
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,086
Do you want to die?

96
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,788
I'll ask the questions.

97
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,690
Okay, the question is,

98
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,859
"If your girlfriend..."

99
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,495
This is a question in the book.

100
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,732
"...is walking closely with another man,

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,801
what would be your reaction?"

102
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,203
Hey, there are four choices.

103
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,571
That's more than the last question.

104
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,273
"One, no feeling.

105
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,412
Two, want to validate the situation,
but afraid that others will know you care.

106
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,782
Three, admit that you can't take it.

107
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,650
Four, don't say anything."

108
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,751
Please answer.

109
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,720
I don't want to answer.

110
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,055
Young Master.

111
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,823
You have to answer.

112
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,024
What do you care?

113
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,626
Young Master.

114
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,763
I need to tell you that you can't get
an accurate result this way.

115
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,132
Two.

116
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,534
Two.

117
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,303
That means you want
to validate the situation,

118
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,606
but is afraid
that others will know that you care.

119
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,544
Did anyone ask you to repeat that again?

120
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,115
Next question. Okay.

121
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,818
The question is,

122
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,654
"Which type of woman attracts you?"

123
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,223
There are three choices.

124
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,792
"One, neat and easy on the eyes."

125
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,528
Who wants a dirty woman?

126
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,464
Are you stupid?

127
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,300
Young Master,
just don't choose this option.

128
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:43,837
There are more.

129
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,706
"Two, cheerful and uninhibited.

130
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,609
Three, strong and stubborn."

131
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,810
Please answer.

132
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,413
Strong and stubborn.

133
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,815
Hurry. Get the results.

134
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,716
Okay.

135
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,285
F.

136
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:00,887
Okay.

137
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:06,927
Young Master.

138
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,129
Just fire me.

139
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,830
I won't dare to read it.

140
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,100
-What is it?
-Young Master.

141
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:16,870
<i>I hate your stupidity!</i>

142
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,938
I hate your goldfish eyes!

143
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,673
I hate that you think you're perfect!

144
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,409
I hate everything about you!

145
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,378
You're the most hateful type
in those psychological tests!

146
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
I hate you!

147
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,647
<i>I hate you the most!</i>

148
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,581
-This is...
-Hey.

149
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,582
Young Master.

150
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,785
Please don't be mad.

151
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,521
There are references for you at the back.

152
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,226
"Our suggestion is for you
to change starting

153
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,295
from your outward appearance.

154
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,765
Always put on a big smile.

155
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,236
Wear cuter and approachable clothes.

156
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,441
Have a friendly attitude towards people

157
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,011
so that you can improve
your relationship with them."

158
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,099
Hey, hardworking virgin!

159
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,934
Hey!

160
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,869
Hardworking virgin!

161
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,041
Please stop calling me that, okay?

162
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,076
All right. Never mind.

163
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,211
Come and have a drink with us.

164
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,747
You're drinking in school
in broad daylight?

165
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,249
We're all adults.

166
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,617
So what if we drink?

167
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,185
Come sit down here.

168
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,565
Just talk to each other. Don't mind me.

169
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,105
I think it's because Jing is coming back.

170
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,708
That's why Lei is acting
a bit strange lately.

171
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,344
And I heard Jing was chosen to be

172
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,479
the ambassador to promote
the image of the airline company.

173
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,748
That's why you can see
her posters everywhere.

174
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,484
I want to ask a question.

175
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,187
What is Jing's relationship
with Huaze Lei?

176
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,755
Jing is Lei's first love.

177
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,123
What?

178
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,792
First love?

179
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,627
It started when they were in kindergarten.

180
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,496
Since he was little,
Lei has always been strange.

181
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,598
We all felt he was autistic
when we were little.

182
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,635
Don't you think he's still
a bit autistic now?

183
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,438
When the four of us were playing
when we were kids,

184
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,374
he would always sit on a corner
and sulk all day.

185
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,078
Or when we were all playing
and having fun,

186
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,748
he would suddenly throw up and cry.

187
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,819
We were so young then.
How would we know what to do?

188
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,488
But Jing, who is three years older
than us, knew what to do.

189
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,290
Since she came into our lives,

190
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,426
she'd take Lei somewhere
every time he cries.

191
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,729
They would come back
and Lei have already stopped crying.

192
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,466
Since then, his condition improved.

193
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,004
We all feel that Jing slowly helped
Lei come out of his autistic tendencies.

194
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,074
Jing is really great.

195
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,112
Without her, I think Lei would now be
in a mental care facility.

196
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,115
<i>My head hurts.</i>

197
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,283
<i>It feels like it was hit by a bat.</i>

198
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,421
<i>Turns out Huaze Lei has been waiting
for Jing's call all along.</i>

199
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,292
I wonder what Lei will do
when Jing comes back this time.

200
00:10:55,355 --> 00:11:00,760
LEI, I'M BOARDING NOW.
SEE YOU IN 17 HOURS. JING

201
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,599
Huaze Lei.

202
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,068
What are you doing here?

203
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,042
You're so pretty today.

204
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,282
You look different from usual.

205
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,691
Good night.

206
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,561
I'm really happy to see you here today.

207
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,066
<i>Is he really Huaze Lei?</i>

208
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,703
<i>Is this his dream or mine?</i>

209
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,252
Look.

210
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,188
Teng Tangjing is in the magazine.

211
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,323
She's gorgeous.

212
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,494
I wish I can be as beautiful as her.

213
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,731
If you compare Jing and some other girls,

214
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,000
they will be like heaven and earth.

215
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:47,900
That's right.

216
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,502
One is so elegant and classy.

217
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,504
The other one is so tacky.

218
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,874
She's even wearing the same clothes
for two consecutive days.

219
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,244
-Oh, my god.
-Is she also wearing the same underwear?

220
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,712
That's so gross.

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,081
This dress is so nice.

222
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,950
The weather is so nice.

223
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,219
You changed the topic too fast.

224
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,381
What happened to you?

225
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,816
Where did you get that shirt?

226
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,451
Why? Does it look bad?

227
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,086
I think it's nice.

228
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,022
Lei, what do you think?

229
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:49,962
Hey.

230
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,764
You're here.

231
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,633
Okay.

232
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,802
I'll be right there.

233
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,373
Where are you going?

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,274
Jing is here!

235
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,676
Where?

236
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,575
I missed you.

237
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,651
You're all grown up.

238
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,153
You've matured.

239
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,089
I really missed you.

240
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:56,963
Hi.

241
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,997
Long time no see.

242
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,132
Jing, long time no see.

243
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,032
Yes.

244
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,367
You're all grown up.

245
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,502
You've really changed.

246
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,636
As if you don't already know.

247
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,104
-It's Teng Tangjing.
-Wow.

248
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,472
She's Teng Tangjing.

249
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,041
Teng Tangjing is so pretty.

250
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,209
She's stunning.

251
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,210
Yes, she's so pretty.

252
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,378
She's beautiful.

253
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,379
Me too.

254
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,048
I never thought you'd be more enchanting

255
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,650
and even more charming when you come back.

256
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,551
Thank you.

257
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,052
When did you come back?

258
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,821
I saw the posters. They're quite nice.

259
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:22,889
Not really.

260
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,926
Do you still live beside the Seine river?

261
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:27,860
Yes.

262
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,362
Let's find a place to have some drinks.

263
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,696
-Let's go talk somewhere else.
-Okay.

264
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,231
We can have a drink.

265
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,500
But can you please change
your hideous outfit first?

266
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,903
Let's go.

267
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,806
Lei, why are you just standing there?

268
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,706
Let's go.

269
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,510
<i>Turns out people like her exist.</i>

270
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,012
<i>She's perfect.</i>

271
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,315
<i>I really can't compare to her.</i>

272
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,855
I'm so glad we're all together again.

273
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,191
Are you guys still the same as before?

274
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,092
Nothing really changed.

275
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,361
Ximen still changes
his girlfriend every week.

276
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,096
Meizuo does the same.

277
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,599
Who said so? I'm not like you.

278
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,302
Ah Si, how's your sister?

279
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,270
She got married last year.

280
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,439
She's with her husband in Switzerland.

281
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,907
Really?

282
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,177
You and your sister were so close.

283
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,279
You must miss her a lot, right?

284
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,714
Don't worry about him.

285
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,617
Now, a girl just like her sister is here.

286
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,185
Her name is Shancai.

287
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,621
You jerk! How can you compare her
to my sister?

288
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,822
They're so different.

289
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,824
Are they? I think they're quite similar.

290
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:32,792
Hey.

291
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,160
Lei.

292
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,562
Why are you so quiet?
Are you in a bad mood?

293
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,297
Jing's back.

294
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,933
I know. She's right here.

295
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,636
This guy has always been the same.

296
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,339
He gets in a bad mood whenever he's happy.

297
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,507
That's right.

298
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,542
I remember Lei being
that way since he was little.

299
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,476
I'm not!

300
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,581
What's the matter?

301
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,486
Jing, why did you take
those kind of pictures?

302
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,121
Don't you think you revealed too much?

303
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,091
Did she? I didn't see anything.

304
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,927
The picture only showed this part.

305
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,863
Lei, aren't you being too strict?

306
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,066
That's just my job.

307
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,603
How can you be like the ordinary models?

308
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,906
I don't like it.

309
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,877
I'm happy that you're always
thinking about me.

310
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,779
I like you the most.

311
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,283
-Hey, why did you only kiss him?
-What just happened?

312
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,284
What's going on?

313
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,854
-Let's all have a toast.
-What about us?

314
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,656
-We've known each other so long.
-I don't want to.

315
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,557
Here. Cheers.

316
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,591
You're so bad.

317
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,893
Fine. Cheers.

318
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,566
Why aren't you eating?

319
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,301
I'm not hungry.

320
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,139
I bought this fish for NTD 80.

321
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,908
You should at least eat this fish.

322
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,811
I'm not hungry.

323
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,681
Hey, where's the fish?

324
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,082
-Hey!
-What?

325
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,116
You...

326
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,818
you can't eat your daughter's fish.

327
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,887
No, I'm telling you.

328
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,056
Youngsters don't know how
to value things, you know?

329
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,358
They don't like to eat this and that.

330
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,493
Our life was so hard before.

331
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,962
We didn't get to eat this much.

332
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,196
-That's right.
-We were so poor,

333
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,731
-I had to sell my blood, you know?
-Yes.

334
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,466
He sold his blood.

335
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,369
He couldn't be a male host
so he sold his blood instead.

336
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,773
I was selling too much blood

337
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,109
that I became anemic
and had to be hospitalized. You know?

338
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,615
The next time you buy fish,
don't buy one with so many bones.

339
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,483
Then stop eating it.

340
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,285
Your blood pressure will be too high.

341
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,954
Your triglycerides
and cholesterol will be high.

342
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,190
You'll get hospitalized.
Hospitalization requires money.

343
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,359
Shancai doesn't want to eat it anyway.
It would be a waste.

344
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,493
You bought it for NTD 80.

345
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,495
Then give me half of it.

346
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,030
Give me half of it.

347
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,599
<i>Her father is the president
of a big enterprise.</i>

348
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,901
<i>My father is selling blood.</i>

349
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,403
<i>My god.</i>

350
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,073
<i>I really can't compare
to that heiress, Teng Tangjing.</i>

351
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,243
<i>I shouldn't think too much.</i>

352
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,612
<i>I also shouldn't think about F4.</i>

353
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,650
Shancai!

354
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,219
Shancai. It's me.

355
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,322
Qinghe. Wait for me.

356
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,661
Shancai, it's me.

357
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,863
Qinghe.

358
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,532
Qinghe?

359
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,501
You're my junior high school classmate.

360
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,069
Why are you here?

361
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,537
I transferred here.

362
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,839
We own a lot of land.

363
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,442
After my dad sold our ancestral lands,
we became nouveau riche.

364
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,510
I see.

365
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,346
My dad is afraid I'd be too tacky.
So he sent me to study here.

366
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,947
Now, we're classmates again.

367
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,449
That's right. It's been a long time.

368
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,518
I'm so happy to see you here.

369
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,720
Yes. I heard you were studying here.

370
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,355
At first I was quite scared.

371
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,791
But after seeing you,
I'm not scared anymore.

372
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,459
That's right. I'm here, so you...

373
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,898
I think it's better
if you don't talk to me.

374
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,799
Why?

375
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,267
You're the only person I know here.

376
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,902
And you've been taking care
of me ever since.

377
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,236
How can I not talk to you?

378
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,871
You can't ignore me.

379
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,873
All right. I won't.

380
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,175
Let's go.

381
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,145
This school is really great.

382
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,347
There should be a lot
of celebrities' kids, right?

383
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,883
I guess so.
I don't know any of them, though.

384
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,419
Hey.

385
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,088
Who are they?

386
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,756
Are they celebrities?

387
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,526
Hey, handsome guys!

388
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,828
Don't call them!

389
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,162
Let me tell you this.

390
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,965
If you want to peacefully spend your years
in this school,

391
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,900
don't have anything to do with them, okay?

392
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,069
-Why?
-Don't ask. Let's just go. Hurry.

393
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,410
Shancai, let's eat.

394
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,745
Thank you.

395
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,379
Sorry for making you pay for my lunch.

396
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,382
Didn't you buy too much food?

397
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,384
It's fine. We'll have more choices
this way.

398
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,489
Even if you're rich now,
you can't waste money like this.

399
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,491
It's fine.

400
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,391
Thank you.

401
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,528
Actually, I still miss how we were before.

402
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,067
But you're really different now.

403
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,169
And I'm still lame and tacky.

404
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,005
How am I different?
I'm still as tacky as before.

405
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,374
Hey.

406
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,177
Do you still go to that stall in front
of our school to eat tempura?

407
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,179
I almost asked my dad to buy that stall.

408
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,514
Why do you want to buy it?

409
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,883
So they can sell in front of my house.

410
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,452
You're too much.

411
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,654
Do you want it now?
I'll tell them to come over here.

412
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,723
Don't. Are you kidding me?

413
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,368
It's so good to meet old friends.

414
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,304
You can't get that feeling in this school.

415
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,340
What are you saying?

416
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,677
Nothing. I'm just happy now.

417
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,469
What are you looking at?

418
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,471
What are you looking at?

419
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,075
Shancai, what's your locker number?

420
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,377
Oh, mine is 150. How about you?

421
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,612
Mine is 174.

422
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
What? 174 again?

423
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,151
Hey.

424
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,920
Why is there a red card here?

425
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,289
<i>Why did they give Qinghe a red card?</i>

426
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,658
<i>Is it because of me?</i>

427
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:46,198
Is this like a greeting card
to welcome transferees like me?

428
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,500
<i>What does Daoming Si want now?</i>

429
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,319
What do you want now?

430
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,420
You big idiot!

431
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,623
Qinghe hasn't even met you.

432
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,291
How could he get on your nerves?

433
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,926
Speak!

434
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,261
You big, stupid fool!

435
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,462
It's all because of you!

436
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,731
You wench. You don't know anything.

437
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,866
What do you mean by that?

438
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,368
How is it all because of me?

439
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,436
Why should brainless morons
like you blame me?

440
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,537
I'm brainless?

441
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,006
Your friend is so brainy then?

442
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,075
-Qinghe?
-Yes! That nouveau riche.

443
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,845
Let's see who'll drop out
between the two of you first.

444
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,347
I want you to take back his red card.

445
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,982
What a joke.

446
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,218
Nobody dares to command me,
Daoming Si, since I was little.

447
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,486
Let me tell you again.

448
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,388
I want you to take back his red card!

449
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,455
Go away.

450
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,526
You dared to do that to a girl?

451
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,261
You deserved it!

452
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,763
Who told you to be with such a tacky guy?

453
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,964
See how I'll deal with you two.

454
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,767
You jerk!

455
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,168
I definitely won't forgive you!

456
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,337
You wench.

457
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,806
Are you sure you want
to do this for that tacky guy?

458
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,207
Yes, I'm sure!

459
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,612
What are you doing?

460
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,818
Go away!

461
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,254
Qinghe, are you all right?

462
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,622
Let's run!

463
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:17,790
-Stop!
-Stop!

464
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,494
In France,

465
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,831
I'll just sit down
when I'm in bars at night.

466
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,566
Then have you met any special guy?

467
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,902
-Stop!
-Stop right there!

468
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,806
Men won't let go
of a woman like you easily.

469
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,109
I had some suitors.

470
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:40,646
But I think if I don't have any feelings
for them...

471
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,015
Qinghe, are you all right?

472
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:47,152
If a bunch of girls pursue me,
I'll date them one by one.

473
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,587
I'll just try it.

474
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,523
That's why I say you're
a beast in human form.

475
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:52,891
How about you, Lei?

476
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,626
Do you have a girlfriend?

477
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,731
No.

478
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,033
How come?

479
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,702
It's better for men to have girlfriends.

480
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,373
You'll become a real man
after you have a girlfriend.

481
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,675
Jing, you are way out of line.

482
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,910
You know the reason Lei doesn't have
a girlfriend is because...

483
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,547
Never mind.

484
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,851
All right.

485
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,186
Let me introduce a model
to be your girlfriend, okay?

486
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,187
There's no need for that.

487
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,490
I knew you'd say that.

488
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,061
I couldn't resist teasing you.

489
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,295
Because every time I do so,

490
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,930
that's the expression
you have on your face.

491
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,502
You can't be serious with other girls.

492
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,106
Because you're the Lei
that only belongs to me.

493
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:45,944
Jing, welcome back.

494
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,980
Yan, long time no see.

495
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,648
You're really getting more
and more beautiful.

496
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,950
No. By the way, let me introduce you.

497
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,019
He's the son
of the Rock Aboretum's President.

498
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,554
He's a senior here.

499
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,755
They are...

500
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,158
I know, they're the famous F4.

501
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,192
Hello.

502
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,561
He's your boyfriend, right?

503
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,463
I saw how sweet you were earlier.

504
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,131
You mean Lei?

505
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,635
No. We've been good friends
since we were kids.

506
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,670
We're like siblings.

507
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,338
I see.

508
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,208
You really look like a couple, though.

509
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,576
Turns out you're just siblings.

510
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,678
We're going to Hawaii
for our spring vacation, right?

511
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,547
I wonder if you've already checked
the bulletin.

512
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,949
Hawaii again?
We've been there hundreds of times.

513
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,686
Only F4 deserves
a beautiful girl like you.

514
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:32,291
If he's not your boyfriend,
then it must be Daoming Si?

515
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,403
Jing, I'm sorry.
I still have a class. I'll go ahead.

516
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,771
Okay, bye.

517
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,950
Go away!

518
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,285
Qinghe!

519
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,520
Are you all right?

520
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,555
They're coming! Run!

521
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,690
Help!

522
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:05,624
Don't run!

523
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,926
SPRING VACATION. NTD 50,000
LIMITED SLOTS ONLY. GRAB YOUR CHANCE

524
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,194
Hawaii!

525
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,231
It's my dream vacation spot.

526
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,167
I swore I have to go to Hawaii
at least once in this lifetime.

527
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,236
What?

528
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,570
Fifty thousand?

529
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,840
Freshman kids
in this school are so wasteful!

530
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,476
The self-guided tours on newspapers
only costs NTD 19,000.

531
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,311
I can go to the South Pole for NTD 50,000!

532
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,213
Shancai, there's a lot
of people chasing us.

533
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,149
Do you really need
to think about that at this time?

534
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,216
Don't run!

535
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,584
They're coming. Run!

536
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,353
Don't run!

537
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,755
BULLETIN BOARD

538
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,569

539
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,071
Don't run!

540
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,043
Don't run!

541
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,445
Don't run!

542
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,051
What are they doing?

543
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,488
Don't run!

544
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,356
Hurry.

545
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,524
Qinghe, are you all right?

546
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,092
Qinghe.

547
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,397
<i>Why did Teng Tangjing see me like this?</i>

548
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,033
Don't run!

549
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,809
That's enough!

550
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,213
<i>It's Huaze Lei.</i>

551
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,215
<i>I never thought Huaze Lei would help me.</i>

552
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,584
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

553
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,489
Lei.

554
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,459
Do you know what you're doing?

555
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,594
Ah Si.

556
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,529
You should stop. Haven't you had enough?

557
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,864
What do you mean?

558
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,476
Don't tell me you've fallen for her?

559
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,847
<i>Please, don't deny it.</i>

560
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,655
You're so determined to help her.

561
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,092
Would it not matter even
if you're forced to drop out?

562
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,497
Stand up.

563
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,401
Until when will you protect this wench?

564
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,302
What do you care?

565
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,237
-Let go!
-No!

566
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,805
It hurts! Let me go!

567
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,941
Daoming Si, you jerk! Let me go!

568
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,411
Fine.

569
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:40,345
Huaze Lei.

570
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,480
Our friendship is over!

571
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,515
I will never talk to you again!

572
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,188
Ah Si.

573
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,426
What happened?

574
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,295
Why did it turn out this way?

575
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,466
Why are you so dirty?

576
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,036
Come on. Let's freshen you up.

577
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,443
<i>I hope you won't mind them.</i>

578
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,978
They're not bad kids.

579
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,614
They just go overboard sometimes.

580
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,684
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

581
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,087
<i>Her eyelashes are so long.
Like that of a doll.</i>

582
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,857
<i>It's so hard to imagine
that we're both human.</i>

583
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,559
<i>How can we be so different?</i>

584
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,395
<i>Her skin is so bright.</i>

585
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,863
<i>It looks translucent.</i>

586
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,434
<i>And she smells so nice.</i>

587
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:38,537
What's the matter?

588
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,373
Nothing. I'm fine.

589
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,775
Here. Wipe your face with this.

590
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,910
Thank you.

591
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,313
-Is this a Chanel handkerchief?
-Yes.

592
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:54,019
It's my first time to see Lei so agitated.

593
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,290
I think he really likes you.

594
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,725
No way.

595
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,460
I can't compare to you.

596
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,628
It's impossible for Huaze Lei to like me.

597
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,464
You're the one that he likes.

598
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:07,399
Is that so?

599
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,371
I still feel
that Lei would leave me someday.

600
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,041
I think I'll be sad when that happens.

601
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,012
<i>Why does Jing have the same
sad expression on her face</i>

602
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,548
<i>like Huaze Lei when she said that?</i>

603
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,756
You have some dirt over here.

604
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,761
It's a must for girls
to always be neat, clean, and pretty.

605
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:40,232
Because you don't know
when you'll meet the one you like.

606
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,236
Wow. Your shoes are so nice.

607
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,904
Really?

608
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,205
I like them too.

609
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,376
When I was in France, I heard them say

610
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,780
that everyone should have
a pair of good shoes.

611
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,818
Because good shoes take you
to the most beautiful places.

612
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,089
<i>Teng Tangjing is a really attractive girl.</i>

613
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,126
<i>Even though we belong to different worlds,</i>

614
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:09,961
<i>she's still so kind to me.</i>

615
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,498
<i>She's completely different
to girls like Baihe.</i>

616
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,402
<i>That's how a high-society heiress
should be.</i>

617
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,742
Thank you for what you did earlier.

618
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:08,153
But I'm sorry to cause a conflict

619
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,222
between you and Daoming Si.

620
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,459
It has nothing to do with you.

621
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,928
I was just in a bad mood earlier.

622
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:28,473
<i>Why?</i>

623
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,349
<i>Why did you save me earlier?</i>

624
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,151
<i>Why did you sacrifice yourself
because of me?</i>

625
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,224
Is there something you want to say?

626
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,640
If you don't have anything to do,
stay here.

627
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,666
<i>Stand up.</i>

628
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,670
Until when will you protect this wench?

629
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,570
What do you care?

630
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,506
-Let go!
-No!

631
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,974
It hurts! Let me go!

632
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,043
Daoming Si, you jerk! Let me go!

633
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,379
Fine.

634
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,614
Huaze Lei.

635
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,682
Our friendship is over!

636
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:45,784
I will never talk to you again!

637
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,978
<i>I don't know why.</i>

638
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,347
<i>But I'm staying
with this quiet and sad boy</i>

639
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,750
<i>at the school rooftop the whole night.</i>

640
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,920
<i>Even if I feel sick.</i>

641
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,789
<i>What does this mean?</i>

642
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,225
<i>I don't even know.</i>

643
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,767
It's almost dawn.

644
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,673
<i>Is he still waiting
for Jing's call, as usual?</i>

645
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,155
You really don't speak much, do you?

646
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,291
There are times when I speak even less.
You just haven't seen it.

647
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,192
I see.

648
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,663
Am I disturbing you?

649
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,831
I've been here the whole night.

650
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,600
It's fine.

651
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,002
You're not talkative. It's not annoying.

652
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,004
Thank you.

653
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,060
What's that?

654
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,031
You should leave quickly.

655
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,373
Huaze Lei, you're crazy!

656
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,241
You're lighting fireworks
at this time of the night.

657
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,309
And you didn't even tell me.

658
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,615
When I was little, a friend told me
that when it's almost sunrise,

659
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,517
all angels would go and worship God.

660
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,487
If you light fireworks during this time,
you'll get their attention.

661
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,858
And there would be more chances
for your wish to come true.

662
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,427
Haven't you heard of that?

663
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,000
It's really beautiful though.

664
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,840
At the back of the school.

665
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,444
At the tree in front
of the fifth electric post.

666
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,946
This should be it.

667
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,084
Qinghe.

668
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,056
There's no one here.

669
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,358
Qinghe.

670
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,259
Shancai!

671
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,227
You scared me!

672
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,797
Why are you dressed like that?
You look so strange.

673
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,599
No, I'm dressed this way
so that no one can find me.

674
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,003
Are those people
from last time still waiting for us?

675
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,204
I'm not sure.

676
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,373
I saw your note after I went to my locker.

677
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,676
What exactly are you planning?
I'm so dizzy.

678
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,244
Nothing. Let me tell you.

679
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,547
It was so scary yesterday!

680
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,117
So many people were chasing me
for the first time in my life.

681
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,387
It was just like in the movies.
It was so exciting!

682
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,256
That's why I'm wearing
this helmet to prepare for war.

683
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,899
Shancai.

684
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:56,768
What's the matter?

685
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,570
Nothing. I'm fine.

686
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,038
Are you getting dizzy from the heat?

687
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,873
No, I'm fine.

688
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:06,811
Then are you

689
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,681
going to that spring vacation?

690
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,883
You mean Hawaii?

691
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,785
It costs NTD 50,000.

692
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,720
Our family can live on that
for three months.

693
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,222
I'm not going.

694
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,624
Then do you want to take
a three-day yacht cruise?

695
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,593
A three-day yacht cruise?

696
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,228
Your family owns a yacht?

697
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,997
Well, you know.

698
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,499
My dad owns a lot of land.

699
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,370
He originally wanted to rent
a tour bus to go on a pilgrimage.

700
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,406
But the people in the village
said it's not cool enough.

701
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,175
So my dad thought

702
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,011
of renting a yacht instead.

703
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,181
That would be luxurious and cool enough.

704
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:46,885
He wants to worship Mazu
so he needs to go to a port.

705
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,454
But the fortune teller told my dad

706
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,222
that he can't be near water in April.

707
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,025
So my parents won't be able to go.

708
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,960
There are two slots available.

709
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:57,762
So...

710
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,232
I think we should go instead.

711
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,601
Shancai, what do you think?

712
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,336
Shancai!

713
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,171
What's the matter?

714
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,706
Shancai!

715
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:10,942
Shancai!

716
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,490
-Let me see.
-What's her temperature?

717
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,159
Oh, no. It's 38.6 Celsius!

718
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,627
It's so high!

719
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,162
That's good.

720
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,364
It's good to have a fever.
The higher, the better.

721
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,167
I never expected Shancai
would get a fever.

722
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,070
Ever since she was little,
she rarely catches a cold.

723
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:42,540
People say that only idiots
and stupid people don't get sick.

724
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,742
Now we have proof
that my daughter is not an idiot.

725
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,578
-This is great.
-What are you talking about?

726
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,647
I heard something though.

727
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,383
They said it's easier for people
who are in love to catch a cold.

728
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,854
-Maybe our daughter is in love!
-In love!

729
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,823
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

730
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,491
Should you be saying that
at a time like this?

731
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,160
I'm sick.

732
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,128
-Oh, that's right.
-You have a fever.

733
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,763
-Get well first.
-That's right.

734
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,932
Here. I made egg porridge.

735
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,034
Feed her slowly.
I'm going to my part-time job.

736
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,569
-Go to work.
-I'm leaving now.

737
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,005
-I'll handle this. Come on.
-I'm leaving.

738
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,741
Hey!

739
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,813
How can you eat
your daughter's egg porridge?

740
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,283
That's because I can't resist the smell.

741
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,652
I'm so hungry, Honey.

742
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,755
We only eat carrots every day.

743
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,590
I'm not a rabbit.

744
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,360
Of course, you're not a rabbit.

745
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:38,096
-You're almost bald!
-Bald?

746
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,965
Being bald is better than being stupid,
like our neighbor.

747
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,633
You're not stupid.

748
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,802
But the problem is your daughter
is really sick,

749
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,839
yet you're still eating her one
and only nutritious egg porridge.

750
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,607
Don't you have any conscience?

751
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,376
Don't you know we're very poor?

752
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:56,314
We've used up all our money
to pay for her tuition and our rent.

753
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,116
You should ride out the storm with us.

754
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,885
Are we so poor that I can't even have
a bite of her porridge?

755
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:01,919
Of course, you can't!

756
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,721
-If you take a bite, I'll take one too!
-Stop.

757
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,424
-If you eat it, I can eat it too!
-Stop arguing!

758
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,861
Can you two stop arguing? I'm sick.

759
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,462
Do it for me.

760
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,933
-That's right.
-It's all your fault.

761
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,101
-Get out.
-Okay.

762
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,003
-You don't have to take care of her.
-It's my fault.

763
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,005
-Go to work.
-I'll go to work. I'll do my thing.

764
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,374
He's even stealing porridge.

765
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,178
Shancai.

766
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,814
I've thought about it.

767
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,150
If you feel too much pressure,

768
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,119
you don't have to study
in that elite school anymore.

769
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,854
Really?

770
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:37,755
Yes.

771
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:40,658
I've really thought about it.

772
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,428
I think you should just date
that nouveau riche guy

773
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,530
who brought you home, Qinghe.

774
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,731
That would be quicker.

775
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,001
-I want to throw up.
-Maybe we can even save

776
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,336
on tuition for your elite school.

777
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,573
Hey, Shancai.
Don't you think that makes sense?

778
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,809
I think it's a good idea.

779
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,565
Are you in a better mood today?

780
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,707
I heard that Shancai is sick.

781
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,008
What?

782
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,244
That Shancai is sick?

783
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:35,413
Why are you so concerned?

784
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:37,782
I'm not.

785
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,517
Who says I'm concerned?

786
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,921
I was just wondering why that kind
of person would get sick.

787
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,881
