1
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,190
Where are you going?

2
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,392
I'm telling you, I can't bear it

3
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,128
when someone wants to hurt you
behind your back.

4
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,265
I feel like I'm on pens and needles.
thinking that you might be in danger,

5
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,000
It's "on pins and needles."

6
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,703
Whatever. Anyway...

7
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,338
Why do we even have these pictures?

8
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,906
Who took them?

9
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,808
I got have the address of the person.

10
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,477
Don't you want to know who framed you?

11
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,679
I...

12
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,148
Of course, I want to know.

13
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,351
Then, enough talking. Let's go.

14
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,757
It's this one.

15
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,111
Coming.

16
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,716
Why are you here?

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,518
You're still pretending.

18
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,221
You took these pictures, right?

19
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,225
Daoming Si, you must be mistaken.

20
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,693
How can it be her?

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,994
She's Li Zhen.

22
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,096
It's definitely not her.

23
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,165
How can I make a mistake?

24
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,735
Why did you frame Shancai?

25
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,138
Isn't she your best friend?

26
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,175
Was it really you?

27
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,881
How is that possible?

28
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,352
You were drunk that day
and Qinghe took you home.

29
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,788
How was it possible that you
took these pictures?

30
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,657
Actually, I wasn't drunk that day.

31
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,426
Qinghe did take me home.

32
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,061
But then I followed you.

33
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,729
That way, you wouldn't suspect me.

34
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,732
You did it on purpose?

35
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,068
Actually, I didn't think too much of it.

36
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,370
But when that foreigner took you
to a hotel, though,

37
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,172
it gave me an opportunity.

38
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,875
Li Zhen.

39
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,678
I never thought you were
that kind of person.

40
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,013
How could you say that?

41
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,518
You gave me the dress Daoming Si gave you
so that he would hate me

42
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,821
and make him look down on me.

43
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,090
So, you think you're better than me?

44
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,325
And if you were doing nothing wrong

45
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,461
do you think I could've had
a chance to take those photos?

46
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,031
You did such a shameful thing
and yet you're making excuses?

47
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,766
Why did you do that to me?

48
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,203
Aren't we best friends?

49
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,538
Best friends? Maybe.

50
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,310
If not for him,
I might have becomemyour best friend.

51
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,781
In school, we're both commoners.

52
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,350
I even work 1,000 times harder than you.

53
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,685
I'm on a scholarship.

54
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,653
I'm first honor in school,

55
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,257
yet our classmates don't like me
and he hates me.

56
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,695
You're so ordinary,
yet everyone likes you.

57
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,697
It's unfair that you
get everything that I can't.

58
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,765
Shut up!

59
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,933
Cut the crap!

60
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,102
Wait for your red card tomorrow.

61
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,904
Thank you.

62
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,641
Li Zhen.

63
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:40,180
I never thought that what I did
would make you hate me that much.

64
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,283
I'm sorry about that,

65
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:52,325
but, actually, I need to thank you too,
since we used to be best friends.

66
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,166
I've always had this with me,

67
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,004
but I don't think I need it anymore.

68
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,540
I'm giving it back.

69
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,653
Daoming Si.

70
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,888
Please...

71
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,058
Don't give her a red card.

72
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,982
<i>Shancai, I'm sorry.</i>

73
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,122
Shancai, when I came to school earlier,
I heard Li Zhen dropped out.

74
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,760
I see.

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,943
<i>Shancai, I'm sorry.</i>

76
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,646
<i>I may have done a lot of things
that hurt you,</i>

77
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,215
<i>but deep in my heart,</i>

78
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,052
<i>you're still my best friend in Yingde.</i>

79
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,797
Why are you so down?

80
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,567
You look like someone who never got
their money back after lending it.

81
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,003
Are you done? Who would owe me money?

82
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,738
My family is the one that owes money.

83
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,273
Who would owe us?

84
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,108
You're still sassy.

85
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,076
That means it's not that serious.

86
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,579
I know you're in a bad mood
because of Li Zhen.

87
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,916
Let me tell you. It's not worth it.

88
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,418
I'm not sad because she framed me up.

89
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,921
It's because she dropped out.

90
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,823
I didn't want her to drop out.

91
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,859
Stop thinking about it.

92
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,495
I knew you would feel that way.
That's why I took you out today.

93
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,196
Come in.

94
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,265
This store looks really expensive.

95
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,334
-I don't want to go inside.
-Come in.

96
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,736
-Why are you bringing me here?
-Welcome, Young Master Daoming Si.

97
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,306
Your sister ordered a lot of dresses
when she got married.

98
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,941
Thank you so much.

99
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,644
Find her some clothes
and give her a makeover.

100
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,279
-Yes.
-Wait.

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,981
Why should I change my clothes?

102
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,616
We're going on a vacation.

103
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,252
Vacation? Who says that I would go
on a vacation with you?

104
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,955
Take care of her.

105
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,189
Hey.

106
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
Not bad.

107
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,835
That suits you.

108
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,671
Do I look good on it?

109
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,741
If I say you do, nobody would
dare say you don't.

110
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,011
And this gives you a new
and refreshment look.

111
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,612
It's "a new and refreshing look."

112
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,481
Did you really study Chinese before?

113
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,683
Whatever. Let's go.

114
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,717
Go where?

115
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,652
On a vacation.

116
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,020
Vacation? Where are we going?

117
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,455
Okinawa.

118
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,057
-In Ryukyu, Japan?
-Yes.

119
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,126
It's not like we're going somewhere near.

120
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,534
I already called your house.

121
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,769
Your dad answered.

122
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,104
He said it doesn't matter how long
we'll be there,

123
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,973
even better if you never come home.

124
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,675
Your parents already trust me too much.

125
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,979
My god, what idiot parents.

126
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,013
Hey.

127
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,581
You're here.

128
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,682
Where's Meizuo?

129
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,686
-I'll go find him.
-Okay, see you later.

130
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,021
Young Master, your luggage.

131
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,356
Just leave it here.

132
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,059
-This is the phone you asked for.
-Okay, you can go.

133
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,226
Okay.

134
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,265
Don't I have one already?
Why are you giving me another one?

135
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,333
This is a mobile with the Japanese system.

136
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,968
You can use it in Okinawa.

137
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,904
Thank you.

138
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,506
<i>He's so thoughtful.</i>

139
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,110
-Lei.
-Sorry, I'm late.

140
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,249
<i>Is that really Lei?</i>

141
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,886
<i>Why did he change
after coming back from France?</i>

142
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,124
-Let's go.
-Okay.

143
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,358
I'll help you.

144
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,693
Thank you.

145
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,303
LUE ON THE BEACH

146
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,354
What is he talking about?

147
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,158
He said we've already reserved
the whole hotel.

148
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,461
Check which room you like.
You can choose whichever you want.

149
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,497
You can find him if you need anything.

150
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,671
What a nice place!

151
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,473
I can see the ocean.

152
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,177
Let's go.

153
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,980
-What are you doing?
-What?

154
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,848
This is the key.

155
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,083
Thank you.

156
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,651
-Let's go.
-Just go straight ahead.

157
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,197
What a nice room.

158
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,066
Can we see the ocean from the window?

159
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,404
Of course.

160
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,173
I chose this room especially for you.

161
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,141
You can see the ocean at dawn.

162
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,182
This room belongs to us.

163
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,283
What?

164
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,984
Daoming Si.

165
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,586
I'm hungry.

166
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:46,806
Shut up.-

167
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,621
You are exaggerating.

168
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,889
What are you laughing at?

169
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,492
What did you buy?

170
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,729
You're bad at this.

171
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,332
Am I?

172
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,334
You haven't told the joke
but you're laughing already.

173
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,103
You're laughing but I don't get it.
What's so funny?

174
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,872
-It's fine. I'll just laugh with you.
-That's right.

175
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,374
Let's just laugh together.

176
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,328
Why aren't you eating?

177
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,697
Eat some more.

178
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,999
Okay, thank you.

179
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,710
<i>My heart is beating so fast.</i>

180
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,746
<i>I'm staying with Daoming Si in one room.</i>

181
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,447
-<i>I don't know what I should do.</i>
-Goodnight.

182
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,016
<i>Why am I feeling this way?</i>

183
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,225
What's the matter?

184
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,563
What's wrong?

185
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,931
It's nothing.

186
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,433
I'm just a bit tired.

187
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,235
Then lie down first.

188
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,936
Sleep early.

189
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,438
Sleep?

190
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,243
Actually, I'm not that tired.

191
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,477
And...

192
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,614
I'm not used to sleeping early.

193
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,118
I want to watch Japanese television shows.

194
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,121
Don't misunderstand.

195
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,157
Even though I've confessed
my feelings for you,

196
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,358
before you even said yes...

197
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,027
I'm not the type of person
you're thinking of.

198
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,729
And I won't do that kind of thing to you.

199
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,333
Daoming Si.

200
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,370
I'm also a man.

201
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,938
I'd be lying if I say I'm not impatient.

202
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,239
However...

203
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,241
Just go to bed.

204
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,879
Do you want to sleep on the bed
while I'll sleep on the sofa?

205
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,247
The sofa?

206
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,417
How can I let the girl I like
sleep on the sofa?

207
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,219
Just sleep, okay?

208
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,625
<i>My god, I can't sleep.</i>

209
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,494
<i>I keep thinking about
how Huaze Lei is acting.</i>

210
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,974
<i>Stop thinking about it too much.</i>

211
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,442
<i>How annoying.</i>

212
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>I'll go outside and take a walk.</i>

213
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,840
Why are you here?

214
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,408
No reason.

215
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,213
Where's Daoming Si?

216
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,483
He...

217
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,117
He's already asleep.

218
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,088
Did you just stay here the whole time?

219
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,289
Yes.

220
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,196
Aren't you feeling well?

221
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,635
You'll get sick if you stay here.

222
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,506
What are you doing?

223
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,142
Ten minutes, no. Just five minutes.

224
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,577
Can you hold me tight?

225
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,313
I'll be okay in the morning.

226
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,083
But tonight, I can't.

227
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:03,356
Can't you ask the girl you're with
to hold you?

228
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,490
I don't want to.

229
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,093
I don't want a girl I don't know
holding me.

230
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,428
Please hold me tight, okay?

231
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,330
Okay?

232
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,649
<i>I've always hoped that Huaze Lei
can be in my arms.</i>

233
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,285
<i>In those hell-like days,</i>

234
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:36,989
<i>no matter how cold he was to me,
I couldn't take my eyes off him.</i>

235
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,993
<i>When he smiled at me,
I could forget all the pain.</i>

236
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,131
<i>Now, Huaze Lei is in my arms.</i>

237
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,099
My heart...

238
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,041
I lived with Jing in Paris.

239
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,211
That was the best time of my life.

240
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,783
We talked about our childhood memories.

241
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,421
And we just wandered around
the streets of Paris.

242
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,991
Jing was in my arms.

243
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,360
I was holding her.

244
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:22,001
However, those days didn't last.

245
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,638
Jing started studying.

246
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,574
She went to class in the morning.

247
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,577
She was a lawyer's secretary at night.

248
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,747
She was so busy every day.

249
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,984
From the moment she left
until she came home,

250
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,821
I just stayed at home doing nothing.

251
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,225
By the way,

252
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,394
we always talked about you.

253
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,729
Me?

254
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,963
Yes.

255
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,332
Jing says she likes you very much.

256
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,267
Really?

257
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:01,507
She said you're like
the yellow flower in the wild.

258
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,109
-Yellow flower?
-Yes.

259
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,411
It's a type of yellow blossom.

260
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,947
It's very small, but its
vitality is very strong.

261
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,082
It can survive anywhere.

262
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,751
And you can see it everywhere.

263
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,854
That means it's just like a weed.

264
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,155
That's right.

265
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,991
No matter where it goes it can grow.

266
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,028
It welcomes the wind and blooms.

267
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,132
That's because its life is very cheap.

268
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,102
I suddenly remembered
one time you fought with Ah Si.

269
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,937
Which time?

270
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,739
You're parasites who hide under your dads.

271
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,874
You've never earned any money.

272
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,509
You don't have
any contribution to society.

273
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,844
How dare you speak so arrogantly here?

274
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,813
You're right.

275
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,582
Once we leave our parents,

276
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,384
we become useless.

277
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,954
You know I was autistic before, right?

278
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,423
Yes.

279
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:55,528
At that time, Jing slowly
drew me out from the shadows of my autism.

280
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,565
However, I've never really changed.

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,769
I'm still a little kid like back then.

282
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,240
I can't do anything for the woman I love.

283
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,253
Why am I telling you these things?

285
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,091
I always tell you things
that even the F4 don't know.

286
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,899
-It's Ah Si, right?
-Yes.

287
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,968
He really cares about you.

288
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,403
Go back already.

289
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,405
How about you?

290
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,674
I want to stay here a bit longer.

291
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,142
But...

292
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,111
I'm fine now.

293
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,579
I see.

294
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,814
-I'll go ahead then.
-Okay.

295
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:55,888
Shancai.

296
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,591
Thank you.

297
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,292
Okay.

298
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,984
What were you doing?

299
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,086
Why are you all here?

300
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,454
Where did you go?

301
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,189
Me?

302
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,324
I couldn't sleep earlier.

303
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,094
So... I went for a walk alone.

304
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,630
I told you not to worry.

305
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,698
Do you know how worried this guy was?

306
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,968
He suddenly barged into our rooms
and shouted, "Shancai is gone!"

307
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,070
He was worried
that you might have drowned.

308
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,706
You don't have to say it.

309
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,909
I'm going to bed.

310
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,013
We need to be up early tomorrow.
Sleep already.

311
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,581
Hey.

312
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,184
You'll sleep at a time like this?

313
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,985
Daoming Si.

314
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,858
I'm sorry.

315
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,660
You know how to apologize?

316
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,862
Why did you get up?

317
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,666
Remember to leave a note next time.

318
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,535
Go to bed already.

319
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,611
<i>That's not true.</i>

320
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,779
<i>I lied.</i>

321
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,215
<i>I was at the beach hugging Huaze Lei.</i>

322
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,083
<i>I couldn't ignore him.</i>

323
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,785
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

324
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,233
Lei.

325
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,737
Lei.

326
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,039
Yes!

327
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,342
Well done.

328
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:35,915
Lei.

329
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,787
Ah Si.

330
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,224
Did anything happen
between you and Huaze Lei last night?

331
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,227
Nothing happened between me and Huaze Lei.

332
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,030
-No way.
-Yes.

333
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,831
He didn't come back the whole night.

334
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,411
Lei, you dropped something.

335
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,614
Your phone.

336
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,015
Lei.

337
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,987
I was talking with Shancai
here last night.

338
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,221
She must have left it.

339
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,489
You give it back.

340
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,091
Your ball.

341
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,327
Where did you go?

342
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,128
Me?

343
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,064
I couldn't sleep earlier.

344
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,900
So... I went for a walk alone.

345
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,805
Ah Si, why are you just standing there?

346
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:37,576
What were you doing?

347
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,811
Are you all right?

348
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,080
Is there anything between you two?

349
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,115
What did you say?

350
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:44,917
Are you all right?

351
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,689
What's the matter? Does your head hurt?

352
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,991
Was I too strong?

353
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,793
I'm fine. I'll go rest for a while.

354
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,961
You guys continue playing.

355
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:57,997
What's the matter?

356
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,365
I'll go check on him.

357
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,500
You hit the ball too hard.

358
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,150
Where's your phone?

359
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,121
<i>Oh, no.</i>

360
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,223
<i>I don't know where I dropped
it last night.</i>

361
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,227
<i>I can't find it in the room
or in my pockets.</i>

362
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:33,565
<i>I can't let him know
that I was with Huaze Lei last night.</i>

363
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,703
It's in our room.

364
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,010
Shancai.

365
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,048
Shancai.

366
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,150
Qinghe.

367
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,484
Shancai.

368
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,654
Qinghe, how did you find us here?

369
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,023
I couldn't find you so I asked around.

370
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,960
They said you, Daoming Si, and the others
went on a vacation to Okinawa.

371
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,495
That's why I came here.

372
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,664
You're a bad friend.
You didn't ask me to come.

373
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,266
I was just dragged here.

374
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,700
Good thing I'm smart.

375
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,536
I went to Daoming Si's house
and asked them.

376
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,305
I booked a room next to yours.

377
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,840
Nouveau riche.

378
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,142
-Who said you could be here?
-I came to look for Shancai.

379
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:22,214
No, actually, I just brought you
some magazines to read.

380
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,016
Look. Jing's on the magazine.

381
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,688
It says that a very powerful man
in France is marrying her.

382
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,889
What?

383
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,861
"Although Teng Tangjing is hesitant
regarding the proposal,

384
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,798
she couldn't resist
the man's strong pursuits.

385
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,000
They plan to get married within the year."

386
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,836
No way.

387
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,806
Lei, did you know about this?

388
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,041
I do.

389
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,643
It was already a hot rumor
when I was in Paris.

390
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,078
Don't you care at all?

391
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,346
I don't.

392
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,048
It's over anyway.

393
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,027
<i>This is the reason why
he changed this much.</i>

394
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,597
<i>He wants to get away from that sad place.</i>

395
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,736
Let's play ball.

396
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,763
I'm fine.

397
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,997
Go back.

398
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,404
I told you I'm fine.

399
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,272
Go back already.

400
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,018
Are you crying?

401
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,655
Why are you crying?

402
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,992
Didn't I tell you I was fine?

403
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,161
Go back, quickly.

404
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,034
I forced myself not to think of you,

405
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,304
but I really can't do it.

406
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,141
You're all I think about.

407
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,613
Why can't you be happy?

408
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,893
Why didn't I fall in love
with you instead?

409
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,357
You're so thin.

410
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,962
If I hug you more tightly,
it feels like I'll break you.

411
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,164
It's fine.

412
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,932
Hold me tight.

413
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,802
It's fine even if I break.

414
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,444
<i>I don't care about anything else anymore.</i>

415
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,379
<i>Even if it's the end of the world today,</i>

416
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,981
<i>I don't care.</i>

417
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,451
<i>Huaze Lei is the only one I see.</i>

418
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,364
Ah Si.

419
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,436
So this is what's going on.

420
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,473
Daoming Si.

421
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,951
Huaze Lei.

422
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,226
Daoming Si, wait.

423
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,828
Please let me explain.

424
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,731
What else is there to explain
at this point?

425
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,941
I really like you.

426
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,880
I like you with all my heart and soul.

427
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,349
And you?

428
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,455
You tore my heart apart again.

429
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:39,998
I'm sorry.

430
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,469
-I...
-Don't touch me.

431
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,508
Let's just pretend that nothing happened.

432
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:56,047
Don't talk to me ever again.

433
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,996
I'm sorry, Daoming Si.

434
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,633
I didn't want to hurt you this way.

435
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,336
I never thought...

436
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,407
I never thought...

437
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,779
Because I like you.

438
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,516
I really like you.

439
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,385
If you say you didn't,

440
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,521
I believe you.

441
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,093
Did you find him?

442
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,429
No.

443
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,464
He really did go back
to Taiwan on his own.

444
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,537
What should we do then?

445
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,587
Are you shaking?

446
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:18,590
Yes.

447
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,058
How strange.

448
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,097
Don't worry.

449
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,432
I'm here.

450
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,671
<i>Huaze Lei's hand is so cold.</i>

451
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,907
<i>It's completely different
from Daoming Si's warm hand.</i>

452
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,475
<i>However, I...</i>

453
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,811
<i>chose these cold hands.</i>

454
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,551
<i>I will never see that guy's smile again.</i>

455
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:09,708
I'm home.

456
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,576
Shancai, you're home.

457
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:16,348
I immediately felt
a sun-kissed beach girl vibe.

458
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,516
Okinawa's beach
is really beautiful, right?

459
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,986
I really hope you'll get married soon.

460
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,990
Then I can use my mother-in-law status
to travel to Okinawa.

461
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,727
Shancai, did Daoming Si propose to you?

462
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,330
Did you sleep together?

463
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,698
Any new developments?

464
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,767
Or just kissing,

465
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,403
strolling on the beach?

466
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,404
Mom.

467
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,041
-I'm sorry to disappoint you.
-What?

468
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,845
What you said will never happen.

469
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,749
I'm really tired. Can I rest for a bit?

470
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,630
Lei and Shancai?

471
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:06,998
That's impossible.

472
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,467
We all know how Lei feels about Jing.

473
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,636
Didn't that magazine that Qinghe brought

474
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,773
mention that Jing might really
marry that man, though?

475
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,910
No wonder Lei completely changed
after coming back from Paris.

476
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,480
Didn't you have a similar experience too?

477
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,052
Don't talk about me, okay?

478
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,988
-We're talking about Lei and...
-Shut up, you two. Okay?

479
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,356
I'm warning you.

480
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:32,857
Don't mention their names again.

481
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,826
Ah Si, you're such a coward.

482
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,262
Not mentioning Lei and Shancai's name
won't solve the problem.

483
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,963
You'll see Lei again tomorrow in school.

484
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,732
-You'll also see...
-I told not to...

485
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,367
Ah Si.

486
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,468
Calm down.

487
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,704
Why are you hitting one of your friends?

488
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,476
You're right.

489
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,813
I shouldn't hit a friend.

490
00:36:56,114 --> 00:37:00,051
That's why I definitely
won't forgive Huaze Lei.

491
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,321
Say something.

492
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,626
Lei.

493
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,461
-I really...
-Stop it.

494
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,832
From now on, you're not my friend.

495
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,301
Since you chose to be a traitor,

496
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,038
from now on, you're not part
of the F4 anymore.

497
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,241
Ah Si, cut it out.

498
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,675
I'm going home.

499
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:58,977
Calm down, okay?

500
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,345
Go away.

501
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,752
<i>I...</i>

502
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,054
<i>I disappointed Daoming Si so much.</i>

503
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,190
<i>I feel so bad.</i>

504
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,559
<i>I have to apologize to him.</i>

505
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,769
Have you seem Daoming Si?

506
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,571
Why are you still looking for him?

507
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,240
I...

508
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,075
If you want to apologize, there's no need.

509
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,344
Have you forgotten Ah Si's motto,

510
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,914
"If apologizing is effective,
what are the police for?"

511
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,851
And it's too late to apologize now.

512
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,488
What do you mean?

513
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,858
Ah Si already kicked out Lei.

514
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,461
F4 doesn't exist anymore.

515
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,231
-How can that happen?
-How can it not?

516
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,733
I never thought that you were that good.

517
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,403
Playing the F4 into your hands.

518
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,339
Forget it, Ximen. Stop it.

519
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,614
<i>Daoming Si kicked Huaze Lei out of the F4.</i>

520
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,784
<i>They really ended their friendship
because of me.</i>

521
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,252
<i>I...</i>

522
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,820
<i>I didn't want it to turn out this way.</i>

523
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,188
<i>What should I do?</i>

524
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,407
Want to eat something?

525
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,113
Thank you.

526
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,622
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,226
I heard you've been kicked out of the F4.

528
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,695
It's all my fault.

529
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,665
Why are you apologizing to me?

530
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,170
If I didn't go to the beach then...

531
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,539
I kissed you because I wanted to.

532
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,708
It's not your fault.

533
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,549
Lend me your notebook.

534
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,151
Okay.

535
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,099
Ah Si's face...

536
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,103
must look like this right now.

537
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,380
What an ugly drawing.

538
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,382
Actually, he should look like this.

539
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,921
His eyebrows are very thick.

540
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,823
And he should look angry.

541
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:01,793
Then his eyes are like that of a goldfish.

542
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,396
He has a pineapple hairstyle.

543
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:28,252
Let's go on a date on Sunday.

544
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,808
What's the matter?
Is Young Master getting mad again?

545
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,776
Yes.

546
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,812
I've been with Young Master
since he was a kid.

547
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,215
This is the first time
I've seen him this drunk.

548
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,453
Is he really that brokenhearted?

549
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,423
He broke something again.

550
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,891
What can we do?

551
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:57,942
Have you been waiting long?

552
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,379
No, I just got here.

553
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,982
Where are we going?

554
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,584
Have you thought about it?

555
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,220
I haven't. How about you?

556
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,857
I haven't either.

557
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,727
-Let's just walk along there.
-Okay.

558
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,615
<i>Huaze Lei is really handsome.</i>

559
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,120
<i>Actually, Daoming Si
is really handsome too.</i>

560
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,456
<i>But his haircut is so funny.</i>

561
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,825
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

562
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,560
<i>Didn't I say I need to forget about him?</i>

563
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,596
<i>I'll have a happy date today.</i>

564
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,864
<i>Stop thinking about him.</i>

565
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,702
What's wrong? Do you have a headache?

566
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,637
-No.
-Okay.

567
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:01,405
-Let's go.
-Okay.

568
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,856
<i>Lei hasn't said anything for a while now.</i>

569
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,559
Shancai.

570
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,019
