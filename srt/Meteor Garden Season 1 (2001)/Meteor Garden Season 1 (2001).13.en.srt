1
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,021
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,723
It's all my fault.

3
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,293
I didn't mean to do it.

4
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,900
I just couldn't bear seeing you
so close with another guy.

5
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,235
You need to look sad now.

6
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,870
You're a bunch of idiots!

7
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,339
Don't complain. Just do as I say.

8
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,977
I...

9
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,714
I am...

10
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,315
-The last word.
-Yeah.

11
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,017
Why should I apologize
to that kind of person?

12
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,986
I don't get it.
I'd rather die than apologize.

13
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,255
You appeared out of nowhere
and beat up that guy beside Shancai.

14
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,958
What did you call her? A slut.

15
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,660
Don't you think you went too far?

16
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,129
If I were Shancai, I would hate you, too.

17
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,732
You called her in such a disgusting way.
No wonder she hates you.

18
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,968
Lei, what do you think?

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,005
What do you mean?

20
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,008
I'm telling you, maybe Shancai
won't talk to you ever again.

21
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,010
So? What do I have to do with it?

22
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,779
I don't care if she hates or likes me.

23
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,817
I never really cared from the beginning.

24
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,856
Apologize to her.

25
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,125
It's really your fault.

26
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,693
-Why should I...
-Go.

27
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,697
Shan...

28
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,265
Shancai.

29
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,004
Ah Si has something to tell you.

30
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,675
Shancai, Daoming Si looks upset now.

31
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,309
I don't care.

32
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,112
From now on, he's invisible to me.

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,648
-Invisible?
-Yes.

34
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,417
I won't talk to him anymore.

35
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,463
See?

36
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,914
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

37
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,617
Why didn't you get a day off
and rest at home?

38
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,019
You shouldn't be working right now.

39
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,555
It's fine. I can't stand staying at home
and doing nothing.

40
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,756
I would rather work here.

41
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,758
Actually, I'm fine.

42
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,359
Welcome.

43
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,761
You can also order here.

44
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,266
Boss, we're leaving now.

45
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,505
Hey, hurry up.
Shancai is about to get off work.

46
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,073
You have to talk to her nicely.

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,975
You can't treat her
like she owes money or something.

48
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,643
She does owe me money.

49
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,412
Young Master Ah Si.

50
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,681
You're here to apologize today.

51
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,483
Please mind your attitude, okay?

52
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,153
You can't go to the audition
because you're hurt.

53
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,287
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,059
Hey.

55
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,562
What's the matter?

56
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,800
Wait, isn't that the man
who hit me the other day?

57
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,569
I'm sorry, Xiaoshun.

58
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,238
I got you involved in this.

59
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,940
But why did he hit me?

60
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,543
That's because...

61
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,948
I guess he likes you, right?

62
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,453
He saw you and me having fun,

63
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,355
so he got mad and hit me.

64
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,057
That's not the case.

65
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,894
That Daoming Si is a lunatic.

66
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,433
The other two are members of F4, right?

67
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,003
What is he doing here?
Taking revenge on me?

68
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,372
I don't think so.

69
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,575
Anyway, you should stay away
from those guys from now on.

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,477
Ah Si, what are you waiting for?

71
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,346
Shancai was mad at this guy
and released her anger on him.

72
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,549
I told you to apologize to her.

73
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,750
Shut up!

74
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,885
Why should I apologize to that ugly girl?

75
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,754
So they came here to apologize.

76
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,323
Why should I apologize?
I've done nothing wrong.

77
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,060
Yeah, you don't need to apologize.
Shancai doesn't suit you anyway.

78
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,895
She's got no boobs or butt.

79
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,997
She is rude and unrefined.

80
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,666
She is way below our league.

81
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,434
But you love her,
and there's nothing we can do.

82
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,869
Keep talking and I'll beat you up.

83
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,005
I mean, stir-fried <i>suancai</i>
has no charm as a woman at all.

84
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,240
In short,

85
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,576
she must be a plank of wood
in her past life.

86
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,544
-You idiots! Bastards!
-Who said that?

87
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,117
How could you scold the F4 like that?

88
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,388
Do you know those guys
are scarier than mobs?

89
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,890
Especially Daoming Si.

90
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,726
There's nothing different
between him and a beast.

91
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,728
If he saw you back there,

92
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,064
he might look for trouble with you
even when you're working.

93
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,766
But can you just let it go?

94
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,468
They said you have no boobs or butt.

95
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,470
-A plank of wood in your past life.
-Don't repeat it!

96
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,938
I get mad whenever I think of them.

97
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,044
Actually, when you scolded them
back for me,

98
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,080
I felt so good.

99
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,082
But that was too dangerous.

100
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,684
Don't you ever get
in their way again, okay?

101
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,620
Really?

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,456
I've learned a lot today.

103
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,125
What did you learn?

104
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,629
A friend once told me

105
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,565
that if people can't be honest
with each other,

106
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,467
there can never be true freedom,

107
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,836
and things can go south easily.

108
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,040
If you can't break away from the darkness
in your heart,

109
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,443
you can never experience
true honesty and freedom.

110
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,445
"Honesty and freedom"?

111
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,048
Why are you talking like an old man?

112
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,417
And why are you talking about this
all of a sudden?

113
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,053
Yeah, why am I telling you this?

114
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,323
Hey, it's late now,
and we should get going.

115
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,257
Yeah.

116
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,127
Hey, I have a friend
who is a photographer.

117
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,397
The magazine he's working for
has a column about relationships.

118
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,666
They need a male model and a female model.

119
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,034
I think you'll be interested, right?

120
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,136
What do you think?
Let's take the job together?

121
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,606
Me? I was so scared the last time
I was interviewed as a model.

122
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,174
And you're asking me to go to another one?

123
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,643
He's my friend so you're very safe.

124
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,012
Please do it as a favor to my friend.

125
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,147
Let's go there tomorrow.

126
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,448
Okay.

127
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,988
Come on, Xiaoshun.

128
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,291
Tell your friend to relax. Take it easy.

129
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,061
Easy, one more shot. Don't be so nervous.

130
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,830
All right, let's try this one.
Let's take one shot.

131
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, do a pose for me.

132
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,438
All right, another pose.

133
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,541
Great, perfect.

134
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,543
All right, you two
can pose more naturally.

135
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,113
Xiaoshun, you can stand closer to her.

136
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,749
All right, take it easy.

137
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,917
Okay, now.

138
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,187
All right, Xiaoshun, you're good friends.

139
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,256
Show me how good is your friendship.

140
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,858
All right.

141
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,127
Okay, Xiaoshun, put your arms around her.

142
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,299
Miss, put your hands
on Xiaoshun's hands, okay?

143
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,035
All right, let's take a shot.

144
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,439
Okay, smile more naturally. Good.

145
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,511
Good. All right, Xiaoshun,
hug her tighter.

146
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,813
Great.

147
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,089
How was it? Are you tired from posing?

148
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,592
It's actually pretty tiring.

149
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,328
I guess I'm just not used to it.

150
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,704
Wait.

151
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,142
There's a guy around you, you know?

152
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,411
As long as you're with him,

153
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,079
bad things will happen.

154
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,615
What's the matter?

155
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,152
That lady is good at fortune-telling.

156
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,988
She doesn't look like
a good fortune-teller.

157
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,994
Ma'am, do you remember me?

158
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,497
I'm sorry, I don't.

159
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,472
Is this guy your boyfriend?

160
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,041
No.

161
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,612
He looks like my husband.

162
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,514
What? Your husband?

163
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,018
Little girl.

164
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,153
Here are my words.

165
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,355
Let the past stay in the past.

166
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,257
Stop looking back.

167
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,261
If you want to find your happiness,

168
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,996
you have to remember what I said.

169
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,733
Let the past stay in the past.

170
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,969
Stop looking back.

171
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,307
I got it, ma'am.

172
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,275
Remember my words.

173
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,811
Thank you.

174
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,985
Hey, who is she?

175
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,255
Maybe she's a master fortune-teller.

176
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,992
She doesn't look like one.

177
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,429
Doesn't she? I think she is pretty good.

178
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,702
There she is. What are you doing here?

179
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,504
How did you get here?

180
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,406
Here are my words. You'll die tomorrow.

181
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,142
Fine, I'll die tomorrow.

182
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,476
-Here are my words.
-Yeah.

183
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,446
-You'll hit the jackpot tomorrow.
-Hit the jackpot tomorrow.

184
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,847
<i>Just like what that lady said,</i>

185
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,116
<i>I have to unchain myself
from the curse of F4.</i>

186
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,886
I want to check if they said anything
about that new Dior bag

187
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,388
in the latest issue of British magazines.

188
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,190
-You can't buy one in Taiwan.
-Yeah.

189
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,427
Didn't you date a tech nouveau riche guy
from Silicon Valley before?

190
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,595
How did it turn out?

191
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,766
-Don't talk about it, okay?
-Did you get him?

192
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,869
-What's wrong?
-It was going smoothly at first.

193
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,671
Then...

194
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,145
Really? You're so disgusting.

195
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,513
Am I disgusting?

196
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,148
He's the disgusting one, okay?

197
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,717
Then you should read this one.

198
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,054
"Men's secret sexy body area."

199
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,822
-You're the disgusting one.
-No, I'm not.

200
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,257
Why do you think I'd like to read this?

201
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,292
Wait a minute.

202
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,627
This... Wait.

203
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,796
-Isn't this that...
-What?

204
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,366
-Shancai?
-Yeah.

205
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,602
That irritating Shancai.

206
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,438
I can't imagine she worked as a model
for a clothing magazine. Really?

207
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,712
It's so disgusting. How could she pose
for this kind photos?

208
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,281
-It's so embarrassing, yeah.
-She has no shame.

209
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,849
She's also seducing the F4 at school.

210
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,318
-That's already too much.
-Right.

211
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,387
Now she is working for this kind
of magazine after school.

212
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,656
She is a disgrace to Yingde.

213
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,159
I can't imagine we tried
to make friends with her before.

214
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,294
We should give this magazine to F4.

215
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,296
Let them see how shameless she can be.

216
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,438
Shancai, my dad bought me a yacht.

217
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,173
-Really?
-It's called Qinghe.

218
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,610
We'll sail out to the sea on summer break.

219
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,611
Hello.

220
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,012
Xiaoshun.

221
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,081
What's up?

222
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,051
Okay. I know that place.
Let's talk when we meet.

223
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,953
Okay, I'll go there right now. Bye-bye.

224
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,321
Shancai, who called you?

225
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,591
A friend from work.
He has something to tell me.

226
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,892
Maybe something about work.

227
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,395
You can go back to the classroom now.
I'll get back there in a minute.

228
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,597
What is she up to?

229
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,432
A friend from work?

230
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,109
Hey! Where's Shancai?

231
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,312
I'm asking you.

232
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,882
She will be in the classroom in a minute.

233
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,684
I'm asking you where is she now.

234
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,353
She said she had to meet her friend.

235
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,523
You can't even talk properly.

236
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,198
Xiaoshun.

237
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,700
What are you doing here?

238
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,168
I brought you the magazine.

239
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,436
-Magazine?
-Yeah.

240
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,312
How could it be like this?
This isn't what you told me.

241
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,047
Why is the title so explicit?

242
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,149
They only made the title kind of explicit.

243
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,950
The article itself is pretty wholesome.

244
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,286
There is nothing wrong with our photos.

245
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,155
This is not some shady magazine.

246
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,123
Don't get mad at me, okay?

247
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,826
Darn it, I feel so much regret.

248
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,961
Why did I decide to work
for this magazine?

249
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,496
What should I do?

250
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,066
I was afraid you would get mad
so I let you see it as soon as possible.

251
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,234
No one will notice
since there are only a few photos in it.

252
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,670
Him again?

253
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,439
Why is he following you?

254
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,942
None of your business.
We're just friends--

255
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,777
It's because Shancai is my partner.

256
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,179
Partner?

257
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,748
Xiaoshun, what are you talking about?

258
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,118
I mean it. Shancai is my best partner.

259
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,787
Shancai, have you lost your mind?

260
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,422
You posed with him
for this crappy magazine,

261
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,791
and now you're flirting with him
at school. What's that?

262
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,226
It's none of your business.

263
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,260
Are you jealous?

264
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,597
You're jealous, right?

265
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,466
Would you dare say no?

266
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,801
Can't you admit it?

267
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,404
What are you talking about, Xiaoshun?
Stop it.

268
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,005
Shancai, keep quiet.

269
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,443
You've been spying on her.

270
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,079
You get paranoid when you don't see her.

271
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,316
You go nuts when she goes
against your will.

272
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,785
So you love her very much, don't you?

273
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,819
What are you talking about?

274
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,621
-Daoming Si!
-Do you want to get your ass kicked?

275
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,958
Shancai, take this chance
to talk things out.

276
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,693
Do you love him?

277
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,429
Do you love this man
who behaves like a kid?

278
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,197
Why should I answer that question?

279
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,866
Why don't you answer it?

280
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,301
You have to tell him how you feel,
so you can get rid of him.

281
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,070
He's been controlling you.

282
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,405
He's been ruining your life.

283
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,874
Weren't you badly bullied by him?

284
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,143
-You're a terrible man.
-You know nothing!

285
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,013
-Shancai, tell him.
-Shut up!

286
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,783
-I told you to shut up!
-Stop it!

287
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,385
I told you to stop it, Daoming Si!

288
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,223
I'm not in love with anyone.

289
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,559
Daoming Si.

290
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,795
Every time I'm with you,

291
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,097
I feel like I'm going to suffocate.

292
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,266
In this school,

293
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,601
it seems that I have to be
under your control.

294
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,337
Under your authority,

295
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,040
I almost can't breathe anymore.

296
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,111
I want a normal life

297
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,116
rather than a stressful one
like what it is right now.

298
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:54,720
It seems that I can't do anything
without your permission.

299
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,155
I have no freedom.

300
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,925
I can't take it anymore.

301
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,561
I really can't take it anymore.

302
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,498
I want to be free from you and the F4.

303
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,401
So I'm begging you,

304
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,536
leave me alone, okay?

305
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,509
Shancai, let's go.

306
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:22,915
I love you.

307
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,060
I love you.

308
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,231
I don't know why I love you so much.

309
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,167
In my eyes,

310
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,036
you're always the only one I can see.

311
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,771
Why are you so annoying, Daoming Si?

312
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,541
Shancai.

313
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,743
I know I'm so annoying.

314
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,346
But I want you to know

315
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,450
that if you run away,

316
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,419
I'll chase after you

317
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,722
no matter where you are,

318
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,824
even if you're in hell.

319
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,094
No matter which corner
of the world you're in,

320
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,796
I'll chase you down.

321
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,900
I want you to know one thing.

322
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,771
That is, I want you.

323
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,543
<i>I can't believe Daoming Si loves me.</i>

324
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,979
Shancai, ignore him. Let's go.

325
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,874
CALLING DAOMING SI

326
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,052
Lei, have you really not seen Ah Si?

327
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,087
No.

328
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,323
I haven't seen him for two or three days.

329
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,126
That's weird. Did he really disappear?

330
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,762
I called his home number
but he wasn't there.

331
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,997
Maybe he is at his mansion.

332
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,734
Why would he do that all of a sudden?

333
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,072
Hey, maybe it's
because Shancai is in the magazine?

334
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,676
That guy working with Shancai is...

335
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,878
Xiaoshun.

336
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,848
He seems to be the male model
posing with her.

337
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,719
Ah Si has already beat him up.

338
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,089
If he saw the title in the magazine,

339
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,691
do you think he would act
like nothing happened?

340
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
I'm a little worried about Shancai.

341
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,429
Ah Si is like a weapon.

342
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,999
We are his good friends
who have grown up with him,

343
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,468
but we still don't know what he will do.

344
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,436
The first thing is to find him.
The rest can wait.

345
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,171
Shall we go check his mansion?

346
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,373
Okay.

347
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,553
<i>Red card.</i>

348
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,423
<i>I didn't know
I would have another red card.</i>

349
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:21,861
<i>It seems like Daoming Si
is saying goodbye to me.</i>

350
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,796
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

351
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,465
<i>I had no idea I've hurt you so badly.</i>

352
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,306
<i>I love you.</i>

353
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,377
I don't know why I love you so much.

354
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,215
<i>My mind is consumed
with what he just said.</i>

355
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,352
<i>My heart is going to explode</i>

356
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,487
<i>when I think of the love
in Daoming Si's eyes.</i>

357
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,625
Wow, Shancai has had two red cards now.

358
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,695
No one has ever had two red cards from F4.

359
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,963
I bet she will be doomed this time.

360
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,167
We haven't played games for a long time.

361
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,002
I'm bored to death now.

362
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,104
Human scum.

363
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,774
Even if I'm human scum,
it's none of your business.

364
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,409
You'd better be worrying
about yourself now.

365
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,882
<i>These F4's puppets are probably
going to bully me again.</i>

366
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,518
I'm not so stupid to just stand
and let you bully me!

367
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,986
Shancai, why are you running?

368
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,422
-Someone is chasing me.
-Hey! Stop!

369
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,091
-Go find her!
-Stop!

370
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,261
-Go search that area.
-You go that way.

371
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,030
We've searched this area,
go search that area.

372
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,132
Let's go outside. Hurry up.

373
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,467
Is she hiding in the bathroom?

374
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,209
Those idiots in our school are so mean.

375
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,345
They got so pumped up
when they saw a red card.

376
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,282
Those freaks.

377
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,620
What happened?

378
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,723
What did you do to Daoming Si
to get him this mad?

379
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,658
He even gave you another red card.

380
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:03,929
Actually, I didn't piss him off.

381
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,565
Is it because of that magazine?

382
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,334
How did you know about it?

383
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,169
Did you eavesdrop on us?

384
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,138
It's Qianhui and Baihe.

385
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,973
Everyone has one copy now.

386
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,010
Shancai, do you love Xiaoshun?

387
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,612
What are you talking about?

388
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,181
Xiaoshun is my new friend from work.

389
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,183
-Go outside. Hurry up!
-Is she hiding somewhere nearby?

390
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,918
-Go search that area.
-You go search that part.

391
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,686
We've searched this area,
go search over there.

392
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,355
-Move there. Fast!
-They're about to find us.

393
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,623
Is she hiding in the bathroom?

394
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,525
Let's go through the side door.

395
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,093
I'll distract them.

396
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,162
-Qinghe.
-Hurry. Meet me at the side door.

397
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,163
Hurry up.

398
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,232
I saw Shancai!

399
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,234
-Where?
-Chen Qinghe is with Shancai.

400
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,669
I'm not.

401
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,338
-Go after her!
-Shancai is over there.

402
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,481
What are you doing?

403
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,102
Shancai.

404
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,574
Shancai!

405
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,118
Where's your young master?

406
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,553
Young Master?

407
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,356
We haven't seen him
for three or four days.

408
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,124
Don't mind me.

409
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,027
Did that guy go abroad again?

410
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,729
Like going to New York or some place?

411
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,599
I'm thinking
that maybe we are overreacting now.

412
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,535
Shancai just posed for a magazine.
It's nothing serious.

413
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,404
Hello.

414
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,573
Qinghe?

415
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,876
How did you get my number?

416
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,712
What red card?

417
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,882
Shancai received a red card again?

418
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,851
I know nothing about this.

419
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,121
Okay. I got it.

420
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,391
Shancai received a red card?

421
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,962
Because the photos of that male model
and Shancai agitated Ah Si too much.

422
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,566
So, he might be still at school.

423
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,737
No matter what, let's find Ah Si first.

424
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,705
Let's go.

425
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,811
Welcome.

426
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,146
Qinghe.

427
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,715
Did Shancai come to work?

428
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,584
No, she didn't come to work today.

429
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,152
She didn't request any leave
from our boss.

430
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,320
I don't know what happened.

431
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,390
Darn it. I just went to her house.

432
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,692
Her parents said she hasn't come home yet.

433
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,560
Did you call her?

434
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,063
She was in a rush at school so she forgot
to bring her phone with her.

435
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,499
Her fellow students were chasing her
to bully her.

436
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,368
I brought her backpack to their house.

437
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,872
Why are your fellow students
bullying Shancai again?

438
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,707
Did something happen to her at school?

439
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,177
She received another red card.

440
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,046
Another red card?

441
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,014
Then what should we do?

442
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,685
You mean, those people
will all start bullying Shancai, right?

443
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,820
It's getting on my nerves now.

444
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,956
Xiaoyou, don't worry.

445
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,825
I, Chen Qinghe, will rescue her.

446
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,393
I won't let anyone bully her.

447
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,828
Qinghe.

448
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,030
You love Shancai, right?

449
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,168
I...

450
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,238
Yes, Xiaoyou, I love Shancai.

451
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,777
Daoming Si, Huaze Lei,
and that model, Xiaoshun,

452
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,748
they all think they'll make a great couple
with Shancai,

453
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,986
so they're all brutally forcing her
to make a choice in their own ways.

454
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,487
I won't do that to her.

455
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,757
Shancai won't understand what I'm feeling.

456
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,392
And I have no intention
to let her know it.

457
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,994
It's enough for me to love her secretly.

458
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,898
Qinghe, I'm so touched by your words.

459
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,769
But Shancai has received
another red card now.

460
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,637
How will you protect her?

461
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,473
What should we do now?

462
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,408
I have no idea.

463
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,343
Am I a useless person?

464
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,045
You're fine.

465
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,016
Anyway, we need to find Shancai first.

466
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,619
Oh, I've looked for her everywhere,
but I couldn't find her.

467
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,087
Hey, don't get frustrated.

468
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,523
You're making me
even more worried, Qinghe.

469
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,050
Relax, we won't kill you.

470
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,184
You can start recording now.

471
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,926
Hey, bring that envelope here.

472
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,930
Send this out first.
Remember to bring that guy here.

473
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,902
<i>What are these people up to?</i>

474
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,704
<i>I don't know any of them. Who are they?</i>

475
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:18,844
You're finally here.

476
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,612
What took you so long?

477
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,081
I bought some beer.

478
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,482
I'm going to get Daoming Si.

479
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,030
He isn't at school.

480
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,832
I couldn't get through to Ah Si's number.

481
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm starting to get a little worried.

482
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,470
If Ah Si really loses it this time,

483
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,105
Shancai will be in danger.

484
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,440
Qinghe just called me.

485
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,509
He said he couldn't find Shancai anywhere.

486
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,077
I don't know why,

487
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,446
but I have this feeling
that this leads to something bigger.

488
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,583
I don't know what's going on right now,

489
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,354
but I think the red card that Shancai
has received

490
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,223
wasn't from Ah Si.

491
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,427
But Ah Si isn't here right now,
so he can't prove it.

492
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:12,097
Besides, is there someone bold
to dare do this in the name of F4?

493
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,365
If there is one,

494
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,567
their purpose is very terrifying.

495
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,737
Obviously, he didn't do this
with good will.

496
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,775
Let's go.

497
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,277
Let's find Ah Si first.

498
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,815
<i>I can't believe it.
How can you be the one behind all this?</i>

499
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,350
<i>How is it possible?</i>

500
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,810
Oh, you're here.

501
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,047
Why do you look so pale?

502
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,449
Join me and eat.

503
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,651
You finally showed up.

504
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,786
We've been looking for you for so long,

505
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,856
and you're just here barbecuing
and drinking beer?

506
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,491
Where the heck did you go?

507
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,327
I just went to Huadong Coast
to clear my mind.

508
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,629
You went to Huadong Coast
to watch whales and go fishing?

509
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,665
Things are getting serious now.

510
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,434
What things are getting serious?

511
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,636
Why are you looking so pale?

512
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,305
I just went there to clear my mind.

513
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,473
Ah Si, something happened.

514
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,180
What took you so long?

515
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,883
Take the beer.

516
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,434
Xiaoshun.

517
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,869
How could it be you?

518
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,072
What do you want from me?

519
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,741
I'm sorry, Shancai.

520
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,776
I took advantage of you.

521
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,078
You took advantage of me?

522
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,180
I don't understand.
What did you take advantage of me for?

523
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,250
I took advantage of our friendship.

524
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,286
I had a motive for befriending you.

525
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,755
What are you talking about?

526
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,523
Could it be that you purposely
befriended me?

527
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,659
You're mostly correct.

528
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:22,828
That's impossible.

529
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,464
I was scammed by the modeling agency.

530
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,332
You showed up in time and saved me.

531
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,834
That's how we met.

532
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,235
Don't you still get it?

533
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,504
You said I showed up in time.
Why did I show up just in time?

534
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,408
But I decided to go to the interview
on impulse.

535
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,377
Don't forget the agent
who gave you his business card.

536
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,612
You planned that, too?

537
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,583
That's right.
Everything was planned by me.

538
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,486
Why are you doing this?

539
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,454
What is going on?

540
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,925
Saving you at the studio
is the first step of my plan.

541
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,528
The photos of us, the magazine,

542
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,965
and your red card were all planned by me.

543
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,236
You being here right now
is also a part of my plan.

544
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,738
But...

545
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,708
What's your motive for doing all this?

546
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:15,213
Take advantage of you
to deal with Daoming Si.

547
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:16,715
Daoming Si?

548
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,084
You're scheming against Daoming Si?

549
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,621
He just lost it and hit you,

550
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,889
and you're scheming against him?

551
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,991
He lost it and hit me that day,

552
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,994
then I realized how much you weigh
in his heart.

553
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,198
So I was more certain
that the plan would be successful

554
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,200
if I took advantage of you
to deal with him.

555
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,903
I couldn't imagine this girl
would fall into my trap so easily.

556
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,505
Xiaoshun,
I think you are more than a model.

557
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,940
You can even be an actor.

558
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,577
Cheating naive girls is what you do,
right?

559
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,147
We think you are obsessed with this girl.

560
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,316
You won't change your mind
and betray us, right?

561
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,086
Betray you? Don't make me laugh.

562
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,488
Don't forget who's the one
leading this plan.

563
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,092
Don't forget who's the one giving you
the opportunity to make Daoming Si pay.

564
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,131
I just want to take advantage of her.

565
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,139
Why, Xiaoshun?

566
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,742
Why are you doing this?

567
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,411
What's your problem with Daoming Si?

568
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,449
Could you please leave us alone
for a moment?

569
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:25,817
I have something to tell her.

570
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,253
All right. Just don't let her go.

571
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,029
Although I can't cut you loose,

572
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,664
but...

573
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,767
You son of a bitch! Don't touch me!

574
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,603
Why don't you just die? Scumbag!

575
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,939
Why are you hanging around
with those thugs?

576
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,517
I grew up in an orphanage.

577
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,620
I am a son of a mistress,

578
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,922
so I was abandoned there
when I was little.

579
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,192
My father didn't want to raise me.

580
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,429
My mother abandoned me later on.

581
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,666
I am a mistake from the day I was born.

582
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,003
In my blood,

583
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,639
there is only hate, no love.

584
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,545
I wanted to end my life by suicide.

585
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,616
I went to the seaside that day.

586
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,118
I decided to give up.

587
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,253
I jumped into the sea to commit suicide.

588
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,691
At the last moment before dying,

589
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,695
a man jumped into the sea and saved me.

590
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,736
He is my life saver.

591
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,640
He didn't only save my life,

592
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,143
but he also talked me out of it.

593
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,147
What does that have to do with Daoming Si?

594
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,715
You asked the right question.

595
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,218
He's such a good man,

596
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,087
but he made a small mistake
in Yingde University

597
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,255
and offended Daoming Si.

598
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,825
That violent human scum kicked him
so hard that his organs ruptured.

599
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,228
From that day on,

600
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,196
I've wanted to avenge him.

601
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,299
I have to make Daoming Si pay!

602
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,435
How could it be?

603
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,439
Those men who just kidnapped you
also hate Daoming Si.

604
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,641
We met by chance.

605
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,144
We have a mutual enemy,
so we planned our revenge together.

606
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,414
Too bad you are associated
with that infamous human scum.

607
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,718
I finally got it.

608
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,487
You kidnapped me and brought me here

609
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,991
to use me as a hostage
to lure Daoming Si here.

610
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,125
Don't stare at me like that.

611
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:51,329
All these years, I've been waiting for
a chance to take revenge on Daoming Si.

612
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,332
You're only a piece of my entire plan.

613
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,202
I despise you because you're so wicked!

614
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,303
Whatever you say.

615
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,540
I'll get Daoming Si this time,
and he's dead meat.

616
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,208
What are you going to do?

617
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,711
You'll see.

618
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,049
Shancai received a red card?

619
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,851
Ah Si, you didn't leave
the red card there, right?

620
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,289
Darn it. Who could it be?

621
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,490
How dare they fool us.

622
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,593
-I'm afraid Shancai is in danger now--
-Young Master, someone gave me this.

623
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,395
He said they got Miss Shancai.

624
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,800
Where is he? Where is the man
who gave you the photo?

625
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,101
Calm down. Hey!

626
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,203
PRIVATE NUMBER CALLING

627
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:35,840
Hey.

628
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,175
Have you seen the photo?

629
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,845
Who are you? What do you want?

630
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,380
My identity is none of your concern.

631
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,251
But I can let you hear the voice you want
to hear the most.

632
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,687
Speak.

633
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,156
Speak.

634
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,692
Daoming Si, don't come here.
Don't believe--

635
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,494
Did you hear that?

636
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,863
I'm warning you. Don't call the police.

637
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,465
<i>Or Shancai will be killed.</i>

638
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,168
<i>Besides, come here alone.</i>

639
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,369
<i>Take no one along.</i>

640
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,204
<i>A man will bring you here.</i>

641
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,040
Fine. I promise you, I'll go there alone.

642
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,810
But I need your promise
that Shancai will be safe.

643
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:12,944
Shut up!

644
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,179
You want to bargain?

645
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,315
I'm warning you,
you'd better do what you said.

646
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,518
If I notice anything wrong,

647
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,588
I'm not sure what will happen to Shancai.

648
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,323
You... Hey!

649
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,593
-Hey.
-Ah Si, where are you going?

650
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,128
You stay out of this. Leave it to me.

651
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:31,096
It's too dangerous.

652
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,131
I said stay out of this.
Did you hear me? Wait for me.

653
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,805
So, everything is a lie.

654
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,675
You said you wanted to be my friend.

655
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,778
You made me said those words
to Daoming Si to hurt him.

656
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,714
Everything is a lie.

657
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:51,950
I'm so stupid.

658
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,019
I'm really so stupid.

659
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,589
You must be laughing at me
in your mind, right?

660
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,127
I'm just an idiot you took advantage of.

661
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,263
I won't laugh at you.

662
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,666
On the contrary, I pity you.

663
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,502
The moment someone is associated
with Daoming Si,

664
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,237
that's the beginning of their bad luck.

665
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,339
You're such a malicious and cunning man!

666
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,940
I'm telling you,

667
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,976
Daoming Si isn't the reason
of my bad luck.

668
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,678
The reason is, I trusted you.

669
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,846
Your hypocrisy makes me sick.

670
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,783
What do you know?
What the heck do you know?

671
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,351
I gave you hints.

672
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,719
I told you before.

673
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,055
If you can't break away from the darkness
in your heart,

674
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,890
you can never experience true honesty
and freedom.

675
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,892
A friend once told me

676
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,028
that if people can't be honest
with each other,

677
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,930
there can never be true freedom,

678
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,366
and things can go south easily.

679
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,570
If you can't break away from the darkness
in your heart,

680
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,807
you can never experience
true honesty and freedom.

681
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,408
I gave you hints long ago.

682
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,377
Whether I want it or not,

683
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,680
our relationship will change eventually
because of Daoming Si.

684
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,582
But you didn't get it.

685
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,783
I didn't get it.

686
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,185
I don't want to get it.

687
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,054
Why should I get what a scumbag
like you are thinking?

688
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,056
I want to puke just by seeing you.

689
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,192
What crap are you discussing
with that woman?

690
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,961
I think we should cover her mouth
with duct tape, right?

691
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,863
If she starts yelling,
things may get problematic.

692
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,964
It's not necessary.

693
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,233
We're in the middle of nowhere.
No one will come here.

694
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,268
I think it's safer to cover her mouth.

695
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,437
If something really happens,
will you be able to handle it?

696
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,774
I can make our plan work,
so I can handle any problem.

697
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:24,576
You'd better can.

698
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,412
Don't touch me!

699
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:30,381
Get your dirty hands off me.
You dirty scumbag!

700
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,283
Acting tough, huh?
Who do you think you can scare?

701
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,886
You say we're scumbags?
Your boyfriend is a much bigger scumbag.

702
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:38,423
In the pub in East District,
he knocked us out.

703
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,925
Yeah, we will take our revenge today.

704
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,228
We'll make him pay for beating us.

705
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,497
What a bunch of pussies.

706
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,932
I was wondering why you hate him so much.

707
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,135
Being knocked out?

708
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,504
That's because you're too weak, right?

709
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,774
You can't defeat Daoming Si
without your dirty scheme, right?

710
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,209
You're so ridiculous, so pathetic!

711
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,311
Don't disrespect us.

712
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,447
Or I'll teach you a lesson.

713
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,549
I'm telling you.

714
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,618
Daoming Si won't come here.

715
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,052
What?

716
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,656
I'm not his girlfriend.

717
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,591
If you don't believe me,

718
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:17,128
you can sit on your stupid asses
and wait forever.

719
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,763
-Bitch!
-Stop.

720
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,665
If you hurt her,
won't things get messier later?

721
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,034
-What? Get your hands off me.
-What are you doing? Don't touch me.

722
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,269
What are you doing? Let go of me.

723
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,726
Untie him.

724
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,035
Thank you for your warm invitation.

725
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:58,803
All right.

726
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,972
Let's settle this quickly.

727
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,740
What do you want me to do?

728
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,910
Not much.

729
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,846
Just stay there.

730
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,081
Let us do the rest of the work.

731
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,251
Idiot, why did you come here?

732
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,520
Why did you come here?

733
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:16,855
You big idiot!

734
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,857
I've untied your hands.

735
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,859
You can attack me.

736
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,996
But I advise you not to make any move.

737
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,000
You don't want her to get hurt, right?

738
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:32,637
Hey.

739
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,943
Don't look at me with your dirty face.

740
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,179
Close your eyes.

741
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,215
Take him out.

742
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:57,695
Aren't you good at fighting?

743
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,297
Get on your feet and fight back.

744
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,373
You really hate it,
and you want to beat us up, right?

745
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,877
The young master from Daoming Corporation
is getting beaten up.

746
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,846
You don't like this feeling, right?

747
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:21,886
You weaklings.

748
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,690
I didn't feel a thing.

749
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,661
Is this all you've got?

750
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:32,697
Beat him up!

751
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,666
Why don't you speak now?

752
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,206
Stop! Don't beat him anymore!

753
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,749
<i>A man who has never been beaten by anyone.</i>

754
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,484
<i>A man who is great at fighting.</i>

755
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,287
<i>A man who will win even if he's
surrounded by a bunch of people.</i>

756
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,588
<i>Why?</i>

757
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,958
<i>For me, he lets them beat him
however they want.</i>

758
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,326
<i>He doesn't fight back at all.</i>

759
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,043
Where did he go?

760
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,956
What's wrong with this guy?

761
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,858
He can still stand up
after being beaten so badly.

762
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,610
Are you finished?

763
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,713
I didn't feel a thing at all.

764
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,117
Do you want to do it yourself?

765
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,320
This is for my friend!

766
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,088
Die!

767
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,806
-Darn it. Beat up the girl, too.
-Stop.

768
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,749
That's enough. We should go.

769
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,225
That's a lesson for you.
Don't be too arrogant from now on.

770
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,894
Jerk. Watch out.

771
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,066
Daoming Si. Are you okay?

772
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,170
How could I be okay?

773
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,540
My hands.

774
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,776
My ribs are almost broken.

775
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:04,148
Idiot! Why didn't you fight back?

776
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,417
Aren't there only four of them?

777
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,985
For someone like you,

778
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,088
they could be taken down
in no time, right?

779
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:13,958
You're so stupid.

780
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,061
If I fought back,

781
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,431
I would've lost.

782
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,970
I wouldn't be able to protect you anymore.

783
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,777
It's easy for me to deal with them.

784
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,582
But I had to control myself.

785
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,385
I couldn't fight back,

786
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,727
because all I was thinking in my mind...

787
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,200
was to protect you.

788
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,075
If I die today,

789
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:07,712
don't get upset.

790
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,217
Don't cry.

791
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:17,922
Daoming Si.

792
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,625
Daoming Si, don't die.

793
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,260
I don't want you to die.

794
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,928
Daoming Si!

795
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,988
