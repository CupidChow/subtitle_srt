1
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,657
What's the matter, Lei?

2
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,661
What? Don't you mind at all?

3
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,600
Lei, I really don't mind.

4
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,603
In fact, I'm so happy right now.

5
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,941
This means I'm very important to you.

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,245
I forget that Lei's a boy, too.

7
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,450
No, this is not what I want.

8
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,886
Don't worry.

9
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,557
Sometimes, you need
to let things happen naturally.

10
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,958
No.

11
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,426
I don't want this.

12
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,669
Jing.

13
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,704
I didn't know you're all here.

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,239
Get down and grab something to eat.

15
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,394
Ximen, get up.

16
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,398
Meizuo, get up. Hurry up, get down
and grab yourself something to eat.

17
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,367
Qianhui.

18
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,003
Get up.

19
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,307
Oh, my gosh.

20
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,843
Hurry up, let's eat.

21
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,545
Ah Si.

22
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,047
Is this some kind of joke?

23
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,615
What are you thinking?

24
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,851
Look at what you're wearing.

25
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,653
Go ahead and eat my sashimi.

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,988
I caught the fish myself.

27
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,356
Sashimi.

28
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,957
Oh, my gosh.

29
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,760
There must be something else
you could do, right?

30
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,329
That's why I hate virgins the most.

31
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,598
What? Is Daoming Si still a virgin?

32
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,004
You talk too much.

33
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,073
How can I do those things
with a girl I don't like?

34
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,708
You annoying jerks.

35
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,711
Grab a chair and sit with us.

36
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,845
-Okay.
-Yeah.

37
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:32,779
Fine.

38
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,214
Give me the chopsticks.

39
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,451
-Here.
-Excuse me.

40
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,186
-Here you go.
-Since we're all here,

41
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,687
I'll give you a riddle, okay?

42
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,222
-What riddle?
-Okay.

43
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:49,696
-The riddle is "kiss".
-Pass the chopsticks over here.

44
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,232
-"Kiss"?
-Guess a location.

45
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,934
-A location?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,235
A location for the kiss?

47
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,837
What else?

48
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,072
You'd better be careful with your answer.

49
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,474
Do you already know the answer?

50
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,209
No, I don't.

51
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,377
Has anyone guessed it yet?
I'll tell you the answer now.

52
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,680
The answer is "Jiji" train station.

53
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,081
It's so funny, right?

54
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,118
Because you'll make "Jiji" sounds
when you kiss.

55
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,919
Isn't it funny?

56
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,988
Your joke is so lame.

57
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,691
It's my turn now.

58
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,992
Okay, go ahead.

59
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,462
What's this?

60
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,600
Octopus.

61
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,003
A spider is doing push-ups on the mirror.

62
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,640
-Not bad, huh?
-It's so funny.

63
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,509
-It's so funny, right?
-It's so funny.

64
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,681
Let's eat. We caught this earlier.

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,617
-Really?
-Did you catch these, Daoming Si?

66
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,652
Yeah, try it.

67
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,889
-You're awesome.
-I don't know you're so good at fishing.

68
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,290
Why are you so good at fishing?

69
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,004
What are you eating?

70
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,372
Can I try it?

71
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,840
I'll get you some right now.

72
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,309
No need. I'll share this with you.

73
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,487
Where's Jing?

74
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,493
No idea. Maybe she's sleeping.

75
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,065
I'm sorry that you're disturbed.

76
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,202
<i>Dummy, what am I talking about?</i>

77
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,937
So you heard that.

78
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,706
I... I didn't intend to.

79
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,441
I was just passing by,

80
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,109
so I accidentally...

81
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,612
accidentally heard that.

82
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,587
Maybe I ate too much mustard,

83
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,090
because I can't stop crying.

84
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,802
I know you might hate me,

85
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,672
and you find me selfish
and hard to deal with.

86
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,742
But...

87
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,881
please don't hate me.

88
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:29,022
In my mind,
I feel like we're friends on the rooftop.

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,727
If I hated you,
I wouldn't save you that day.

90
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,145
Clean them very well.

91
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,348
Hurry up.

92
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,753
Young Master,
why did you get up so early today?

93
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,789
It's good to get up early
every now and then.

94
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,291
Young Master, may I ask you

95
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,826
would you like to have your breakfast
in your room, or...

96
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,095
I'll have it here today.

97
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,430
Thank you.

98
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,464
Very well, Young Master.

99
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,832
I'll serve your breakfast right now.

100
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,336
Young Master, your breakfast is ready.

101
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,971
It's prepared as you preferred.

102
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,025
Young Master, are you satisfied
with your breakfast?

103
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,128
Not bad.

104
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,336
Young Master,
I'd like to tell you something.

105
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,172
I think your mood has been
pretty good recently.

106
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,144
Young Master, I'm sorry,
I'm talking too much.

107
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,881
You also know that.

108
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,216
You're amazing.

109
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,854
Young Master, you're joking again.

110
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,325
<i>I hate going to school.</i>

111
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,496
Shancai.

112
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,198
Qinghe.

113
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,132
Morning.

114
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,235
Hey, my mom asked me
to say thank you to you.

115
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,670
It's about that yacht.

116
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,071
No problem.

117
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,573
You can come and join us again next time.

118
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,308
That last night was so good.

119
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,609
I'm so touched.

120
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,111
I didn't know I'd make the common people

121
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
fit in with upper class people
by making them eat sashimi.

122
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,614
I'm so great!

123
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,182
We'll never be afraid of being bullied.

124
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,486
What the heck are you doing?

125
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,720
Let's go.

126
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,524
Didn't I already make them
mingle because of sashimi?

127
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:48,695
Don't get upset.

128
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,563
You should have hope in life.

129
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,831
Hurry up and change into gym suit.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,002
Damn it, those sons of bitches.

131
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,704
My sports shoes are missing again.

132
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,906
This is my third pair.

133
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,142
Didn't you say don't give up,

134
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,777
and have hope in life?

135
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,680
But you need money to buy sports shoes.

136
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,315
Even one pair costs NTD 299,

137
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,517
it's not for free.

138
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,352
"Stir-fried Shancai",

139
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,255
are these your shoes?

140
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,557
My shoes!

141
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,062
The new semester has just started,
and you're bullying me like that.

142
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,396
You big pig head!

143
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,166
Shancai, wait for me!

144
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,636
-Get lost.
-Shancai, wait for me.

145
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,708
Hey, did you see her angry face?

146
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,646
You called us here so early
in the morning just for this?

147
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:44,217
Hey, how is it? It took me the whole night
to think of this way to torture her.

148
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,121
I don't think
this is some sophisticated prank.

149
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,691
Is it not?

150
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,195
Isn't this a weird way
to express someone's love?

151
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,397
Where's Lei?

152
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,799
You just had a fight with him,
and you're looking for him now?

153
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,434
We're F4.

154
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,336
It's so weird when there's one less of us.

155
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,225
Are you looking for me?

156
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,228
What? You look like you saw a ghost.

157
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,896
You scared me.

158
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,899
You stood here spacing out,
so you got scared.

159
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,813
What were you thinking?

160
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,416
Want to come and sit with me?

161
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,568
Could you please pull me up?

162
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,772
Pull me up, okay?

163
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,245
Thanks.

164
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,019
Turns out the view from here
is more beautiful.

165
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,692
<i>It feels so good.</i>

166
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,027
<i>We didn't talk,</i>

167
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,696
<i>but, on a sunny day,</i>

168
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,698
<i>I just sit here with Huaze Lei.</i>

169
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,800
<i>It feels so good.</i>

170
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,028
Hey, where's Lei?

171
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,031
I'm asking you, did you see Lei?

172
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,701
I think I saw him heading to the rooftop.

173
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,436
-The rooftop?
-I'm sorry.

174
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,305
Why are you apologizing to me?

175
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,150
I thought I would never see you here,

176
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,721
because I thought you would hate me.

177
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,225
I'm really happy now.

178
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,828
You're so easy to impress.

179
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,563
I'm telling you the truth.

180
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:50,436
Maybe you don't know something trivial
can be actually fairly important.

181
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:35,882
Hey.

182
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,885
Do you know Shancai and Huaze Lei
often meet on the rooftop?

183
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,890
Really?

184
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,728
I think It started
after Lei saved Shancai.

185
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,064
No way.

186
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,765
He's right.

187
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,001
Shancai really loves Huaze Lei.

188
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,937
In fact, they are meeting each other
like this on the rooftop

189
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,739
every time they have the chance.

190
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,475
Yeah, they're like two lovebirds.

191
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,577
This is the video footage I got.

192
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,079
Do you want to watch it?

193
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,323
...selfish and hard to deal with.

194
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,259
But...

195
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,365
please don't hate me.

196
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,337
<i>In my own mind...</i>

197
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,041
We can't tolerate her
dating Huaze Lei and Daoming Si.

198
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,809
She's dating two boys at the same time.

199
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,545
Yeah, I hate Shancai so much.

200
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,980
After she kissed you,

201
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,148
she...

202
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,418
That's my V8.

203
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,825
We couldn't just stand there
watching Shancai doing things like that.

204
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,994
We wanted to give her some advice.

205
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,364
We told her Huaze is in love with Jing.

206
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,535
We didn't know after Shancai left Huaze,

207
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,937
she started sticking around you.

208
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,273
She's unforgivable,

209
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,775
isn't she?

210
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,209
Don't touch me.

211
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,018
Don't hit women.

212
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,692
Why are you so angry?

213
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,729
It's not like you don't know
how Lei feels towards Jing.

214
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,799
He won't fall in love with Shancai.

215
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,702
Look at yourself.

216
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,271
You can't take this seriously, right?

217
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,906
Let's go, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

218
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,240
Get your hands off me.

219
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,144
I told you to get your hands off me.

220
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,019
He got that look on his face again.

221
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,334
The summer is coming.

222
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,671
I remember when I first met you here,

223
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,105
it was still spring.

224
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,009
-Was it?
-Yeah.

225
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,586
LEI, COME WITH ME TO THE STUDIO
TO TAKE SOME PHOTOS TONIGHT.

226
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,521
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU, JING

227
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,123
Something came up, I'm have to go now.

228
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,861
What's this?

229
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,529
The invitation card
of Jing's birthday prom.

230
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,864
She hopes you will come.

231
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,969
You'll be there, right?

232
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,203
Huh?

233
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,605
Jing wanted me to ask you.

234
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,808
Yes.

235
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,909
What are you doing here?

236
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,210
You scared me.

237
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,313
<i>This guy is so weird.</i>

238
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,748
<i>He's not his normal self.</i>

239
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,217
I'm going home.

240
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,318
Stay here.

241
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,086
You bitch.

242
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,555
How dare you fool me.

243
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,956
I'm gonna destroy you.

244
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,357
What are you talking about?

245
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,226
Get your hands off me,
or I'll be mad at you.

246
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,694
It's all your fault.

247
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,962
What did I do wrong this time?

248
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,430
I think you know already!

249
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,566
-Leave me alone.
-How dare you betray me?

250
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,710
<i>This guy seems very serious.</i>

251
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,445
<i>He is so fierce.</i>

252
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,214
Leave me alone.

253
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:03,816
Help!

254
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,718
Leave me alone.

255
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,389
Help!

256
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,060
Help, don't come any closer.

257
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,495
Stay away from me!

258
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,699
Stop it, Daoming Si.

259
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,700
Stop it.

260
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,301
I'm begging you, stop it.

261
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,937
Daoming Si.

262
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,007
I'm begging you, stop it.

263
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,593
Stop crying.

264
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,734
Stop crying.

265
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,005
I won't hurt you anymore.

266
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,019
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

267
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,187
<i>You're back.</i>

268
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,655
<i>-Yeah.
-Dinner's ready.</i>

269
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,723
<i>Okay.</i>

270
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,992
<i>Why are you dressed like that?</i>

271
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,294
<i>Whose clothes are these?</i>

272
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,497
<i>It's too cold out there
so I borrowed this from my fellow student.</i>

273
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,733
<i>Okay, let's eat now.</i>

274
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,785
<i>What happened?</i>

275
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,053
<i>Why?</i>

276
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,955
<i>What's wrong with that guy?</i>

277
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,958
<i>He was in a good mood this morning.</i>

278
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,828
<i>I have no idea what was he thinking.</i>

279
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,396
It's all your fault.

280
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,698
What did I do wrong this time?

281
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,700
I think you know already!

282
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,335
-Leave me alone.
-How dare you betray me?

283
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,909
<i>I didn't know he is so strong.</i>

284
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,712
<i>I struggled as hard as I could
but I failed.</i>

285
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,529
<i>Stay away from me.</i>

286
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,431
Stop it, Daoming Si.

287
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,399
Stop it.

288
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,234
I'm begging you, stop it.

289
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,603
Daoming Si.

290
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,706
I'm begging you, stop it.

291
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,121
<i>What was I doing?</i>

292
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,591
<i>That was not the usual Daoming Si.</i>

293
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,461
<i>I've never felt boys are so scary before.</i>

294
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,230
<i>What was he up to?</i>

295
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:26,545
DON'T BULLY SHANCAI ANYMORE, DAOMING SI

296
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,271
Right, did you receive
Tengtang Jing's invitation card?

297
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,573
-Yeah, you got it too?
-Yeah.

298
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,976
I was so happy when I received it.

299
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,778
This is my first time attending a party.

300
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,549
But I have no idea
what should I wear to the party.

301
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,484
The time is getting closer,

302
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,119
and I'm getting more and more upset.

303
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,187
Why is that?

304
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:12,658
I'm able to study in Yingde University
all because of my scholarship.

305
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,561
I have no idea
what should I wear to the party.

306
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,430
I don't like to admit it,

307
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,699
but sometimes I have to lie to myself,

308
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,201
that I'm poor but proud.

309
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,139
What a beautiful dress.

310
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,685
SHANCAI, THIS IS A GIFT FOR YOU.

311
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,719
Daoming Si.

312
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,755
That guy just won't leave me alone.

313
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,891
After what he did to me,

314
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,359
he's giving me a gift now?

315
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,594
Do you think I'll forgive you
because of this?

316
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,130
He's so condescending.

317
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,566
Who wants your gift?

318
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,307
Even if I return it to him,
he can't wear it.

319
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,479
I'd better give it to Li Zhen.

320
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,181
She needs it now.

321
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,154
Are you serious?

322
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,823
Did he do that to you?

323
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,392
Isn't it horrible?

324
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,628
Yeah.

325
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,032
So I'm too scared to tell others.

326
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,567
You're the only one I can tell.

327
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,936
But Daoming Si...

328
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,105
Why was he so suddenly rude to you?

329
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,940
And he gave you this dress.

330
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,009
Does he give you this gift as an apology?

331
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,311
He's so weird.

332
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,479
Yeah.

333
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,414
I don't know what's going on.

334
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,517
He was goofing around as usual
in the morning,

335
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,052
and...

336
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,820
<i>Don't come any closer.</i>

337
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,188
Stay away from me.

338
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,290
Stop it.

339
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,526
Stop it, Daoming Si.

340
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,460
Stop it.

341
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,095
I'm begging you, stop it.

342
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,865
Daoming Si.

343
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,000
<i>I'm begging you, stop it.</i>

344
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,270
And what?

345
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,806
What else did Daoming Si do to you?

346
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,043
Nothing.

347
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,312
I just don't know what he's up to
with all these.

348
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,947
Really?

349
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:49,848
Yeah.

350
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,683
And since I received the gift,

351
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,652
I haven't seen him yet.

352
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,721
I think maybe he didn't come to school.

353
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,090
Xiaoyou.

354
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,225
Could you please come with me
to this event, okay?

355
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,961
"Invitation"?

356
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,763
Invitation card.

357
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,034
Isn't this Tengtang Jing's party?

358
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,904
Yeah, I don't really want to attend,

359
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,605
but she's been so nice to me,

360
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,441
so I couldn't reject this.

361
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,875
Let's attend it together, okay?

362
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,278
Qinghe and Li Zhen will be there too.

363
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,679
Who's Qinghe?

364
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,114
Don't you know him?

365
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,682
Haven't I told you before?

366
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,451
Qinghe is my fellow student
from primary school.

367
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,419
He's really nice and pretty cute.

368
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,921
He's studying in Yingde now.

369
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,723
I think you two will be good friends.

370
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,692
Please come with me, okay?

371
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,895
Okay?

372
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,131
Okay.

373
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,134
But what should I wear?

374
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,804
Didn't you give your dress to Li Zhen?

375
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,540
Yes, and now I don't know
what I should wear.

376
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,741
I'm still thinking.

377
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:50,742
Here.

378
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,680
-Xiaoyou, Shancai's mama...
-Thank you.

379
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,148
cut some fruits for you.

380
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,249
What's this?

381
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,684
It's nothing.

382
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,352
-Nothing?
-This is a birthday card.

383
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,487
Birthday card?

384
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,456
Then there should be "happy birthday"
on it.

385
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,657
There's only one word on it.

386
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,493
It's "invitation."

387
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,294
A card with "invitation" on it is...

388
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,996
an invitation card.

389
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,998
Did Daoming Si invite you?

390
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,700
-No.
-Did he?

391
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,268
Let me see...

392
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,704
I didn't know things went so...

393
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,172
"Tengtang Jing"

394
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,773
Tengtang Jing.

395
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,275
Are they from that Teng Corporation?

396
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,579
That Teng Corporation which holds
the most stock in the eight major sectors,

397
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,416
investing in various stocks
from iron and steel to biotech?

398
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,685
Wow, Shancai's mom is amazing.

399
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,989
You talked like a stock analyst
from Channel 4.

400
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,524
Yeah, and they always say something like

401
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,825
"You have to listen to me."

402
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,360
"See? You lost your money."

403
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,362
You have to attend this kind of party.

404
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,063
Why are you hesitating, my daughter?

405
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,832
Have you lost your mind again?

406
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,701
-Mom.
-There are many rich people in proms.

407
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,937
I don't care whether it's Daoming Si
or Siming Dao.

408
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,105
Just date whoever you can get.

409
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,708
You two will go there and stun them all.

410
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,943
Mom, stop it.

411
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,579
But Shancai is worried
about what she should wear.

412
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,181
You talk too much.

413
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,148
Easy.

414
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,350
Xiaoyou, you've done a good job.

415
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,921
Have you been worried
about what to wear for a long time?

416
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,490
Just leave it to me.

417
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:15,394
Twenty years ago,

418
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,530
I was Miss Meatball in Hsinchu.

419
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,600
-Really? That's awesome.
-That's nothing awesome.

420
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,902
Didn't you hear my mom
would dress us up as meatballs?

421
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,704
You won't be dressed up as meatballs.

422
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:30,642
You'll be pinky, shiny,
and pretty little tapioca pearls.

423
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,350
Our clothes...

424
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,085
don't seem right.

425
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,086
Yeah.

426
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,688
What are you talking about?

427
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:47,960
These were customized for me
when I was the Miss Meatball.

428
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,595
I'm so touched.

429
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,197
If you go out there dressing like this,
people will say

430
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,700
"Whose daughters are these cute girls?

431
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,702
You're so beautiful."

432
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,471
Stay still.

433
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,006
Two beauties, stay still.

434
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,374
I'll be right back.

435
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,109
Xiaoyou, stay still.

436
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,944
You're so beautiful.

437
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,448
Are we really going to go there in these?

438
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,383
Yeah, it's so embarrassing.

439
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,185
Yeah.

440
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,953
Look, Shancai, Xiaoyou.

441
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,489
There's a handsome young man joining us.

442
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,791
Qinghe.

443
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,195
Oh my gosh, Qinghe.

444
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,532
You're dressing like that man
who won the title of Mister Tempura

445
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,802
the year I won the title of Miss Meatball.

446
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,870
Am I?

447
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,238
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

448
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,206
It's perfect.

449
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,208
Look at you two, perfect.

450
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,210
Shancai, I'm here to pick you up.

451
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,511
<i>No!</i>

452
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,280
-Hurry up.
-No.

453
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,614
I'd rather die than get in the car.

454
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:43,749
Stop dragging me.

455
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,851
It's so cool with all the improvements.
Let's go.

456
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,818
No!

457
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:47,786
Shancai, we should go.

458
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,621
It's the only car we got.

459
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:52,357
Xiaoyou, I will not. Stop dragging me.

460
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,293
We're running late.
There will be no food left there.

461
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,995
-Hurry up.
-No.

462
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,331
Young Master, there's not much time left.

463
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,732
Get in the car now.

464
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,202
We're gonna be late.

465
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,203
Let's go.

466
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,471
Yes, Young Master.

467
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,243
Why do you look so sad?

468
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,278
Who doesn't when sitting in this car?

469
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,047
This car is so cool.

470
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,417
How about some music?

471
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,586
Ah Qin, play some music.

472
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,189
-I want live music.
-Yes.

473
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,290
What live music?

474
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,526
<i>The shining lights</i>

475
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,728
<i>And charming songs</i>

476
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:34,066
<i>Make me flutter</i>

477
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:39,204
<i>I don't know you're flattering me</i>

478
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:43,108
<i>So I have fallen for you</i>

479
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,911
-I want to get out the car.
-<i>My pure love was cheated by you</i>

480
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,447
<i>And I still have no idea</i>

481
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,517
<i>The more I think about it
The sadder I am...</i>

482
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,226
<i>Does this fancy dress really belong to me?</i>

483
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,962
<i>If it doesn't belong to me,</i>

484
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,232
<i>why does it feel so real when I touch it?</i>

485
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:13,538
<i>Why do I have a feeling
that this dress is so suitable for me?</i>

486
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,874
<i>God must have given me this opportunity.</i>

487
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:21,313
<i>So I can wear this dress
and make everyone notice me.</i>

488
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:27,953
<i>I don't know why,</i>

489
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,855
<i>but I'm so nervous.</i>

490
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,591
<i>I think tonight will be the start
of my dream.</i>

491
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,602
Hurry up. It's here.

492
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,138
Come on.

493
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,679
What an amazing party.

494
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,749
Is this the family party
Jing talked about before?

495
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,885
This is some next level stuff.

496
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,620
There are celebrities here.

497
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,587
Where are they?

498
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,524
Daoming Si is over there.

499
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,626
Shancai, where are you going?

500
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,929
<i>What should I do? How should I face him?</i>

501
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,202
There really are celebrities here.

502
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,470
I'm going to ask for an autograph.

503
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,571
Qinghe.

504
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,408
Are you that...

505
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,877
"Red bean, big red bean..."

506
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,579
Are you Aya?

507
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,881
Could you please give me your autograph?

508
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,484
Thank you.

509
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,456
You're Blackie, right?

510
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,424
Could you please give me your autograph?

511
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,929
You are Aisa and Mai.

512
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,131
Shancai.

513
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,365
So you're here.

514
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,136
Why are you two dressed so...

515
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,206
Right, did you just arrive here?

516
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,575
-Ah Si, Shancai is here.
-Hey.

517
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,211
Ah Si, Shancai is here.

518
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,958
<i>What a douchebag.</i>

519
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,192
<i>What an attitude.</i>

520
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,894
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

521
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,395
<i>Why are you so mad?</i>

522
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,930
<i>I'm the one who should be mad.</i>

523
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,533
<i>I had no idea why he treated me like that,</i>

524
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,469
<i>and he even forcefully kissed me. Twice.</i>

525
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,204
<i>I'm the one who is suffering more.</i>

526
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:31,009
<i>Dang it.
This douchebag didn't apologize at all.</i>

527
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,712
Have we met before?

528
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,180
I don't think so.

529
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,481
This is the first time we've met.

530
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,650
That's right.

531
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,820
It's impossible for me
to forget cute girls like you.

532
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,723
After tonight's party...

533
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,358
Please don't mess with my friend.

534
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,726
Let's go.

535
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:49,761
Xiaoyou.

536
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,930
You'll get pregnant when you talk
with that kind of people.

537
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,532
No, I won't do that.

538
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,634
How can I make such mistakes?

539
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,135
Don't believe his words.

540
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,203
He's very dangerous.

541
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,205
Treat him like a virus.

542
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:02,274
Stay away from him as far as you can,
understand?

543
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,808
You're exaggerating.

544
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:04,876
Ximen.

545
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,145
Okay.

546
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,414
I'll stay away from her.

547
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,155
When he talked with me,

548
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,357
I felt so nervous.

549
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,059
That's because he's so cute,

550
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,194
and my heart can't take it anymore.

551
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,564
Can you please be more reserved?

552
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,898
I can't help it.

553
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,468
I think Daoming Si is pretty cool.

554
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,938
He's not that scary
like what you described.

555
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,841
You have no idea.

556
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,243
All I can say is,

557
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,412
they're all beautifully packed Godzilla.

558
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,147
They bring bad luck.

559
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,563
Thank you for attending
my daughter's birthday party.

560
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,999
I hope you're all satisfied tonight.

561
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:04,603
Please enjoy.

562
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,607
Shancai.

563
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,876
That Tengtang Jing is really beautiful.

564
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,414
Shancai?

565
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,382
Huh?

566
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,218
Yeah, Jing is really beautiful.

567
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,235
What a good couple.

568
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,505
Yeah, they're perfect for each other.

569
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:56,121
<i>The gentleness in Huaze Lei's eyes
is only for her.</i>

570
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,228
Hi, Daoming Si.

571
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:05,664
Long time no see.

572
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,499
Why haven't you called me?

573
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,434
I've been busy these days.

574
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,502
So...

575
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,374
<i>These rich young masters
love flirting with girls.</i>

576
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,576
Anything I can do for you?

577
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,347
Xiaoyou.

578
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,915
Let's grab a drink, okay?

579
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:24,916
Okay.

580
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,284
Well...

581
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,053
It's less crowded over there.

582
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,487
-Let's head over there.
-Yeah.

583
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,290
I'll go get Qinghe,
you can wait for me there.

584
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,591
-Yeah.
-Okay.

585
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,188
What brings you here?

586
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,423
I don't like that place.

587
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,058
I feel they're so fake.

588
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,027
I'd rather drink alone.

589
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,528
What about you?

590
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,263
I...

591
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,365
That's fine if you don't want to tell me.

592
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,467
What would you like to drink?

593
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,935
Anything is fine.

594
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,770
Gin and tonic, it is.

595
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,478
Thank you.

596
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,761
<i>Huaze Lei is so gentle tonight.</i>

597
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,231
<i>That's because today is Jing's birthday.</i>

598
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,605
Could you please give me another one?

599
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,869
You're Sara from Walkie Talkie, right?

600
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,671
-Yes.
-Could you please give me your autograph?

601
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:27,972
Okay.

602
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,675
-Well.
-I'll hold it for you.

603
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,643
Okay, thank you.

604
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,911
Where's the other one?

605
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,647
She's busy working.

606
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,816
You're lying.
Your band was disbanded, right?

607
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:38,883
No.

608
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,418
You are just waiting to split up.

609
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,520
Hi, excuse me.

610
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,189
-Thank you.
-What? Hold on.

611
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,124
-Come here. You're embarrassing yourself.
-Thank you.

612
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,193
See? My notebook is filled up.

613
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,862
Stop asking for autographs, okay?
You're embarrassing yourself.

614
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,765
-There are two more over there.
-Come with me.

615
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:54,766
Wait. Hey.

616
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,435
Stop pulling me. I haven't finished yet.

617
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,538
Li Zhen, you're here.

618
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:01,506
Qinghe.

619
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:02,907
Wait, I'll introduce someone to you.

620
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:03,875
She's Xiaoyou.

621
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,476
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-You're so beautiful.

622
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,879
I'm Shancai's fellow student
from high school. I'm Xiaoyou.

623
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,848
Hi, I'm her fellow student now.

624
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,115
I'm Li Zhen.

625
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,084
Where's Shancai?

626
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,719
She's by the swimming pool.

627
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,889
Should we join her?

628
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,502
Why are you wearing this dress?

629
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,343
You don't deserve clothes sent by me.

630
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,911
You're so ugly.

631
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,782
You'd better leave here right now.

632
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,132
Thank you.

633
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,307
Actually, I think...

634
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,710
I forgot what I wanted to say.

635
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,980
You drank too much.

636
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,083
Actually, I've always wanted to ask you...

637
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,853
why are the personalities
of Ah Si and you so fierce?

638
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,222
No wonder he loves you.

639
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,325
Don't compare me to him.

640
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,193
I'm different from him.

641
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,429
Thank you for attending my birthday party.

642
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,933
I hope everyone could have
a good time today.

643
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,235
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

644
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,504
Thank you, everyone.

645
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,674
Today's my 24th birthday.

646
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,542
Now,

647
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,312
I have an announcement to make.

648
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,682
I, Tengtang Jing,

649
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,652
will go back to Paris next month.

650
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,322
And I won't be back in the country

651
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,391
anytime soon.

652
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,428
Dad, Mom,

653
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:05,830
please forgive my willfulness.

654
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,067
Pretend that I've already gotten married.

655
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,802
Jing, what are you talking about?

656
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:11,970
You just came back.

657
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,840
Mom, I've already decided
to go back to France

658
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,942
to continue my doctorate in Law.

659
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,981
And I'll work pro bono all my life.

660
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,315
Stop talking nonsense.

661
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,951
You're my only daughter.

662
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,053
You'll take Teng Corporation
from our hands in the future.

663
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,121
Dad.

664
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,658
Your company is not mine.

665
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:38,696
I want to establish my own career
and fulfill my dreams.

666
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,067
From now on,

667
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,704
I'm not going to be
Teng Enterprises' doll anymore.

668
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,976
Elegant clothes...

669
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,445
and beautiful hair...

670
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,683
are not important to me anymore.

671
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:01,919
From now on,

672
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,489
I'll be myself.

673
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:26,978
Huaze Lei.

674
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,115
Don't disturb him now.

675
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,022
<i>What will Huaze Lei do?</i>

676
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,191
<i>If Jing leaves,</i>

677
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,126
<i>they might not see each other again.</i>

678
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,143
Regarding the contract with our company,

679
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,480
could you put in a good word
to your father?

680
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,418
I never interfere
with my father's business.

681
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,222
Regarding your company's contract,

682
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,724
we can talk about it
when I become the successor.

683
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,328
However, that would be
seven or eight years from now.

684
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,530
If your company has not gone bankrupt yet,

685
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,399
I'll consider it.

686
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,467
Thank you.

687
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,535
<i>Cocky kid.</i>

688
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,604
<i>Just like his father.</i>

689
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,046
What are you doing over there?

690
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,315
You were eavesdropping.

691
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:40,384
I didn't do it on purpose.

692
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,520
I was going to...

693
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,193
<i>I have to say something.</i>

694
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,386
