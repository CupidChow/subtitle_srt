1
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,289
Where's Ximen? Have you seen him?

2
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,025
I'm not sure. He said he's busy
so he's not coming.

3
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,094
It seems like he's on a date
with his new target.

4
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,562
New target?

5
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,230
That can't happen.

6
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,268
Daoming Si, you have
to help me this time no matter what.

7
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,338
When did you two make up?
Why aren't we aware of it?

8
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,407
Lei, we must have missed
some amazing scenes.

9
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,114
What kind of help do you need?

10
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,517
That's right, it's about Ximen.

11
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,621
That playboy asked Xiaoyou out on a date.

12
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,122
Xiaoyou broke up just a while ago.

13
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,191
If she doesn't escape
from Ximen's clutches this time,

14
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,760
she'd surely die from sadness.
You have to help me.

15
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,030
Why did Ximen's taste suddenly change?

16
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,000
Shancai, think of it this way.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,602
Xiaoyou has to grow up anyway.

18
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,904
Just let Ximen open her up
like a bud that's waiting to blossom.

19
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,306
Definitely not!

20
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,842
Daoming Si, please.
You have to stop Ximen.

21
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,077
Shancai, don't listen
to Meizuo's nonsense.

22
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,580
-Ximen knows his limits.
-No way!

23
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,015
How can I just watch Xiaoyou

24
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,817
stay beside a fox like Ximen
and not consider her safety?

25
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,620
Daoming Si, please.
You have to stop Ximen.

26
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:35,822
Well...

27
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,057
How can he do that?

28
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:40,227
Shancai, even though we're F4,
we have our own freedom.

29
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,729
Ah Si, you won't be that lame
and stop them, right?

30
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,797
I...

31
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,400
I can't do that.

32
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,203
This is what I can do.
I can ask someone to follow them.

33
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,439
This way, Xiaoyou wouldn't
be in danger, okay?

34
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,007
What do you mean
that Xiaoyou is in danger?

35
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,342
What are you thinking?

36
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,511
Is Ximen a poisonous snake or a beast?

37
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,414
I'll just ask someone to follow them.
I won't interrupt their date.

38
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,249
Lei, what do you think?

39
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,882
So, did you easily find this place?

40
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,287
My Italian friend opened this.

41
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,056
It's an interesting homestyle cafe.

42
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,359
But their coffee is really authentic.
Do you want to try it?

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,929
-Okay.
-What do you want to drink?

44
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,132
I'm fine with whatever.
I don't really know these things.

45
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,900
-I'll order for you then.
-Okay.

46
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,104
Waiter. One espresso, please.

47
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,242
Do you think our date would serve
its purpose

48
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,412
if Shancai and Daoming Si don't see us?

49
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,481
I've already leaked the news
of our date to them.

50
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,750
Based on Shancai's fussy personality,

51
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,852
she'd surely find a way
to know where we are.

52
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,489
In order to make her more hysterical,

53
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,758
call her now.

54
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,793
Okay.

55
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,630
I don't know if I'm good
at acting, though.

56
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,832
I'm afraid she'll catch on to us.

57
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,300
Just tell her what I taught you to.

58
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,570
Based on Shancai's personality, once she
gets nervous, her mind would get muddled

59
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,405
and she wouldn't be able to think
of anything else.

60
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,306
Okay.

61
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,850
-Hello, Shancai.
-Xiaoyou!

62
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,555
I know. I know you have your opinion
about Ximen.

63
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,392
But give me a chance, okay?

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,327
Let me date him properly.

65
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,099
I've already had a blinded relationship.

66
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,702
But that doesn't mean
that I won't meet good guys.

67
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,573
So don't be so biased about Ximen.

68
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,777
I believe that under
his playboy appearance,

69
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,512
there must be some real feelings inside.

70
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,015
What?

71
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,550
No.

72
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,752
You definitely cannot disturb us.

73
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,189
Don't worry. I'm fine on my own.

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,261
If something really happened,

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,430
I would have willingly consented to it.

76
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:36,670
I'll be responsible
for my own body and soul.

77
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,674
That's all. Don't worry. Bye.

78
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,109
Believe me.

79
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,446
The more you ask her not to worry,
the more nervous she'll become.

80
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,815
Then what are we going to do now?

81
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,984
What do you mean?

82
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,653
Just enjoy the date with me.

83
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,856
Don't think about anything else.

84
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,091
This way, our model date
would really be a success.

85
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,027
<i>We have to teach those fools
what lovers are supposed to do.</i>

86
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,166
Daoming Si, are you sure the person
you found was really able to follow Ximen?

87
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,168
I'm sure. You're so annoying.

88
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,070
Didn't we contact him earlier already?

89
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,738
Are you really sure?

90
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,807
I'm sure.

91
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,644
Do you know what Xiaoyou told me earlier?

92
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,280
She said that no matter what happens
between her and Ximen,

93
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,781
she would have willingly consented to it.

94
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,750
What do you think will happen
between them?

95
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,020
And she even told me she'll be responsible
for her own body and soul.

96
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,822
What does she mean by that?

97
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,057
Isn't that good?

98
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,293
It seems that Xiaoyou knows
the situation with Ximen.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,662
And Ximen is an expert.

100
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,763
He won't disappoint Xiaoyou.

101
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,399
You mean, Xiaoyou and Ximen,

102
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,433
they are thinking...

103
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,202
They are thinking of doing it?

104
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,871
All humans think about doing it.

105
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,206
I think about it too.

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,275
It's just that I'm a bit shy.

107
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,577
And I want to do it with someone I like.

108
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,146
Is this the time to be talking about this?

109
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,814
Try and see if you dare to do it.

110
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,595
They're beautiful.

111
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,366
Do you like these stuff?

112
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,535
Is it strange?

113
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,605
No.

114
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,340
It's quite unique.

115
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,009
I think this flower looks nice.

116
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,214
Do you really like them?

117
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,516
Yes.

118
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,084
Then I'll buy all of them.

119
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,453
There's no need.

120
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,289
So are you hungry?

121
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,860
Yes, I only ate a piece of cake for lunch.
And we walked around the whole afternoon.

122
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,462
I'm starving now.

123
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:21,901
The pasta here is good,
but order anything you want. Don't be shy.

124
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,205
I haven't been shy all day.

125
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,208
And it's my first time to come
to such a high-class restaurant.

126
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,711
The items on the menu are so expensive.

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,847
That's nothing.

128
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,916
It's my way of thanking you
for spending the day with me.

129
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,251
Order whatever you want.

130
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,537
This kind of wine is really good. Try it.

131
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,343
Xiaoyou.

132
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,211
Do whatever you want.

133
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,115
This way, that moron outside
can report our situation to them.

134
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,722
Ximen.

135
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,858
Actually, I've always thought
that Shancai and Daoming Si's lives

136
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,294
are too different.

137
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,298
And they both need to lower their pride
and adapt to each other.

138
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,635
Will they have many problems this way?

139
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,705
Ah Si's basically a good person,

140
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,475
but his temper is a bit bad.

141
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,313
Maybe he has a problem expressing himself.

142
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,215
You don't understand him.

143
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,717
Actually, he really loves Shancai.

144
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,022
I believe he's a good man, who knows
how to care for the woman he loves.

145
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,361
Ximen,

146
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,431
do you also know how to care
for the woman you love?

147
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,374
I'm sorry. I asked a stupid question.

148
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,378
This food looks quite good. Let's eat.

149
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,787
I'm a good man but I'm not a good person.

150
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,526
To me, the expiration date
of every woman is only one week.

151
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:39,873
<i>What?</i>

152
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,842
They're very sweet.
They're drinking wine while eating.

153
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,544
What? They're even drinking wine?

154
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,613
Ximen must want to get Xiaoyou drunk.

155
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,314
Darn it! How can he rely
on his family's wealth

156
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,682
to create such a romantic atmosphere

157
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,651
in a high-class restaurant?
Let me speak to him!

158
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,586
Hey, what are they talking about?

159
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,158
Ximen must be using sweet words
to fool Xiaoyou.

160
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,693
Watch them carefully.
Don't slack off, okay?

161
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,095
Okay.

162
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,698
This guy Ximen doesn't
have good intentions.

163
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,033
What a playboy.

164
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,768
He thinks he can do this
just because he's rich.

165
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,236
He's treating Xiaoyou like a fool.

166
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,337
I can't tolerate him.

167
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,039
Okay, eat this.

168
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,377
Why is it so delicious?

169
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,946
Eat more if it's delicious.

170
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,682
You like interfering
with other people's business so much,

171
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,150
but you're not taking care of yourself.

172
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,554
You don't eat much. You're too thin.

173
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,356
-Who says so?
-You don't think so?

174
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,559
That night when we watched
the meteor shower,

175
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,428
while I was hugging you, I was thinking,

176
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,131
why are Shancai's boobs so small?

177
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,933
You pervert!

178
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,367
I don't want you to be like this.

179
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,938
When you're dating me,
I don't want you to be this thin.

180
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,407
It looks like you're having a hard time.

181
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,976
I don't feel that I'm having a hard time.

182
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,946
And my boobs are naturally small.

183
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,118
Fine, I'll eat.

184
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,726
<i>Turns out he's even worried
about such things on my behalf.</i>

185
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,660
<i>How about me, though?</i>

186
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,697
<i>Now or even before we started dating,</i>

187
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,866
<i>it seems like I don't really think
about things on his behalf.</i>

188
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,744
<i>Yes, Young Master.</i>

189
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:28,581
<i>After having dinner,
Young Master Ximen held Miss Xiaoyou</i>

190
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,117
<i>and checked into the Maple Lead Hotel.</i>

191
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,952
<i>The room number is 601.</i>

192
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,132
Miss, please give me room number 602.

193
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,667
Okay, I'll check for you now.

194
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,669
It is unoccupied.

195
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,372
It's NTD 50,000 for one night.
Are you paying with cash or credit card?

196
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,840
-NTD 50,000?
-Yes.

197
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,312
-I'm Daoming Si. Give her that room.
-Yes, we'll process it right away.

198
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,248
Young Master Ximen is now
in room 601, right?

199
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,950
He checked into that room,

200
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,952
but he told us earlier
that he's going out for a while.

201
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,487
-Miss, hurry up, please?
-Yes.

202
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,388
All right.

203
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,904
Hey. What are you doing?

204
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,074
Ximen and Xiaoyou's room
is behind this wall.

205
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,776
Why are you so stupid?

206
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,678
This is our hotel.

207
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,212
It's not some cheap motel.

208
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,114
How is it possible for you to hear them?

209
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,516
That's right.

210
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,686
Because your family opened such a hotel
where one room costs NTD 50,000,

211
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,622
perverts like Ximen who fool girls
can check-in here.

212
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,325
Why are you harming people like this?

213
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,126
Do you want to have a fight?

214
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,697
Ximen's not in his room now.

215
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,365
Then Xiaoyou's temporarily out of danger.

216
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,068
Do you think I should barge
into their room and get Xiaoyou out?

217
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,738
Xiaoyou especially told me
to give her a chance, though.

218
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,840
What would Ximen do?

219
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,510
He'll use his exclusive tricks.

220
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,979
What exclusive tricks?

221
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,783
Like his secrets in pursuing women.

222
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,720
I heard no woman has ever managed
to resist them.

223
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,022
Then what will he do?

224
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,227
I think it's champagne with roses.

225
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,896
Those things that women like.

226
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,373
Who is it?

227
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,009
-Hello, room service.
-Hey.

228
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,012
We didn't order this. We're room 602.

229
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,514
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

230
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,816
-I'm sorry.
-Can you check, please?

231
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,184
Wait a moment.

232
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,554
That's right. We ordered this.
Please take this in.

233
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,764
Just put it over here.

234
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,574
Thank you.

235
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,679
-Hey. We didn't--
-Ximen must have ordered this.

236
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,348
That guy made a mistake.

237
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,151
We got this now.
Ximen can't play his tricks anymore.

238
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,353
You...

239
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,489
This pervert Ximen
even prepared chocolates.

240
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,325
All right.

241
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,860
Let's not be shy then.

242
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,662
There are so many things to eat down here.

243
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,469
I'll eat one.

244
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,338
You...

245
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,176
You haven't received flowers
from me, right?

246
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,144
Yes. So what?

247
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,148
I'll give these to you then.

248
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,818
Thank you.

249
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:01,227
Didn't you say Ximen has more tricks?
What else would he do?

250
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,166
Wait, I'll open the door.

251
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:18,778
Here.

252
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,214
Another one of Ximen's tricks.

253
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,048
Thank you. It was really nice.

254
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,984
Would you two like to dance?

255
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:12,798
Do you want some cola?

256
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,572
Do you think this is really effective?

257
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,841
Thank you.

258
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,244
They're enjoying my exclusive tricks now.

259
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,247
If they're still fighting
every three minutes,

260
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,716
that would really spoil the mood.

261
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,452
So you're a really romantic guy.

262
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,492
I feel sorry for Shancai though.

263
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,429
She's so worried about me.
That's why she's closely watching us.

264
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,032
She even got the room next door to us.

265
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,370
If she knows that everything
is just a setup that I'm helping you with,

266
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,838
then...

267
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,741
You say this is a setup.
Isn't that too serious?

268
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,911
Our intentions are good.

269
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,881
I think Shancai would thank you
if she finds out.

270
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,749
Really?

271
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,853
How long should we stay here then?

272
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,944
Hey. You stepped on my foot.

273
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,113
So what? Can't you endure it a bit?
Why are you shouting?

274
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,015
You stepped on me
and won't even allow me to shout.

275
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,650
You really deserve a beating.

276
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,719
Deserve a beating? You only think
about beating up people.

277
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,387
You violent pig!

278
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,089
Who's a pig?

279
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,524
You! And you're the most stupid pig.

280
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,560
-I'm stupid?
-Yes.

281
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,695
You've been calling me stupid
so many times!

282
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,630
Try and do it again.

283
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,298
Stupid!

284
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,366
You're stupid!

285
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,868
Don't think I won't get mad at you!

286
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,471
Get mad then. After you get mad,
you're still going to be stupid!

287
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,272
I...

288
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,175
What are you looking at?

289
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,645
Are you happy
that I'm being given an earful?

290
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,679
Do you want to die?

291
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,347
Play your violin inside the restroom!

292
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,884
Why are you getting mad
at him for no reason?

293
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,052
How did he get on your nerves?

294
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,454
And it's all because
your family's hotel is too lousy.

295
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,223
If I have money,
I won't come here for a date.

296
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,824
It's expensive
and it's not romantic at all.

297
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,394
It's better to eat ice cream
in the streets. It's cheap and romantic.

298
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,797
Who says we're here on a date?

299
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,700
You said you wanted to come here
to follow Xiaoyou and Ximen.

300
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,069
That's right. How can I forget?

301
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,574
You two... What are you doing here?

302
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,245
We're doing what you're doing.

303
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,647
Ximen, do you want me to beat you up?

304
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,815
Shancai, I'm sorry.

305
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,252
We were thinking that if we help arrange
a romantic date for you and Daoming Si,

306
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,687
you surely won't agree.

307
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,689
So Ximen thought of this idea.

308
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,391
Then I worked with him
for this model date.

309
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,826
Model date your face!

310
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,362
Do I need you to be so nosy?

311
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,730
Xiaoyou.

312
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,965
Turns out you worked with him to trick me.

313
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,234
I'm so mad. Go away!

314
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,369
Shancai.

315
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,470
Shancai...

316
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,944
These jerks teamed up to fool me.

317
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,982
That guy Daoming Si.

318
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,252
Come out. Stop playing.

319
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,359
You can go now. It's fine.

320
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:05,965
Ah Si.

321
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,534
I worked so hard to design such a...

322
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,137
You really messed it up just like that.

323
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,738
Whatever.

324
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,940
What exactly happened earlier?

325
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,078
Xiaoyou must have brought Shancai back.

326
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,679
You better fix
that expression on your face.

327
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,655
Mrs. Daoming.

328
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,725
Ah Si, Mrs. Daoming is here.

329
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,098
Mom, when did you come back?

330
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,604
I came back today.

331
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,274
And I came here to handle some matters.

332
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:52,278
They told me
that you checked into a room today.

333
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,180
So I came over to check.

334
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,183
Why are you staying here?

335
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,752
No reason.

336
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,721
Mrs. Daoming, this is my idea.

337
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,690
I wanted
to discuss some things with Ah Si,

338
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,258
and I was afraid
that it would be too late.

339
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,495
So I booked a room.
I thought we could stay overnight.

340
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,097
Ah Si.

341
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,967
I remember I told you not only once

342
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,169
that even though your life may be long,

343
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,072
you have to grow up sometime.

344
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,741
Actually, life is very short.

345
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,512
Don't waste your time
on such a lame person.

346
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,950
Stay here tonight if you want to.
I'll go home first.

347
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,492
That was close. Good thing Shancai
and Xiaoyou left before your mom arrived.

348
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,527
Otherwise, you're dead.

349
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,597
No.

350
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,332
You can't stay here now.

351
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,601
Isn't Shancai living in your house now?

352
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,735
What if your mom...

353
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,780
Nothing happened while I was away, right?

354
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:02,781
Everything's fine.

355
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,951
-Prepare my bath. I'm tired.
-Yes, ma'am.

356
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,122
Welcome home, ma'am. Please have some tea.

357
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,325
Aunt Yu, thank you for taking care
of the household in my absence.

358
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,094
Don't mention it. That's part of my job.

359
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:17,830
Aunt Yu.

360
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,701
I asked you to manage the household mainly
to supervise Ah Si on my behalf.

361
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,204
So he won't mess around
with indecent girls.

362
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,306
Did you watch him well for me?

363
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:31,477
There are no indecent girls messing around
with Young Master lately.

364
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,146
So please don't worry, ma'am.

365
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,349
That poor girl...

366
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,787
the one that I mentioned to you before,
did you already send her away for me?

367
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,623
If you're referring to Shancai, ma'am,

368
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,294
I've already instructed her
to take care of Young Master

369
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,562
and be his personal maid.

370
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,568
Aunt Yu, you must be getting old.

371
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,337
How can this happen?

372
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,372
Explain it to me right away.

373
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,308
I'm sorry about this.

374
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,344
I made my own decision
without your consent.

375
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,380
That child works very hard though.

376
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,915
She wakes up at 5 a.m.

377
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,985
and continues working after school.

378
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,754
I think they're dating right now.

379
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,025
It's natural for her to want
to take care of Young Master.

380
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,728
What did you say?

381
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,763
You even allowed them to date?

382
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:31,537
I don't think it's good
to break up a couple that's in love.

383
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,339
It doesn't seem right.

384
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,108
I don't want to hear these lousy reasons.

385
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,845
Aunt Yu. You've worked
in the Daoming household for 60 years.

386
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,315
You should know very well
that the Daoming family's children

387
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,084
are not ordinary people.

388
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,952
Ah Si is someone with a bright future.

389
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,223
How can you let such a poor
and lowly girl destroy his life?

390
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,726
Where is that savage girl now?

391
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,027
At the guest room upstairs.

392
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,135
Aunt Yu.

393
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,337
Why did you let this gross girl

394
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,639
who is similar
to sewer rats come into my house?

395
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,410
I'll leave immediately.
Please don't blame Aunt Yu.

396
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,380
Stop.

397
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,783
How much do you want?

398
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,351
What?

399
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,788
You fought with me for so long.
Aren't you after the money?

400
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:24,890
Tell me how much.

401
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,193
As long as you can say it, I'll pay you.

402
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,896
After you get the money,

403
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,399
don't get involved
with Daoming Si anymore.

404
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,168
And don't have anything to do
with the Daoming household either.

405
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,971
Ten million was too little
for you the last time.

406
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,439
How about 50 million?

407
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,275
Or do you want 100 million?

408
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,747
Tell me. How much do you want?

409
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,316
Ma'am, are you done?

410
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,622
I would surely disagree
to send this child away today.

411
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,526
Aunt Yu.

412
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,062
Do you know what you're saying?

413
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,363
I know very well.

414
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,199
I've worked in the Daoming household
for 60 years.

415
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,368
Ma'am, you must have forgotten

416
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,371
what Ah Si's grandfather said
when he was dying.

417
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,475
I, Yu Sao, will work here
until the day I die.

418
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,479
What do you mean by that?

419
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,748
What I mean is very clear.

420
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,853
If this child leaves today,
I won't live until the next morning.

421
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,401
Aunt Yu.

422
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,171
I will let you win tonight.

423
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,775
However, you have to know

424
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,878
that I'm the one who makes the decisions
in this household.

425
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,147
No one can mess around here.

426
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,152
Thank you, ma'am.

427
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,195
I'm sorry.

428
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,500
Thank you, Aunt Yu.

429
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,169
You're so protective of me.

430
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,839
Stop staring at me with that ugly face.

431
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,917
My husband was a soldier.

432
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,754
He died during World War II.

433
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,992
I was just 19 years old then.

434
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,329
Ah Si's late grandfather took me in.

435
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,965
That's why I had a place to stay.

436
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,937
So I swore to work
for this household my whole life.

437
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,308
Now, Master is all grown up.

438
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:02,581
Madam married into this family.
Zhuang and Ah Si were born.

439
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,785
This family had been happy
for over several decades.

440
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:12,090
But as Master's businesses expanded,

441
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,727
this house became cold.

442
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,066
Young Master Ah Si was the one
who got affected the most.

443
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,671
I remember that starting
from when he was in grade five,

444
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,474
he would come home every day
with blood all over him.

445
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,910
I thought they were just stains.

446
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,379
They were not.

447
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,717
It was the blood of the people who got
hurt after he beat them up.

448
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,224
Master and Madam only used
their money to resolve matters.

449
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:50,996
So Young Master Ah Si
became even worse day by day.

450
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,301
When I came back this time though,
I've noticed that he's changed.

451
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,472
You were the one who changed him, right?

452
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,941
Me? I didn't.

453
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,910
Actually, I didn't do anything.

454
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,280
I just hated his arrogant ways in school.

455
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,549
So we had a confrontation.

456
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,318
At that time, I punched him like this.

457
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,387
That's it.

458
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,590
Nobody dares to do that
to him in this household.

459
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,059
Ever since Zhuang got married,

460
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,462
nobody else can handle him
in this household.

461
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,667
Actually, I had a really hard time
when I was fighting with him back then.

462
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,239
Whatever you say,
you can't leave this house.

463
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,475
I'll protect you with my life.

464
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,777
But...

465
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,413
I know what you're worried about.

466
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,850
Don't worry. I have an idea.

467
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,720
Aunt Yu, based on the way you're smiling,
I think it's better for me to leave.

468
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,056
Stupid girl! Do you want me to die?

469
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:55,794
Let me tell you. If you go out that door,
I'll hang myself in front of you.

470
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,730
You're threatening me? That's horrible!

471
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:03,235
Miss, there is only one way
to solve this problem.

472
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:09,207
I want you to do it with Young Master
and have a baby.

473
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,209
Aunt Yu, what are you talking about?

474
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,712
-I think I should--
-Go on a journey of love.

475
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:18,483
In such a romantic atmosphere
at a foreign land,

476
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,686
hit it in one shot. What do you think?

477
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,654
Aunt Yu, that's really ridiculous.

478
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,991
It's not ridiculous at all.
I'll arrange it for you soon.

479
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,693
This is such a good plan.

480
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,929
There's no need, Aunt Yu. Thank you.
I think I should just--

481
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,766
You can't just leave.
No, you have to stay.

482
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,370
But I can't do
what you're suggesting, Aunt Yu.

483
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:39,771
I'll die if you can't do it.

484
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,707
-How can you threaten me?
-How am I threatening you?

485
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,141
Help! Let me leave!

486
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,010
No, you can't leave!

487
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,729
Why did you bring
that weed, Shancai, here?

488
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,200
Don't you care about the Daoming
household's safety and privacy?

489
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,103
Don't you care
about this family's reputation?

490
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,638
I don't know what this has
to do with our reputation.

491
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,608
Shancai's family is in trouble.
I took her into our house.

492
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,876
What's so embarrassing about that?

493
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,513
Do you think the Daoming household
is a shelter or a hotel?

494
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,117
Are you going to bring back all
the girls who are out on the streets?

495
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,919
-Don't you think they're dirty?
-What are you implying?

496
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,422
Just say it directly.

497
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,261
I only know that decent young ladies

498
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,030
won't just live together
with a man that easy.

499
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,599
Mom.

500
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,001
You're the one who's thinking
about gross things.

501
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,370
Let's stop talking.
I'm going to find Shancai.

502
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,271
Stop right there!

503
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,577
This is the truth I'm seeing.

504
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,248
You're going to this girl's room
in the middle of the night.

505
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,383
A girl whose door is always open for men

506
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,152
to go into does not have the right
to live here.

507
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,155
Did you already send Shancai away?

508
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,461
Let me tell you once again.

509
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,197
That kind of dirty girl does not have
a right to live in my house.

510
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,436
Don't waste your time anymore.
I would never agree to this.

511
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,575
Why didn't you send Shancai away?

512
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,183
Shancai!

513
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,319
-Young Master, lower your voice.
-Aunt Yu.

514
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,121
Why are you in Shancai's room?
Where's Shancai?

515
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,989
Shancai's already asleep.

516
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,559
Madam wanted to send her away today.

517
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,561
I fought with my life for her to stay.

518
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:44,996
So it's you.

519
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,300
How did you do it?

520
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,068
I guaranteed her with my life.

521
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:55,073
As long as I'm alive,
Mrs. Daoming can't just send Shancai away.

522
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,509
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

523
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:02,314
Aunt Yu. You're the best.

524
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,683
Let me speak with Shancai.
I want to talk to her.

525
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:05,917
Cut it out.

526
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,086
Young Master.

527
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,856
If you don't want madam to misunderstand

528
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,859
that Shancai is a bad girl
who doesn't conduct herself well,

529
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,427
you also have to behave.

530
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,230
And it's so late now.
She's already asleep.

531
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,500
Don't worry. I'll stay with her tonight.

532
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,068
Don't be too willful, okay?

533
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,603
-I...
-All right.

534
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,505
Go back.

535
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:33,712
Hey.

536
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,180
Ximen?

537
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,819
No, she fought with my mom today.
Good thing Aunt Yu defended her.

538
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,320
Okay.

539
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,257
Sure, I'll go there later.

540
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,864
If the Empress Dowager is already back,

541
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,233
then I won't go to Ah Si's house anymore.

542
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,135
That's not the point, okay?

543
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,638
Did you forget that Shancai is working
as a maid at Ah Si's house now?

544
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,705
I know.

545
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:04,242
Now, it's like Shancai is having a
direct confrontation with Empress Dowager.

546
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:09,814
Can you still remember
what Shancai said to her before she left?

547
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,449
I'm a nobody.

548
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,719
Perhaps for you, I'm just like a weed.

549
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,322
But you need to be clear that

550
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,225
I've never done anything for people
to look down on me and despise me.

551
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,496
But now, I sincerely despise you.

552
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,565
Think about it.

553
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,567
The Empress Dowager comes back,

554
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,136
she finds out that her own son
is still with this weed,

555
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,805
and she's even living in her house.

556
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,707
Then she'll surely have a stroke.

557
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:38,977
Ah Si's here.

558
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,579
Ah Si, over here.

559
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,050
Did your mom see Shancai?

560
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,120
-Yes.
-Was she really mad?

561
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,292
She'll surely use
more intense tricks this time.

562
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,061
What are you planning to do?

563
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,197
What else can I do?

564
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,266
Why are you talking like that?

565
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,435
I'm not Shancai but I feel weak
after hearing that.

566
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,439
It's my responsibility to protect
and not let Shancai be defeated by my mom.

567
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,240
What are you planning to do then?

568
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,377
I'll cross the bridge when I get there.

569
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,014
You can't think about it too simply.
It's your mother we're talking about.

570
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,218
Hey, Lei. Can't you give some suggestions?

571
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:22,821
Ah Si.

572
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,657
What if you move out with Shancai?

573
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,960
Knock it off. Empress Dowager
would surely find them right away.

574
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,196
I think that's a good idea.

575
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,032
Just hide first.

576
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,134
Actually, hiding is not the point.

577
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,470
They probably can't hide from her anyway.

578
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,405
The point is,

579
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,707
Shancai lives in your house now.

580
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:46,077
Because of Shancai, you'll surely fight
with your mom.

581
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,347
Based on Shancai's personality,
she'd also do the same.

582
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,816
Then Empress Dowager
will surely be more mad.

583
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,452
Someone like her would not
be able to take it.

584
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,423
That's why if you two can move out,

585
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,525
that would at least lessen the conflict.

586
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,095
That way, it won't involve people like
Aunt Yu who has nothing to do with this.

587
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,367
Ah Si, Lei's analysis makes sense.

588
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,535
You can consider it.

589
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,137
Ah Si, what do you think?

590
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,908
If I get to the bridge
and I couldn't cross it,

591
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,644
no matter what my mom does,

592
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,546
it would still be impossible for me
to leave Shancai.

593
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,853
<i>Because Mrs. Yu really used her life</i>

594
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,555
to threaten you,

595
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,192
will you just let Shancai stay here?

596
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,028
It will be harder
for Young Master to leave her this way.

597
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,166
Also, if Miss Xiaozi finds out about this,

598
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,635
it would be harder
for her to change her mind.

599
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,105
Ma'am, I was thinking

600
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,576
that Shancai's reason
for not taking the money before

601
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,378
is not that simple.

602
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,950
Her plan might be to replace you

603
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,352
and become the Daoming household's
only female master.

604
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,924
I won't let her win.

605
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,059
Yutian.

606
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:13,598
Didn't the report mention that Shancai
had some good childhood friends?

607
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,974
Hey, Shancai.

608
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,143
Why didn't you wait for me
and leave by yourself?

609
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,445
Okay, fine.
Do you have an afternoon class?

610
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,314
I'll pick you up and take you somewhere.

611
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,616
You'll know when you get there. Okay, bye.

612
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,136
What's the matter?

613
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,339
I'm regretting it already.

614
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,409
I'm Daoming Si.
I'm sitting in such a cute place.

615
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,812
It's so embarrassing.

616
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,113
Then why did you come?

617
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,617
You said you want to go on a date
in interesting places like these.

618
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,686
You still remembered that?
I just said it randomly yesterday.

619
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,854
Yes.

620
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,926
It's really not suitable for you
to sit in a place like this though.

621
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,496
Thank you.

622
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,666
It looks so good.

623
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,006
It's delicious.

624
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,209
Don't just drink coffee.
Order the same thing that I got.

625
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,110
No.

626
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,645
Try it.

627
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,979
No.

628
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,147
Just try it.

629
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,649
Why are you so annoying?

630
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:38,616
I don't care.

631
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,190
Why is it so sweet?

632
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,025
Why are you wiping it?

633
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,194
You're afraid of my saliva?

634
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,428
Haven't we been kissing lately--

635
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,464
Stop talking about it. Drink your coffee.

636
00:38:58,703 --> 00:38:59,671
Shancai.

637
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,373
What exactly happened last night?

638
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:09,147
Actually, it's not a big deal.
After I went home last night...

639
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,883
Aunt Yu went to my room
and chatted with me.

640
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,652
And I was really tired so I fell asleep.

641
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,895
I want to move out.

642
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,030
Move out?

643
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:26,931
Yes.

644
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,769
What do you mean?
Do you know what moving out means?

645
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,241
It means living outside.
And living in a smaller place.

646
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,111
You'll live outside on your own.
Nobody would take care of you.

647
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,779
You have to cook for yourself every day.

648
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,681
And you have to pay rent monthly.

649
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,484
And you have to pay the water
and electric bills. Do you know that?

650
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,253
Do you know where to pay them?

651
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,188
You're so upsetting.

652
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,191
It is upsetting to live alone.

653
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,293
And why do you have to...

654
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,328
If I don't leave that house,
how can I protect you?

655
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,539
There's no need to do that. Stop it.

656
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,541
I'm going to school.

657
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:14,779
QINGHE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
XIAOYOU INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

658
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,684
You know what to do, right?

659
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,219
Yes.

660
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,697
Mom, what exactly happened?

661
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,799
Why did you urgently ask me to come home?

662
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,503
Xiaoyou. Your dad was demoted.

663
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,604
Why?

664
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,706
Wasn't he supposed to be transferred
to another department

665
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,508
and be the director there?

666
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,642
That's right.

667
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,412
But your dad called earlier and said

668
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,214
that they want to transfer him
to the factory of their downstream sector.

669
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,452
This is their way of firing him.

670
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,154
Why did it turn out this way?

671
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,889
The economy is so bad.

672
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,491
If your dad loses his job,

673
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,429
we still owe the bank lots
of money for our mortgage.

674
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,032
I don't know what to do.

675
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,635
Why did this happen?

676
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,409
Why are you so moody?

677
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,411
What's the matter?
Weren't you just fine earlier?

678
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,615
It must be because my mom is back, right?

679
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,485
Why won't you tell me?

680
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,388
Why won't you tell me what happened
when you met my mom last night?

681
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,992
She must have said
a lot of bad things, right?

682
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,595
Why won't you tell me anything?

683
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,897
What exactly happened last night? Tell me.

684
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,699
It's not you.

685
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,368
It's my pride.

686
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,436
Am I that unreliable to you?

687
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,007
That's not it. It's just that I...

688
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,708
Just what?

689
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,677
I just don't want you to move out.

690
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:56,347
Who am I moving out for?
I'm doing it for you.

691
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,648
I know.

692
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,584
I know you're doing it for me.

693
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,519
Then why are you acting like this? I--

694
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,354
Because I don't want you to protect me.

695
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:08,459
If I let you protect me, our relationship
won't be balanced anymore.

696
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,795
I don't want that to happen.

697
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,198
I know you might not find me cute
when I say this,

698
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,268
but I don't want our relationship
to turn out like that.

699
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,771
You're really not cute at all.

700
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,342
I don't know what to do anymore.

701
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:30,448
Why can't you be like other girls
and be a bit more delicate?

702
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,116
Rely on me a bit.

703
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,220
Never mind.

704
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,090
I love you for who you are.

705
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,495
Actually, I understand your intentions.

706
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,964
And I'm very happy about it.

707
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,633
So...

708
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:50,635
So what?

709
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,432
Hey, Dad. How are you?

710
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:24,902
No way!

711
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,938
Why did we suddenly go bankrupt?

712
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,307
Aren't we nouveau riche?

713
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,778
Why would we have insufficient funds?
It wasn't easy for us to become rich.

714
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,116
I won't lose anything because of it.

715
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,719
Besides, that's how people greet
each other overseas.

716
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:45,189
It's fine even if girls initiate, right?

717
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:48,693
What are you talking about?

718
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,261
Nothing, just kissing...

719
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,831
You won't lose anything because of it.

720
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,733
That's how people greet
each other overseas.

721
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,435
You mean kissing, right?

722
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,705
Why are you eavesdropping?
You're really mean.

723
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:04,142
Shancai, people don't usually
talk to themselves, right?

724
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:06,110
You kissed Ah Si.

725
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,779
It's not a big deal.

726
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,215
That's how people greet
each other overseas.

727
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,551
That's how people greet
each other overseas?

728
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,987
Then greet me the same way.

729
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:17,421
Hi.

730
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,490
That's not what you said earlier.

731
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:20,958
Come on, hurry.

732
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,585
