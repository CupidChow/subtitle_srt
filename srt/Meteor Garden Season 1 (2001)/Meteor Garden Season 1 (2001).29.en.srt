1
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,062
Shancai!

2
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,997
Oh, my, Shancai, great!

3
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,665
We did it!

4
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,134
Let's get inside!

5
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,703
Let's go.

6
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,764
I can't stand up.

7
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,401
I've bought all we need.

8
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,836
-Why are you so slow?
-Gosh.

9
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,104
Why did you pinch my face?

10
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,739
There were many people over there.

11
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,809
You're always very slow.

12
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,312
Could you be gentler to me?
You're too harsh on me.

13
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,780
Here.

14
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,382
I don't want it anymore.

15
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,550
You don't?

16
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,351
You said you wanted to eat it just now.

17
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,519
You're a pain in the neck.

18
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,288
I just don't want to eat it now.

19
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,325
How can you recover
if you don't eat anything?

20
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,661
You haven't fully recovered yet.

21
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,865
Listen. No matter what happens,

22
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,568
don't hurt yourself anymore. Okay?

23
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,405
To be honest,

24
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,274
I thought I was going to die
when I was on the hunger strike.

25
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,944
I would be so regretful if I died.

26
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,478
Why?

27
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,613
Are you stupid?

28
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,783
Because you haven’t told me
that you love me.

29
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,019
Is that important?

30
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,254
Of course!

31
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,725
Will you feel good if you've never been
truly loved by anyone?

32
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,663
There you go again.
You're always avoiding my questions.

33
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,866
I've told you that I love you.
Why can't you say it even once?

34
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,933
I love you.

35
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,204
What did you say? Say it once more.

36
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,473
I've said it but you didn't hear me.

37
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,941
Why would you say it so casually?

38
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,010
I honestly didn't hear anything.
Say it again, okay?

39
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,478
Why are you being so mean to me?

40
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,081
No. I've already said it,
but you just didn't hear me.

41
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,048
I'm done!

42
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,651
I honestly didn't hear you.
Say it again, okay?

43
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,752
No!

44
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,720
Shancai!

45
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,169
I love you.

46
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,665
<i>At a night like this,
it's a good thing that I'm not alone</i>

47
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,934
<i>to continue thinking about sad things.</i>

48
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,304
<i>Though that jerk Daoming Si
was the one who barged in here,</i>

49
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,839
<i>it feels a bit different from usual.</i>

50
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,208
Go away! It hurts!

51
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,051
This is a nice song.

52
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,897
My boyfriend and I think
you're a great singer.

53
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,398
Really? Thank you.

54
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,400
-Let's request a song.
-Request a song?

55
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,402
Sorry, this is the only song I know.

56
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,338
I'm good at this song
because I sing it a lot.

57
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,973
What's the title?

58
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,107
"Can't Help Falling in Love."

59
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,909
-It's really nice.
-Really? Thank you.

60
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:57,844
All right, enjoy.

61
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,946
"Enjoy"?

62
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,218
<i>I don't know why</i>

63
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,254
<i>But I met you again</i>

64
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,671
Hey, Xiaofang.

65
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,272
Yeah.

66
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,907
Tonight?

67
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:29,876
Of course.

68
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,144
All right. See you tonight.

69
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,580
Aren't you staying at home tonight?

-Hello, everyone. We're F4.

72
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,258
Thank you for supporting <i>Meteor Garden</i>
in these four months.

73
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,660
We've finished all the filming.

74
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,029
We're sad to see this end.

75
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,735
We want to show you some awesome clips
from the four months of filming.

76
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,839
We'll show them to you later
in today's episode.

77
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,907
So,

78
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,509

<i>METEOR</i>
DIFFICULT SCENES

80
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,985
HEAVY RAIN

81
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,690
<i>This was a heartbreaking and touching
breakup scene under the heavy rain.</i>

82
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,126
<i>Although it was just a few minutes,</i>

83
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:57,063
<i>the two lovebirds, Daoming Si
and Shancai, didn't have it easy.</i>

84
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,899
<i>It was hard to control the flow of water,</i>

85
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,536
<i>so they had been soaking wet in the water
for two days straight</i>

86
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,038
<i>before this scene was completed.</i>

87
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,706
<i>They really had a hard time.</i>

00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,653
Drop the rain between them. Thank you.

90
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,389
All right, counting down. Get ready!

91
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,325
I can't open my eyes!

92
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,061
Help!

93
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,863
-The rain is already too heavy.
-Stop!

94
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,197
I'm so cold.

95
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,099
-It's really cold.
-You did great.

96
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,236
Why do my lips look so pale even if
I applied lipstick? I don't get it.

97
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,638
WATER STREAMS

98
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,375
I don't know if these are tears
in my eyes or it's the water.

99
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:46,513
T-Rex and I have filmed
a lot of hard scenes together.

100
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,116
I think this scene under the heavy rain
was the hardest one among them.

101
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:55,722
We filmed that scene the entire night
until dawn.

102
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,657
The lighting was too inconsistent
to continue filming,

103
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,659
so we had to film it again
the next evening.

104
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,561
By then, I was soaked to the skin.

105
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:05,098
Even my underwear was soaking wet.

106
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,701
We were shivering
because it was so cold at dawn.

107
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,904
We both had a cold that time.

108
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,273
I remember the most difficult scene was

109
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,142
when I was supposed to turn around,
take a breath, and call Daoming Si,

110
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,477
but I coughed,

111
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,214
so I choked on water
and couldn't stop coughing.

112
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,882
It was really uncomfortable.

113
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,784
T-Rex went all red-eyed.

114
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,120
Maybe it was because
of the contact lenses he wore

115
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,088
and the rainwater
that directly hit his eyes.

116
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,624
The water was pretty dirty,

117
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,293
so his eyes felt uncomfortable.

118
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,931
It was really a very hard night
for both of us.

119
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,233
That scene was so difficult.

120
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,336
That was a difficult scene to shoot,
because that rain...

121
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,140
They were using a rain-making machine,

122
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,809
and the flow of water was unstable.

123
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,012
We also thought
that it wasn't the cleanest water.

124
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,148
Actually, I was not feeling well that day,

125
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,484
but the staff were trying their best
to take care of us.

126
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,988
They felt upset to see us like that.

127
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,157
KISSING SCENES

128
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,861
<i>Why were the audiences so impressed
by</i> Meteor Garden?

129
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,131
<i>These numerous kissing scenes
were definitely one of the reasons.</i>

130
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,434
<i>It was up to the director and the actors</i>

131
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,737
<i>to deliver the perfect
romantic kissing scenes,</i>

132
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:22,008
<i>even that difficult
forceful kissing scene.</i>

133
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,876
<i>During the filming
of these special kissing scenes,</i>

134
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:28,014
<i>the actors learned a lot
from the director's demonstration.</i>

135
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,251
You're just forcefully hugging her!

136
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,354
Your shoulders still blocked the camera.

137
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,723
THE DIRECTOR'S DEMONSTRATION

138
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,725
When you were doing this...

139
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:40,793
You acted really weird.

140
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,029
There should be a powerful force
when you're doing this.

141
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,498
She's resisting violently
and struggling with him.

142
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,433
So, can I grab like this?

143
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,736
You can grab her like this
and hold this side.

144
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,371
You'll be blocking her face in that way.

145
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,739
-Grab right here?
-Like this.

146
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,507
-No, grab here. Right, hold this.
-Yeah.

147
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,109
Grab this side of her face.

148
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,678
-Hold her down. Okay, I get it now.
-Grab it, and you'll be fine.

149
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,314
Want to kiss me?

150
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,884
<i>Daoming Si and Shancai were new on acting,</i>

151
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,220
<i>but they had so many kissing scenes.</i>

152
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,656
<i>During the filming of the first
kissing scene in Daoming Si's house,</i>

153
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>they were so nervous,

154
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,661

GOSH. WHAT'S THE NEXT LINE?

158
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,403
WHY DON'T YOU FOLLOW MY LINES?

159
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,140
Shouldn't you ask me about that foreigner?

160
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,041
Daoming Si.

161
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:28,975

162
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,943
I'm so nervous!

163
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,513
FORGOT THE LINES

164
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,547
AGAIN...

165
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,050

00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,853
Hey, can you be more gentle?
Will you take responsibility if it scars?

168
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,255
I'll take...

169
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,590
You'll what?

170
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,225
I'll pay you.

171
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,227
TOO NERVOUS

172
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,199
Five, four, three, two.

BLOOPER THREE

174
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,904
I'm sorry.

<i>For example, this deep kissing scene</i>

179
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,385
<i>was filmed while everyone
was watching them.</i>

180
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,854
Director, I'm sorry.
Could I do it once for you?

181
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,656
Look at us.

182
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,824
Is this what you mean?

183
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,858
The other side.

184
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,759
Right, that's right.

185
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,261
Right, you should try a few more times.

186
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,630
SHANCAI CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE

187
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,333
I'm so mad.

188
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,635
Daoming Si is such a playboy.

189
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,910
He...

190
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,479
He kissed Li Zhen before,

191
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,948
and now he kissed Xiaozi.

192
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,151
What do I mean to him?

193
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:55,528
During my first kissing scene with T-Rex,
I felt like I was kissing a little rabbit.

194
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,530
When we were filming the kissing scene,

195
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,665
I was not familiar with him at all.

196
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,701
We didn't talk much then.

197
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,872
I felt like he was so mysterious.
He was serious and didn't talk much.

198
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,473
I didn't know how he felt towards me then.

199
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,710
That scene was filmed when we weren't
so familiar with each other.

200
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,578
He said he was nervous.

201
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,748
Actually, I wasn't feeling nervous
back then,

202
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,450
because I thought...

203
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,621
it was just a kissing scene
where we would kiss. No big deal.

204
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,624
I didn't know her much at that time.

205
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,492
I didn't talk much with her back then.

206
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,363
So I was feeling awkward
during the filming of the kissing scenes.

207
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,632
Right. But she's...

208
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,234
Yeah, I found out afterward
that she was actually very nice.

209
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,639
I didn't feel embarrassed anymore
unlike before.

210
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,575
ACTION SCENES

211
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,247
<i>There were inevitably difficult
action scenes for Shancai and the F4</i>

212
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,049
<i>to make the show more enjoyable.</i>

213
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,951
<i>Although the scenes were not that long,</i>

214
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,654
<i>the actors had a hard time filming them.</i>

215
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,425
<i>Just like Vic Chou,
for the two scenes with the handstand.</i>

216
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,061
<i>He tried to hang upside down many times,</i>

217
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,465
<i>having blood rush for nearly half an hour,
before he finally did it.</i>

218
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,667
We're filming.
Just go up to the monkey bar.

219
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,603
Okay. Yeah. Action.

220
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,838
FILMING SITE

221
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,774
COME ON, MAKE IT FAST!

222
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,743
Move your hands to another position.

223
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,644
What?

224
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,414
WHERE SHOULD I PUT THEM?

225
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,049
Put them behind your back.

226
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,918
-Put them behind your back.
-Put them behind your back.

227
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,521
I CAN'T HOLD ON MUCH LONGER!

228
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,655
Open up your eyes.

229
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,557
-Hold my feet, please.
-I'll do it for you.

230
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,060
Open up your eyes.

231
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,828
Open your eyes wider.

232
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,763
I can't open them at all.

233
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,168
The director asked me to hang upside down,
and I haven't worked out for a long time.

234
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,669
So after I went upside down,

235
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,172
and it was raining, I felt so dizzy.

236
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,341
First, it was the dizziness,
then I felt...

237
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,277
Anyway, I did the stunt. The director said
maybe I haven't worked out for too long.

238
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,679
Then I felt...

239
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,249
The others asked me,
"Why does your face look strange?"

240
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,151
I took a look at my face,
and I saw my capillaries were busted.

241
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,957
<i>Jerry Yan did many intense
and dangerous stunts in this show</i>

242
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,159
<i>that really scared the audience.</i>

243
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,829
<i>His extreme dedication,
with the guidance of the director,</i>

244
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,831
<i>made the scenes successful.</i>

245
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,933
-Let's go.
-Okay.

246
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,669
Okay, here. Come on.

247
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:21,741
Go. Six, five, four, three, two.

248
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,979
You know what? Money is hard to earn.

249
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,951
That was actually a pretty hard scene.
There was some fake blood on my face.

250
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,755
It was made of syrup
and it stayed on my face.

251
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,890
I felt uncomfortable
as it kept covering my face.

252
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:41,794
We were filming until 4:00 a.m.

253
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,663
And we filmed for two days.

254
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,534
We just kept filming,
so I had an allergic reaction on my face.

255
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,338
That was a memorable part of that scene.

256
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,241
At first, we had no idea how hurt I'd be
after being beaten by that stick.

257
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,144
After the rehearsal,
I thought that would really hurt me.

258
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,013
I said, "Are we really going to do this?"
Then they found another way to film it.

259
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,051
They found a softer stick
to replace that very hard one.

260
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:05,952
Yeah.

261
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,822
<i>This bus chase scene where Daoming Si
wants to get Shancai back</i>

262
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,758
<i>put Jerry Yan's strength and stamina
to the test.</i>

263
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,260
Okay, cut.

264
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,328
AGAIN...

265
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,863
-Faster.
-Faster.

266
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,799
-Shancai!
-Faster.

267
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,568
Faster.

268
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,469
Shancai!

269
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,339
Shancai!

270
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,640
-Faster.
-Faster.

271
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,075
Shancai!

272
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,545
Shancai!

273
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,817
<i>Jerry and the director wanted
to make this scene perfect,</i>

274
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:42,488
<i>so they ran in the street
the whole sunny day,</i>

275
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,657
<i>with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.</i>

276
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,926
Okay, ready.

277
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,564
All right. Action.

278
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,234
-Six, five, four...
-Six, five, four...

279
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,837
-Wait.
-Cut.

280
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,239
I'm tired. I'm really tired.

281
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,741
I haven't been this tired for so long.

282
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,643
I'm exhausted.

283
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,078
Why is this so tiring?

284
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,015
I started filming
not long after I finished my meal.

285
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,919
I just kept chasing that bus.
I heard they recorded me vomiting.

286
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,788
Right. That was really tiring.

287
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,790
But I really wanted that scene
to be perfect.

288
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:22,328
When I was filming,
maybe my voice cracked,

289
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,697
or I wasn't running very fast,

290
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,399
or maybe I couldn't catch the bus.

291
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,167
There were many reasons to shoot again.

292
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,369
I kept running back and forth.
I was kidding with my director.

293
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,804
"Director, do you hate me?

294
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,473
You're making me run so many times."

295
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,742
BODY DOUBLE

296
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,545
<i>Usually, in romantic dramas,</i>

297
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,448
<i>all the heroine has to do
is hang out with her boyfriend,</i>

298
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,884
<i>and there aren't many
dangerous action scenes.</i>

299
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,687
<i>But the female lead, Big S,</i>

300
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,823
<i>has more body doubles
than usual action actors.</i>

301
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,692
<i>Where would these body doubles be?</i>

302
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,026
REAR VIEW OF BODY DOUBLE NUMBER TWO

303
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,909
<i>As Big S doesn't know how
to ride a scooter,</i>

304
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:14,780
<i>the scene where she was riding
on campus was filmed with a body double.</i>

305
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,782
AND MORE...

306
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,418
He can still stand up
even after being beaten so badly.

307
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,291
This is for my friend!

308
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,093
Die!

309
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,633
<i>Oh, how touching this scene is.</i>

310
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,036
<i>Look at how heartbroken Big S is.</i>

311
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,171
<i>Is it really that painful, though?</i>

312
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,875
<i>Gosh!</i>

313
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,112
<i>He is a guy?</i>

314
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,849
His hair is amazing.

315
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,251
Director, I don't want that ugly guy.

316
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,155
<i>You have to accept what's there, Jerry!</i>

317
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,290
REHEARSAL!

318
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,061
IT'S SO FUNNY!
I CAN'T HOLD BACK MY LAUGHTER!

319
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,601
BODY DOUBLE NUMBER FOUR
(THE REAR VIEW OF HIM BEING BEATEN)

320
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,871
WOW!

321
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,172
HELP! IT HURTS!

322
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,907
LET'S DO THIS!

323
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,445
Five, four, three, two, action!

324
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,313
Die!

325
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,252
Cut!

326
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,955
I don't think he looks like me
as he's prettier than me.

327
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,959
I think, if he was a girl,
he would be a goddess.

328
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,494
I'm nowhere near him.

329
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,198
I think I need a body double
to do many scenes for me.

330
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,801
I don't think it's my fault, because...

331
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,870
Hey, Shancai is like a hybrid weed,

332
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,572
so she needs to know a lot,

333
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,040
like riding a scooter.

334
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,842
She's supposed to know tons of things.

335
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,443
But I really can't ride a scooter.

336
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,678
I was thinking about learning it,

337
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,480
but the people
from the production company thought

338
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,383
it would take me a long time to learn it,
and they had to start filming right now.

339
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,519
So they found me a body double
to ride a scooter.

340
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,987
And playing the piano...

341
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,023
I can't play it! What else can I do?

342
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,758
They had to find someone
who can play the piano,

343
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,526
and drew a similar tattoo
on her hand as mine.

344
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,595
She played the piano,
pretending she was me.

345
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,965
Another scene was where Daoming Si
rescued me in the warehouse,

346
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,501
and I ran over there
then got hit by a chair.

347
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,735
That scene,

348
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,938
I really didn't want to be hit
by that chair.

349
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,709
Actually, I have trust issues
with the props team.

350
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,213
I don't know if it's
because my attitude was too bad,

351
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,981
I was always thinking
that someone will hurt me.

352
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,117
So I asked Mr. Wang,
the cameraman recording right now,

353
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,552
to be my body double.

354
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,622
But I think he's my best body double,

355
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,557
because his body shape is just like mine,

356
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,360
and he filmed
all the unpleasant scenes for me.

357
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,429
I'm so thankful.

358
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,632
The girl in the opening clip
where everyone was watching meteors?

359
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,833
That girl wasn't me.

360
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,036
The long-haired girl in the opening clip
with the F4, raising her arm?

361
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,104
That was not me.

362
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,439
Do you feel disappointed?

363
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,208
You know, those two girls,
Baihe and Qianhui.

364
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,410
That long-haired girl
was played by Ruozhen.

365
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,645
That was her.

366
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,282
Because she was the only one
who had the same length of hair as mine.

367
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,417
The director said he wanted
to film a scene from far away,

368
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,455
and I didn't have to go there
just for this one scene.

369
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,858
So he asked Ruozhen to be my body double
as she was there already.

370
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,393
So, I was not in the opening clip.

371
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,632
<i>METEOR</i>
NG HIGHLIGHTS

372
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,636
Huaze Lei, you're crazy!

373
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,604
You're lighting fireworks
at this time of the night.

374
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,275
When I was little,
a friend told me that...

375
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,676
GOSH. THE NEXT LINE IS...

376
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,744
When...

377
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,979
"When it's almost sunrise."

378
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,384
Lit it up after...

379
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,619
-Launch it after he takes a few steps.
-Don't do it too early.

380
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,021
Don't launch it early.

381
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,656
-Okay.
-All right, no turning back now.

382
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,691
You all should stay where you are
after I say "cut."

383
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,294
Counting down. Go.

384
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,797
My camera is fixed here.

385
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,667
Action.

386
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,669
You should leave quickly.

387
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,703
Sorry, I failed.

388
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,405
I failed to light it.

389
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,078
-Be careful. Ah Ren, do it.
-We're counting on you, Ah Ren.

390
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,546
You're making me nervous.

391
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,682
-Do it.
-Do it.

392
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,350
You should leave quickly.

393
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:12,518
I can't light it.

394
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,519
Cut!

395
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,089
Ren!

396
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,691
I've lost all my hope.

397
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,162
Help!

398
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,699
Help!

399
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,006
Let's go.

400
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,510
The door is locked.

401
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,678
PLAYING THE FOOL

402
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,882
Hey, don't you like locking the doors?

403
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,784
Why didn't you lock it this time?

404
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,490
I'm bored to death.
My daily life is so "moonotonous."

405
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,493
It's "monotonous," right?

406
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,296
Really, it's "mono"?

407
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,365
So you say...

408
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,268
"smoth,"

409
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,204
"schol,"

410
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,805
and "mute"?

411
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,507
What am I saying?

412
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,078
You should sleep now.

413
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,281
Do you want to sleep on the bed
while I'll sleep on the sofa?

414
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,750
You're going to sleep on the couch?

415
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,785
How can I let the man I like
sleep on the sofa?

416
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,792
Daoming Si, we know
your sexual orientation now.

417
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,630
Director, you can't erase this tape.
I'm buying this tape.

418
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,668
They're not like a couple at all.

419
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,471
It doesn't seem right for us
to watch them.

420
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,140
Let's go. Don't let them see us.

421
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,908
I want you to kiss me.

422
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,477
Cut.

423
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,812
Don't laugh.

424
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:48,714
Zaizai, don't laugh.

425
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:49,948
Don't laugh.

426
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,253
They're not like a couple at all.

427
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,523
It doesn't seem right for us
to watch them.

428
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,525
Let's go. Don't let them see us.

429
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,993
I want you to kiss me.

430
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,629
Why are you laughing?

431
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,730
You laughed again.

432
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,399
I was holding back my laughter so hard,
my head was shaking.

433
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,104
I'm working.

434
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,105
Working?

435
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,274
What a...

436
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,212
I'm working.

437
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,346
Working?

438
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,949
What a hardworking girl.

439
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,320
Sometimes this guy behaves weirdly

440
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,255
in front of the "glue" he loves.

441
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,690
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

442
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,591
CUT

443
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,931
Sometimes this guy behaves weirdly

444
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,666
in front of the "glue" he loves.

445
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,101
What am I talking about?

446
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,539
Sometimes this guy behaves weirdly

447
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,441
in front of the girl he loves.

448
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,443
GREAT JOB

449
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,911
You finally got it right.

450
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,214
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY YOUR LINE?

451
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,018
You're not using your brain, though.

452
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,155
It's impossible for you
to live Shancai's life.

453
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:05,090
If you can fall asleep there,

454
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,025
I think the sun will "west from the rise."

455
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:07,926
Cut.

456
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,895
"The sun will rise from the west."

457
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,864
"The sun will rise from the west."

458
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,699
"The sun will rise from the west."

459
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,501
You put "rise" at the front.

460
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,002
It's "The sun will rise from the west."

461
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,172
F4.

462
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,540
Who is the king of NG?

463
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,908
He just raised his hand.

464
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,978
-They're the same, though.
-The two of us.

465
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,648
Because we're new on acting, so...

466
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,050
So you mean that we're old men?

467
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,187
F4 TALKS ABOUT WHO THE NG KING IS

468
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,156
Actually, I'm...

469
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,225
I failed on purpose

470
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,094
because every time they were like...

471
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,263
"It's fine." And then... Never mind.

472
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:45,831
It's not funny.

473
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,333
And in the scale of the whole show?

474
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,769
-That would be...
-One, two, three. Let's say it together.

475
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,070
-One, two, three,
-One, two, three,

476
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,238
-Oudi.
-Oudi.

477
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,408
When he has a lot of lines,

478
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,809
-but...
-He'll be nervous.

479
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,479
-Yeah, he'll be too nervous to say them.
-He becomes nervous easily.

480
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,813
He's hardworking,

481
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,783
but sometimes, it's just...

482
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,954
I think he has worked hard for this show.

483
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,088
Yeah.

484
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,524
So we can absolutely understand that.

485
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,492
Oudi, you can do it.

486
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,459
You can do it, Oudi.

487
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,696
No one can match
his willfulness after all.

488
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,431
Yeah.

489
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,433
You finally smiled.

490
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,303
-I didn't smile before?
-You don't think so?

491
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,906
You've been putting
on a "gummy" face the whole day.

492
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,308
GUMMY FACE?

493
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,710
I admire your imagination, Zaizai.

494
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,848
No one can match
his willfulness after all.

495
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,750
Yeah.

496
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:40,953
You finally smiled.

497
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,355
-I didn't smile before?
-You don't think so?

498
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,658
You've been putting
on a grumpy face the whole day.

499
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,261
I've been putting on this face
since I enrolled in Yingde.

500
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,862
I've been like this for a long time.

501
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,132
Sorry!

502
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,470
She's got no boobs or butt.

503
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,372
She is rude and unrefined.

504
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,673
She is way below our league.

505
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,408
But you love her,
and there's nothing we can do.

506
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,743
Keep talking and I'll beat you up.

507
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,912
I mean, stir-fried <i>suancai</i>
has no charm as a woman at all.

508
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,214
GOSH. WHAT'S MY NEXT LINE?

509
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,249
I forgot.

510
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,188
Your mom is so resourceful.

511
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,756
If you two get married,

512
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,325
your wedding ceremony would be like
that of the first family.

513
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,493
Nonsense.

514
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,794
How could I marry him?

515
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,696
Why would you marry "him"?

516
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,271
What exactly are you here for?

517
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,572
Nothing.

518
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,573
I'm...

519
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,575
I heard you're sick so I paid you a visit.

520
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,744
They say only idiots get sick
in summer, okay?

521
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,114
Do you want me to punch you again?

522
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,918
WOW! DIDN'T SHE HIT HER TOO HARD?

523
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,088
Did I hit you too early?

524
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,723
You're too late.

525
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,828
They say only idiots get sick
in summer, okay?

526
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,931
Do you want me to punch you again?

527
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,434
-You...
-Cut!

528
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,769
LAUGHTER

529
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,570
I'm so nervous.

530
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,674
Are you coming in or not?

531
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,375
Do you need a body double?

532
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,911
I'm done. Can you find me a substitute?

533
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,018
Qinghe, why did you come here so early?

534
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,154
Shancai, I saw the news this morning.

535
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,222
It said there is a girl
stealing women's underwear.

536
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,025
-A girl is stealing women's underwear?
-A girl is stealing women's underwear?

537
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,065
Qinghe, why did you come here so early?

538
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,866
Shancai, I saw the news this morning.

539
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,868
It said "nearby" stealing
women's underwear.

540
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,443
Since I'm back now,
our boss gave her a few days off.

541
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,145
Besides, she's about to take an exam,
so she didn't come here today.

542
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,816
After you get off from work,
I'll drive you home.

543
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,084
Okay?

544
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,485
LAUGHTER

545
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,824
Five.

546
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,158
Four, three.

547
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,093
FOCUS ON ZAIZAI'S HANDS

548
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,027
Two.

549
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,528
So you bought it, right?

550
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,696
I didn't make it in time.

551
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,098
Sorry.

552
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,171
Why are you here?

553
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,373
To buy a cake.

554
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,108
WOW! IT LOOKS SO DELICIOUS!

555
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,342
Give me this...

556
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,278
LAUGHTER AGAIN

557
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,549
You'll spoil me if you keep doing this.

558
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,619
Maybe there isn't much time left for me
to spoil you.

559
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,656
Maybe this...

560
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,058
WHAT? HE LAUGHED AGAIN

561
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,359
Zaizai...

562
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,366
Maybe this period of time will be
my very important memory,

563
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,071
because this is my first time
not considering Ah Si's feelings,

564
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:50,075
and I can freely express my...

565
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:58,884
Hey, wake up.

566
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,619
Look at this, Lei.

567
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,221
What's this?

568
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,157
Just take a look at it.

569
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,692
It's my birthday gift from Shancai.

570
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,195
Why are you hitting my face?

571
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,266
Just take a look at it.

572
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,903
It's my birthday gift from Shancai.

573
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,038
It's shaped like my face.

574
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,339
How is it? Isn't it cute?

575
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,508
She keeps saying she...

576
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,410
Why did you say that line so early?

577
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,782
I would think it's so ugly
if someone else made it,

578
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,083
but Shancai made it for me.

579
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,018
And it's shaped like me.

580
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,419
Hey, isn't it cute? Come on.

581
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,921
Does it look like me? Isn't it so cute?

582
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,255
Hey!

583
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,857
What are you doing?

584
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:39,791
Spit it out!

585
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,359
This is my cookie!

586
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,029
ARE YOU SEEKING REVENGE ON ME?

587
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,172
I'm one of the four NG Kings
selected by the director.

588
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,641
I'm the only one from F4 in it.

589
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,844
Things got much better later.

590
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,213
It was voted by them,

591
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,281
so I know nothing about it.

592
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,750
I think it's like...

593
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,520
Just like, one scene after another...

594
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,188
If I keep getting NGs
and they keep filming,

595
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,157
they can have the chance
to try out different emotions.

596
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:16,294
But if I get too many NGs,
other actors might also get exhausted.

597
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,929
Yeah. I won't apologize.

598
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,166
If apologizing is enough,
what do we need the police for?

599
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,267
I was joking.

600
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:27,105
I feel so sorry,
but I think they actually won't mind.

601
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,007
THICK-SKINNED

602
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,144
SPECIAL GUEST

603
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,614
MOONCAKE
ZHU YUANZHANG

604
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,550
Shancai, can you tell us
what was inside the mooncake?

605
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,422
-Egg yolk?
-Egg yolk?

606
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,092
Give her a round of applause.

607
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,997
Actually, inside the mooncake was a note.

608
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,965
However, if they didn't put
that note inside back then,

609
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,535
who would have the idea of putting
egg yolk inside the mooncake now?

610
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,703
Isn't it right?
Give her a round of applause.

611
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,771
LOOKS AT THE SCRIPT

612
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,007
Shancai's answer is....

613
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,041
superb.

614
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:07,245
She has such potential.
She's our country's hope in the future.

615
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,047
Awesome.

616
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,088
Who calls his own mom "Mother"?

617
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,290
Are you stupid?

618
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,324
I...

619
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,725
All right. I'll stop.

620
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,098
Do you need another butler?

621
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,071
If the economy becomes bad,
it's going to be hard to find work.

622
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,910
WHY WON'T DIRECTOR CUT IT?

623
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,581
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO KEEP SMILING?

624
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,219
Where's the "cut"?

625
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,326
Could you please stop him, miss?

626
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,027
Never mind. Let him be.

627
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,229
I wonder how this kind of person
could be born in our family.

628
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,298
Prepare my bath with some essential oil.

629
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,766
I'm going to do a hot "sba"...

630
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:12,677
Ma'am, this is what I found
in the shortest time possible.

631
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,214
Miss Shancai isn't the daughter
of a chairman.

632
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,849
Her father...

633
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,018
To be honest, I'm going to do it again.

634
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,725
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

635
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:30,195
Aunt Yu, you're the best.

636
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,229
Fine.

637
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,031
Let me speak with Shancai.
I want to talk to her.

638
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,132
Cut it out.

639
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,201
Young Master,
stop messing around, will you?

640
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,837
If you don't want madam to misunderstand

641
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,238
that Shancai is...

642
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,373
Gosh.

643
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,179
Sit down and have some.

644
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,851
You're done with everything you need.

645
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,085
You may leave now.

646
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,187
I'm so hungry right now.

647
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,189
I'll leave when I'm finished, okay?

648
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,830
For real.

649
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,468
Take a seat.

650
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,608
HOW YOU CAN EAT THIS?

651
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,609
Cut.

652
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,213
Action.

653
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,650
Hey! Why are you leaving now?

654
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,619
Give me a chance!

655
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,187
Why are you leaving me?

656
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,090
Let go of me. I can't talk like this.
Let me go!

657
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,626
I still have one important line left.

658
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,028
Let's start over...

659
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,697
I'm sorry.

660
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,532
Let's start over, okay?

661
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,434
How many lines do you have?

662
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,705
SPECIAL GUESTS

663
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,042
I found that they are so pure
after I cooperated with them.

664
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,477
The whole team,

665
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,248
including the director, the lighting,
the cameraman, and the actors...

666
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,217
They are like a pure stream of water.

667
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,486
You can feel how pure they are.

668
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,722
They are nowhere near ill-mannered.

669
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,024
Everyone was like family.

670
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:09,227
The director cared about the actors.

671
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,897
He would let us have a rest
when we were tired, something like that.

672
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,933
I didn't feel stressed out
during the filming.

673
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,267
We were just like a family.

674
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,403
You could act without any burden.
You could...

675
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,941
So I felt so happy. Really happy.

676
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,110
I think our efforts paid off.

677
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,177
So...

678
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,713
we're getting better and better.

679
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,781
During the filming,

680
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:33,318
I enjoyed acting as a dad.

681
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,788
Especially as Big S's dad.

682
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,656
She's better than us in everything.

683
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,193
Who would know a couple like us
could have such a beautiful daughter?

684
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,730
We have a daughter who is a celebrity
and so pretty, right?

685
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:50,502
I think this was a challenge for us.

686
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:55,607
We managed to make the atmosphere joyful.

687
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,776
No wonder Big S said

688
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,744
the atmosphere was great

689
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,746
as long as Shancai's dad was here.

690
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:06,251
I think this was a unique experience.

691
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:13,124
I think<i> Meteor Garden</i> lives up
to the hype.

692
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:17,362
There were so many first times in it
for every one of us.

693
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,963
As for me,

694
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,367
I'm so happy to cooperate
with these people to film this show.

695
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:27,038
Because this show is loved
by many young people,

696
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,175
I feel like the distance between me
and my children was shortened.

697
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,343
My current most important business
is getting F4's autographs

698
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,815
for those fellow students of my kids.

699
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,783
I'm so happy
that I could stick around them

700
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,085
and tell them to sign the autographs.

701
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,155
Whenever they saw me, they would say,
"Ms. Wang, do you need autographs?"

702
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,192
"Yes, I need autographs.
I need a lot of them."

703
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,595
I was a bit worried when I got this role,

704
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,898
because Teng Tangjing has such a different
personality from me.

705
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,001
If you know me, you would know
I'm more like your girl next door,

706
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,070
but Jing is like your big sister.

707
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,039
She's such a decent girl.

708
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,241
So I think that was the challenge for me.

709
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:07,045
Thank you, Chai, for the opportunity.

710
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,615
Thank you, Director Tsai Yueh-Hsun,
for the guidance.

711
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,984
I want to thank everyone and the staff.

712
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,486
We were all exhausted,
but I think the staff had it the worst.

713
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,957
Staff like the props team, lighting team,

714
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,560
and the producer had to arrive before us.

715
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,530
They would be preparing for a few hours
and waited for us.

716
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,465
I think they had it the worst.

717
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,566
So...

718
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,036
During the filming,

719
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,841
I felt like everyone is family,
and we were calling each other brother.

720
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,042
Thank you for your effort.

721
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:42,247
We're a bunch of newbies
who caused you a lot of troubles.

722
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,616
I promise it won't happen next time

723
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,918
if I can work with you again.

724
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,753
Even if it happens again,
it won't be caused by me.

725
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,954
Right.

726
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:55,159
I feel so happy to work with everyone
for these months.

727
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,596
Maybe I will never meet another director
with such a good temper,

728
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,466
nor will I meet such professional staff.

729
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,234
One thing that impressed me was,

730
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:04,936
I heard people
would form up separate groups

731
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,373
during the last few months of filming,

732
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,575
but that didn't happen in our team.

733
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:14,913
That's why I was so happy and moved
that I cried during the celebration party.

734
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,048
Everyone was so true to each other.

735
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,351
I'm so touched and thankful. Thank you.

736
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:25,156
SHANCAI AND F4

737
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:30,028
I'm a little upset that
<i>Meteor Garden</i> has come to an end.

738
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,697
But I'm also excited about

739
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,833
future cooperation and development.

740
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,368
That's it.

741
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,403
<i>METEOR</i> EXPERIENCE SHARING

742
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,841
Filming <i>Meteor Garden</i> has been
quite a special experience for me.

743
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,045
I've learned a lot,

744
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,780
especially the acting skill,

745
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,382
and the way to treat others.

746
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,786
I want to thank our director and Chai
for giving me this role.

747
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,187
I'll keep doing my best.

748
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,158
After six months,
<i>Meteor Garden</i> has finished filming.

749
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,161
A lot of things happened.

750
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:07,332
I'll remember this period of time.

751
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:11,936
I wish the other three the best.

752
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,572
I want to thank the audiences
for your support.

753
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,707
Thank you.

754
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,709
The show has finished filming.

755
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,310
This is my first show,

756
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:25,149
so whether I will keep acting or not,

757
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,252
I'll definitely remember <i>Meteor Garden</i>.

758
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,721
That's all. Bye-bye.

759
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,527
My life has changed a lot after this show.

760
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,629
It's not about my career,

761
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,800
but about the way I treat others.

762
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,736
I hated to make friends before,

763
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,839
and I thought I was a loner
and an unfriendly person.

764
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,174
But after I cooperated with the team,

765
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,477
I wanted everyone to get along,

766
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,746
and maintain a good relationship
with everyone.

767
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,281
We haven't had one argument
in the five months.

768
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,950
We've had a good time working together.

769
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,885
I think it can...

770
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,820
increase my EQ.

771
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,189
So, it's a challenge for me.

772
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,791
I feel thankful to Chai.

773
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,227
And I want to thank our director, too.
He has a really good temper.

774
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,195
He didn't put pressure on us.

775
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,965
We were allowed to do things over
and over again until we got them right.

776
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,067
It was like all the burden was on him.

777
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,102
We kept trying until we got it right,

778
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,938
so I think the director
is really a nice guy,

779
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,373
and he's also very talented.

780
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,941
I admire his endurance very much.

781
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,243
Why do we need to work so hard?

782
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,978
I had no idea
why everyone was working so hard.

783
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,446
Sometimes I would get exhausted,

784
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,916
but when I saw everyone working so hard,
I didn't want to be the one slacking off.

785
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,818
So I would keep working
like what they were doing.

786
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:38,189
So I think everyone has been
through a lot.

787
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,924
It wasn't easy for everyone.

788
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:43,361
Well, I want to thank everyone
for giving me the experience,

789
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:46,097
and I want to thank all the actors
for working with me.

790
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,500
You're newbies, and I'm one, too.
This is our first time acting.

791
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:54,005
Well, I feel lucky to survive so far.

792
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,241
Everyone has been very supportive.
I think we're so lucky.

793
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,244
Well, I'm not sure if I'll continue
acting in the future,

794
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,414
but it's a happy first-time experience
to work with everyone.

795
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:06,350
If I act again in the future,

796
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,353
I hope the experience
can be as nice as this one.

797
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,023
I think he filmed this show
to torture himself.

798
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,393
-Yeah, I think so.
-He got four stupid actors.

799
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,429
-Four stupid actors, a pain in the neck.
-Sorry, Director Tsai.

800
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,199
Director Tsai, We, F4, would like to say

801
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,301
-sorry.
-Sorry.

802
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,705
Thank you for watching.

803
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,674
F4 won't disband.

804
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,676
There's a bright future ahead of us.

805
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,311
Yeah, we will work together in the future.

806
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,713
-Like albums and photo books.
-Yes.

807
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,684
We'll be touring around
in the northern, the middle,

808
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,018
and the southern part of Taiwan.

809
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,287
We'll be meeting our fans.

810
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:49,193
Again, thank you for all your support.

811
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,063
Remember, don't buy pirated DVDs.

812
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,333
Thank you all for your support.

813
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,635
-Thank you!
-Bye!

814
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,305
BONUS SHOTS

815
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,843
Daoming Si!

816
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,146
What's up?

817
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,047
He's now with Ximen and...

818
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,287
All right.

819
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,332
What?

820
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,234
You can come closer.

821
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,070
Six minutes saved your life.

822
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,855
I look so stupid.

823
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:05,790
