1
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,200
A western philosopher once said,

2
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,269
"Women,

3
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,672
your gorgeous diamonds and shiny pearls

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,176
give you delusions of being a queen.

5
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,612
But you didn't notice

6
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,914
that there is only
the poison of pretension

7
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,649
and the aroma of arrogance.

8
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,051
The aroma which attracts
and also kills people.

9
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,520
Women,

10
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,923
when you pay homage to fortune,

11
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,925
cheer to fame,

12
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,893
and raise your arms to power,

13
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,931
please don't ask that bird
who used to sing in the past.

14
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,667
It has flown to a place no one knows

15
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,971
because its voice has dried out,

16
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:23,276
along with the doom of truth,
dignity, and pure souls."

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,229
Does the value of a person lie

18
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,698
in whether they can play the piano,

19
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,967
in which family they were born,

20
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,969
or what jewelry they are wearing?

21
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,105
What's so special about
knowing how to play the piano?

22
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,840
Let me tell you.

23
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,842
This is the only song I can play.

24
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,411
So what?

25
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,088
Happy birthday. I'll go now.

26
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,190
Wait.

27
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,526
Ah Si.

28
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,828
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

29
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,231
You don't know how to behave
according to your status.

30
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,702
You even lied and told me
that she's the daughter of a chairman.

31
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,370
You're way out of line.

32
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,406
It's not important to me whether or not
she's the daughter of a chairman.

33
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,307
Shut up!

34
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,310
Don't you dare talk to me like that.

35
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,946
You're our only son.

36
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,483
You're so enamored
with such a low-class girl.

37
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,185
What should I tell your dad?

38
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,653
It was love at first sight for me.

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,021
I don't want other girls.

40
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,689
She's the one I like.

41
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,860
This joke has gone too far.

42
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,562
Mrs. Daoming, please don't do this.

43
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,563
We're not...

44
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,298
This is a family matter.

45
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,233
You don't have the right to interfere.

46
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,568
Leave!

47
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,036
Get out immediately.

48
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,207
You want to rebel?

49
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,408
Stop them!

50
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,279
Mrs. Daoming.

51
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,280
Get out of my way.

52
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,315
Shancai.

53
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,616
Your bag.

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,718
Stop right there.

55
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,220
I won't allow you to do this.

56
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,888
That's an order!

57
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,639
Thank you.

58
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,447
You were good at playing the piano.

59
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,115
How can you say that?

60
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,717
Your mom wanted me
to play the piano earlier

61
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,085
so that I'll embarrass myself.

62
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,887
Why didn't you say anything?

63
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,421
You also didn't help me out.

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,524
So I had to mess with the piano.

65
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,895
When I heard you messing with it,

66
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,531
I was actually quite happy.

67
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,835
Though I know my mom wants
to embarrass you,

68
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,405
I know you have a way
to embarrass my mom more.

69
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,209
Why do you keep looking at me?

70
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,779
Stop it.

71
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,817
You know what?

72
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,152
I love you.

73
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,357
I don't care if you can play the piano
or not.

74
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,727
I don't care if you're the daughter
of a chairman.

75
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,963
Because I love you.

76
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,066
I'm going home now.

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,901
You can drive me home.

78
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,303
No I won't.

79
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,405
You won't?

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,176
I just want to share my naked thoughts
with you.

81
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,011
Naked?

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,447
What are you up to?

83
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,517
Don't get me wrong, okay?

84
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,687
I mean we can tell each other
what's exactly on our mind.

85
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,766
What an exciting day.

86
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,969
I wonder what Ah Si
and Shancai are doing right now?

87
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,872
Did you see Shancai playing the piano?

88
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,808
Ah Si's mom got so mad.

89
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,212
When Ah Si was pulling Shancai
to the door,

90
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,314
Lei even tried to block her way.

91
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,850
She was so mad that her veins
were popping out of her face.

92
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,185
It's so funny.

93
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,121
I'd better not visit Ah Si's house
for a while.

94
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,923
We'd better not visit his house

95
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,892
or else his mom will order someone
to chase us out.

96
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,062
I've only met Ah Si's mom three times
so far.

97
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,531
She's still the same.

98
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,767
Do you remember when we were
at Ah Si's home in middle school,

99
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,169
what did she tell us
when we first met her?

100
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,939
Who can forget the Empress Dowager?

101
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,710
"Ah Si.

102
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,680
If you keep sticking around
with your friends,

103
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,383
I'll beat your head into a pulp."

104
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,518
His mom is so scary.

105
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,453
She doesn't care
about other people's feelings at all.

106
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,354
Snob.

107
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,057
But she got embarrassed big time today.

108
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,092
Even we,

109
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,429
who are heirs to families
in the top ten nationwide list,

110
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,232
were scolded like that. Let alone Shancai.

111
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,068
Maybe she will hire a hitman
to kill Shancai.

112
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:20,106
I didn't know Ah Si would confront
the Empress Dowager for Shancai.

113
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:26,513
But I'm sure she won't let them
get away with it.

114
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,548
What will she do?

115
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,984
Will she really get rid of Shancai
for good?

116
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,219
She will definitely think of some way
to separate them.

117
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,525
If Ah Si rebels against his mother,

118
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,561
I'm afraid neither of them will come out
in one piece.

119
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
Have you heard of Maple Hotel Corporation?

120
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,969
Of course.

121
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,905
I'm poor but I've heard of it.

122
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,675
They own luxury hotels all over the world.

123
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,913
The Chinese word of "maple" is "feng".

124
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,314
You're right.

125
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,250
It's named after my mother.

126
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,187
My mother changed her last name
to her husband's.

127
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,056
So her name is Daoming Feng.

128
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,125
Daoming Feng?

129
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,295
So your mom owns
the Maple Hotel Corporation?

130
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,463
Yeah.

131
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,666
My parents are so busy,

132
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,469
so we've almost never lived together.

133
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,305
They're my family

134
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,574
but I feel so distant from them.

135
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,910
I get it now.

136
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,113
Such a strange family.

137
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,315
No wonder you're so arrogant.

138
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,451
Hey, don't lecture me.

139
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,721
You're acting like you know everything.

140
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,524
I'm telling you this

141
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,763
to let you know that you shouldn't take
my mother's words seriously.

142
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,001
Because I'll decide what
to do with my life.

143
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,942
SHANCAI INVESTIGATION REPORT

144
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:08,882
Ma'am, this is what I found
in the shortest time possible.

145
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,719
Miss Shancai isn't the daughter
of a chairman.

146
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,723
To be precise, she's just a common person.

147
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,192
Her father changed jobs a lot.

148
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,628
Her mother is doing part-time jobs here
and there.

149
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,831
They're living in an old apartment
that's less than ten square meters.

150
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,968
But Young Master is deeply in love
with her.

151
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,437
Enough.

152
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,238
All in all,

153
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,407
get rid of this pest as soon as possible,

154
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,610
or she'll do serious damage
to the Daoming Family.

155
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,716
Before this happened,

156
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,187
I thought Ah Si was still young,

157
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,090
and that it was too early
to commence my plan.

158
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,726
In this case,

159
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,495
I can't wait anymore.

160
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,931
That plan...

161
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,934
Didn't you say
after Young Master graduates--

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,303
Don't make me repeat my words again
and again.

163
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,237
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,006
How about the airline ticket
to New York tomorrow?

165
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,608
Reschedule it for me.

166
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,009
Yes.

167
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,748
You want to fight with me?

168
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,951
How naive.

169
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,088
Did you catch a cold?

170
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,990
Put your coat on.

171
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,091
I'm fine.

172
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,994
No, you're not. You'll blame me
if you catch a cold.

173
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:28,962
Hurry up.

174
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,267
What are you up to?
What are you looking at?

175
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,437
Look at yourself. What else will I do?

176
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,772
Don't get any weird ideas.

177
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,375
If you dare to touch me,
I'll throw you in the river.

178
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,144
You're so weird.

179
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,546
If a man and a woman falls in love,

180
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,548
they will do whatever they want.

181
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,650
Besides, you're with me.

182
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:55,155
You won't be unsatisfied
with a man of sense like me.

183
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,258
Daoming Si.

184
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,693
I've always wanted to ask you this.

185
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,197
Why do you think I love you?

186
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,633
My intuition.

187
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,001
Intuition?

188
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,470
Is your intuition accurate?

189
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,640
Am I wrong?

190
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,477
Let's take this chance
to clear things out.

191
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,145
What are your thoughts right now?

192
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,681
What are my thoughts right now?

193
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,950
I don't know.

194
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,586
You say this every time.

195
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,522
I really don't know.

196
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,257
I just don't want to fool you.

197
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,197
Actually, there's really a question
that I've always wanted to ask you.

198
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,432
Ask away.

199
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,702
Why me?

200
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,572
I'm poor and lowly.

201
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,373
I almost have nothing.

202
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,844
There are so many rich, powerful,
and pretty girls in our school.

203
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,846
Why did you choose me?

204
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,683
How could you love someone like me?

205
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,419
Maybe you've lost your mind.

206
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,022
Maybe.

207
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,424
What?

208
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,460
I'm also wondering why I'm interested
in a woman like you.

209
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,530
I can't figure it out.

210
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,534
I got fortune, status, reputation,
and handsomeness.

211
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,603
So you can stay as who you are now.

212
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,641
You're not handsome. Idiot.

213
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,643
If there is someone who's so perfect
like you described,

214
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,345
I really want to meet him.

215
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,579
You're...

216
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,419
Why are you laughing?

217
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,655
I'm starving.

218
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,557
I'm different from you.

219
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,860
I have less fat,
so I can't endure hunger that long.

220
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,265
I forgot I had cookies in my bag.

221
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,034
What?

222
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,302
Nothing. It's nothing.

223
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,204
-What did you hide?
-Nothing.

224
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,472
-Let me see it.
-No.

225
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,307
-Just show it to me.
-Hey.

226
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,875
What's this?

227
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,278
The birthday present I wanted to give you.

228
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,879
Birthday present.

229
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,048
Didn't you say you forgot to bring it?

230
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,684
They were all giving you expensive gifts.

231
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,486
Someone even gave you a car.

232
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,920
How could I take this out?

233
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,125
Don't be so rough. They're fragile.

234
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,197
I baked them in the store I work at.

235
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,465
They're a little burnt.

236
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,672
Don't keep looking at them.

237
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,573
I feel so embarrassed.

238
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,475
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,679
I don't have any money
so this is all I can give you.

240
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,552
I thought it would be easy
to bake a cookie shaped like your face.

241
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,220
It turned out to be really difficult.

242
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,689
I practiced for a few days.

243
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,857
These are the best ones.

244
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,795
If you don't want it just give them back.

245
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,699
I'm so happy right now.

246
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,500
It's the first time
someone baked cookies for me.

247
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,404
<i>It's the first time that I saw
that childish look on his face.</i>

248
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,107
<i>Unknowingly, I forgot to be angry.</i>

249
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,377
<i>I didn't know that my ugly cookies</i>

250
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,580
<i>would touch Daoming Si so much.</i>

251
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,917
I'm so hungry, let's eat.

252
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,086
No, these are the cookies you gave me.

253
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,855
Just wait a little longer.

254
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,390
Don't eat the cookies you gave me, okay?

255
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,507
Hey, Lei. Wake up.

256
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,376
What year will you get up?

257
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,146
Why isn't there a couch in your room?

258
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,581
Where should I sit?

259
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,484
The couch is in the living room.
Go sit there if you want.

260
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,953
Whatever. Get up now.
I have something to tell you.

261
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,655
What are you doing? Why don't you go home?

262
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,758
How could I go home?

263
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,660
I had a big fight with my mom yesterday.
How could I go home?

264
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,330
I can go home once she goes back
to the US.

265
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,969
It's only 6:30 a.m. What are you doing?

266
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,905
I'll show you something.

267
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,907
Look.

268
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,776
What's this?

269
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,111
It's my birthday gift from Shancai.

270
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,380
It's shaped like my face.

271
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,717
She keeps saying she hates me.

272
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,852
It turns out she's good to me.

273
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,256
See, a cookie shaped just like me.

274
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,792
I would think it's so ugly
if someone else made it

275
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,126
but Shancai made it for me.

276
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,429
Does it look like me? Isn't it so cute?

277
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,166
What are you doing?
I didn't say that you can eat it.

278
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,801
That's my gift!

279
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,637
Spit it out! What are you doing?

280
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,272
Spit it out, Lei!

281
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,307
I didn't say you can eat it!

282
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:45,945
<i>Beautiful flowers don't bloom every day</i>

283
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,049
<i>And beautiful sceneries
Will eventually go away</i>

284
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,918
Who is it?

285
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,253
We don't have guests here.

286
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,559
We can't afford newspapers either.

287
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,894
Don't even think about selling stuff
to us.

288
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,197
Who is it?

289
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,735
A handsome man and a pretty lady.
Who are you looking for?

290
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,537
Maybe you're at the wrong place.

291
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,706
I don't think we've met each other before.

292
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,642
Is this the place?

293
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,077
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,812
This is where that miss lives.

295
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,981
What miss?

296
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,052
Are you Miss Shancai's mother?

297
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,487
How did you know that?

298
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,057
This is Mrs. Daoming.

299
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,427
You're Daoming Si's mother?

300
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,895
Why did you come to our house?

301
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,164
Come in.

302
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,765
Take your seats.

303
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,569
Those shoes...

304
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,339
The flowers.

305
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,774
Shancai, hurry up.

306
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,277
Daoming Si's mother is here.

307
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,546
Shancai, hurry and get up.

308
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,249
Daoming Si's mother is here.

309
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,326
Please have some water.

310
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,831
Nice to meet you.

311
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,766
I'm Daoming Si's mother.

312
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,270
I'm sorry to disturb you this morning.

313
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,607
That's okay. Young Master Daoming Si
takes good care of our Shancai.

314
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,576
Yutian, take it out.

315
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,477
Yes.

316
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,247
Excuse me for cutting to the chase.

317
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,017
I don't want to take more
of your precious time.

318
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,519
No. Our time isn't precious at all.

319
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,321
We got a lot of time here.

320
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,789
I'll just cut the formalities.

321
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,426
Let me tell you why I visited here today.

322
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,262
Miss Shancai,

323
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,098
please stop pursuing Ah Si.

324
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,902
Of course, I won't tell you
to give up with nothing.

325
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,376
This is NTD 10,000,000.

326
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,211
NTD 10,000,000.

327
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,981
I know it's rude.

328
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:08,220
But it seems
that your family is on a budget.

329
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,257
So I think we should go straight
to the point.

330
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:17,196
Everyone knows
that Ah Si is the heir of our family.

331
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,365
So as his mother,

332
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,034
I have to correct his improper behaviors.

333
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,138
As he's growing up,

334
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,975
there will be some stumbling blocks

335
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,910
and some weeds in his way.

336
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,647
I have to be there in time
to get rid of those things for him.

337
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,619
<i>Are you saying I'm the stumbling block
and weed that's in his way?</i>

338
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,555
<i>I couldn't imagine you would drive me away
with NTD 10,000,000.</i>

339
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,956
<i>Old hag.</i>

340
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,891
<i>What a snob.</i>

341
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,561
What's the matter?

342
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,832
Do you really think
that Ah Si is in love with you?

343
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,801
He just wants a casual relationship
with you.

344
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,104
Your relationship will go nowhere
no matter what you do.

345
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,641
At most, your daughter will sleep
with him at an early age.

346
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,676
I think,

347
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,445
your daughter is fine with that.

348
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,684
Hold on.

349
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,689
Mom, what are you doing?

350
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,591
Hey.

351
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,993
-What are you doing?
-Mom.

352
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,462
Take your money away and get out of here!

353
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,430
Mom.

354
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,432
Chairman.

355
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:32,138
When my kid is being humiliated,
do you understand how I feel?

356
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,408
Do you think I can't be her mother
just because I'm poor?

357
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,778
I totally understand what you mean.

358
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,313
Will you really not accept the money?

359
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,448
No.

360
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,052
I see.

361
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,554
-Let's go.
-Yes.

362
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,594
Goodbye.

363
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,735
I can't believe it.

364
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,271
You rejected NTD 10,000,000.

365
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,872
That's a lot of money.

366
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,543
Mom, I feel so touched and proud.

367
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,647
I now feel a lot of courage in my heart.

368
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,516
We are poor but we have the backbone.

369
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,552
That stupid old hag.

370
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,088
She's rich so she thinks
that she can crush us with money.

371
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,255
No way!

372
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,191
Daughter, what are you talking about?

373
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:31,197
I was thinking that that woman will die
before her son.

374
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:36,335
I couldn't care less
about that NTD 10,000,000.

375
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,537
I'm looking at the bigger picture.

376
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,074
I want the Daoming Family's
entire fortune.

377
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,576
I have my plan.

378
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,745
Mom, how could you think like that?

379
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,179
That's great.

380
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:52,118
So, Shancai. No matter what,
you have to be determined

381
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,320
to marry Young Master Daoming Si.

382
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,622
So that old hag will be so mad,
she'll die in no time.

383
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,925
That way, you can inherit
all their legacy properly.

384
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,094
Your dad and I are in good health.

385
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,496
We will live up to 100 years.

386
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,564
Then we can enjoy...

387
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,999
What are you talking about?

388
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,934
You looked so honorable just now.

389
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,337
Why didn't you just accept
the NTD 10,000,000?

390
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,372
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

391
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,673
I'm going crazy!

392
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,741
<i>I tell you what,</i>

393
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,676
she even made cookies shaped
like when I'm angry.

394
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,512
It looks so similar to me!

395
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,380
This is my own precious treasure.

396
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,450
It's really one of a kind.

397
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,821
For such amazing cookies,
shouldn't you apply for a patent?

398
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:29,855
Hey.

399
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,524
Ximen.

400
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,659
You're so smart.

401
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,197
-He's so carried away by it.
-He's been like that the whole day.

402
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,633
He's been like that since he came
at my house this morning.

403
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,836
I think he went to your place
that early just to annoy you.

404
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,472
Ah Si has always treated you
as his rival in love.

405
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,808
Meizou.

406
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,276
You talk too much.

407
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,211
Did I ask for your opinion?

408
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,981
I think he's forgetting
that his mom is going to intervene

409
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,050
to separate them two poor lovebirds.

410
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,152
Let me ask you something.

411
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,821
You're so happy right now,

412
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,756
so you must have had a great night
with Shancai.

413
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,824
What?

414
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,793
Have you already done that?

415
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,229
Done what?

416
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,298
We were so hungry last night.

417
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,734
Don't change the subject, okay?

418
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,436
What?

419
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,238
We're asking you if you got laid?

420
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,708
You're talking too much.

421
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,476
I think he didn't get laid.

422
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,478
You suck.

423
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,381
You fearlessly confessed
to her at your birthday party.

424
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,884
And you two were out the whole night.

425
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,220
She even gave you cookies made by herself.

426
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,822
You didn't get laid under this situation.

427
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,557
Are you really a man?

428
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,559
How could you still be a virgin
at this age?

429
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,261
You can't grab any good opportunity.

430
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,365
You're so useless.
You're bringing so much shame to F4.

431
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,335
I hate forcing her into it.

432
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,937
I'm not like you.

433
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,572
Don't talk crap about us.

434
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,109
We treat all of our girlfriends nicely.

435
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,811
Just think about it.

436
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,381
Maybe you'll be fifty years old
when Shancai finally decides to do it.

437
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,050
Didn't you see the look on your mom's face
when she saw Shancai?

438
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,453
She looked like she saw some poison.

439
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,090
I'll take control of my life.

440
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,959
My mom, or anyone,

441
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,028
can't intervene.

442
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,597
That's why I'm saying you
and Shancai can't keep living like this.

443
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,466
You should take some actions.

444
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,469
You're so naive.
How would you fight with your mom?

445
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,007
Lei.

446
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,276
What do you think?

447
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,912
I only hope you can protect Shancai.

448
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,389
<i>NTD 10,000,000.</i>

449
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,959
Daoming Si's mom visited your house
with NTD 10,000,000

450
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,128
-to make you give up Daoming Si?
-Yeah.

451
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,430
I can't believe it.

452
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,265
Rich people got their own ways
to deal with things.

453
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,034
-She's foolish in spending money.
-Yeah.

454
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,569
Did you take it?

455
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,605
How could I? Am I that kind of person?

456
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,974
What?

457
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,777
You didn't take that NTD 10,000,000.

458
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,979
Does that mean you'll continue
dating Daoming Si?

459
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,181
His mom must be so mad.

460
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,749
That's right.

461
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,320
But just because we didn't take the money
doesn't mean that I'll date Daoming Si.

462
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,489
If that woman becomes my mother-in-law,

463
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,558
what kind of pathetic life will I live?

464
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,160
Mother-in-law?

465
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,129
I didn't say you would marry Daoming Si.

466
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,165
Oh, right.

467
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,599
I didn't mean it.

468
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,336
I mean, I'm so different from him.

469
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,304
And I can't fit in with them.

470
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,407
What am I talking about?

471
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,042
My head is a mess right now.

472
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,247
Welcome.

473
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,354
Miss Shancai. The chairman sent me here.

474
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,623
Please read this letter.

475
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,674
Could you please come with me?

476
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,848
Young Master, excuse me.
Please come with us.

477
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,249
What are you doing?

478
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,053
Aren't you that old hag's bodyguard?

479
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,455
This is an order from the chairman.
Please come with us.

480
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,892
Do I look like a scumbag
who would do what you told me to do?

481
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,327
Young Master, I'm sorry.

482
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,329
Hey! What are you doing?

483
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,580
Come in, please.

484
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,654
Shancai.

485
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,991
She hasn't showed up yet?

486
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,994
I just got a call. She's at the door now.

487
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,029
What scheme are you planning?

488
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,531
Why did you even bring Shancai here?

489
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,500
What's this about? What are you doing?
Why do I have to wear this?

490
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,769
Get your hands off me or I'll hit you
with high heels.

491
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,145
Who are you?

492
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,017
She's Miss Heyuan Zi.

493
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:26,852
Ah Si.

494
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,954
She's your fiancé.

495
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,029
Sorry, I'm late.

496
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,998
I haven't seen you for a long time,
President He and Mrs. He.

497
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,735
I haven't visited you for so long.

498
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,272
This is Young Master Ah Si.

499
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,708
He's so handsome.

500
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,277
Hello. We are Xiaozi's parents.

501
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,048
Mom, Dad, what are you talking about?
Didn't I say I don't want to get married?

502
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,916
Xiaozi, be quiet.

503
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,020
That kid's like this all the time.
We spoiled her.

504
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,156
Please take care of her in the future.

505
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,691
Stop daydreaming.

506
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:07,926
Are you kidding me?

507
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,661
How could you make this decision for me?

508
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,430
I don't want you to make decisions for me.

509
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,967
You two are very similar.

510
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,639
The date of your wedding ceremony
will be decided after your graduation.

511
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,374
So for the next two years,

512
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,176
you two will be building
your relationship.

513
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:29,014
Two years might be too long
for them youngsters.

514
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,885
If they want to marry earlier,
we won't oppose them.

515
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,387
We'll see how they think about this.

516
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,890
What are you talking about?

517
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,558
I won't agree to marry him.

518
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,663
This is...

519
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,267
I am...

520
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,503
Miss Shancai.

521
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,273
I'm glad you can spare your time
to come here.

522
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,377
With this situation,
have you already understood it all?

523
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,512
I understood.

524
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,883
Good. You're a smart girl.

525
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,654
I believe a boy who suits you will show up
in the future.

526
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,059
President He, Mrs. He,
please take your seats.

527
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,395
How are you doing recently?

528
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:17,930
Thanks to you...

529
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,299
Please, take your seats.

530
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,304
<i>I should go.</i>

531
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,506
<i>Xiaoyou is waiting for me
at the cake store.</i>

532
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,109
<i>Right, today is salary day.</i>

533
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,312
<i>I should take my money and give it to mom.</i>

534
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:38,283
<i>But my feet feels like they're glued
to the floor.</i>

535
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,185
-<i>Why can't I move a muscle?</i>
-Please take your seats.

536
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,888
-Tonight, I especially...
-Young Master, please take your seat.

537
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:43,989
Leave me alone.

538
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,857
Go get him!

539
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:47,960
Leave me alone.

540
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,062
Let's go!

541
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,468
They can't catch me
if I've run this far, right?

542
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,739
But we have to find a place to hide.

543
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,175
We'll wait until that old hag comes back
to the US.

544
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,010
But I'm telling you,
I didn't know her plan.

545
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:05,911
But after all...

546
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,715
Why are you here? What are you doing here?

547
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,683
You're asking me?
I should be the one asking questions.

548
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,285
You big idiot, why did you pull me here?

549
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,673
Daoming Si, you big douchebag!

550
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,110
You big douchebag!
Why are you running so fast?

551
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,452
Wait for me.

552
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,856
What are you doing?

553
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,791
Lend me some money.

554
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,762
If I had some money I would have taken
a taxi. Are you an idiot?

555
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,564
Wait!

556
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,833
Use your brain. I'm going bare feet.

557
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,268
My feet hurt after all the running.

558
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,404
This is your fault for pulling me here.

559
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,571
And you are ignoring me.

560
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,407
Don't you think you're being mean?

561
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,675
No.

562
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,846
Carry me home!

563
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,181
What are you doing? Get off me.

564
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,482
No! And you will carry me home!

565
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,184
Are you a monkey? Get off me.

566
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,986
What are you doing?

567
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,559
I didn't know your ears are
that sensitive.

568
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,094
I just bit your ear and you're blushing.

569
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,262
That's nonsense!

570
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,697
If you keep saying that, I'll kill you.

571
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,845
What do you think that guy is doing?

572
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,648
Big idiot. They just ran away
holding each other's hand.

573
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,851
They've met before
and they pretended to be surprised.

574
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,320
They left me there like an idiot.

575
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,622
What?

576
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,725
Did that really happen just now?

577
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,893
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

578
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,595
They were like filming a movie.

579
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,364
A romantic movie.

580
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,631
They ran away just like that.

581
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,635
Shancai, did this hit you too hard?

582
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:11,937
What?

583
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,074
Daoming Si has a fiancé.

584
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,444
How is that possible?
Why should I consider this a trauma?

585
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,047
I went there because I wanted
to put an end to this.

586
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,516
Now we have a perfect ending.

587
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,552
But you look so mad.

588
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,056
I am? No. Why should I be mad?

589
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,424
I'm so happy right now.

590
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,494
But Xiaoyou I'm sorry
for what I did to you earlier.

591
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,096
I shouldn't have ran away
and left you alone like that.

592
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,932
But it won't happen again.
Everything's settled now.

593
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,267
I'm finally free.

594
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,407
It must be Daoming Si. Just take it.

595
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,808
PRIVATE NUMBER CALLING

596
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,511
Why don't you take it?

597
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,815
Shancai, what's wrong?

598
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,450
Why don't you take it?

599
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,920
Why should I take it?
I have nothing to say to him.

600
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,756
Actually, I should congratulate him.

601
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,392
I'll congratulate him in person tomorrow
at school.

602
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,795
He has a rich and beautiful fiancé now.

603
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,278
Shancai.

604
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,551
Young Master Daoming Si,
congratulations on your engagement.

605
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,087
-Engagement?
-With whom?

606
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,423
You all fooled me yesterday!

607
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,792
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened yesterday.

608
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,327
Do you think I knew about it beforehand?

609
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,762
What are you guys talking about?

610
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,797
The old hag made that decision.

611
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:49,801
Really? And you ran away
with that girl while holding her hand.

612
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,238
Could you let me explain?
I just got the wrong person.

613
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,873
Hey, what's going on?

614
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,008
Then explain it to me,
how could you get the wrong person?

615
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,010
Our haircuts and clothes are so different.

616
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,278
Are you be blind?

617
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,215
Why are you so unreasonable?

618
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,984
I called you yesterday to explain
but you wouldn't take my call!

619
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,253
Why would I take your call
and listen to your nonsense?

620
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,088
I think you're just like Ximen and Meizuo!

621
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,023
Do you really think I don't know
what you're thinking?

622
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,826
You'll treat me like that woman
you'll dump before getting married, right?

623
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,495
I'm telling you, you got the wrong person.

624
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,163
I'm breaking up with you!

625
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,099
-I, wait.
-Leave me alone!

626
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,034
Shancai!

627
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,071
-Engaged? Daoming Si is engaged?
-Is that true?

628
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,772
Did he dump Shancai?

629
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,107
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

630
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,443
-How could it be?
-Shut up!

631
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,777
Are you looking for trouble?

632
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,213
What happened?

633
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:37,616
I have no idea.

634
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,485
Maybe Shancai dumped him.

635
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,121
You nouveau riche,
who allowed you to eat here?

636
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,162
The daughter of the president
of He Corporation.

637
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,199
The He Corporation that is cooperating
with the American Oil King

638
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,635
and has wide networks in China and Taiwan.

639
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,803
Great.

640
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,342
Amazing, no wonder Ah Si is engaged
with her. She is an extraordinary match.

641
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,380
Oil is the only field that's not
in the Daoming Corporation's business.

642
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,982
That's why that old hag went
to her family.

643
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,451
Your mom is so resourceful.

644
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,487
If you two get married,

645
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,156
your wedding ceremony would be like
that of the first family.

646
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,624
Nonsense.

647
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,126
How could I marry her?

648
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,861
Why are you saying that?

649
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,597
Is she cute?

650
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,767
Not at all. She is a female monkey.

651
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,268
How could she be a female monkey?

652
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,303
Does she look like one?

653
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,805
She jumped on my back like a monkey,
and my ear...

654
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,975
Ear? What happened to your ear?

655
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:38,944
Why are you blushing?

656
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,080
What business do you have here? Get lost.

657
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,416
What happened?

658
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,419
I don't know but it seems funny.

659
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,255
He totally deserved to be embarrassed.

660
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,290
He tried to talk his way out
after what happened.

661
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,725
"Got the wrong person."

662
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,795
How could he get the wrong person?
I'm nothing like that girl.

663
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,830
Who would mistake a banana for a guava?

664
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,565
Lying liar.

665
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,044
He has fiancé now,
and she is a perfect match for him.

666
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,980
Isn't this great?

667
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,282
I've always wanted
to get rid of him anyway.

668
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,455
What a fashionable girl.

669
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,457
She looks like that girl from yesterday.

670
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,896
It really is her.

671
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,699
Hey. Is it really you?

672
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,035
We've met yesterday at the hotel.

673
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,337
So you're studying in Yingde?

674
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,073
-Hello.
-Could I sit next to you?

675
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,775
-Please, go ahead.
-Thank you.

676
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,780
Yingde is pretty big and majestic.

677
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,183
Did you come here
to find Daoming Si that idiot...

678
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,618
-That guy?
-Yes.

679
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,353
He is over there
at the student restaurant.

680
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,188
Oh, okay. I'll go there later.

681
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,425
I was wondering what kind of school
that weirdo is in like.

682
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,161
I was driving nearby so I went in
to take a look.

683
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,462
Weirdo?

684
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,865
Yes. Don't you think he's weird?

685
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,199
You knew what happened yesterday.

686
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,002
I had no money on me. I had no shoes.

687
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,904
But he just ignored and left me there.

688
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,739
Would a normal person do that?

689
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,508
He ignored you and left?

690
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,810
Yes. My feet were bleeding.

691
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,845
I spent over an hour walking home.

692
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,748
I will scold him as hard as I can
if I see him.

693
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,152
But aren't you in a relationship
with Daoming Si?

694
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,888
Who will be in a relationship
just after they first met?

695
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,656
"First met"?

696
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,925
But you two ran away together.

697
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,127
Oh, that.

698
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,896
I didn't know why either.

699
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,799
Maybe he fell in love
with me at first sight.

700
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,267
Who knows?

701
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,170
Hey, female monkey.

702
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,005
What are you doing at our school?

703
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,708
Female monkey?
How dare you call me female monkey?

704
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,510
Because of you, my whole body is aching
and my feet were almost broken.

705
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,545
Who cares?

706
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:57,015
I'm telling you,
there will be no engagement.

707
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,450
I'd rather die.

708
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,186
You're such an arrogant
and naive young man.

709
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,288
-What?
-Your ear.

710
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,691
You're a naive young man who will blush
if I bite your ear.

711
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,493
Bite his ear?

712
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,363
-So that's what the ear stuff is.
-You're so amazing.

713
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,765
What are you talking about?

714
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:18,570
From now on, as your fiancé,
I will be teaching you some lessons.

715
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,638
I fell in love with you.

716
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,507
What?

717
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,909
No matter what happens,
we're going to get married.

718
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,245
So it's fine to date you now.

719
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,914
"Get married"? "Fine to date"?

720
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,850
Ah Si, don't hit her.

721
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,719
-Yeah, she is a girl.
-I won't hit a girl, get off me.

722
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,288
-I don't believe you.
-You've hit girls before.

723
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,990
-You bitch.
-What bitch?

724
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,625
I have a name. I'm Heyuan Zi.

725
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,760
I don't care about your name.

726
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,461
I have not first thought about dating you.

727
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:44,763
And I don't want to marry you.

728
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,864
You meant "not once," right?

729
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,298
Don't lecture me, you...

730
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,101
Shancai, take this woman somewhere else.

731
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,936
-Hurry.
-You guys, get off me.

732
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,304
Hey, hurry...

733
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,340
Stop. I have something to say to you!

734
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,441
Hey!

735
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,109
Get off me.

736
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,685
I forget to tell you, I'm Xiaozi.

737
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,420
I'm Shancai.

738
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,856
Let's go shopping, shall we?

739
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,258
-Go shopping?
-Yeah.

740
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,160
It's okay. I'm really tired now.

741
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,228
And we just met.

742
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:20,098
That's fine. We can get to know each other
while shopping.

743
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,699
And I need your advice.

744
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,701
What advice can I give you?

745
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,804
A very important one. Let's go.

746
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,574
May I ask if this fits you?

747
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,543
It's nice but it looks a little big.

748
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,248
Shancai, what do you think of this one?

749
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,418
I think you look beautiful in all of them.

750
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,620
And haven't you bought enough already?

751
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,323
I want to dress up
to get Ah Si's attention.

752
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,624
Tailor it smaller for me.

753
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,695
You knew him longer. That's why I need
a very important advice from you.

754
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,665
Shancai, let me ask you a question.

755
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:59,838
Do you know if he likes gender-neutral,
sexy, or young style?

756
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,639
I don't know.

757
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,242
I think out of all the people
in the world, he likes himself the most.

758
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,978
I don't think he'll notice
what a girl is wearing.

759
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,079
Really?

760
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,748
That's so interesting.
I have to make him notice me.

761
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,654
That kind of boy is rare now, right?

762
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,823
I've decided to conquer his heart.

763
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:23,228
I thought my dad would introduce me
to some retarded rich young master.

764
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,630
But I think Ah Si is not bad.

765
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,798
He's pretty good.

766
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,868
So I think I'll regret it
if I give up just like that.

767
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:33,338
So I've decided to get
into a serious relationship.

768
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,306
I'm fine with whatever you're going to do.

769
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,676
Yeah. You're right.

770
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,378
Shancai, I'm sorry.

771
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:44,215
I'm an only daughter.
So I might be a little arrogant.

772
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,118
I think that's the reason
why I can't make any friends.

773
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,189
That's okay.
I have no friends in Yingde, too.

774
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,024
I'm sorry for troubling you.

775
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,027
That's fine. You aren't troubling me.

776
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,630
-Would you do me a favor?
-Okay.

777
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,898
Awesome!

778
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,033
What favor are you talking about?

779
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,868
Isn't this what always happen on TV shows?

780
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,638
Stuff like good friends
sharing love problems with each other.

781
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,074
I can tell you the secrets in my heart
and you can give me advice.

782
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,643
So I'm really happy right now.

783
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,979
If there's any problem between Ah Si
and I, I'll come to you.

784
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,514
But...

785
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,484
But what?

786
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,654
This is hard to say.

787
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,455
Well...

788
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,992
Daoming Si said he love me before.

789
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:29,594
Really?

790
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,563
But I'm not interested in him.

791
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,932
Then it's fine.

792
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,435
You can tell him something good about me.
And you can make him give up on you.

793
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,337
You can kill two birds
with one stone, right?

794
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,640
Miss, your clothes are ready.

795
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:43,641
Okay, thanks.

796
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,742
Wait for me, okay?

797
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,049
How did things turn out like this?

798
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,151
What am I doing?

799
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,873
What a beautiful dress.

800
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,477
I haven't bought a dress for about a year.

801
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,521
This one is over NTD 20,000.

802
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,766
This one is pretty good too.

803
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,037
Miss, please wrap it up for me.

804
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,379
I'm so happy today.

805
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,280
Shopping can really make you happy.

806
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,449
I think you're the only one happy.

807
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,986
And you're from a rich family.
What pressure could you have?

808
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,555
How could I not have any?
I have to learn a lot of skills at home.

809
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,491
And school is really boring.

810
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,593
But things are better now.
Since I love someone now,

811
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,628
I really feel that I'm in love.

812
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,929
Really?

813
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,633
I'm thinking,
if I can conquer that arrogant man,

814
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,735
I'll have the sense of accomplishment
as a woman.

815
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,537
I see.

816
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,073
How about you?
Are you in love with anyone?

817
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,009
Could it be Daoming Si?

818
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,010
No.

819
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,378
I don't like him.

820
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:28,746
That's great.

821
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,615
So are you in love with someone?

822
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,849
Not right now.

823
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,917
"Not right now."

824
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,652
It means you loved someone in the past.

825
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,321
What is he like?

826
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:39,791
He...

827
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,292
He's quiet.

828
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,927
A little dumb.

829
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:46,197
Dumb. You have a weird taste.

830
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,332
You're the one who has a weird taste.

831
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,935
Actually, he's not dumb.

832
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:55,540
I should say that when we were together,
I would become dumb.

833
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:00,778
I think that's because you were
comfortable and relaxed with him.

834
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,513
I think it's pretty important.

835
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,514
Is it?

836
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,416
Shancai, pull yourself together.

837
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,618
You can find a boy who's better than him.

838
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,421
If I were a boy,
I would love a girl like you.

839
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,490
-Thank you.
-Sure.

840
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,793
If you were a boy,
would you love a girl like me?

841
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,531
Why are you reacting like that?

842
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,234
I was joking. Don't get upset.

843
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,603
I'm joking too. This is for you.

844
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,438
Thank you for shopping
with me today, goodbye.

845
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,041
This is that dress earlier.

846
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,943
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

847
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,878
It's okay.

848
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,847
I think that dress would suit you well.

849
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,448
You'll be so beautiful in it.

850
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:39,750
I really want to be friends with you.

851
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,552
I'm leaving now, bye.

852
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,814
Stay with me for a while.

853
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,577
