1
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,053
Silly me.

2
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,655
I thought he's different
from the other three.

3
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:29,923
I'm such an idiot.

4
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,091
I have good news and bad news.

5
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,426
The good news is,

6
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,929
your endurance earned my respect.

7
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,464
The bad news is,

8
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,532
I'll work even harder to bully you.

9
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,681
Shancai.

10
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,816
This is your fourth bowl of rice.

11
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,384
Can you handle it?

12
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,254
I have to eat more.
I need to save my energy.

13
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,793
I'm done. I'll go now, Dad.

14
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,960
Yeah.

15
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,997
Hey, Dad. Is "Shancai" a kind of weed?

16
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,800
Is it a weed that no matter how hard
people step on it,

17
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,268
it will still sprout in spring?

18
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,570
Yeah.

19
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:24,738
Why are you asking?

20
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:25,939
It's nothing. I'm leaving now.

21
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,408
Mom, I'm leaving now.

22
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,950
What? She ate the whole pot of rice?

23
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,553
There's nothing left.

24
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,355
Honey.

25
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,826
Honey.

26
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,329
Your daughter ate the whole pot of rice.

27
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,132
Is she pregnant?

28
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,802
No, just remember--

29
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:56,803
Pig Head 4.

30
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,505
I'm telling you.

31
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,873
Don't think I'm scared of you.

32
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,975
I'm officially declaring a war on you.

33
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,515
This is the first time
someone dared to challenge us.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,286
What did she write?

35
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,691
It's so ugly.

36
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,270
No way.

37
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,139
Shancai, you really did that?

38
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,607
That's right.

39
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,509
I don't believe I'll lose to them.

40
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,712
Great! The Shancai I know is back.

41
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,282
You are truly a brave
and righteous person.

42
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,752
Make them pay ten times
for all they've done to you.

43
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,020
You must make them regret.

44
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,422
I'll make them regret
for the rest of their lives.

45
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,291
Shancai, you can do it.

46
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,727
-Yeah, I can do it.
-You can do it.

47
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,462
So, what's your strategy?

48
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,698
I don't have one.

49
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,470
Then what do you think the F4
will do next?

50
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,239
I don't know.

51
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,558
Young Master Ximen.

52
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:25,826
Have they arrived?

53
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,827
They're upstairs.

54
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,061
Thank you.

55
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,670
Sorry, I'm late.

56
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,141
That's okay. We're used to it.

57
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,110
Why are you here alone?

58
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,512
Where's that girl from last time?

59
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,849
I never keep a woman for more than a week.

60
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,984
It's been a week already?

61
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,720
Hey. Where's Lei?

62
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,656
I called him before I left.

63
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,592
He said he was sleeping.

64
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,761
That guy needs more than 15 hours
of sleep a day.

65
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,967
I'm bored to death.
My daily life is so "moonotonous."

66
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,071
It's "monotonous," right?

67
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,241
Really, it's "mono"?

68
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,243
So you say...

69
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,378
"smoth,"

70
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,746
"schol,"

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,548
and "toth"?

72
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,050
What?

73
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,585
Now I see how boring your life is.

74
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,554
It's the same "o."

75
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,289
-That's too much.
-That's too much.

76
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,426
If what you said is true,
then you should say "to."

77
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,263
Fine, as long as you're "god."

78
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,064
I'm not.

79
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,933
My life is so boring these days.

80
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,701
Hey, have you got anything fun?

81
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:42,936
Yeah.

82
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,739
That girl called Shancai or something.

83
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,841
She is pretty aggressive.

84
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,843
She even challenged Daoming Si.

85
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,147
I believe this is the most interesting
thing we've encountered.

86
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,117
That Shancai is pretty cool.

87
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,020
She won't admit defeat
even after getting badly bullied.

88
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,222
Ah Si, she is like your older sister.

89
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,623
I bet you can't handle her.

90
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,726
What are you talking about?
I can't handle her?

91
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,397
Sure, I place the same bet as always.

92
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,099
I bet Meizuo will win this.

93
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,969
You're going to lose this.

94
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,019
Those sons of bitches.

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,255
I can't believe they did this to me.

96
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,126
Need some help?

97
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,061
What?

98
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,129
Oh, yeah, thank you.

99
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,197
You're welcome.

100
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,067
We should actually thank you
for writing letters to us.

101
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,135
Letters? What letters?

102
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,071
Hey, stop fooling around.

103
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,939
You also sent me one.

104
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,140
What's that?

105
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,077
The letter said that F4 is bullying you.

106
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,547
And if someone comes to rescue you,
you will do anything, right?

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,948
I didn't write those letters.

108
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,150
Hey, don't pretend that you don't know
anything about it.

109
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,420
We approached you despite all the dangers,
at least let us kiss you.

110
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,089
What crap are you talking about? Psycho.

111
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,857
-Just have fun. You must be good at it.
-Hey!

112
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,592
Fun, my ass! Get lost!

113
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,329
Get lost! Stay away from me!

114
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,865
Go away! Someone help me!

115
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,701
Get lost! Help!

116
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,370
Help, anyone?

117
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,270
Help!

118
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,305
Hold her down now.

119
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,674
-Freaking bitch, how dare you hit me!
-Get your hands off me!

120
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,143
-I'm going to teach you a lesson.
-Get your hands off me!

121
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,678
-Shut up!
-Get your hands off me!

122
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,046
Don't touch me!

123
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,214
Get lost!

124
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,882
-Go away!
-Let her go!

125
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:36,783
Huaze Lei.

126
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,121
I said get your hands off her.

127
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,323
-But Daoming Si told us to do--
-Enough.

128
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,564
Why did you help me?

129
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,999
Aren't you with them?

130
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,568
No one helped you.

131
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,470
I just hate this kind of things.

132
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,854
What are you doing?

133
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,267
When I was a little kid,
a friend of mine taught me

134
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,204
that when your tears are about to fall,

135
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,272
you can do a handstand

136
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,378
to stop them from flowing.

137
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,218
Did you get it?

138
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,500
If you want to cry, just do a handstand.

139
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,775
What's up?

140
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,080
Two schoolmates
of Young Master want to visit him?

141
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,114
Got it.

142
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,751
Where's Young Master?

143
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
At the swimming pool?

144
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,255
The indoor one or the outdoor one?

145
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,557
The indoor one. Got it.

146
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,527
Tell Young Master
that his guests are here.

147
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,877
Are you Young Master's schoolmates?

148
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,779
Follow me.

149
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,317
Don't touch anything.

150
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,886
If you break something,
I'm sure you can't afford it.

151
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,803
Young Master.

152
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,431
So, how did it go?

153
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,301
You failed?

154
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,204
Are you pigs?

155
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,672
You idiots!

156
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,609
But that girl is really tough
to deal with.

157
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,910
We managed to hold her down,

158
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,179
and we were about to rip her clothes off
to teach her a lesson.

159
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,615
Who told you to rip her clothes off?

160
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,517
I just told you to scare her a little.

161
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,922
No. We actually failed
because Huaze Lei showed up.

162
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,361
Huaze Lei?

163
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,370
Where's the NTD 50,000 you promised?

164
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,741
How dare you ask for money
after what you've done?

165
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,023
Why are you acting weird today?

166
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,558
No, I'm not.

167
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,460
Really?

168
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,303
Daoming Si!

169
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,144
You douchebag!
How can you call yourself a man?

170
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,279
You're too shameful to do that thing!

171
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,593
Are you okay?

172
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,530
You want a soda?

173
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,342
I'm so nervous.

174
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,180
Will they get back at me?

175
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,016
It's so scary.

176
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,389
But it's so cool!

177
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,625
Pig Head 4, I'll never give in to you!

178
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,263
Why are you two still here?

179
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,564
Young Master is still there.

180
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,666
What? Young Master is still there?

181
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,871
He's been there for five hours.

182
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,375
Could there be any problem?

183
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,068
<i>That's strange. He didn't come here today.</i>

184
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,513
HUAZE

185
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,604
You can play the violin? That's amazing.

186
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,674
That song is so beautiful.
What's its title?

187
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,110
Do you know you're disturbing me?

188
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,559
Actually, I came here to thank you
for what you did yesterday.

189
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,328
If you didn't save me, I might...

190
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,098
Anyway, thank you very much.

191
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,601
If I had known you're so annoying,
I wouldn't have saved you.

192
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,237
It wasn't a big deal anyway.

193
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,309
But I'm still so happy.

194
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,881
I know you're F4.
That's why you're ignoring me, right?

195
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,485
I will still go to the rooftop
to meet you.

196
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,358
Then I won't go there anymore.

197
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,905
<i>That's weird.</i>

198
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:30,076
<i>Why am I not angry at all
after he said such mean words to me?</i>

199
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,912
<i>That gentle melody and rhythm,</i>

200
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,849
<i>I don't know why,
it has deeply captivated my heart.</i>

201
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:06,946
Are you Miss Shancai?

202
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:07,980
Please come with us.

203
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,082
Hey! What are you doing? Who are you?

204
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,317
<i>Help!</i>

205
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,586
<i>Sit tight.</i>

206
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,553
<i>What are you doing?</i>

207
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,389
<i>-Get lost!
-Trying to escape?</i>

208
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,490
<i>Don't move!</i>

209
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,058
<i>I said don't move. Stay still!</i>

210
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,627
<i>Hands, hold her hands.</i>

211
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,596
<i>I can't hold them if you keep doing that.</i>

212
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,131
<i>Hey, keep your eyes on the road!</i>

213
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,165
<i>Don't kick me.</i>

214
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,468
<i>-Watch out!
-Get your hands off me. Get lost!</i>

215
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,538
<i>It hurts. How dare you bite me!</i>

216
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,640
<i>She is so fierce.
Let's just knock her out.</i>

217
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,653
The skin complexion is pretty good.

218
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,423
It will be better if we tighten her skin.

219
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,192
I'm thinking of nerve stimulation.

220
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,128
The waist is a little wide.
We can use energy resonance device.

221
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,799
The arms are a little thick.
Let's do a massage treatment for her.

222
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,835
The legs are a little thick, too.
We'll give her a seaweed wrap.

223
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:03,869
Who are you?

224
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,804
Stay still.

225
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,605
-Be still.
-We're making you prettier.

226
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,973
Who are you? I have to go.

227
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,775
-Let me go. I want to leave.
-Stay still.

228
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,544
-What are you doing?
-You'll get so pretty.

229
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,878
Stop pulling my clothes!

230
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,046
Don't take my clothes off.

231
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,681
Help!

232
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,017
No! Why are you grabbing my hair?

233
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:18,984
What the heck?

234
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,122
This way, please.

235
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,131
One moment, please.

236
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,184
How is it?

237
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,787
Are you satisfied with your new style?

238
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,755
Why are you here?

239
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,924
This is my house.

240
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,359
Your house?

241
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,762
You have your own beauty salon
inside your house?

242
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,367
This is the life of upper class.

243
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,171
This is something people of your class
will never have in life.

244
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,175
But this proves

245
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,510
that an ordinary person like you

246
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,548
can also shine after some makeover.

247
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,152
Then what? What are you up to?

248
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,958
What I mean is,

249
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,527
I can offer you an opportunity.

250
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,362
I'll allow you to stick around me.

251
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,765
Stick around you?

252
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,767
You belong to me in school.

253
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,436
You will be allowed to follow behind me.

254
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,172
When no one else is present,

255
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,141
you're allowed to be by my side.

256
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,009
How is that?

257
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,811
You must be so excited now, right?

258
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,614
Yeah, I'm feeling so excited,

259
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,251
because this proves that my beating
has really made you an idiot!

260
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,752
What are you talking about?

261
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,421
Do you really think I will be excited?

262
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,822
Why not?

263
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,625
I can give you NTD 100,000 every month.

264
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,361
I can give you a platinum card
with unlimited spending limit.

265
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,997
A chauffeur will pick you up every day.

266
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,866
My skincare center
will be at your service.

267
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,902
I can give you a luxurious life.

268
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,105
There's nothing in this world
that money can't buy.

269
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,108
If I want,

270
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,277
I can even buy you the Eiffel Tower.

271
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:02,147
What's not to like about
a man of size like me?

272
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,449
-You pig head!
-Hey!

273
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,150
It's "sense," not "size."

274
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,720
Give me my clothes back. I'm leaving now.

275
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,456
What do you mean?

276
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,657
What do I mean?

277
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,125
Do you think I'm an idiot?

278
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,461
You want to buy me just like you
buy everything else, right?

279
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,364
I'm telling you,
I'm someone you can't buy with money.

280
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,298
You...

281
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,167
There are many women
who want to be my girlfriend,

282
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,103
and you're rejecting me?

283
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,905
Then go get them.

284
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,274
Don't treat me like them.

285
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,608
I'm telling you again,

286
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,444
I'm someone in this world
you can't buy with money.

287
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,746
-Goodbye!
-You...

288
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,456
Get lost!

289
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,060
Young Master.

290
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,497
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

291
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,199
<i>Am I being paranoid?</i>

292
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,268
<i>It seems that everyone is staring at me.</i>

293
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,113
That girl from the ordinary family
is really different from us.

294
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,183
Yeah, it's hard to imagine someone
would do such things.

295
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,485
She even had two abortions.

296
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,419
Really?

297
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,329
SHANCAI WAS A BAD GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL
WHO SEDUCED GUYS AND HAD TWO ABORTIONS

298
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,708
Shancai.

299
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,343
Don't worry about me.

300
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,325
Why do you love showing off so much?

301
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,728
Ximen is the only one in F4
who can't do one-arm pull-ups.

302
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,929
Who said I can't do it?

303
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,966
I just feel like it isn't
a graceful thing to do.

304
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,202
It costs me too much energy
and it's just boring.

305
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,038
Hey.

306
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:39,972
What should we do now?

307
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,707
About what?

308
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,243
What should we do with Shancai?

309
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,345
No idea.

310
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,813
No idea again?

311
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,981
Meizuo, how about you?

312
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,517
I told you that you can't handle her.

313
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,153
Just admit defeat and pay me.

314
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,055
Don't forget my share.

315
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,123
It's not about winning or losing.

316
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,559
It's about F4's reputation.

317
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,962
Daoming Si, you son of a bitch!

318
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,699
Get down here.

319
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,068
Why did you write that?

320
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,603
I didn't have an abortion.
I'm still a virgin.

321
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,846
She came here just to tell me
she's a virgin.

322
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,183
Does that mean...

323
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,221
Aren't you thinking too much into it?

324
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,592
How could he do that?

325
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,595
-He went too far for writing that.
-Yeah.

326
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,864
This is so mean.

327
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,300
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

328
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,473
When I got into the classroom,

329
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,808
I saw the words on the blackboard.

330
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,177
I was shocked.

331
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,112
Yeah.

332
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,279
You know,

333
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,014
we are all girls.

334
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:59,618
We can't just forgive something this mean.

335
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,723
If I were you, I would cry my eyes out.

336
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,192
You're nowhere as strong as Shancai.

337
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,595
Don't you think she is so beautiful

338
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,830
with her strong personality?

339
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,432
Yeah.

340
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,399
Shancai.

341
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,169
We believe that's not who you are, okay?

342
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,138
Thank you.

343
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,609
Isn't this the way
to the school dining hall?

344
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,478
Shancai, so this is your way home
every day?

345
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,047
Because my motorbike is parked there.

346
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,015
I see.

347
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,684
-Aren't your cars parked over there?
-Yeah.

348
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,619
That's okay.

349
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,821
-We're good friends now.
-Yeah.

350
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,923
What's wrong with walking with you
down the road?

351
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,591
We can chat with you on the way.

352
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:40,759
Yeah.

353
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,295
Did you hear that there is
a prom tomorrow afternoon?

354
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,798
If you are free, would you come with us?

355
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,402
No thanks, I don't have a dress for prom.

356
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,138
Come on. It's not a formal prom.

357
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,072
Yeah.

358
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,874
You can even wear jeans.

359
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:56,808
Yeah.

360
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,144
And the entry fee is only NTD 5,000.

361
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,112
It's 5,000?

362
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,513
No. I got no money.

363
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,516
-Shancai.
-Come on. Come with us.

364
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,152
It's just a small amount.
Your entry fee is on me.

365
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,854
You can come with us now, right?

366
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,055
But...

367
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,323
It's a deal.

368
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,792
See you there at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

369
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,197
Remember to wear cowgirl jeans
and a scarf, okay?

370
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,234
Wow, Shancai.

371
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,303
Are you really going to that prom?

372
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,940
I heard that it is
at a luxirious private club.

373
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,376
You people in Yingde
are really living an extraordinary life.

374
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,812
They are the extraordinary ones.

375
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,247
What's extraordinary about me?

376
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,284
I can't believe
the entry fee is NTD 5,000.

377
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,353
That's half of my monthly salary.

378
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,088
I...

379
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,224
don't belong with them.

380
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,125
Hey, that's not true.

381
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,062
I think they really want
to make friends with you.

382
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,764
They are even willing
to pay your entry fee.

383
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,068
I think they mean it.

384
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,942
Actually, I'm thinking

385
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:08,513
that I might be biased towards rich kids.

386
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,882
I know that when it comes to lifestyle,

387
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,951
we don't share the same ideas.

388
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:17,456
But maybe we can be friends
based on mutual support.

389
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,725
Lei, don't you have anywhere else to go?

390
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,593
Look.

391
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,196
There are two very handsome guys
coming in.

392
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:26,999
What do you want to buy this time?

393
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,668
What are you looking at?

394
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,875
Welcome.

395
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,113
Shancai.

396
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,914
It really is Shancai.

397
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,383
What are you doing here?

398
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,119
I'm working.

399
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,120
Working?

400
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,222
What a hardworking girl.

401
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,290
No.

402
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,859
I should call you a hardworking virgin.

403
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,794
Give me a break.

404
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,433
You must be the legendary F4, right?

405
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,001
I know you guys.

406
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,004
I'm Xiaoyou,
Shancai's schoolmate in high school.

407
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,406
She took care of me a lot.

408
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,573
Who cares?

409
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,309
Don't just talk to strangers.

410
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,044
May I have this cake?

411
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,182
Which one would you like?

412
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,550
This one.

413
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,687
This one, right?

414
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,155
No.

415
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,123
The one beside it.

416
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,565
Hey, Lei, we'll hang out later tonight.

417
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,800
Why did you buy this?

418
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,201
Don't you hate sweet food?

419
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:38,737
I'm not eating it.

420
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,605
But I just think it's cute.

421
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,245
Sometimes this guy behaves weirdly
in front of the girl he likes.

422
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,680
Like, you bought this cake--

423
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,182
You talk too much, Meizuo.

424
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,617
How much is it?

425
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,619
It's NTD 90.

426
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,228
<i>He's blushing.</i>

427
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,131
Don't get weird ideas. I was just joking.

428
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,533
You're not the reason
why he's acting weird.

429
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,675
Hey, your change.

430
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,310
You can keep it.

431
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,486
"You're not the reason
why he's acting weird."

432
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,488
Maybe I'm the reason?

433
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,163
Oh, I get it now.

434
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,565
The one who bought the cake
must be the one you said.

435
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,667
He's the one that's different
from the other three, right?

436
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,538
Does he often smile at you, little weed?

437
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47,806
Let's change the topic.

438
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,574
Where was I?

439
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,278
Oh, well, a friendship based on
mutual support.

440
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,548
Should I go tomorrow or not?

441
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,017
Hey, I'm not done talking yet.

442
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,385
Are you really my friend?

443
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,010
<i>Baihe and her friend lied to me.
Everyone is well-dressed.</i>

444
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,695
You're late.

445
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,730
Why the long face?

446
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,467
Didn't you say this is a cowboy prom?

447
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,302
I was joking.

448
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,071
Everyone knows that in this kind of place,

449
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,006
it can't be a cowboy prom.

450
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,476
Look at your outfit.

451
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,112
But don't worry,
I'm still going pay for you.

452
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,415
No, I'll pay for myself.

453
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,718
Shancai, you don't have to.

454
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,222
You have to work
to support yourself, right?

455
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,158
The entry fee is pretty high.

456
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,860
Then I'm leaving now.

457
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,661
It's all your fault.

458
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,763
I told you not to ask her,
and you didn't listen to me.

459
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,799
And you said that you want
to make friends with her.

460
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,835
This isn't a place for Shancai to come to.

461
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,371
I did that out of kindness.

462
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,908
I just wanted to use the chance
to make friends with her.

463
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,776
Who knew she would do that?

464
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,845
-She's so mean.
-She's so mean.

465
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,754
Where should I go to pay the entry fee?

466
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,426
Miss, excuse me.

467
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,030
Why are you giving me this?

468
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:53,665
Shancai.

469
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,301
She thought you're a waitress.

470
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,336
Look at your outfit.

471
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,272
You're even wearing a scarf.

472
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,674
I won't blame her
for giving you the dirty dish.

473
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,709
This is so embarrassing.

474
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,779
If I were her,
I would definitely kill myself.

475
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:09,848
Shancai.

476
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,151
If you're going to pay for yourself,
eat everything that you can eat.

477
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,754
You can't get a refund.

478
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,223
And I bet you've never had
such exquisite food.

479
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,359
How could you do that?

480
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,595
Don't be so mean to Shancai.

481
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,498
You keep telling her to eat something
she hasn't had before.

482
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,366
What if she gets diarrhea because of you?

483
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,601
Miss, excuse me.

484
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,835
I'm just kidding.

485
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,070
You're right.

486
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,139
You'd better just drink some water.

487
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,440
Take care.

488
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,775
We're leaving.

489
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,145
Which company are you from?

490
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,713
We're students.

491
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,749
-In which school?
-We're Yingde University students.

492
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,686
-Yingde.
-No wonder you look mature and pretty.

493
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,621
Thank you for your kind words.

494
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,456
You're nothing
like average college students.

495
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,591
You're so sweet.

496
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,658
Thanks.

497
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,093
-Thank you.
-Hello.

498
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,229
You've got a unique style, miss.

499
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,831
Are you also a Yingde University student?

500
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,366
Miss.

501
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,268
The girl in jeans.

502
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:05,870
Hello.

503
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,609
I thought in elite schools
like Yingde University

504
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,611
the girls are all the same.

505
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,848
But you have a unique style.

506
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,085
Miss, may I ask what's your name?

507
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,886
Of course, she's unique.

508
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,389
When she was in an average high school,

509
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,558
she was a problematic student.

510
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,394
She was a slut and had two abortions.

511
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,762
Pretty unique, right?

512
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,998
That's what makes her unique.

513
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,432
Very unique, right?

514
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:36,801
-Right.
-Yeah.

515
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,069
Unique.

516
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,472
We are going to get more wine.

517
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,374
-Bye.
-I'm sorry. Goodbye.

518
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,544
So you two wrote the words
on the blackboard.

519
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,313
Yeah, that was us.

520
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,817
Because you're such an attention seeker
and a pain in the ass.

521
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,587
We wanted you to disappear
as soon as possible,

522
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,355
so we wrote those words.

523
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,690
We wanted everyone to know.

524
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:00,458
Why?

525
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,895
We spent so much time and money

526
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,497
to become the best women.

527
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:09,334
So that one day,
we can marry the best men.

528
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,070
People like the F4. That's our goal.

529
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,242
How could we tolerate
some ordinary girl like you

530
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,911
following them around
and making eyes at them?

531
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,813
You have to know,

532
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,549
they won't fall in love
with an ordinary person like you.

533
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,217
You are different from us.

534
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,321
We feel so embarrassed even when
you stand by our side.

535
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,959
Did you really think
we would make friends with you?

536
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,795
Did you think it was possible?

537
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,763
You think too much.

538
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,436
<i>I have to stay here.
I won't get chased away by them.</i>

539
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:54,245
Upper class people like us won't invite
that kind of people, right?

540
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,580
That's right.

541
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,348
Hey, let's change the subject.

542
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,650
When we were at the party,

543
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:03,088
why did you keep making eyes
at that bald and fat Huang Xiaokai?

544
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,589
That's disgusting.

545
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,024
Don't forget

546
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:11,129
that our goal is to marry a president
or a general manager.

547
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,064
I don't care if he's bald or fat.

548
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,899
I'm going to get him first.

549
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:19,237
I'll dump him after I find someone
better-looking.

550
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,805
You're right.

551
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,208
Yeah, I know, right?

552
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,143
The next man will be better and richer.

553
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,453
Hello, I'm Qian Baihe.

554
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,056
Hello. You really look like your name.

555
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,924
You're beautiful like a lily flower.

556
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,493
Thank you for your kind words.

557
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,796
Yeah. She is beautiful like a lily flower.

558
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,932
She is a huge black lily.

559
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,167
Is she your friend?

560
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,335
No. I don't know her.

561
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,137
Baihe, we're friends.

562
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,205
Didn't you just tell me
we're here to find rich guys?

563
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,175
You also told me that the next man
would be better and richer.

564
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,945
Is he that richer guy you told me about?

565
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,046
You said that?

566
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,615
-No. I didn't mean that.
-Yes.

567
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,649
-I tell you what.
-I'm not--

568
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,552
You should treat a huge black lily
like her this way.

569
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,457
Excuse me, do you have tissue papers?

570
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,393
What happened? What did you do?

571
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,661
What did you do to her?

572
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,099
I'm telling you,
you messed with the wrong person.

573
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,834
If you love the F4 so much,

574
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,135
why don't you go get them?

575
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,670
Does it have anything to do with me?

576
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,806
But I tell you what,

577
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,975
girls like you are not worthy
of being loved by any men.

578
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,078
We won't let you get away with this.

579
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,481
Try me.

580
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,817
Although I'm just a little weed
in your eyes,

581
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,185
I'm telling you,

582
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,786
you'll never get rid of me.

583
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,785
MESSAGE

584
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,522
JING: I'M COMING BACK.

585
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,295
<i>Jing will finally be home soon.</i>

586
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,368
Why is the door open?

587
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,817
Morning.

588
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,620
Morning.

589
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,223
Didn't you say
you wouldn't come here anymore?

590
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,459
Don't like to see me here?

591
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,562
That's not what I meant. It's just...

592
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:33,965
I don't know.

593
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,700
I really like this place.

594
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,537
Because I can't hear the noise here.

595
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,012
Do you know the time difference
between us and France?

596
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:49,847
France?

597
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,084
One, two, three...

598
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,053
That's okay.

599
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,188
It's fine even if you don't know.

600
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:09,801
<i>Actually, it's enough for me to see him.</i>

601
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,270
<i>As for other things,</i>

602
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,772
<i>maybe it's better if I don't know them.</i>

603
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,503
What?

604
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,272
Isn't this a magazine
that you rich people read?

605
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,340
Why throw it at me?

606
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:50,742
Open your eyes.

607
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,243
Read the cover.

608
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,513
There's her biography inside.

609
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,081
Teng Tangjing.

610
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,350
The only daughter of the president
of Teng Corporation.

611
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,552
She can play five musical instruments,

612
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,121
and has her sailing license.

613
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,256
She's now studying in France.

614
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:09,627
She was even given the title
of Miss France.

615
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,129
Did you see that?

616
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,697
What an amazing biography.

617
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,499
Who is she?

618
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,801
She is the one Huaze Lei loves.

619
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:21,439
And she will graduate soon
and will come back from France.

620
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,208
You're not worthy of loving Huaze Lei.

621
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:28,279
Look at Teng Tangjing on the cover,
then look at yourself.

622
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,949
You can't even match one strand
of her hair.

623
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,653
What right do you have to talk
to Huaze Lei or even to love him?

624
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,621
Tell me.

625
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:39,824
What's wrong?

626
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:41,859
What?

627
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,797
Aren't you pretty aggressive?
What's wrong with you now?

628
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,698
Too shocked to think.

629
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:49,634
Let me tell you,

630
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,437
no matter how hard you act cute
and attract him,

631
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,172
you don't deserve the F4.

632
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,309
A weed like you shouldn't be allowed
to be here.

633
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,445
You'll ruin our image.

634
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,214
Get it? Now get lost.

635
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,151
Daoming Si.

636
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,921
Who said you can bring her here?

637
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,460
I'm telling you.

638
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,929
This woman belongs to me.

639
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,031
If I see you lay a finger on her,

640
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,667
the red card will be in front of you
the next day.

641
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:25,870
I'm sorry.

642
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,007
You're safe now.

643
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,344
Relax, I got you.
They won't bully you anymore.

644
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,579
Get lost!

645
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,646
What are you doing?

646
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,915
Who do you think got me in this situation?

647
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,083
You big idiot!

648
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,152
Why are you treating me like this?

649
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,520
I'm here to save you.

650
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:43,855
I didn't ask you for this!

651
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,723
Nobody dares to speak to me like this.

652
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,492
That's because everyone is an idiot!

653
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,659
What are you talking about?

654
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,828
Is there a more perfect man than me
in this world?

655
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:51,863
Perfect?

656
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,698
You call yourself perfect?

657
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,983
