1
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,660
<i>When did that woman
become such a daredevil?</i>

2
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,962
She doesn't look like one.

3
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,764
Yeah, this sounds exactly like
what Shancai's friend would do.

4
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,168
Well, she already made a move.

5
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,171
Pushing her away doesn't sound
like something you will do.

6
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,706
Give me a break.

7
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,808
You know very well
that she's the type I fear the most.

8
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,176
You're right.

9
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,478
She is very brave.

10
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,849
But she is too pure
for a veteran like you.

11
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,686
If you treat her badly,
even I can't just sit there and watch.

12
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,522
I'm also afraid Shancai would punch me.

13
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,461
That's right. Don't your girlfriends
only last a week?

14
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,429
If you really did that to Xiaoyou,

15
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,165
Shancai won't forgive you
even if Xiaoyou doesn't blame you.

16
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,602
I think it's best not to get
involved with her.

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,372
Do you have plans?

18
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,773
I'm meeting someone.

19
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,377
You can go ahead then.

20
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,179
Are you okay to be here alone?

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,482
I have nothing else to do anyway.

22
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,252
All right.

23
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,721
-I'll get going.
-Pay the bill if you leave first.

24
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,823
I know.

25
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,566
Hey, Ximen, why are you alone?

26
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,968
Want to go to our table?

27
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,605
I have other plans. Next time, okay?

28
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,573
Okay, sure. I'll go ahead.

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,574
Bye.

30
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,142
Xiaoyou.

31
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,877
I'm Ximen.

32
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,280
What time will you get off work?

33
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,697
<i>The lights are still on
in Daoming Si's place.</i>

34
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,933
<i>Is he still awake?</i>

35
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,006
<i>The ceiling is so low.</i>

36
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>The place is full of moldy smell.</i>

37
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,312
<i>How can I sleep here?</i>

38
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,885
<i>Turns out Shancai lives
in this kind of environment.</i>

39
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:23,663
<i>What we've been through
made our connection stronger.</i>

40
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,834
<i>Who doesn't want to have
an ordinary relationship?</i>

41
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,108
<i>However, when I've decided to love him,</i>

42
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,577
<i>I gave up on that idea.</i>

43
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,123
<i>Is Shancai already asleep?</i>

44
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,493
<i>Although this place is so old and rundown,</i>

45
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,531
<i>the thought of her staying next door</i>

46
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,934
<i>makes me feel
that this moldy smell is tolerable.</i>

47
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,338
<i>Even the air here feels different.</i>

48
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,209
<i>I want to go there and be with her.</i>

49
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,411
<i>I want to stay beside her.</i>

50
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,648
<i>And even watch her sleep.</i>

51
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,788
<i>I thought I have to force myself</i>

52
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,257
<i>to enter his world
when I cross that bridge.</i>

53
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,526
<i>However, now,</i>

54
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,030
<i>it seems like Daoming Si
jumped over that wall right away</i>

55
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,765
<i>and came into my world.</i>

56
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,602
<i>Actually, I'm really moved.</i>

57
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,405
<i>I want to go over there
and tell him about it.</i>

58
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,676
<i>If I really knock on his door, though,</i>

59
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,478
<i>will he mistake my intention?</i>

60
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,114
<i>Will he think I'm an easy girl?</i>

61
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,502
HOTEL

62
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,544
You're here.

63
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,045
Come in.

64
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,400
Have some tea.

65
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,263
Are you ready?

66
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,642
Don't be nervous.

67
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,769
Don't force yourself anymore.

68
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,905
You're not that kind of girl.

69
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,211
I'm also not interested in doing it
with a girl that's shaking all over.

70
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,914
Xiaoyou.

71
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,883
This is that I do with girls.

72
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,353
This is the only way I live my life.

73
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,189
You won't get used to it.

74
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,892
You should treasure yourself.

75
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,195
Look at you.

76
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,030
You can't even stand steadily.

77
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,268
I came here precisely
because I wanted to treasure this feeling.

78
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,872
If this is your way of living,

79
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,841
I'm willing to adjust to you.

80
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,482
This is crazy.

81
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,185
Actually, I just wanted to scare you.

82
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,987
Because you always like to force yourself.

83
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,090
This is not like you at all.

84
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,526
Were you just trying to scare me?

85
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,895
Please be serious, okay?

86
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,197
This is really important to me.

87
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,169
It's my first time.

88
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,376
Xiaoyou.

89
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,013
You don't need to force yourself
to adjust to me.

90
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,950
You are not like the other girls.

91
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,189
Even the names of the other girls
don't matter to me.

92
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,527
Ximen, I was thinking...

93
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,664
that even if I'm just a girl
whose name you won't even remember,

94
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,768
I still hope to leave a trace
in your life.

95
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,336
Why?

96
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,107
Because I don't have much time.

97
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,612
The reason I mustered my courage
to do so many bold things

98
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,915
is because...

99
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,418
my dad received a very big blow
in his work last time

100
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,721
because of Shancai.

101
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,724
Though it's all over now,

102
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,094
he still feels very discouraged.

103
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,063
So he has decided...

104
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,499
that we should migrate to Canada.

105
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,368
We already have the plane tickets.

106
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,808
So tonight will be
my last night in Taiwan.

107
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,413
Are you going overseas?

108
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,683
So...

109
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,686
just treat this as my wish.

110
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,124
Because I really like you.

111
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,691
<i>I have to act naturally.</i>

112
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,693
<i>Otherwise, he would think too much.</i>

113
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,831
<i>And I just simply want to thank him.</i>

114
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,338
Why is the door open?

115
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,007
Daoming Si.

116
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,143
Daoming Si.

117
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,412
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

118
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,751
I couldn't sleep at all.

119
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,688
I never thought you'd really rent
the place next door to Shancai's.

120
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,857
How can you live in such a place?

121
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,727
I really admire the things
you do for love.

122
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,700
Is your life as an ordinary citizen
really that tiring?

123
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,104
I really wanted to go to sleep.

124
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,708
However, the ceiling was so low
and it was so dark.

125
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,212
That place has a moldy smell.

126
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,814
How can I fall asleep?

127
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,350
<i>Why did he tell him?</i>

128
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,219
<i>Didn't we agree
that it's supposed to be a secret?</i>

129
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,320
<i>This big, stupid fool.</i>

130
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,590
If Qinghe wasn't so talkative,
we wouldn't find out about this.

131
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,693
You're not using your brain, though.

132
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,396
It's impossible for you
to live Shancai's life.

133
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,631
If you can fall asleep there,

134
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,067
I think the sun would rise from the west.

135
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,970
Whatever.

136
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,172
Did I ask for your opinion?

137
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,174
You don't understand at all.

138
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,813
<i>He's whining so much after just one day.</i>

139
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,182
<i>He's really such a spoiled brat.</i>

140
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,989
I can't do it anymore.
I'm going home to sleep.

141
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,559
Are you not going to class again?

142
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,797
<i>Though I know
this is what's going to happen,</i>

143
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,266
<i>I still feel really happy</i>

144
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,635
<i>even if he couldn't adapt to my life.</i>

145
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,242
Hey.

146
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,178
<i>Shancai. It's Xiaoyou.</i>

147
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,213
Xiaoyou, what's up?

148
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,649
<i>I have to say goodbye to you.</i>

149
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,984
<i>Because my dad has decided
that we should migrate.</i>

150
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,586
<i>We're leaving today.</i>

151
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,254
<i>You don't need to see me off.</i>

152
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,056
You're migrating overseas?

153
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,692
Why didn't you mention it before?

154
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,894
<i>I'm sorry for not telling you before.</i>

155
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,963
<i>I just didn't want us to be so sad.</i>

156
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,065
<i>I don't want to see you cry.</i>

157
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,501
<i>And I also wouldn't be able to resist it.</i>

158
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,772
<i>You're so bad.
I already feel like crying now.</i>

159
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,340
<i>You're leaving.</i>

160
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,943
<i>We won't be able to see
each other anymore then.</i>

161
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,978
<i>No, I promise you.</i>

162
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,880
<i>I'd work part-time
during summer and winter vacations</i>

163
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,882
<i>so that I can buy a plane ticket
to come and visit you.</i>

164
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,152
<i>So Shancai, please don't blame me.</i>

165
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,171
Sir, your coffee. Please enjoy.

166
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,740
-Thank you.
-By the way, Shancai is on leave today.

167
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,909
And Xiaoyou has already resigned.

168
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,545
I know.

169
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,313
I just wanted to come here.

170
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,915
All right. I won't disturb you then.

171
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,190
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

172
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,263
What's the matter?

173
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,134
I really like this girl.

174
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,203
She just wouldn't agree to be with me.

175
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,305
-Ximen.
-You became stronger.

176
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,809
You're not the girl who was crouching
and crying by the sidewalk anymore.

177
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,448
Ximen, you were the one
who made me stronger.

178
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,021
<i>Just treat it as my wish.</i>

179
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,425
<i>Because I really like you.</i>

180
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,211
-Hey.
-<i>Hey, Ximen. It's me, Meizuo.</i>

181
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,580
Where are you now?

182
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,448
Aren't we going to a party tonight?

183
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,517
Tell me where you are.
I'll go pick you up.

184
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,719
I'm not going anymore.

185
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,790
What's going on? Supermodels
will be all over the party tonight.

186
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,358
It would be a shame not to go.

187
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,027
Meizuo.

188
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,029
Just enjoy yourself there.

189
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,965
I'm not really interested.

190
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,866
All right, bye.

191
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,921

DELETED

196
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:14,854
XIAOYOU

197
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,315
<i>It's been a few days since Xiaoyou left.</i>

198
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,253
<i>Daoming Si doesn't come here anymore.</i>

199
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,339
<i>It's not strange for Daoming Si
not to come here at all.</i>

200
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,076
<i>This place is so old and dirty.</i>

201
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,478
<i>It would be strange if he can stay here.</i>

202
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,749
<i>However, why do I feel so bad?</i>

203
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,709
Why are you standing there
like a ghost and not talking?

204
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,544
What did you say?
Why do you say I'm like a ghost?

205
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,280
What do you think? Your hair is so long
and you're standing there so quietly.

206
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,648
Good thing my heart is strong enough.

207
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,852
You don't need to come here. Why did
you come here for me to scare you?

208
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,753
What?

209
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,421
You can stay in your palace-like home.

210
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,089
Isn't it more comfortable there?

211
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,924
Why are you so irritated?

212
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,059
I'm not.

213
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,763
I spent money to rent this place.
I can come whenever I want.

214
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,798
Hey, this is the world
of ordinary citizens.

215
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,400
I don't want people
to just come and go as they please.

216
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,437
Lower your voice, okay?
Do you know what time is it now?

217
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,372
I'll take you home first.

218
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,507
Let's talk inside.

219
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,153
What's the matter?

220
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,221
I don't know what's the matter with me.

221
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,026
<i>I'm falling deeper and deeper</i>

222
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,728
<i>into this love that has no future.</i>

223
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,198
<i>I can't bear this feeling
of uneasiness anymore.</i>

224
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,937
Do you miss me because
you haven't seen me for two days?

225
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,241
How is that possible? You stupid fool.

226
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,888
Honestly, I've been coming here
the past few nights.

227
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,291
You just don't know it.

228
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,394
I come here around 1 a.m.
and leave at dawn.

229
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,496
You're lying.

230
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,032
Why would I lie to you?

231
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,434
Because it's more dangerous
during those hours.

232
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,638
The bodyguards are watching me
really closely lately.

233
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,107
It's so hard to escape from my house.

234
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,711
I think that was my mom's instructions
to them.

235
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,913
She's in New York now,

236
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,082
but she wants to monitor my every move.

237
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,584
If you come here,

238
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,386
wouldn't your mom find out
about us easily?

239
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,522
That's why I can only come out
in the middle of the night.

240
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,691
And I can't use my car.

241
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,560
I have to hail a cab along the way.

242
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,262
It's really troublesome.

243
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,334
<i>So that's what he's been doing.</i>

244
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,835
<i>I'm so bad.</i>

245
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,871
<i>I was mad for no reason.</i>

246
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,639
<i>It's so embarrassing.</i>

247
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,345
All right. It's late already.
You should be tired, right?

248
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,146
Go to bed.

249
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,182
I'm really sleepy too.

250
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,618
Okay.

251
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,086
I'll go to bed then.

252
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,153
Okay.

253
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,429
Go to sleep.

254
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,598
I'll stay here until you fall asleep.

255
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,204
Actually, I really miss Xiaoyou.

256
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,374
I miss you too.

257
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,109
Good night.

258
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,886
<i>I'm so happy today,</i>

259
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,323
<i>even though there's always been
a big question on my mind</i>

260
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,027
<i>about our different backgrounds.</i>

261
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,262
<i>Though I've already decided</i>

262
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,898
<i>to be with you against all odds,</i>

263
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,535
<i>I still feel very uneasy deep in my heart.</i>

264
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,255
<i>Madam.</i>

265
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,024
<i>When the realtor saw
one to two million in front of him,</i>

266
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,526
he told us everything.

267
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,964
He said a man used a huge amount of money

268
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,766
to rent the place beside Shancai's house.

269
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,902
He didn't leave any information, though.

270
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,739
So we still couldn't confirm
who this man is.

271
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,775
However, I'm guessing

272
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,644
that it should be Young Master Daoming Si.

273
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,248
You have been working for me for so long.

274
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,985
You know me quite well.

275
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,688
There's no need to report
unconfirmed information to me.

276
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,090
Yes, Madam.

277
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:54,693
I've already sent men
to watch more closely

278
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,095
outside of Shancai's house.

279
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,429
And then?

280
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,231
We've confirmed
that it's Young Master Daoming Si.

281
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,234
Madam, we're very sorry.

282
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,838
Yamen, the one we hired, was not useful.

283
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,446
Is that so?

284
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,386
There's no point talking about the past.

285
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,523
And don't waste any more of my time.

286
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,892
This has to end.

287
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,787
You're in disguise again?

288
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,322
Have you been waiting for a long time?

289
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,558
Did you lose your bodyguards
when you came out earlier?

290
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,994
I went around so many times
before I managed to lose them.

291
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,028
Let's go.

292
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,965
Who else dates so excitingly like us?

293
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,669
I'll take off my hat then.

294
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,771
No. Someone might see you.

295
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,180
Thank you.

296
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,784
What's this? It looks really good.

297
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,653
Truffles.

298
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,488
Truffles?

299
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,593
It's my first time to eat truffles.

300
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,298
It feels like the food tastes so much
better every time I watch you eat.

301
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,434
It really tastes good.

302
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,272
I know so many girls.

303
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,475
No one has the same expression
as you when they eat,

304
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,312
be it my mom, my sister, or Jing.

305
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,948
You all eat on those long tables.

306
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,850
How can you see each other's expressions?

307
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,986
Our family always eats on a round table.

308
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,488
We chat while we eat.

309
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,356
That makes the food taste so much better.

310
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,661
It's so nice to eat as your family does.

311
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,999
If you want,

312
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,001
you can come to my house
and I'll cook for you.

313
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,838
Sure.

314
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,653
What do you mean by that?

315
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,689
Sir, I'm sorry. Your card is unusable.

316
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,024
Unusable?

317
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,294
I'll give you another one.

318
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,672
Daoming Si,
I just got my salary yesterday.

319
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,008
-How about it's my treat this time?
-There's no need.

320
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,110
I never let a girl pay.

321
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,016
Sir, I'm sorry.

322
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,350
This card is also unusable.

323
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,486
Unusable again?

324
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,493
Try this one.

325
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,905
Sir, I'm very sorry.

326
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,674
All three cards are unusable.

327
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,042
How is that possible?

328
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,244
-Is your credit card device broken?
-Daoming Si, don't be mad.

329
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,378
<i>-Let me pay.
-Don't interfere.</i>

330
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,613
Don't act this way.

331
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,915
Maybe their device is really broken.

332
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,952
And it's fine to let me pay sometimes.

333
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,720
Otherwise, you're the one who always pays.

334
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,023
My mom started taking action.

335
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,592
What did you say?

336
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,196
My mom started taking action.

337
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,104
I don't think so.
Maybe they really just made a mistake.

338
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,608
For example,
your card might already be expired.

339
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,010
Or the device is really broken.

340
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,878
Or...

341
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:13,919
That's right.

342
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,722
That waiter's facial expression
was even worse than mine.

343
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,492
You dare say that? You were the same.

344
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,127
Who says so? I...

345
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,162
I look much friendlier than him.

346
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,833
All right. Let's go somewhere else.

347
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,435
I'll call someone from home to
ask them to bring some money for me.

348
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,139
There's no need to call them.
There are ways to not spend money.

349
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,540
That's what I do.

350
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,276
Let's have an ordinary citizen date.

351
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,910
We don't need to spend money.

352
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,812
-An ordinary citizen date?
-Yes.

353
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,782
Why doesn't it sound fun
when it comes from you?

354
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:44,950
No.

355
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,853
It's true. There are many places
we can go without spending money.

356
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,058
<i>Things are starting to change,</i>

357
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,460
<i>but I don't want to think about that.</i>

358
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,464
<i>Because I just want to treasure
our short moment together.</i>

359
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,175
Madam, everything is ready.

360
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,145
And there's news

361
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,946
that at 2 p.m. Taiwan time,

362
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,649
Anton Restaurant confirmed

363
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,319
that Young Master Ah Si
and Miss Shancai was there.

364
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,689
Madam, this is your plane ticket.

365
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,726
The car is ready. We can leave anytime.

366
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,041
Hi.

367
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,880
-You can hold him.
-Thank you.

368
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,916
-He's so cute.
-He's so stinky.

369
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,919
-Do you want to touch him?
-No. Take him away from me.

370
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,621
You're not afraid of cats, right?

371
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,857
How can I be afraid of such a thing?

372
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,792
I just haven't touched one before.

373
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,663
Why are you smiling in such an evil way?

374
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,199
I never thought that the Daoming Si
who's not afraid of anything

375
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,633
are afraid of cats.

376
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,573
Haven't you had pets before?

377
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,542
Aunt Yu wouldn't let us.

378
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,979
Then what did Aunt Yu
let you do when you were little?

379
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:26,485
She asked us to take
karate, aikido, and judo lessons.

380
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,919
Why?

381
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,755
To prevent us from being kidnapped.

382
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,491
There were a few times when we almost
got kidnapped when we were little.

383
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,394
So we had to attend
those classes once a week.

384
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,764
I remember there were huge men
like bears who would teach us back then.

385
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,233
No wonder you fight so well.

386
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,835
I know I must protect myself.

387
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,671
At that time, my sister went overseas
for her studies.

388
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,074
My parents also live overseas
for long periods of time.

389
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,610
So you must feel lonely, right?

390
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,779
I don't feel lonely.

391
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,817
So what if you feel lonely? Why won't
you admit it? You're so in denial.

392
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,920
Haven't you always lived that way
since then until now?

393
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,359
I'm not lonely at all now

394
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,495
because I have you.

395
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,966
I don't want anything else aside from you.

396
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,836
This is the first time I felt this way.

397
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,105
It's unimaginable, right?

398
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,113
I'll kill whoever tries to break us apart.

399
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,949
Is it that serious?

400
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,364
Time passed by so fast.
It's night time now.

401
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,235
I'm so hungry.

402
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,240
I only have NTD 100 left.

403
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,375
Hot buns.

404
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,111
-Big, hot buns.
-There's someone selling buns over there.

405
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,914
Wait here. I'll buy some.
NTD 100 is enough for us both to eat.

406
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,552
-Miss, do you want some buns?
-Sir.

407
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,589
-I want some buns.
-Okay, how many do you want?

408
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,590
I want five.

409
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,924
Okay, thank you.

410
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,637
Daoming Si.

411
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:27,939
-Daoming SI, what's the matter?
-What?

412
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,040
Nothing.

413
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,743
I got the buns. Let's find
a place to sit down and eat them.

414
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,355
Okay.

415
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,931
This is so funny.

416
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,266
Why are you laughing?

417
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,601
You're Daoming Si

418
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,937
and you're sitting on the side
of road and eating buns.

419
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,073
If other people see you,
they'll surely laugh.

420
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,875
Are you stupid?

421
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,479
How is it? It's good, right?

422
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,180
It's quite good.

423
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,183
Your taste is becoming more
and more like an ordinary citizen's.

424
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,485
That's a good thing.

425
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,022
Do you want me to adjust to your taste?

426
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,423
Of course.

427
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,025
If I adjust to you,

428
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,060
we'd never have enough money for food.

429
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:26,998
Look.

430
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,500
The stars are out.

431
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:31,369
We can see the stars on this road.

432
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,071
This is my first time to see those here.

433
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,205
Yes.

434
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,979
We were out for so long and
your bodyguards didn't find us.

435
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,114
We can come out like this
more often in the future.

436
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,116
Yes, you're right.

437
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,518
Where would you like to go?

438
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,990
To...

439
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,732
It's Meizuo.

440
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,834
Why didn't you answer Meizuo's call?

441
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,470
Who cares? It's not something
important anyway.

442
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,047
Let's eat.

443
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,449
I'll take you home afterwards.

444
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,357
Why isn't he answering my call?

445
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,392
He ignores his friends
because he has a girlfriend now.

446
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,262
Lei's out of the country.

447
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,399
Ximen suddenly doesn't want
to go out and party.

448
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,936
Ah Si is busy in love.

449
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,713
It seems F4 is going to disband.

450
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,357
My feet are killing me.

451
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,526
You're really useless.

452
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,262
You always use your car. You seldom walk.

453
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:09,267
Do you want me to prepare
a lunch box for you?

454
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,003
It's up to you.

455
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,172
I'm used to eating bad food anyway.

456
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,074
It tastes bad?

457
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,609
Then I won't make it anymore.

458
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,178
Then don't.

459
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,014
Okay, I won't then.

460
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,749
It's up to you.

461
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,420
Just kidding.

462
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,422
See you at school tomorrow.

463
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,991
-I'll go inside then.
-Okay.

464
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,794
-Shancai?
-Yes?

465
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,363
Can I kiss you?

466
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,734
Someone might pass by.

467
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,236
No, it will just take a short while.

468
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,274
Good night.

469
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,532
Come out.

470
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,402
I know you're all around here.

471
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,282
From the time I was at the pet shop,

472
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,419
you've been following me.

473
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,087
Please go home with us.

474
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,728
Let me warn you first.

475
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,633
No matter what you do,

476
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,737
you can't touch Shancai.

477
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,207
Otherwise,

478
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,178
I'll let you die a horrible death.

479
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,956
Ah Si.

480
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,424
Good thing he has a conscience.

481
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,361
Hey, Ah Si.

482
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,297
-Hello?
-<i>What are you doing?</i>

483
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,431
Hello?

484
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:21,966
<i>I know my mom sent you.</i>

485
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,270
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

486
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,741
<i>Hey, let me go.</i>

487
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,810
-Ah Si.
-<i>What are you doing?</i>

488
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,278
Hello?

489
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,096
What's going on?

490
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,365
Lunch break is over.
He's still not coming?

491
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,879
Shancai

492
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,916
Why are you two in such a rush?

493
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,818
Where's Ah Si?

494
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,319
Were you with him last night?

495
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,689
We were together before 8 p.m. yesterday.

496
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:52,957
What about after 8 p.m.?

497
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,327
I'm not sure. He might have gone home.

498
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,731
We were supposed to eat our lunch boxes
together, but he didn't come.

499
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,166
What's the matter?

500
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,335
We're thinking
that something happened to Ah Si.

501
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,006
We can't reach him on his mobile
and we couldn't find him.

502
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,608
I also got a strange phone call
last night.

503
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,043
What do you mean a strange phone call?

504
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,612
He called me, but he didn't talk.

505
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,180
I just heard some strange conversation.

506
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,816
He might have been taken away by someone.

507
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,787
Did you notice anything strange
when you went out yesterday?

508
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,056
No.

509
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,292
Shancai.

510
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,594
Turns out you're all here.

511
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,895
Bad news.

512
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,031
Daoming Si got kicked out of school.

513
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,766
Daoming Si got kicked out?

514
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,602
I heard it from our classmates so I went
to the Student Affairs Office to check.

515
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,103
I heard that the principal instructed it.

516
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,772
And it seems to take effect
starting today.

517
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,273
How is that possible?

518
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,842
Isn't this school supported
by your families?

519
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,477
How can Daoming Si get kicked out?

520
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,947
Ximen, let's go to Ah Si's house.

521
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,482
Okay.

522
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,451
Qinghe, take Shancai home first.

523
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:54,686
Okay.

524
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:58,289
Will Daoming Si's mom do
something to Qinghe again?

525
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,824
I don't think so.

526
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,226
Ah Si's mom won't use
the same tricks twice.

527
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,797
Shancai, don't worry about it.

528
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,499
We're our family's successors.

529
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,435
We'd find a way to resolve this.

530
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,171
Let's go.

531
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,380
Shancai, are you okay?

532
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,819
<i>Let me out!</i>

533
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,488
Open the door!

534
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,624
Let me out!

535
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,229
Open the door now!

536
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,234
So even us can't get in there now?

537
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,370
I'm sorry, Young Master Ximen.

538
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,638
What do you mean?

539
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,407
Tell Mr. Liu to talk to us.

540
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,678
Young Master Meizuo, it's Madam's order.

541
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,180
Without an appointment,

542
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:00,852
we need to politely reject all guests.

543
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,054
Please make an appointment in advance,

544
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,656
no matter who you are.

545
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,665
All right. We understand.

546
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,367
I'm sorry.

547
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,571
Young Master Ximen.

548
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,875
Aunt Yu.

549
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,010
Even if the two of us can't get
in there now.

550
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,979
Are you just sitting there
allowing it to happen?

551
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:32,116
I'm old now. Who would listen
to an old woman?

552
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,188
The people in charge now
have their own way of doing things.

553
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,826
They used to listen to me
because they were giving me the courtesy.

554
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,531
Now, nobody needs me anymore.

555
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,635
In that case, we're leaving now.

556
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,538
Wait, this is for you.

557
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,473
This is...

558
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,042
Young Master told me to give this to you.

559
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,917
Daoming Si is going to marry Xiaozi.

560
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,752
This is ridiculous.

561
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,023
Qinghe, it's none of your business.
Calm down, okay?

562
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,291
It's none of my business?

563
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,026
Shancai's business is my business.

564
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,194
So what are you going to do?

565
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,662
I'll go pay Xiaozi back.

566
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,397
She has never given up Daoming Si.

567
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:22,633
She invited Shancai to a soiree
with Daoming Si's fake cousin.

568
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,335
She planned it all out.

569
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:28,239
It's clear that Xiaozi
has no moral compass at all.

570
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,309
Qinghe. Aren't you jumping
to conclusions too fast?

571
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,410
Fine.

572
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,513
Is this marriage photo fake?

573
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,050
Xiaozi is so cunning
and Daoming Si is even worse than her.

574
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,585
How could he do this to Shancai?

575
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,921
He used to pursue her like crazy,
and he even moved next door to Shancai.

576
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,690
What is he up to? He is fooling us around.

577
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,759
He's getting married all of a sudden.
He's playing with her feelings.

578
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,629
Qinghe, stop it.

579
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,566
Shancai.
I know you're really upset right now.

580
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,101
If you are, say it out loud.

581
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,669
Don't repress your feelings.

582
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,038
You can cry or vent out.

583
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,541
He's just a disloyal Daoming Si,
you can curse him however you want.

584
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,309
Qinghe, haven't you said enough?

585
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,844
This topic has gone too far.

586
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,722
Shancai, don't worry.

587
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,991
Regardless if this wedding
is real or not...

588
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,760
Even if it's real,

589
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:24,862
I believe Ah Si was just forced to do it.

590
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,426
