1
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,163
Is there something wrong with this guy?

2
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,165
He has been beaten up so badly,
but he's still standing.

3
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,883
Are you done?

4
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,153
I didn't feel anything at all.

5
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,323
Do you want to have a go, too?

6
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,526
This is for my brother!

7
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,261
You're not afraid to die?

8
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,345
Darn it. Beat the girl up, too.

9
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,413
Stop.

10
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,188
That's enough.

11
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,256
Let's go.

12
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,964
That's a lesson for you.

13
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,432
Don't be too arrogant from now on.

14
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,300
Jerk, just wait and see.

15
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,804
Daoming Si.

16
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,372
Daoming Si, are you okay?

17
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,510
How can I be okay?

18
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,780
My hand

19
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,883
and my ribs are almost broken.

20
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,653
Stupid fool!

21
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,422
Why didn't you fight back?

22
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,624
Aren't there just four of them?

23
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,325
Based on your skills,

24
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,294
you could've taken them down easily.

25
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,365
You're really stupid.

26
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,601
If I fight back,

27
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,805
then I would lose.

28
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,077
I won't be able to protect you.

29
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,084
It's easy to deal with them,

30
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,788
but I had to resist it.

31
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,659
I couldn't fight back.

32
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,967
I was only thinking about one thing.

33
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,407
And that is to protect you.

34
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,482
If I die today,

35
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,085
don't be sad.

36
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,824
Don't cry, too.

37
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,727
Daoming Si.

38
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,262
Daoming Si.

39
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,898
Daoming Si, don't die!

40
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,566
I don't want you to die!

41
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,235
Daoming Si!

42
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,483
Daoming Si.

43
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,985
What are you doing over there?

44
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,686
It's too dangerous to stand there.

45
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,292
Can you help me?

46
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,794
I can't get up.

47
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,596
No.

48
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,765
Stand on your own.

49
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,701
Rely on your own strength to go on.

50
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,904
Don't you hate me?

51
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,806
Then don't beg me.

52
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,175
I hate you?

53
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,343
Who says that I hate you?

54
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,947
Daoming Si, don't do this!

55
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,388
Shancai.

56
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,223
It's great that you're finally awake.

57
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,025
You got me so worried.

58
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,026
Mom.

59
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,561
Where are we?

60
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,862
We're at the hospital.

61
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,797
You were carried here.

62
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,367
You and Daoming Si fainted
at a very remote warehouse.

63
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,102
That's right.

64
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,605
Daoming Si lost consciousness.

65
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,474
What exactly happened?

66
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,009
I was so worried.

67
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,378
How do you feel now?
Does it hurt anywhere?

68
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,546
Do you feel uncomfortable?

69
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,514
Shancai.

70
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,894
Where's Daoming Si?

71
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,636
Is he still alive?

72
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,787
Where is he now?

73
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,594
That's impossible.

74
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,299
It's too late.

75
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,170
Ah Si's gone.

76
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,346
Until the very last moment,

77
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,916
he was calling your name.

78
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,922
I couldn't believe it.

79
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,958
Ah Si really died just like that.

80
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,690
Daoming Si.

81
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,027
Daoming Si.

82
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,133
How can you die?

83
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,002
If you're dead, how can I apologize?

84
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,777
Even though you're so stupid

85
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,278
and your temper is really bad,

86
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,214
I don't want you to die.

87
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,686
Even though many people want you dead,

88
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,989
I...

89
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,559
Why are you so noisy?

90
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,628
Is this how you should treat your savior?

91
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,603
"I don't want you to die, Daoming Si."

92
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,609
My stomach hurts.

93
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,844
Shancai.

94
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,779
Your facial expression earlier was...

95
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,650
really amazing.

96
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,321
-How infuriating. I want to kill this guy.
-Come back here! Hey!

97
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,956
Do you want to kill me?

98
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,858
My ribs are all broken
and you're even sitting on me.

99
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,526
-Are you crazy?
-Who told you to stoop so low?

100
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,328
-It hurts!
-I'm sorry. It's our fault, okay?

101
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,563
-It's all our fault.
-We're sorry.

102
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,630
Don't be mad.

103
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,469
-It's so funny.
-Calm down.

104
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,938
Not bad, right? Let's go.

105
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,574
Have a good rest here.

106
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,042
Leave everything to us.

107
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,948
Lei, wait.

108
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,484
-If you find them, remember--
-All right.

109
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,651
I know what I should do.

110
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,086
Get some rest.

111
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,663
Let's have a look.

112
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,441
He wrote down how many punches and kicks

113
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,876
he received from each person.

114
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,178
I thought he had gotten more mature.

115
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,047
I don't think so. He's still so vengeful.

116
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,416
What's this?

117
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,052
"Leave Xiaoshun to me. That's all."

118
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,360
Why are you so quiet?

119
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,071
What kind of attitude is that?

120
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,907
Do you think you're so great?

121
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,775
Why should I be so nosy?

122
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,311
I risked my life
and got beaten up so badly

123
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,748
just to save an ungrateful virgin.

124
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,717
You're also a virgin.
How dare you say that.

125
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,953
Shut up.

126
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,924
You always pick fights.

127
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,560
Can't you say nice things
to comfort a patient?

128
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,831
It's because...

129
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,368
What is it?

130
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,471
It's because I had a dream.

131
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,974
I dreamt that you were dead.

132
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,877
I felt so scared.

133
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,949
I wondered if you were really dead.

134
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,220
I thought you wouldn't come and save me

135
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,956
after I said those things to you.

136
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,658
I never thought

137
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,462
that you would come
and save me like a stupid fool.

138
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,066
You were kicked and hit by those scums.

139
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,901
They beat you up so badly.

140
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,936
You even played a prank of me.

141
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,005
I thought you were really dead.

142
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,311
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,649
Stop rubbing your eyes.
You're already ugly enough.

144
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,620
And haven't I told you before

145
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,389
that even if you go to hell,

146
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,424
I would still go there and pursue you?

147
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,060
Don't struggle pointless anymore.

148
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,563
Stupid fool.

149
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,534
What does "struggle pointless" mean?

150
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,436
You meant, "struggle pointlessly," right?

151
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,938
What an idiot.

152
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,441
You always speak Chinese wrongly.
Are you really Chinese?

153
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,945
I think you should study more.

154
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,913
What are you laughing at?

155
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,550
I think you had that
pineapple-head hairstyle before

156
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,719
because you're too stupid.

157
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,455
That's why all your brain cells
went to your hair.

158
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,392
What's the matter?

159
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,565
Xiaoshun.

160
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,301
Haven't you done enough?

161
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,568
What else do you want?

162
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,238
Shancai, move.

163
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,140
Why are you here?

164
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,174
Don't worry.

165
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,777
I'm not here to do anything to you.

166
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,445
Are you here to apologize then?

167
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,113
No way.

168
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,015
Apologize?

169
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,118
I don't think I did you anything wrong.

170
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,056
Compared to the people
you've beaten up in Yingde University,

171
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,692
your wounds are nothing.

172
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,994
Yours pale in comparison.

173
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,599
How is that person now?

174
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,303
He transferred to a school in the South.

175
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,339
He's still alive.

176
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,474
Are you contented with what you did?

177
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,343
I am.

178
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,479
Even though using Shancai to get to you

179
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,914
wasn't an honorable thing to do,

180
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,617
I was able to teach you a lesson
on behalf of those who lived

181
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,219
under the shadow of your violence.

182
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,289
Even if I'm considered a villain
for doing so, I'm very happy.

183
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,224
You can go then.

184
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,892
You've already said
what you wanted to say.

185
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,929
I suggest you stop doing
these things from now on,

186
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,897
for your own good.

187
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,466
Shancai.

188
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,235
Actually, I came today
to apologize to you.

189
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,105
I wronged you terribly.

190
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,639
Please forgive me.

191
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,511
It's too late to apologize now.

192
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,547
You should leave.

193
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,787
Shancai.

194
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,356
If you're not the girl Daoming Si likes,

195
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,227
I really hope we could
still be friends someday.

196
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,397
The kind that really
understand each other.

197
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,301
I don't think it's possible now, though.

198
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,047
Shancai.

199
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,916
It's really such a pity.

200
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,923
<i>Xiaoshun.</i>

201
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,992
<i>Even though what you did</i>

202
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,027
<i>can be considered as one of the top three</i>

203
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,363
<i>most cruel things
I've encountered in my life,</i>

204
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,166
<i>Daoming Si also did something wrong.</i>

205
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,402
<i>I can actually understand how you feel.</i>

206
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,337
<i>However, at this moment,</i>

207
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,106
<i>I really can't forgive you.</i>

208
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,744
That guy is extraordinarily awkward.

209
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,548
I originally wanted to beat him up,

210
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,685
but now, I'm not mad anymore.

211
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,487
Never mind.

212
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,758
<i>Maybe one day,</i>

213
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,093
<i>when time already healed all the wounds,</i>

214
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,929
<i>we can open our hearts together</i>

215
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,430
<i>and be friends again.</i>

216
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,274
What do you think? Interesting, right?

217
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,642
Let me see.

218
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,812
This is so exaggerated.

219
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,447
How did they turn out this way?

220
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,815
It only took us ten minutes

221
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,384
to handle these guys.

222
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,320
They even cried and yelled for help.

223
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,323
They're so lame. They really suck.

224
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,291
Are you sure they were the ones
who beat you up, Ah Si?

225
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,127
That's right.
And he got beaten up so badly.

226
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,062
Shancai.

227
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,129
You...

228
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,799
Ah Si, who has never lost a fight,

229
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,300
willingly got beaten up.

230
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,835
That's right.

231
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,271
We initially thought
that he might become a convict

232
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,205
with his personality.

233
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,774
We never thought
that he would do that for you.

234
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,411
Though we may not understand it,

235
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,614
the power of love is really great.

236
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,083
I...

237
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,352
I had an examination earlier.

238
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,821
The doctor said I'm fine now.

239
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,723
I'm getting discharged today.

240
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,724
Bye.

241
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,828
Don't run away every time
we talk about this, okay?

242
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,898
Ah Si actually has good qualifications.

243
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,667
He has a few hundreds of millions
worth of assets.

244
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,204
It's a rare opportunity for you.

245
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,473
Consider it carefully, okay?

246
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,875
I don't love money that much.

247
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,944
What's so bad about money?

248
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,812
Think about your family, okay?

249
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,949
He's also very loyal.
He would never find another girl.

250
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,285
He's the best fighter
among the four of us.

251
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,320
That's not considered a good point.

252
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,156
You two should just marry each other.

253
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,525
We're already becoming
so impatient watching you guys.

254
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,862
Also,

255
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,398
when you're in danger,

256
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,868
he will definitely save you
no matter what happens.

257
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,370
I didn't ask him to come and save me.

258
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,139
And...

259
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,374
And...

260
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,510
And what?

261
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,582
And I think Daoming Si is like a dog.

262
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,350
A dog?

263
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,085
You said I'm like a dog?

264
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,088
<i>I'm such an idiot.</i>

265
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,023
<i>How can I say such a strange thing?</i>

266
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,340
Why are you laughing?

267
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,075
A dog.

268
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,623
Knock it off.

269
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,926
He's a male beast
that's full of testosterone.

270
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,028
If he unleashes his savagery,

271
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,797
then I would be in danger.

272
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,136
That's not possible.

273
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,938
He also has a lot of good points.

274
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,673
No matter what you say,

275
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,308
he's so rich.

276
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,743
Besides,

277
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,611
weren't you terribly moved

278
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,013
when he came to save you?

279
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,815
If he doesn't really like you,

280
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,985
Daoming Si wouldn't do that.

281
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>I really was very moved.</i>

282
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,667
<i>Daoming Si, whose pride
is higher than Mount Everest,</i>

283
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,136
<i>was humiliated that way because of me.</i>

284
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,809
This has nothing to do with that.

285
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,680
You don't like him,

286
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,048
but you're thinking of dating him.

287
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,849
That's so unconscientious.

288
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,487
Do you think I really like Daoming Si?

289
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:52,458
Does my heart beat fast
like it does with Huaze Lei?

290
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,494
You're so stupid.

291
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,830
If you don't like him,

292
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,465
then just break up with him.

293
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,133
No.

294
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,169
I can't sell myself out that way.

295
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,672
Just think of it as paying him back.

296
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:08,974
There are many ways to pay him back.

297
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,476
Should I give myself to him as payment?

298
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,711
How can I do that?

299
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,918
My head is going to explode.

300
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,621
Ah Si.

301
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,789
You're already discharged.

302
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,092
You're here.

303
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,164
Your ribs are connected back together.

304
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,468
Your ability to recover
is like that of a dog.

305
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,270
A dog?

306
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,939
Don't mind us.

307
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,408
Shancai must have meant
that you're as cute as a dog, okay?

308
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,610
That's right, that must be it.

309
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,413
Stop talking about dogs, okay?

310
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,547
Be careful or I'll kill you.

311
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,816
It seems you received
a serious blow this time.

312
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,218
You won't understand

313
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,787
how it feels
when a girl I risked my life to protect

314
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,988
said that I'm like a dog

315
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,724
with that expression.

316
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,593
She said that I'm like a dog.

317
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,895
That stupid girl.

318
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,531
I'm going to bed.

319
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,599
Good night.

320
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,070
Shancai is really stubborn, though.

321
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,739
Girls who emphasize that they're virgins
are especially troublesome

322
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,143
because they have a lot of
unrealistic notions about love.

323
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,411
I think so, too.

324
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,681
Or else, she wouldn't like
autistic people like Lei

325
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,816
to such an extent.

326
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,722
Love is that feeling
in that particular moment.

327
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,423
That's what makes you feel excited.

328
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,293
A feeling in a particular moment?

329
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,195
Is that so?

330
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,600
This is between Ah Si and Shancai.

331
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,235
Why are you involving me?

332
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,173
Didn't the magazine mention it?

333
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,476
That French guy who proposed to Jing
doesn't seem to have any other plans.

334
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,645
What do you plan to do with Jing?

335
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,581
What do you think?

336
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,250
Just wait and see.

337
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,985
God has His own plans.

338
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,620
You're such a strange person, too.

339
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,790
When you write the phrase
"in love" in Chinese,

340
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,926
it looks like "change love" instead.

341
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,127
I remember now.

342
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,062
In Chinese class
when Daoming Si was younger,

343
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,964
he always writes "in love"
as "change love."

344
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,401
There's nothing we can do now.

345
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,571
We can only push that idiot Shancai
to do as we wish bit by bit.

346
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:27,947
You know,

347
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,349
that red card doesn't seem to be from F4.

348
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,917
Then who is it from?

349
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,486
I never thought there would be
such a fearless person in our school.

350
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,121
How would I know?

351
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,891
Anyway, someone dared to use F4's name

352
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,392
to give Shancai a hard time.

353
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,927
She deserves it.

354
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,629
She was born with such an unlucky face.

355
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,797
She's so annoying.

356
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,866
This proves that we're not
the only ones who hate her.

357
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,834
Other people don't like her, too.

358
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,337
-Of course.
-You two are really such nags.

359
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,540
We're chatting among ourselves.

360
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:55,774
What does it have to do with you?

361
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,377
Who do you think you are?

362
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,846
You want to protect Shancai? Save it.

363
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,315
Will you die if you don't talk?

364
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,316
Bigmouths.

365
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,518
Who cares, froggy?

366
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,487
Did you call me a frog?
You're the one who's ugly.

367
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,489
You dare to call us ugly?

368
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,991
Look at yourself.

369
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,227
You only follow that poor girl Shancai
around all day.

370
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:19,365
You're an ugly toad
who lusts after a swan.

371
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,167
No, a dried goose.

372
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,235
Let me tell you.

373
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,703
I'm not afraid of you.

374
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,072
A good man doesn't fight with women.

375
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,008
Stop bullying Shancai.

376
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,377
If you don't, I'm warning you.

377
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,212
I won't let it go. I'm scary when I'm mad.

378
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,448
We want you to get mad. Bring it on.

379
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,850
Let's go. Come on.

380
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,253
I'm so envious of you.

381
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,222
You don't need to see that Shancai

382
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,957
and that big idiot earlier again.

383
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:45,925
That's right.

384
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm going to a jewelry appraisal class.

385
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,662
How nice.

386
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,864
That means you can shop
to your heart's content

387
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,798
in the US.

388
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:53,933
Of course.

389
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,302
Bring some designer bags
back for me, okay?

390
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,736
That depends on how nice you are to me.

391
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:04,710
Shancai.

392
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,046
Huaze Lei.

393
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,047
How are you?

394
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,082
How are your wounds?

395
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:11,884
They're all healed.

396
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,820
You've really suffered this time.

397
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:17,890
How about Daoming Si?

398
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,592
He was discharged last night.

399
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,927
He's on leave today, though.

400
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,762
His wounds haven't completely healed yet.

401
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,565
-He's out of the hospital?
-Yes.

402
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,033
That's great.

403
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,070
Shancai.

404
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,474
Even if we all grew up with him,

405
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,242
this is the first time
we've seen him like this.

406
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,244
We can tell

407
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,347
that he's really serious about you.

408
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,415
You can also tell, right?

409
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,184
Do you know what I mean?

410
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,689
Lei.

411
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,492
You two look quite happy.

412
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,794
You're bonding behind my back.

413
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,930
-You two--
-You're so lame.

414
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,965
Aren't you on leave today?

415
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,568
I feel weak from sleeping so much

416
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,236
so I went out.

417
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,539
Your wounds are not
completely healed yet, right?

418
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,475
Why are you moving around so much?

419
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,144
Someone said that my ability
to recover is like that of a dog.

420
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,147
I told you that's just a metaphor.

421
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,782
What an amazing metaphor.

422
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,051
Did I ask your opinion, Lei?

423
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,587
All right, I'll go ahead then.

424
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,255
By the way,

425
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,324
I haven't told her what you asked me to.

426
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,192
Just tell her yourself.

427
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,293
I'll go ahead.

428
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,528
-Bye.
-Bye.

429
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,296
What is it?

430
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,933
Do you know what day
the 31st of this month is?

431
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,070
No.

432
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,671
You don't know?

433
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,106
It's my birthday.

434
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,343
Happy birthday then.

435
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,113
They always throw a party for me
on that day each year.

436
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,915
So, you have to bring a gift.

437
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,183
A gift?

438
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,485
Who asks for a gift themselves?

439
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,287
I also don't have money to buy you a gift.

440
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,424
Stop mentioning money all the time, okay?

441
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,992
But that's a fact.

442
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,629
You can come without a gift then.

443
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,264
Just come.

444
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,733
It's your fault this happened to me.

445
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,535
Just treat it like your apology to me.

446
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,637
My mom will be there.

447
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,272
I want to introduce you to her.

448
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,540
Your mom?

449
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,176
My dad can't come because of his work.

450
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,011
Only my mom could come home.

451
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,481
You're introducing me to your mom?

452
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:23,549
My god.

453
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,951
Daoming Si almost died because of you?

454
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,987
That's like a plot
from a television series.

455
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,590
I'm not made of stone.

456
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,192
Of course, I was moved.

457
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:37,362
But I'm not really sure
how I feel about Daoming Si.

458
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,965
He always does whatever he wants.

459
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,467
He's so overbearing.

460
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,535
I feel so much pressure because of it.

461
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,673
What I'm most worried about now is that
he said he'll introduce me to his mom

462
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,942
on his birthday at the end of the month.

463
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,243
-Really?
-Yes.

464
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,412
When rich people like them

465
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,180
introduce their girlfriends to their mom,

466
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,315
it must be really formal.

467
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,717
I think it would be
just like an engagement.

468
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,121
"Mother.

469
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,489
This is Miss Shancai,

470
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,424
the girl who I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

471
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,127
-She's nice, right?"
-Xiaoyou, what are you talking about?

472
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,762
We're not even in a relationship.
Spending the rest of our lives together?

473
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,197
You're so cheesy.

474
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:13,999
Congratulations, Shancai.

475
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,901
You'll become part
of the high society soon.

476
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,903
Cut it out. Stop it.

477
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,339
You know it's not what you think.

478
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,343
What I'm most worried about now
is his birthday gift.

479
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,478
That's right. The gift.

480
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,248
Have you already prepared it?

481
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,251
I really want to lend you some money,

482
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,419
but it's almost the end of the month.

483
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,922
I've almost used up the money
I've earned from this job.

484
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,390
Me, too.

485
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,993
There's only 200 bucks left
from my allowance this month.

486
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,630
I really can't go there
empty-handed, though.

487
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,334
You can make it yourself.

488
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,503
It's the thought that counts.

489
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,005
After your shift,

490
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,407
you can bake some biscuits.
What do you think?

491
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,342
Biscuits?

492
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,851
I burned them all.

493
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,753
Who wants to eat these?

494
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,355
That's all right. You still have two
to three days before the month ends.

495
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,557
I'm sure you can do it.

496
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:15,527
It's okay. I can help you.

497
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:16,595
You can do it.

498
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:21,833
Is it enough?

499
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,302
Yes, these should be enough.

500
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,077
Xiaoyou, do you think these look like him?

501
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,879
Yes, they do.

502
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:34,947
How many did you make?

503
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,315
One, two, three, four...

504
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,883
Around five or six pieces.

505
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,851
-If we add these...
-Are they enough?

506
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,119
I'm not sure.

507
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,487
That's okay. I'll help you make more.

508
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,589
Thank you.

509
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,941
Why are you all here?

510
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,710
We came to pick you up.

511
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,212
Why are you all dressed that way?

512
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,616
It's the birthday party of Daoming Si,
the heir of the Daoming family.

513
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,251
What are you wearing under that jacket?

514
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,586
My mom's dress when she was younger.

515
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,490
Good thing you thought of
picking her up first

516
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,958
or it would've been so embarrassing.

517
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,894
That's right. Come up with a solution.

518
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,463
What solution?

519
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,431
How would we have time
to get her ready now?

520
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,634
Let's go to Ah Si's house.

521
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,534
Why?

522
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,436
Zhuang must have clothes in her room.

523
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,642
What do you want?

524
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,377
What are you doing?

525
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,679
Hey, what are you planning to do?

526
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,592
Good thing you thought of using
Zhuang's dresses in her room.

527
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,994
Is it okay to use them
without telling her, though?

528
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,396
It's fine, don't worry.

529
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,231
Zhuang likes Shancai, too.

530
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,366
She knows her mom better than we do.

531
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,802
I think she would understand.

532
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,005
Shancai, what do you think of this one?

533
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,141
Mrs. Daoming
seems to really like this brand.

534
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,475
I don't think it suits her.

535
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,978
Shancai would look old in that.

536
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,416
Get your makeup done.

537
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,451
-What do you think of this one?
-Which one?

538
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,419
This one.

539
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,721
I don't think it suits her.

540
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,956
I'm afraid Mrs. Daoming would think

541
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,025
that Shancai is not a decent girl
if she wears that.

542
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,828
<i>Why does the atmosphere feel so strange?</i>

543
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,930
<i>Why is Ximen and the others so nervous?</i>

544
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,699
<i>The Mrs. Daoming they're mentioning</i>

545
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,701
<i>is Daoming Si's mom, right?</i>

546
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,472
Hey, I can just wear my own clothes.

547
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,107
You don't have to go through
so much trouble.

548
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,543
I think this black cocktail dress
looks nice.

549
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,946
Didn't Zhuang had this made
when she was in senior high?

550
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,381
Will it fit Shancai?

551
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,217
Isn't Shancai one size smaller
than Zhuang?

552
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,519
Zhuang had this made
when she was in senior high.

553
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,587
It should fit Shancai then.

554
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,222
Excuse me, wait a moment.

555
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,758
Can I ask

556
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,260
why I should dress up so nicely?

557
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,663
Does this birthday party
have any special meaning?

558
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,767
We haven't really told you.

559
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,303
Ah Si's mom is a very scary person.

560
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:12,971
That's right.

561
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,806
She's really hard to get along with.

562
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,309
Especially the way she treats girls.

563
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:20,212
If she finds out Ah Si
brought you there...

564
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,781
Besides,

565
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,117
Ah Si is their family's successor.

566
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,052
Regarding your future...

567
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,553
"Future"?

568
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,956
Your future refers to your married life.

569
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,024
You're the first girl
he has ever brought home.

570
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,260
His mom would surely see you
as his fiancée.

571
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,895
Fiancée?

572
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,797
I'm sorry, I'm going home.

573
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,767
Hey, knock it off.

574
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,735
I'm just attending his birthday party.

575
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,670
If we do this, there would be
a huge misunderstanding.

576
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,671
I'm not going anymore.

577
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,909
This is how it is with children
of business owners.

578
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,979
Our parents sent us to Yingde University

579
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,048
in order to prevent us from meeting
ordinary girls outside the school.

580
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,985
It's the same with our families, too.

581
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,555
If my parents find out that I'm secretly
dating girls who don't go to Yingde,

582
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,557
there would definitely be
a family revolution.

583
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,461
Our marriages have long been set
by our families as business strategies.

584
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,097
Even more so for Ah Si.

585
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,033
He's the only successor
of the Daoming Corporation.

586
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,502
Just imagine how important his future is.

587
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,004
A marriage of convenience?

588
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,005
That's right.

589
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,807
Every one of us is the same.

590
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,775
Why do you think we love
having fun so much?

591
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,611
It's because, in the end,
for our family's image,

592
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,613
we might marry a girl we don't love.

593
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:30,816
With that thought,

594
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,584
we have to have fun
while we can now, of course.

595
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,952
So,

596
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,788
just pretend to be an heiress
for Ah Si's sake today.

597
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:38,523
Please.

598
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,292
You know how much Ah Si treasures you.

599
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,196
Though it's destined that you two
won't end up together in this life,

600
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,497
you have to do your best.

601
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,581
Why are you still standing here?

602
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:04,749
Go inside.

603
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,765
Why took you so long? Did you just arrive?

604
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,834
No, we've been here for a while.

605
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,172
You're dressed quite elegantly today.

606
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,641
Ximen and the others prepared it for me.

607
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,477
Ximen finally did something smart.

608
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,912
Whatever makes you happy.

609
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,681
You look like an heiress today.

610
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,750
A fake heiress.

611
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,253
A fake?

612
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,156
Happy birthday.

613
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,157
Thank you.

614
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,759
Ah Si, happy birthday.

615
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,960
Thanks.

616
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,864
It's so heavy. What is it?

617
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,099
Open it and see.

618
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,101
Why are you being so mysterious?

619
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,903
Hello, Young Master Daoming Si.

620
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,538
I'm a commissioner from Mazda.

621
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,872
Happy birthday.

622
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,007
On behalf of our company,

623
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,342
we're giving you an SUV
as your birthday gift.

624
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,044
The car is right outside.

625
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,512
You can see it when you go out.

626
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,748
Thanks.

627
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,815
Happy birthday.

628
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,585
This should cost at least one million.

629
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:16,688
How about you?

630
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,290
I...

631
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,524
Happy birthday.

632
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,227
What do you mean happy birthday?
Where's my gift?

633
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,862
I forgot.

634
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,930
You forgot?

635
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,599
You came to my birthday party
and forgot my gift?

636
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,435
I'm sorry. I just forgot.

637
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,004
If apologizing is enough,
what do we need the police for?

638
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,372
Stupid girl.

639
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,842
Never mind. I'll introduce you to my mom.

640
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,444
There's no need.

641
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,546
There are so many people here.
Your mom won't see me.

642
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,748
What are you afraid of? I'm not
introducing you as my fiancee.

643
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,283
-Let's go.
-Idiot. What are you saying?

644
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,585
I don't want to go.

645
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,420
-Just follow me.
-No.

646
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,455
Your mom doesn't know me. Let me go.

647
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:51,990
Are you kidding me? Let me go.

648
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,191
-Huaze Lei, help.
-Let's go.

649
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,693
No, it's so scary!

650
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,174
Are you okay?

651
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,977
What a huge commotion.

652
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,980
What's the matter?

653
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,485
What exactly happened?

654
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,320
Stand up. Ah Si's mom is here.

655
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,292
Mrs. Daoming, long time no see.

656
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,426
She is...

657
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,461
Meizuo.

658
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,162
It's not your turn to speak.

659
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,533
Miss.

660
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,935
May I ask who you are?

661
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,271
<i>She's Daoming Si's mom.</i>

662
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,773
<i>How terrifying.</i>

663
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,141
<i>How suffocating.</i>

664
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,178
I'm sorry, I...

665
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,881
I'm...

666
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,950
Ah Si.

667
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,885
Is she your friend?

668
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,353
Yes.

669
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,557
Please ask her to leave.

670
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,233
Ah Si.

671
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,435
Did you hear me?

672
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,536
Mom.

673
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,172
She's a girl who's important to me.

674
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,049
<i>Daoming Si, what are you saying?</i>

675
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,917
<i>How can you say that to your mom?</i>

676
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,819
<i>You must have lost your mind.</i>

677
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,187
<i>You said such a thing</i>

678
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,056
<i>in this situation.</i>

679
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,791
<i>Have you ever thought about my position?</i>

680
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,125
<i>My god.</i>

681
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:38,997
Ah Si.

682
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,068
Did you say that she's important to you?

683
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,670
Do you know what that means?

684
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,173
Yes, I do.

685
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,110
Please wait a moment.

686
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,212
Mrs. Daoming.

687
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,481
She's our classmate in Yingde.

688
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,650
She's our good friend as well.

689
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,086
That's right. She's definitely
not some indecent girl.

690
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,921
Shut up, you two.

691
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,889
Indecent?

692
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,892
I'm not asking you
about those vulgar things.

693
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,695
I just wanted to know if her background

694
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,498
is a match for the Daoming family.

695
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,266
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

696
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:20,605
Miss.

697
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:21,973
What's your name?

698
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:23,541
I...

699
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,676
My name is Shancai.

700
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,611
Miss Shancai.

701
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:30,615
What does your father do?

702
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,152
My father is...

703
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,253
Well...

704
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,689
Well...

705
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,558
The chairman of Muye Entertainment

706
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,161
is her father.

707
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,196
That's right.

708
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,099
This group has a golf course,

709
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,934
a forest bath, aromatherapy,

710
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,737
and various natural forest leisure
and entertainment facilities.

711
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,240
They got listed in the stock market
as a public company just recently.

712
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,274
Haven't you heard of them?

713
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,211
<i>Why are they telling lies
that can easily be found out?</i>

714
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,315
Is that so?

715
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,819
Then an heiress
with this kind of background

716
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,121
should at least know how to play
one or two musical instruments.

717
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,459
Which musical instruments do you know?

718
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,027
Can you play the piano?

719
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,232
Then let's ask her to play for us today

720
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,433
in this special occasion.

721
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,035
Mrs. Daoming,
she has matters to attend to,

722
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,104
so I think I would have to...

723
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,872
have to...

724
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,118
Don't be shy.

725
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,153
Play a song for us.

726
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,220
Mrs. Daoming, please don't do this.

727
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,356
If Miss Shancai did not have time
to prepare for this performance

728
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,225
and embarrasses herself,

729
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,327
isn't that too cruel?

730
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,464
A girl who wants to be
the daughter-in-law of the Daoming family

731
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,466
has to get into the social circle
sooner or later.

732
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,036
If she doesn't even have
the guts to do this,

733
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,138
what would she do then?

734
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,576
Please start, Miss Shancai.

735
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,116
<i>Daughter-in-law? Are you kidding?</i>

736
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,218
<i>Even if the sky falls down,
that's not going to happen.</i>

737
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,254
<i>This kind of woman is going
to be my mother-in-law?</i>

738
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,788
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>

739
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,033
What a joke.

740
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,288
A western philosopher once said,

741
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,624
"Women,

742
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,227
your gorgeous diamonds and shiny pearls

743
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,331
give you delusions of being a queen.

744
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,800
But you didn't notice

745
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,069
that there is only
the poison of pretension

746
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,570
and the aroma of arrogance.

747
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,206
The aroma which attracts
and also kills people.

748
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,308
Women,

749
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,978
when you pay homage to fortune,

750
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,246
cheer to fame,

751
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,182
and raise your arms to power,

752
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,552
please don't ask that bird
who used to sing in the past.

753
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,688
It has flown to a place no one knows

754
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,993
because its voice has dried out,

755
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,331
along with the doom of truth,
dignity, and pure souls."

756
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,684
Does the value of a person lie

757
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,020
in whether they can play the piano,

758
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,288
in which family they were born,

759
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,957
or what jewelry they are wearing?

760
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,193
What's so special about
knowing how to play the piano?

761
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:10,962
Let me tell you.

762
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,797
This is the only song I can play.

763
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,298
So what?

764
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,176
Happy birthday. I'll go now.

765
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:26,778
Wait.

766
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:29,580
Ah Si.

767
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,716
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

768
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,153
You don't know how to behave
according to your status.

769
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,689
You even lied and told me
that she's the daughter of a chairman.

770
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,324
You're way out of line.

771
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,494
It's not important to me whether or not
she's the daughter of a chairman.

772
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,462
Shut up!

773
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,398
Stop talking nonsense.

774
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,068
You're our only son.

775
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,604
You're so enamored
with such a low-class girl.

776
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,206
What should I tell your dad?

777
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,607
It was love at first sight for me.

778
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,942
I don't want other girls.

779
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,644
She's the one I like.

780
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,015
This joke has gone too far.

781
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,883
Mrs. Daoming, please don't do this.

782
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,884
We're not...

783
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,152
This is a family matter.

784
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,121
You don't have the right to interfere.

785
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:11,689
Leave!

786
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,024
Get out immediately.

787
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,128
You want to rebel?

788
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,429
Stop them!

789
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,301
Mrs. Daoming.

790
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,202
Get out of my way.

791
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,436
Shancai.

792
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,537
Your bag.

793
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,739
Stop right there.

794
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,208
I won't allow you to do this.

795
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,876
That's an order!

796
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:49,627
Thank you.

797
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,368
You were good at playing the piano.

798
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,270
How can you say that?

799
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,872
Your mom wanted me
to play the piano earlier

800
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,140
so that I'll embarrass myself.

801
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,041
Why didn't you say anything?

802
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,877
You also didn't help me out.

803
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,678
So I had to mess with the piano.

804
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:11,816
When I heard you messing with it,

805
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,252
I was actually quite happy.

806
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,923
Though I know my mom wants
to embarrass you,

807
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,393
I know you have a way
to embarrass my mom more.

808
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,719
