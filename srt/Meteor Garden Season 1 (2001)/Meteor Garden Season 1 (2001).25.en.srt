1
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,763
Why are you here?

2
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,565
I came to get my shoes.

3
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,902
I have them inside. Just a moment.

4
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,955
Here are your shoes.

5
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:02,956
Thank you.

6
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,525
Daoming Si wants to see you.

7
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,628
Really? I don't want to see him, though.

8
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,730
Why are you being stubborn
about meeting him?

9
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,031
Aren't you relatives?

10
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,267
He must not want to have
a poor relative like me.

11
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,237
And I don't want them to think
I'm trying to get on their good side.

12
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,039
Why are you saying that?

13
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,874
Maybe that's not what they're thinking.

14
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,178
What should I tell him if we meet?

15
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,182
What can I talk about with a spoiled brat?

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,652
Actually, that's not the case.

17
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,788
There are good people like Zhuang
and Mrs. Yu in the Daoming household.

18
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,256
They're really good.

19
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,894
I'm not interested in people
from the Daoming household.

20
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,796
And I don't want to see them.

21
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,998
So those things have nothing
to do with me.

22
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,801
I'll go ahead.

23
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,110
Hey.

24
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,745
I have something for you.

25
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,353
What is it?

26
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,655
Don't you think they look like lanterns?

27
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,123
Lanterns?

28
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,460
Didn't you say it's dark
in front of you last time?

29
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,663
Bye.

30
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,072
They look like lanterns?

31
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,407
He wants to take me out of the dark?

32
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,613
Wait.

33
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,453
Why did you...

34
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,424
What?

35
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,326
This one.

36
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,963
Why do you ask?

37
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:54,034
Honestly, I didn't really like you
when we first met.

38
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,736
I even find you a bit annoying.

39
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,573
However, what you did made me feel...

40
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,513
Because you told me last time

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,515
that it was dark in front of you.

42
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,687
Actually, I don't want to do something
on purpose to get on your good side.

43
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,491
I was just thinking

44
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,427
that I was once like you.
It was dark in front of me.

45
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,896
However, I can only rely on myself
to figure it all out.

46
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,000
If someone was willing to provide
some encouragement for me before,

47
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,370
maybe I'd be different now.

48
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,575
Wait here. Don't go.

49
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,111
Hold this for me. Wait.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,234
This is for you.

51
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,570
What is it?

52
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,706
This has a nice effect at night.

53
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,409
Treat it as a gift in return for yours.

54
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,711
I hope it can give you some light
in your darkness.

55
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,248
Thank you.

56
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,716
Thank you.

57
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,663
Some light?

58
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,004
Darn, why is it raining so hard?

59
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,378
Daoming Si's ex-fiancée.

60
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,512
Nouveau riche.

61
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,813
Who told you, you can call me that?

62
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,448
You also called me by a nickname.

63
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,617
Why are you wearing that? It looks weird.

64
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,653
What do you think I look like?

65
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,488
-What do you look like?
-What do I look like?

66
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,093
-A pervert?
-No, a detective.

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,795
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

68
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,931
Why are you dressed like a detective?

69
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,066
I'm on an important mission.

70
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,269
You're dressed like a detective.

71
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,004
-You're investigating something important.
-Yes.

72
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,239
What are you investigating then?

73
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,608
I'm telling you, a mysterious person
appeared lately.

74
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,310
He likes Shancai.

75
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,545
The most horrifying thing
is that he's Daoming Si's cousin.

76
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,048
What? Daoming Si's cousin?

77
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,650
There's Daoming Si and Huaze Lei.

78
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,218
Now there's Daoming Si's cousin.

79
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,653
That's why I'm investigating.

80
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,089
I'm trying to see if he wants
to break Ah Si and Shancai apart.

81
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,358
How are you investigating?
Did you hire a private investigator?

82
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,193
Private investigator? How boring.

83
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,795
I have to investigate personally,
of course.

84
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,764
No wonder you're dressed up this way.

85
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,900
-Can I join you then?
-Sure.

86
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,135
However, your outfit won't do.
You must disguise yourself.

87
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,438
I happen to have a wig. Try it on.

88
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,075
What do you think?

89
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,844
-No! It stinks and it's dirty!
-Try it on.

90
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,646
No, you can try it on yourself.

91
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,315
-Try it on.
-Gosh, it stinks.

92
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,084
Isn't that guy...

93
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,524
What a coincidence. Remember me?

94
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,260
From the blind date last time. Remember?

95
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,730
That's right. You went with another girl.

96
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,164
Then someone poured water on you two.

97
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,899
Then you both left angrily.

98
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,635
Yes, that guy who poured
the water, Qingyong,

99
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,137
do you know where he lives?

100
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,172
-What are you talking about?
-I'll tell you later.

101
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,441
Do you know his phone number or address?

102
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,611
It's not that I don't want to tell you.
I don't know that guy.

103
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,848
You don't know him? Didn't you attend
the blind date together?

104
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,316
I just hooked up with him?

105
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,784
Hooked up with him?

106
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,787
That day, he approached me
on my way to school.

107
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,655
He gave me NTD 10,000

108
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,391
to attend that blind date.

109
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,762
So you're saying you're not friends.
You don't know him at all.

110
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,865
Yes, I never saw him again after that day.

111
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,634
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

112
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,702
Bye.

113
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,805
Xiaozi, what is this about?
I didn't understand anything.

114
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,907
<i>Why are you looking for him?</i>

115
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,809
You want to threaten him, right?

116
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,211
Speak nicely.
What do you mean by "threaten"?

117
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,981
I just want to warn him
not to mess around with me.

118
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,984
That's called a threat, okay?

119
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,219
Whatever.

120
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,588
Where's Qingyong? Tell me, okay?

121
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,260
Young Master, is that the attitude
of someone making a request?

122
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,497
If you say, "Please think about it,"

123
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,367
I'd surely tell you everything.

124
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,871
However, I'm getting old.

125
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,374
My memory is deteriorating.

126
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,613
Please think about it, okay? You old fool.

127
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,484
Hey, Young Master,
you don't need to add "you old fool."

128
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,885
Come on.

129
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,490
I think the address didn't change.

130
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,624
It's just nearby.

131
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,059
I'll prepare the car for you.

132
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,594
No.

133
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,864
I don't want to ride a car.

134
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,187
Young Master, pay first.

135
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,726
-Young Master Meizuo, pay first.
-Okay.

136
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,663
Hey, get up. I'm going to sit down.

137
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,765
-Get up.
-How can you do that?

138
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,536
Let's go.

140
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,176
Ah Si, is it your first time
to ride a public bus too?

141
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,744
Yes.

142
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,047
You're so strange. You have a car.
Why are you taking a public bus?

143
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,449
It's fine to ride a taxi too.

144
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,518
I'm quite happy

145
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,021
that Young Master is willing
to live like ordinary citizens.

146
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,761
Meizuo.

147
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,331
I don't look different from the people
riding this bus, right?

148
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,934
Is there no difference?

149
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,669
You still don't quite belong.

150
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,739
I can already ride
the public bus like them.

151
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,174
What's the difference between us?

152
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,777
Ah Si, why are you suddenly interested
to live like ordinary people?

153
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,714
Is it because Mrs. Yu said Shancai
is more compatible with your cousin?

154
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,917
That was what I meant. That's right.

155
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,219
Mrs. Yu, that's so lame.

156
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,088
Only people who belong to the same world
can end up together.

157
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,025
That's what usually happens.

158
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,730
Why are you driving so slowly?
Are you stupid or something?

159
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,133
-Drive faster.
-Don't be noisy.

160
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,877
Shancai.

161
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,646
It's you again.

162
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,215
Why are you here?

163
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,549
Because I wanted to see you again.

164
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,084
What?

165
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,953
You're kidding, right?

166
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,254
Qing...

167
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,323
What did you say your name again?
Qing what?

168
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,391
My name is Qingyong.

169
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,897
Miss, try to remember people's names
no matter how slow your brain functions.

170
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,699
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,236
You're speaking
like Daoming Si now, though.

172
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,372
Don't always mention him, okay?

173
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,673
It's quite annoying.

174
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,442
You're right.

175
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,177
You didn't finish what you were saying.

176
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,012
Why did you come here?

177
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,086
Dump Daoming Si and date me.

178
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,156
I promise that I'll surely

179
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,759
be more considerate to you than him.

180
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,062
You're kidding, right?

181
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,697
I'm not kidding.

182
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,740
It's here. That's right.

183
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,575
Hey.

184
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,311
Young Master Ah Si,
I need to warn you first.

185
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,613
If you beat him up for no reason,

186
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,882
I won't just watch and do nothing.

187
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,592
-Don't press the doorbell that way.
-Gosh.

188
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,260
Isn't anybody home?

189
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,132
Young Master, we can come back
another day if no one's home. Let's go.

190
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,801
Are you going crazy again?

191
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,071
It's you, Mrs. Yu.

192
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,907
Young Master Qingyong.

193
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,210
-Young Master Qingyong, it's you.
-It's really you.

194
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,614
Mrs. Yu, how are you?
By the way, why did you come here today?

195
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,549
Long time no see. Hi.

196
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,917
I'm good.

197
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,287
Young Master Qingyong,
you're all grown up.

198
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,558
Mrs. Yu, you're saying
I've grown fatter, right?

199
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,661
You haven't changed at all.
You're still so honest.

200
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,063
That's your cousin Qingyong.

201
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,666
Young Master Qingyong, it's been so long.

202
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,369
You haven't kept in touch
with your relatives.

203
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,205
I've always been worried about you.

204
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:05,011
It looks like you're doing well,
though, right?

205
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,480
Mrs. Yu, don't call me "young master."

206
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,816
Gosh, that's what you are.

207
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,586
Stop putting on pretenses.
Aren't we very much alike?

208
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,488
Ouch!

209
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,191
Young Master Ah Si, what are you doing?

210
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,893
You're saying you don't have any
relationship with the Daoming household?

211
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,897
Didn't you say you're Daoming Si's cousin?

212
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,766
I lied.

213
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,935
I don't have any relationship with them.

214
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,704
You're not related at all?

215
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,840
Not at all.

216
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,476
Stop lying.

217
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,944
You think I'd believe that?

218
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,246
Miss, I'm telling the truth.

219
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,916
Really? Then who are you?

220
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,252
Who I am is not the point.

221
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,756
The point is that if I don't have any
relationship with the Daoming household,

222
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,225
will you give up on Daoming Si
and choose me?

223
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,926
No.

224
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,163
Miss, you answered too fast.

225
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,031
Do you want to reconsider?

226
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,101
Do you really like him that much?

227
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,573
I just don't want
to hurt Daoming Si again.

228
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,076
That's pity.

229
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,445
Pity?

230
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,647
Don't confuse love with pity.

231
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,015
You know what?

232
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,050
There's only a thin line between them.

233
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,954
"It seems he really likes me.

234
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,556
I think he's so pitiful.

235
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,591
If I don't like him,

236
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,594
will he be really sad?"

237
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:33,199
Are those the things
that always go through your mind?

238
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,300
Just a minute.

239
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,836
Don't act like you know everything.

240
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,671
You don't know anything at all.

241
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,073
Why are you judging my thoughts
and feelings?

242
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,409
I don't need to know
everything that happened.

243
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,012
I can tell from your actions.

244
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,347
If you really like someone,

245
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,249
even if there's a big obstacle
in front of you,

246
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,651
you'd still push forward.

247
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,953
And you...

248
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,456
You're just staying where you are.

249
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,090
You don't dare to take
a single step forward.

250
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,592
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

251
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,195
Why not?

252
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,997
Because I'm correct, right?

253
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,034
Of course not.

254
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,802
Then tell me.

255
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,405
Say you like him in front of me.

256
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,344
How lame. I'm leaving.

257
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,679
See?

258
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,048
That's the extent
of your feelings for him.

259
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,650
You don't even have the courage
to say you like him.

260
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,690
I like him.

261
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,628
Your voice is too soft. I can't hear you.

262
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,598
I like him.

263
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,734
There were so many times
that I wanted to tell him I like him,

264
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,870
but I couldn't say it.

265
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,807
I really like him.

266
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,009
It's not pity.

267
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,512
Don't say that about me.

268
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,339
Okay, fine.

269
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,845
Why are you suppressing your emotions?

270
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,500
<i>He's very mature.
He purposely tried to infuriate me</i>

271
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,971
<i>so that I can show my true emotions
in front of someone for the first time.</i>

272
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,706
Shancai.

273
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,008
Qinghe.

274
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,444
Why are your eyes so red?

275
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,914
Because I didn't sleep well last night.

276
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,383
I see. Let me tell you,

277
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,018
Xiaozi and I helped you
investigate things.

278
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,687
You and Xiaozi?

279
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,488
Investigate what?

280
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,123
I'm not sure what's going on either.

281
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,793
Just don't meet
Daoming Si's fake cousin again.

282
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,928
He and Daoming Si
are both not good people.

283
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,030
Nouveau riche.

284
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,066
-You're saying bad things behind my back.
-Shancai, help.

285
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,801
Don't treat him so badly.

286
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,671
Shancai, it seems things are getting
more and more interesting.

287
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,774
I missed a reunion
among relatives yesterday.

288
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,910
A reunion?

289
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,578
You already met your cousin?

290
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,180
He's not my cousin.

291
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,984
I just found out that the Qingyong
you met is a fake.

292
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,885
A fake?

293
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,588
You mean he's not your cousin?

294
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,056
Haven't I told you already?

295
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,058
I'm not Qingyong.

296
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,829
Hi, Daoming Si.

297
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,964
I'm your fake cousin.

298
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,401
Your mother gave me five million

299
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,470
to approach and seduce Shancai.

300
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,310
That means you're purposely breaking
Ah Si and Shancai up?

301
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,578
That's right.

302
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,980
That's what his mom instructed me to do.

303
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,849
I think that's what she wants.

304
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,584
That's ridiculous, Ah Si.

305
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,119
Your mom is still monitoring you.

306
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:15,955
Where are you going?

307
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,156
I'm going to reason with my mom.

308
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,724
There's no use reasoning
with your mom now.

309
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,060
-Cut the crap! Let go of my hand!
-Cut it out!

310
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,528
I'll show you if you don't let me go!

311
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,163
-Calm down!
-Idiot.

312
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,066
Will it kill you
if you calm down and talk?

313
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,067
You...

314
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,669
Are you stupid? Move away!

315
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,971
-Don't use violence.
-Shut up, all of you!

316
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,941
What exactly is going on? Tell me clearly!

317
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,547
One day,

318
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,350
two guys wearing suits came to see me.

319
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,819
They said there's something
they really need my help on.

320
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,055
I found out later

321
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,025
that Mrs. Daoming wants me
to seduce his son's girlfriend.

322
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,327
The reward is five million.

323
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,897
So you approached Shancai?

324
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,432
I see.

325
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,469
I get it now. So you hooked up
with that other person you don't know

326
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,404
to go on a blind date with Shancai
and Xiaozi, right?

327
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,740
Then why did you
reveal yourself so quickly?

328
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,943
I'm not sure either.

329
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,413
Since you already did that,

330
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,682
there's no use for you now. Scram!

331
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,250
You're really so immature.

332
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,852
Listen carefully.

333
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,221
The reason why I came here

334
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,290
is to refuse this contract.

335
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,462
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

336
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,934
Because I like her.

337
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,040
I was originally thinking

338
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,975
that if she's a stupid girl,

339
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,844
I'd dump her once I got her.

340
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,545
I'll earn money anyway.

341
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,317
That thought, however, slowly disappeared.

342
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,488
So I came here to tell you that.

343
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,090
Do you know what you're saying?

344
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,525
Be careful with your words.

345
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,761
Shancai, what do you think?

346
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,796
Do you want to settle things clearly
with this guy?

347
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,297
That's right, Shancai.

348
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,599
It's impossible for you to like

349
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,068
this kind of guy who accepts money
to do despicable things, right?

350
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,571
You're all so noisy.

351
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,641
What? What did you say?

352
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,676
You're all so noisy!

353
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,512
Who do you think you are?

354
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,413
What right do you have
to mess with my life?

355
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,016
Do you know who's the most angry
about all this?

356
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,451
It's me.

357
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,486
I don't care who likes me or not.

358
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,587
It has nothing to do with me.

359
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,122
Shancai, calm down.

360
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,891
How can I calm down?

361
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,627
What exactly is the purpose of doing

362
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,028
these lowly and despicable things?

363
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,864
You big, fat liar. Come here!

364
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,268
Shancai, where are you going?

365
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,336
You really wouldn't be with him, right?

366
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,907
Idiot.

367
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,652
<i>Even if I try to hide and escape,</i>

368
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,521
<i>it seems there's always
a shadow behind me.</i>

369
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,858
<i>Even if I run for my life
to go to a sunny place,</i>

370
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:10,196
<i>that shadow is still looming over me
without me realizing it.</i>

371
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,098
<i>The more I want to run, to get away</i>

372
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,266
<i>from that suffocating shadow,</i>

373
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,069
<i>the more my life falls into chaos.</i>

374
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,307
Where exactly are you going?

375
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,512
Can you let me punch you?

376
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,049
Wait, you won't really...

377
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,687
You asked me where I'm going?
Let me tell you. Take me to that woman.

378
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,557
You're still mad?

379
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,727
I can understand why you're mad,

380
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,630
but think about it. It's five million.

381
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,767
What would you do if it were you?

382
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,738
You can get five million if you get
a woman fall in love with you.

383
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,507
What would you do if it were you?

384
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,109
I'd refuse.

385
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,812
I definitely won't play
with people's feelings to earn money.

386
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,448
Money is money.
There's no difference how you get it.

387
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,952
You're just finding an excuse
that you yourself don't even believe.

388
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,388
Isn't that ridiculous? You big, fat liar.

389
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,758
Miss, this is a public bus.
Please be quiet, okay?

390
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,427
Aren't you a liar too?

391
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,597
You like him so much,
yet you pretend you don't.

392
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,166
How is that lying?

393
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,801
I just have some issues within myself.

394
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,238
I really don't get you.

395
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,140
Why would you like such a guy?

396
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,843
He has a big built,
but he thinks like a kid.

397
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,680
You know what?

398
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,248
I heard an explanation about it.

399
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,351
It is in the human DNA

400
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,288
that love would fade after three years.

401
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,257
When that time comes,
prepare to be a social worker

402
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,793
with that kind of personality.

403
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,663
I don't want to waste my energy on you.

404
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,932
Take me to see Daoming Si's mom.

405
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,036
You have to wait till the bus
gets to the station.

406
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,672
And it's quite far away.

407
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,640
I still have to ride my motorbike
to take you there.

408
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,474
<i>What am I going to say
to Daoming Si's mom?</i>

409
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,944
<i>She even used people to fool me.</i>

410
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,113
<i>What can I do about it?</i>

411
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,020
Why did you bring me here?

412
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,658
That guy's mom is in New York.

413
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,494
If you want to go there,
you must leave from here.

414
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:56,895
How can you do this?

415
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,166
I'm not lying.
His mom is really in New York.

416
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,971
You despicable jerk.

417
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,506
You fooled me again.

418
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,977
Don't always twist
my good intentions, okay?

419
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,748
I can see that you're still mad.

420
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,651
That's why I purposely took you
for a long ride on my motorbike.

421
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,187
I really hope that you can
compose your emotions

422
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,123
in such a long ride.

423
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,530
Honestly, I really don't get it.

424
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,570
I may have said I like you,

425
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,706
but I don't think that's love.

426
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,210
Because I think love
is just a hallucination.

427
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,780
Just like what I said,

428
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,417
it will fade in three years.

429
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,319
In that time, would we ask ourselves

430
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,188
if we really had it at all?

431
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:05,264
Actually, when I saw you
crying so sadly yesterday,

432
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,732
I was thinking...

433
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,805
that you will only be happy
if you're with me.

434
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,809
Make your life a little easier.

435
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,145
Make my life a little easier?

436
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,349
I'm not sure if I can do that.

437
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,856
What is your name, Qingyong?

438
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,595
I'm Yamen, 24 years old.

439
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,597
I'm a working student
taking up my master's degree.

440
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,567
I'm a very common, ordinary citizen.

441
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,637
I'm not lying this time.

442
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,977
It's probably because
of my life experiences.

443
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,847
And it's not hard to guess the thoughts

444
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,115
of innocent girls like you.

445
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,852
Just because of your life experiences?

446
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,720
I think you heard many things about me

447
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,655
from Daoming Si's mom.

448
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,757
In order to approach me,

449
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,127
you've already researched
about me, didn't you?

450
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,830
She didn't really provide
a lot of information about you.

451
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,500
My thoughts about you

452
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,735
are all based on my recent observations.

453
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,470
I'm not lying to you.

454
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,306
If I hadn't slowly gotten to know you,

455
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,708
I wouldn't go to your school

456
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,043
and reveal that I'm not Qingyong.

457
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,180
I also won't come clean
on my true identity.

458
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,450
Let me tell you.

459
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,452
I don't completely trust you yet.

460
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,755
That's fine. I won't lie to you anymore.

461
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,396
Listen to me.

462
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,036
Forget Daoming Si.

463
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,541
It might be impossible
for you to forget him now,

464
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,512
but you really don't need to force
yourself to cross that difficult bridge

465
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,115
just for a guy
that's not suitable for you.

466
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,518
You really don't need to do that.

467
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,454
Because you belong to this side with me.

468
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,290
You don't belong on their side.

469
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,595
Stay on this side
and don't cross that bridge.

470
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,233
You can make your life easier that way.

471
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,184
You're home.

472
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:40,686
I'll get going.

473
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,590
What's the matter?

474
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,260
Will love really fade?

475
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,163
Will it really not last forever?

476
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,669
You must answer those questions yourself.

477
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,806
Because I'm sure about my answer.

478
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,843
In this world, nothing is forever...

479
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,246
including love.

480
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,388
I don't want to break up again.

481
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,958
That just hurts us over and over again.

482
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,929
That pained look in Daoming Si's eyes

483
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,999
has kept me in tears even in my dreams.

484
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,237
I'm not crossing that bridge.

485
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,683
Goodbye.

486
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,679
Shancai!

487
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,081
Qinghe, good morning.

488
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,883
Yesterday, you and that fake cousin...

489
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,186
You are fine, right?

490
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,587
I'm fine.

491
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:56,922
He's a liar.

492
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:02,594
It's indeed horrible for him to take
Daoming Si's mom's money and lie to me.

493
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,997
However, lots of things happened
after I met him.

494
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,034
If I think about it carefully,
he's not really a bad person.

495
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,469
He's not a bad person by doing so?

496
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,804
What are you thinking?
I'm so worried sick about you.

497
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,408
I think because he's older than us,

498
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,210
nothing escapes him.

499
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,878
So, in front of him,

500
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,513
I don't need to hide my feelings.

501
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,315
I feel quite relaxed as a result.

502
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,752
Then you still plan
to be friends with him?

503
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,588
Shancai.

504
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,657
Hi, good morning.

505
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,426
Qinghe, our first class professor
is very strict.

506
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,061
We can't be late. Let's go.

507
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,098
-Bye.
-Shancai.

508
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,533
Shancai.

509
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,806
I called you all night yesterday.
Why didn't you take my calls?

510
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,910
Because I don't think
there's anything left to say anymore.

511
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,208
Why did you call and ask me to come here?

512
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,277
I have a flu. I feel sick.

513
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,480
So I called you to cook for me.

514
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,482
Do you think I'm your maid?

515
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,950
Why are you telling me to cook for you?

516
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,252
You're so noisy.

517
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,189
We're friends, at least.
Can't you help me?

518
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,192
Don't you have other friends?

519
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,128
No.

520
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,044
You cooked all these?

521
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,847
Yes, I learned them from my mom. Eat up.

522
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,584
It's been so long since I had
a home-cooked meal.

523
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,686
Doesn't your mom cook?

524
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,224
I don't have a mom.

525
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,192
You don't have a mom?

526
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,428
My mom ran away with a guy
a few years ago.

527
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,398
How about your dad?

528
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,701
I'm not sure either.

529
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,936
I just know that he's a sailor.

530
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,240
After my mom ran away with that guy,

531
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,674
he disappeared.

532
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,010
I'm not sure where he is now.

533
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,780
So you've been alone.

534
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,184
Miss, don't look at me with pity, okay?

535
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,087
This is common nowadays.

536
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,190
Isn't that Qingyong
in a similar situation?

537
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,194
Your dishes are delicious.

538
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,229
Are your parents the reason

539
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,098
why you don't believe in love?

540
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,900
More or less.

541
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,310
Everything is in order. I'll get going.

542
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,479
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, much better.

543
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,247
I'll go ahead then. Bye.

544
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,615
Wait.

545
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,650
What?

546
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,689
Have you ever been kissed?

547
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:19,424
What?

548
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,426
You have, right?

549
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:23,862
Then it's fine.

550
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,697
What do you want to do?

551
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,399
What are you doing?

552
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,600
Don't bite me.

553
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,702
What are you doing? Let me go!

554
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,037
Go away!

555
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,272
Let me go!

556
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,479
You're still thinking about him, right?

557
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,985
You said you're not crossing that bridge,

558
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,554
but you're still thinking about him.

559
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,326
Why are you doing this to me?

560
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,961
I don't like you that way.

561
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,363
Do you think that a man and a woman
would play video games

562
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,798
when they're alone together?

563
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,301
Don't be so nervous.

564
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,603
Relax a bit.

565
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,510
It's your decision to stay by my side.

566
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,982
You have to be sure of your decision.

567
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,636
<i>My heart and my body are in a tug of war.</i>

568
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,039
<i>It seems my heart is losing its balance.</i>

569
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,689
I'm sorry to ask you to come out.

570
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:01,059
It's fine. I'm free anyway.
What's the matter?

571
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,531
I wanted to talk to you about Shancai.

572
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,403
I suddenly remembered,
there's something I forgot to tell you.

573
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,974
Go and find a good man.

574
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,612
There's no hope for us.

575
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,313
Don't keep waiting for me.

576
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,050
Find a man who cares for you,

577
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,818
protects you, and loves you.

578
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,389
From the beginning,

579
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,759
she's the only one for me.

580
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,930
What a relief.

581
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,500
I was thinking, what would I do

582
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,836
if you ask me to be your girlfriend today.

583
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,706
You won't do that again, right?

584
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,143
Actually, we've always been good friends.

585
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,778
I know.

586
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,814
I'm your good friend

587
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,916
but Shancai is the one you love.

588
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,521
This is what we'll do. Let's make a deal.

589
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,790
If there's a next life,
you must choose me.

590
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,625
Are you stupid?

591
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,160
You're so silly.

592
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,968
<i>He's smiling.</i>

593
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:20,038
<i>It feels like it's been a long time
since I last saw him smile.</i>

594
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,474
<i>I...</i>

595
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,110
<i>I can't believe I'm crying
over such a small thing.</i>

596
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,812
<i>I'm really such an idiot.</i>

597
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,059
<i>I believe</i>

598
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,161
<i>Xiaozi would surely be able
to make him happy.</i>

599
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,841
Then what are you planning to do?

600
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,476
Just silently protect Shancai?

601
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,844
Silently protect her?

602
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,013
That fake cousin of yours

603
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,615
keeps on coming between the two of you.

604
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,684
And there's the problem
with Qinghe and Xiaoyou's families.

605
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,188
There are so many huge obstacles.

606
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,389
I'm not afraid.

607
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,626
I'm not the least bit afraid
of the things you mentioned.

608
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,162
The only obstacle...

609
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,900
is Shancai's feelings.

610
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,204
However, I don't want to think
that much anymore.

611
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,773
No matter who she likes...

612
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,912
I'd do everything to pursue her.

613
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,750
Ah Si, you can do it.

614
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,351
I'll support you.

615
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,523
Nobody can stop me

616
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,227
from pursuing her.

617
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,938
Didn't our manager say
that you're not coming today?

618
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,905
Yes.

619
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,974
Originally, I wanted to take a leave
because I'm sick.

620
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,410
I feel better after resting
this morning, though.

621
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:08,780
Thanks.

622
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,149
Hello.

623
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,684
-It's you.
-That's right.

624
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,918
Long time no see.

625
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,255
I came here twice, and you weren't here.
I was so disappointed.

626
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,090
Sorry. What do you want to order?

627
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,092
I'll wait till you get off work.
Let's go to your place.

628
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,261
-I can't.
-Why? You already have a date?

629
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,295
No.

630
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,763
Liar.

631
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,432
Could it be that you have
a girlfriend now?

632
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,036
That's right.

633
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,471
Didn't you tell me before

634
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,573
that you won't get serious with any girl?

635
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,814
Yamen, someone over there
keeps staring at you.

636
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,570
Do you have a light?

637
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,972
I don't smoke.

638
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,380
How did you find this place?

639
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,751
I forced my mom's men to tell me.

640
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,353
That was easy.

641
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,555
Why are you looking for me?

642
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,328
Do you like Shancai?

643
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,501
With that calm expression,

644
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,136
I was wondering
what you were going to say.

645
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,077
Let me tell you honestly.

646
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm not sure what I'm feeling either,

647
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,982
but I know...

648
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,852
she's the first girl that made me think
of settling down.

649
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,724
Were you surprised?

650
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,527
Actually...

651
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,797
no matter what answer you give me,

652
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,666
I don't care.

653
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,203
Then why are you here?

654
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,839
She belongs with me.

655
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,443
I just came to tell you that.

656
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,546
Goodbye.

657
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,847
Daoming Si.

658
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,852
You're relentlessly

659
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,522
pursuing a girl
that doesn't belong with you.

660
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,325
Don't you feel embarrassed?

661
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,028
Just mind your own business.

662
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,781
<i>Since that day, I've lost my bearings.</i>

663
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,417
<i>When I'm alone,</i>

664
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,919
<i>I feel like I'm going to have
a breakdown anytime.</i>

665
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,602
If you're here to taunt me,
please go away.

666
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,681
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,084
I was out of line before.

668
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,453
Because the women around me

669
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,455
are all frivolous and easy.

670
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,757
So...

671
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,872
There are many things
I don't care about in this world.

672
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,743
I don't care about relationships,

673
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,578
including family and love.

674
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,181
However, I realized I've changed lately.

675
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:05,817
I became happy.

676
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,419
I'm happy every day.

677
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,028
I think it started after I met you.

678
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,335
Please don't touch me again.

679
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,537
I don't feel that way about you.

680
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,041
Okay, I promise you,

681
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,776
we'll do it your way.

682
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,683
Are you busy later?

683
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,652
I'm going to work.

684
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,289
I'll take you there.

685
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:55,967
Shancai.

686
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,269
Qinghe.

687
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:00,538
Who is he?

688
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:02,273
He's Yamen. This is Qinghe.

689
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,174
Hi.

690
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,742
Yamen?

691
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,878
Where are you going?

692
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,179
I'm going to work.

693
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:09,614
I'm taking her there.

694
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,384
Qinghe?

695
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,253
Nothing.

696
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,654
I'll get going then. Bye.

697
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:17,989
Bye.

698
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,512
