1
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,655
Why are you so moody?

2
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,490
What's the matter?
Weren't you just fine earlier?

3
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,494
It must be because my mom is back, right?

4
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,297
Why won't you tell me?

5
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,434
Why won't you tell me what happened
when you met my mom last night?

6
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,071
She must have said
a lot bad things, right?

7
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,708
Why won't you tell me anything?

8
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,943
What exactly happened last night? Tell me.

9
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,678
It's not you.

10
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,580
It's my pride.

11
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,515
Am I that unreliable to you?

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,086
That's not it. It's just that I...

13
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,654
Just what?

14
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,656
I just don't want you to move out.

15
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,293
Who am I moving out for?
I'm doing it for you.

16
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,628
I know.

17
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,663
I know you're doing it for me.

18
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,465
Then why are you acting this way? I--

19
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,200
Because I don't want you to protect me.

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,438
If I let you protect me, our relationship
won't be balanced anymore.

21
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,340
I don't want that to happen.

22
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,011
I know you might not find me cute
when I say this,

23
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,080
but I don't want our relationship
to turn out like that.

24
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,816
You're really not cute at all.

25
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,321
I don't know what to do anymore.

26
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,460
Why can't you be like other girls
and be a bit more delicate?

27
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,962
Rely on me more.

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,466
Never mind.

29
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,169
I love you for who you are.

30
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,508
Actually, I understand your intentions.

31
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,010
And I'm very happy about it.

32
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,679
So...

33
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,647
So what?

34
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,445
Hey, Dad. How are you?

35
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,848
No way!

36
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,850
Why did we suddenly go bankrupt?

37
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,252
Aren't we nouveau riche?

38
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,857
Why would we have insufficient funds?
It wasn't easy for us to become rich.

39
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,095
I won't lose anything because of it.

40
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,498
Besides, that's how people greet
each other overseas.

41
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,102
It's fine even if girls initiate, right?

42
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,572
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,373
Nothing, just kissing...

44
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,543
You won't lose anything because of it.

45
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,079
That's how people greet
each other overseas.

46
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,314
You mean kissing, right?

47
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,684
Why are you eavesdropping?
You're really mean.

48
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,054
Shancai, people don't usually
talk to themselves, right?

49
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,056
You kissed Ah Si.

50
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,792
It's not a big deal.

51
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,228
That's how people greet
each other overseas.

52
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,597
That's how people greet
each other overseas?

53
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,799
Then greet me the same way.

54
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,601
Hi.

55
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,169
That's not what you said earlier.

56
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,937
Come on, hurry.

57
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,939
What are you doing, Huaze Lei?

58
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,176
See? You can't kiss me, right?

59
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,078
So you voluntarily kissed Ah Si,

60
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,747
because your relationship
with him is something else now.

61
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,482
What are you talking about?

62
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,286
<i>I heard that Ah Si's mother chased you out
last night.</i>

63
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,958
Yes. She tried to chase me out
but Aunt Yu stopped her.

64
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,227
She was threatening suicide.

65
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:59,432
Daoming Si's mom couldn't handle her.
So in the end, I wasn't chased out.

66
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,004
Aunt Yu is going hostile
towards Ah Si's mother for you, too?

67
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,106
I guess so.

68
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,777
-Did something happen around you?
-What do you mean?

69
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,180
-Nothing.
-That's impossible.

70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,484
From what I know about Ah Si's mom,
she would have taken some actions by now.

71
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,554
Something that's aimed
at the people around you.

72
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,824
Your friend Xiaoyou or...

73
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,392
How is that possible?

74
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,727
How could she do something
to innocent people?

75
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,596
Besides, what could she do to them?

76
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,031
Shancai.

77
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,066
I'm not scaring you.

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:38,405
The moment you decided to be with Ah Si,
you're doomed to abandon many things.

79
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,585
Hello, Xiaoyou, it's me.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,487
Are you all right?

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,926
What do you mean? I know what?

82
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,796
I don't know. What's the matter?

83
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,680
Ma'am.

84
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,117
How is it going?

85
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,621
Very well. It only took about three hours.

86
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,857
Miss Shancai will receive the message
in no time.

87
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,060
She will be here to negotiate
with you in about one hour.

88
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,529
It's not her place to negotiate with me.

89
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,265
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

90
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,137
That's okay. Thank you for your efforts.

91
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,573
Tell the servants
to pour me a glass of water.

92
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,309
I'll stay and wait here for my guest.

93
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,116
When did you start eating ice cream?

94
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,153
Don't just drink coffee all the time.
Want some?

95
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,191
Why did you meet us here?
Aren't you going to meet Shancai?

96
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,794
Hey, did your mom do something to Shancai?

97
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,564
Hey, don't pretend it's none
of your business, okay?

98
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,401
I have something to tell you.

99
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,636
What is it?
You finally decided to move out?

100
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,040
There's something about you two.

101
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,742
About us?

102
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,944
What could it be?

103
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,246
I'm telling you,

104
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,751
you should stop messing around with girls.

105
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,387
Isn't it time to settle down
and get in a serious relationship?

106
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,890
Are you having a fever?

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,793
We've been in more relationships
than the fights you've been in.

108
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,328
You don't get it.

109
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,364
Is there anything you know that we don't?

110
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,368
You think you know more
and are more experienced than me.

111
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,304
But you've never tasted the real thing.

112
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,709
You said that
because something good happened to you.

113
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,077
Do you want to share it with us?

114
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,847
It's more than something good.

115
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,784
Today is probably the best day of my life.

116
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,221
-Come on, what happened?
-Yeah.

117
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,327
I can't tell you.

118
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,763
I'm afraid that the feeling will disappear
if I tell you.

119
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,566
Did you meet us here just to show off?

120
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,301
What a jerk.

121
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,407
<i>I don't know how far I've run.</i>

122
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,075
<i>There's only silence in my head.</i>

123
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,044
<i>All I hear is my heart pounding in my ear.</i>

124
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,880
<i>I kissed Daoming Si three hours ago.</i>

125
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,950
<i>Now, I'm running on a different path.</i>

126
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,090
Ma'am, Shancai is here.

127
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:44,991
Really?

128
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,261
She's faster than I thought.

129
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,631
Get those phone numbers ready for me.

130
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,933
Done. They're all here.

131
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,304
Good. You can leave now.

132
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,739
Yes.

133
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,188
Excuse me.

134
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,490
Welcome.

135
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,325
Come here and take your seat.

136
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,961
That's fine.
I'll leave right after we finish talking.

137
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,197
Very good.

138
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,599
I don't like wasting time either.

139
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,169
Then let's go straight to the point.

140
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:34,340
I think you understand
the current situation very well,

141
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,142
so I won't explain it to you anymore.

142
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,379
If I didn't understand,
I wouldn't show up here.

143
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,849
I will accept all your conditions.

144
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,418
Please stop your shameless act.

145
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,721
Very good.

146
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,598
Hello.

147
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,667
Is this President Lin?

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,001
I'm Daoming Feng.

149
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,171
The thing we talked about before.

150
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,573
Yes.

151
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,375
Yes, please cancel it.

152
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,645
That employee transferring
in your company.

153
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:14,981
Thank you.

154
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,456
Hello.

155
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,426
It's about the financial problem
of Qingchi Corporation.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,498
Yes, please approve their application.

157
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,533
That's correct.

158
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,337
I'm sorry for troubling you.

159
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,039
Okay. Thank you.

160
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,678
All right.

161
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,947
Now everything has been settled.

162
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,984
As for my conditions...

163
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,386
I'll leave this house right now,

164
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:58,024
and I won't be associated
with Daoming Si in any way.

165
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,792
Are you satisfied now?

166
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,095
Yes.

167
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,631
Do you have anything else to say?

168
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,634
You're despicable.

169
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,738
Maybe in business,
you're the richest and the best one.

170
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,575
But in this world, there are things
that are much more important than money.

171
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,979
You'll only stomp on those precious things
with money and power.

172
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,684
You're worse than a mouse in the sewage.
You're the worst human being.

173
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,655
Precious things?

174
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,858
What could those precious things be?

175
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,628
Are you trying to say love and friendship?

176
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,532
I don't want to waste my precious time.

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,901
You can leave now.

178
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,410
You're beyond saving.

179
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,645
Do whatever you want to do.

180
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,516
No matter how hard you hit me,
I will never yield to you.

181
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,352
If you do something to my friends again,

182
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,221
I'll never forgive you.

183
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,403
Shancai? Stop the car!

184
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,812
Why are you standing in the rain?
Get in the car with me.

185
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,351
I have something to tell you.

186
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,158
I can't be with you anymore.

187
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,198
<i>In the dark night,
the cold rain is pouring down.</i>

188
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,535
<i>Maybe only in this heavy rain,
can I say the words "break up."</i>

189
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,809
It's almost eight o'clock
and Shancai hasn't come home yet.

190
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,078
Who knows where she is hanging around
this time.

191
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,383
All youngsters are like this.
They have no sense of responsibility.

192
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,152
Hey, stop spacing out.

193
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,921
Get everything done before eight o'clock.
Got it?

194
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,659
Aunt Yu, Shancai came back here
this afternoon.

195
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,396
She came back this afternoon?
And then she left again?

196
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,433
She seemed like she was in a hurry.

197
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,968
In a hurry for what?

198
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:28,041
She should be
at home doing chores right now.

199
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,779
Where is madam?

200
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,716
-Madam just left to New York.
-What?

201
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,961
AUNT YU

202
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,777
<i>Aunt Yu, my mom and dad decided
to move back.</i>

203
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,380
<i>They wanted me
to come back home to reunite.</i>

204
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,149
<i>You must understand how badly
I want to go back,</i>

205
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,918
<i>and how much I miss my family.</i>

206
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,988
<i>I'm so selfish
that I didn't even say goodbye.</i>

207
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,457
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

208
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,361
<i>Thank you for taking care of me.
I'll never forget you.</i>

209
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,163
<i>You treated me
like your own granddaughter.</i>

210
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,366
<i>I thank you from my heart.</i>

211
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,567
<i>Shancai.</i>

212
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,842
What are you talking about?

213
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,945
I'll leave your house today.

214
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,381
Wait.

215
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,217
How did it turn out like this?

216
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,320
Didn't we just hang out earlier today?

217
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,522
Don't you remember that?

218
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,226
You said you wanted to have
an equal relationship with me.

219
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,262
You told me not to move out.

220
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,997
Didn't you?

221
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,767
I did.

222
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,369
You told me not to protect you,

223
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,372
so you could break up with me.

224
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:12,779
No, what I said is true.
I said that to build our relationship.

225
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,147
Why?

226
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,850
Why did it turn out like this? Tell me!

227
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,054
You just told me this all of a sudden.

228
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,023
How could I accept that?

229
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:25,691
Tell me!

230
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,127
Daoming Si.

231
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,098
Your mom said that if I refused
to break up with you,

232
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,667
she would put Xiaoyou's
and Qinghe's dads out of employment.

233
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,469
Daoming Si.

234
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,771
I've made up my mind.

235
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,308
I won't be associated
with the Daoming Family in any way.

236
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,778
I've made up my mind.

237
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,749
I won't be with you anymore.

238
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,189
I can't accept this.

239
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,859
Just because of this?

240
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,229
How could you do that?

241
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,432
Shancai.

242
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,809
Have you ever loved me?

243
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,113
If my home

244
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,083
and my mom...

245
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,986
are not considered in this question,

246
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,624
have you ever loved me?

247
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,711
I've never loved you.

248
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,415
If I loved you,
I wouldn't leave like this.

249
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:18,938
<i>There were many times
when I felt I was in love with Daoming Si.</i>

250
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,921
If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.

251
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,563
Because I like you.

252
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,300
I really like you.

253
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,670
Don't do this.

254
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,544
If I die today,

255
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,014
don't get upset.

256
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,787
Don't cry.

257
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,458
Daoming Si.

258
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,061
Daoming Si, don't die.

259
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,264
I don't want you to die.

260
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,035
<i>You're driving me crazy.</i>

261
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,838
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

262
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,006
<i>Call me now.</i>

263
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,144
<i>Shancai.</i>

264
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,315
<i>Shancai.</i>

265
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,441
You.

266
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,746
Do I need a reason

267
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,482
to give a gift to the girl I love?

268
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,755
<i>My heart hurts like hell.</i>

269
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,694
<i>I'm almost numb.</i>

270
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,099
<i>Aside from my heart
that feels like it's being torn apart,</i>

271
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,869
<i>I feel nothing.</i>

272
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,373
<i>Everything vanished into the void.</i>

273
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,321
You've broken too many hot girl's heart.
God is punishing you.

274
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,789
Stop your nonsense.

275
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,691
Hey, why isn't Ah Si here?

276
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,526
Yeah, why didn't I see him today?

277
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,129
I guess he did something good
with Shancai.

278
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,565
He's too happy to sleep
so he's in bed now.

279
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:36,769
I met him yesterday and he was so smug.
He even said Ximen and I knew nothing.

280
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:37,803
What does that mean?

281
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,106
It means things are going well
between Ah Si and Shancai.

282
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,006
Hey!

283
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,075
Do you know where Shancai is?

284
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,311
-What do you mean by "where Shancai is"?
-She's missing.

285
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,512
I can't find her anywhere.

286
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,514
And she even submitted
a dropout request to the school.

287
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,851
Shancai is going to dropout?
How is that possible?

288
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,953
Ximen, call Ah Si now.

289
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,154
I just called him.

290
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,290
His servant said Shancai
packed her things up and left last night.

291
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,227
The call didn't get through.

292
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,598
Hi, Ah Si, this is Ximen.
We heard Shancai dropped out.

293
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,999
We think there's something wrong.

294
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,101
Call me when you get this message.

295
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,703
He didn't pick up?

296
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,906
Let's go to Ah Si's house
and check it out.

297
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,777
Yes. If something happened to Shancai,
Ah Si won't just sit there doing nothing.

298
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,013
Wait for me. I'm going with you.

299
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,234
You stupid kid.

300
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,470
Why are you lying to Young Master?

301
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,806
You're crying like...

302
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,513
If you love Young Master, say it.

303
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,117
Young Master won't leave you
suffering alone.

304
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,253
He will share the burden with you.

305
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,824
Look at you...

306
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,593
We don't know what to do with you.

307
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,629
I'm sorry, Aunt Yu.

308
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,766
I have my principles.

309
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,203
I will choose my own way to live.

310
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:22,141
I get weak when other people protect me.

311
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:28,047
The more gently you take care of me,
the more courage I'll lose.

312
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,584
I can't let this happen.

313
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,986
I'm not a flower growing in a greenhouse.

314
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,322
I'm Shancai, the weed.

315
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,994
If you choose this path,

316
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,764
take it. This is your salary.

317
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,867
No, I can't take it.

318
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,470
You let me stay here,
and gave me food and a place to live.

319
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,139
How could I take your money?

320
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,046
Shancai.

321
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,349
<i>Shancai.</i>

322
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,722
<i>Ah Si, did you hear about it?</i>

323
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,591
Shancai dropped out.

324
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,127
You just let her go?
And you won't chase her back?

325
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,329
Why aren't you talking?

326
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,166
Maybe Shancai will never come back
after this!

327
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,234
Ah Si.

328
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,003
Are you really going
to break up with her like this?

329
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,140
Shut up.

330
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,775
Get out, all of you.

331
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,145
How could you tell us to shut up?

332
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,280
You go find her right now.

333
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,116
It's not too late if you go now,
before Shancai dies on the street.

334
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,819
I told you to get out.
Didn't you hear that?

335
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,921
Ah Si, stop it.

336
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,993
Hey! Ah Si, you're going to kill him.

337
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,708
Get out of my house right now.

338
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,852
Daoming Si is a jerk.
He left Shancai alone and hit me.

339
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,887
Ah Si has gone back to who he was before.

340
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,857
Yeah. Did you see the look on his face?

341
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,594
Every time that look appears on his face,
he's really angry about something.

342
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,463
He's like a beast.

343
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,032
What I find scarier is...

344
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,070
besides anger,
there is hatred in Ah Si's eyes.

345
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,874
He will be scarier than a fierce beast,

346
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,077
because he's more sensitive,
and more dangerous.

347
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,881
He could even die dragging everything
with him.

348
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,585
Young Master Huaze is right.

349
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,486
Aunt Yu.

350
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,922
This is what I'm worried about the most.

351
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:28,360
Young Master Ah Si grew up lonely.

352
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,130
He has never been surrounded by love.

353
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,465
This is his first time.

354
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,968
He treasured it so much.

355
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,338
But he couldn't take control of it,

356
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:45,911
so he can't accept that Miss Shancai left.

357
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,714
Ah Si has never taken
a step back on anything.

358
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,183
He doesn't know what losing is.

359
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,154
In his mind, he either wants
or doesn't want something.

360
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,291
He's never been tortured like this
before he pursued Shancai.

361
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:05,531
So don't annoy Ah Si these days, okay?
Or you will be the target of his anger.

362
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,000
This is his own problem.

363
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,768
He thinks he's special
because he broke up?

364
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,404
All he does is hit people.
All he thinks is how painful he is.

365
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:16,075
Why isn't he wondering that Shancai left?

366
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,376
There must be a reason.

367
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,078
Hey, Qinghe.

368
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,346
Do you know something so you say this?

369
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,254
I don't know.

370
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,256
All I know is...

371
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,127
Shancai isn't someone who only thinks
about herself.

372
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,633
<i>You mean...</i>

373
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,504
Because of our family affairs,

374
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,607
Shancai left Daoming Si.

375
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,948
Why would she do that every time?

376
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:59,218
She puts everyone's burden
on her shoulders.

377
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,619
She won't talk to anyone.

378
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,592
I couldn't believe Daoming Si's mom
would go this far.

379
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,661
Qinghe, does Daoming Si know about this?

380
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:13,699
Daoming Si?
That son of a bitch, idiot, big pig head.

381
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,734
He won't even go find Shancai.

382
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,036
I shouldn't have let Shancai be
with him if I knew this before.

383
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,905
-If I were him, I would give Shancai--
-Qinghe.

384
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,115
Where did Shancai go?

385
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,720
She just went away without telling anyone.

386
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,557
She must be suffering
on her own right now.

387
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,999
We can't help her at all.

388
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,723
<i>Oh, you're Shancai.</i>

389
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,992
I heard it from your mom

390
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,729
that you're the girlfriend
of the Young Master from that rich family.

391
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,967
No offense, but your mom said,
when you get married,

392
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,937
your family will have anything you want.

393
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,744
Mom.

394
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,883
Shancai!

395
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,986
You're here.

396
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,755
Why are you here? Mom missed you so much.

397
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,924
Shancai, dad missed you so much.

398
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,827
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

399
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,702
Are you tired?

400
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,803
Here.

401
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,707
We had no place to live,
so we rented a room.

402
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,276
-This is our landlady.
-Oh, hi.

403
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,111
Hey, this is my daughter.

404
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,046
-Your daughter?
-Yeah.

405
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:11,917
Thank you, ma'am. Here, come in.

406
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,591
Shancai, why did you suddenly
visit us here in the fishing village?

407
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,093
Don't you have a class?

408
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,029
-You shocked mom and dad.
-That's right.

409
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,298
We have a few days off
because of the school anniversary.

410
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh, that's great.

411
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,704
Shancai, you've lived by yourself
for a while now.

412
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,339
Is everything okay?

413
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,376
Yeah, mom missed you so much.
You can ask your dad.

414
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,278
I missed you so much that I would say,

415
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,079
"Do you take good care of yourself?"

416
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,748
"Is everything at school okay?"

417
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,850
I'm fine.

418
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,418
-Mom, dad.
-Yeah.

419
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,787
Can I stay here
while the school days are off?

420
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,989
-Of course.
-Sure.

421
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,793
You can stay here until the school starts,
and then you can go back.

422
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,962
That's okay. You can stay here.

423
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,464
Who's there?

424
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:05,837
I'm sorry for disturbing you.
I saw that your daughter is visiting you.

425
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:10,575
I made a list of unpaid water bills,
electricity bills, rent, and gas bills.

426
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,644
Please take a look.

427
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,447
My daughter is back.

428
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,583
Over NTD 80,000?

429
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,920
Yeah, Yue, I didn't add the interest.

430
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,223
Doesn't your daughter
have a rich boyfriend?

431
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,493
He can pay the bills. Just pay them up.

432
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:31,430
That's okay,
you can talk about this first.

433
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,765
You can go find me after you decide,
I'm leaving now.

434
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,501
Yeah, there will be no problem.

435
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,402
Yeah.

436
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,605
Shancai. Now everyone thinks...

437
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,476
-Mom and dad are doing nothing here.
-Yeah.

438
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,080
Your dad can't be a fisher.

439
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:52,017
When he's on a boat,
he gets sick so bad that he vomits.

440
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,286
Other people have to take care of him.

441
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,322
He can't make any money like that.

442
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,559
But that can't be a reason
for you to lie to other people.

443
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,128
You told people
that you will have a rich son-in-law.

444
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,996
No. Daughter.

445
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,967
That's because I can't let
them look down on us.

446
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,471
I said that before I realized it.

447
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,006
Besides, that will be the truth.

448
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,277
Once you marry Daoming Si,
we will be rich.

449
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,713
Who would dare look down on us
by then, right?

450
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,850
Mom, dad,
please don't talk nonsense anymore.

451
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,019
Diamond? Is this a real diamond?

452
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,187
It's real.

453
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,090
We can sell it. Then we can pay the bills.

454
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,360
No. You can't. I'll return it to him.

455
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,466
This must be given to you
by Young Master Daoming Si, right?

456
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,337
If it is, that will be great.

457
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:46,972
Yes!

458
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,277
It means Daoming Si loves Shancai the most
and she is the woman in his heart.

459
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:56,348
Mom have known it
the moment Shancai was born.

460
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,184
I thought she was so cute.

461
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,020
Young Master Daoming Si
must love you so much.

462
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,322
-Yeah.
-Mom and dad are so happy.

463
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,604
So? Did you find Shancai?

464
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,240
No, I kept looking for her.

465
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,177
Xiaoyou said Shancai didn't call her.
I'm so worried.

466
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,145
She's fine.

467
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,048
Shancai is the liveliest female weed
I've ever met.

468
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,817
Hey, she a princess in my heart.

469
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,719
Then you will be a frog, at most.

470
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,989
What? Then Daoming Si is the prince?

471
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,791
What kind of prince
doesn't protect her princess?

472
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,494
And he didn't try to find her.
What is he thinking?

473
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,797
Actually, we are worried.

474
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,534
Ah Si got his savage
and ruthless personality back.

475
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,205
He won't look for Shancai
and he won't solve the problem.

476
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,940
He wears a poker face every day.

477
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:01,880
The worst thing is, with his personality
and his current condition,

478
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,516
if we talk to him,
I don't know what will happen.

479
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,619
Did he come to school today?

480
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:09,855
I don't know. Should we check it out?

481
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,893
Won't he mind?

482
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,429
He won't mind.
Daoming Si rarely gets angry these days.

483
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,297
-Yeah.
-You won't know if you don't try.

484
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,132
-Will he accept you?
-Yeah.

485
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,269
But I'm so scared.
Wasn't he with Shancai before?

486
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,538
-Come on.
-Shancai dropped out long ago.

487
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,507
Yeah, you're cuter than Shancai.

488
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,308
-Really?
-Yeah.

489
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,878
I made this cake myself. Will he like it?

490
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,546
Yes, he will.

491
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,948
-Daoming Si is walking towards here.
-Go.

492
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,316
I'll go then.

493
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:39,885
You can do it.

494
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,992
Daoming Si. I made this cake myself.

495
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:52,797
If you don't mind,
you can eat it at tea time.

496
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,439
-How is this possible?
-He accepted it.

497
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:08,613
It's a bit messed up here
but my feelings for you are in it.

498
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,984
I've loved you for a long time,
Daoming Si.

499
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,626
Are you okay?

500
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,528
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry, okay?

501
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,649

<i>How about NTD 50,000,000?</i>

519
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,399
Or do you want NTD 100,000,000?

520
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,005
Tell me. How much do you want?

00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,379
<i>I should've taken the money.
I shouldn't have pretended to be cool.</i>

00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,885
<i>I don't want the money of that darn woman.
I would rather starve than take her money.</i>

524
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,398
You really came back.

525
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,570
I knew you would come back.

526
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,938
-Ah Xiang.
-You got the wrong person!

527
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,639
Hey, you got the wrong person!

528
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:26,111
-Hey! Why are you leaving now?
-Let go of me!

529
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,479
Give me a chance!

530
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,115
Let's start over, okay?

531
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,251
Let go of me. I can't talk like this.

532
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:34,719
Right.

533
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,194
<i>I met a lunatic. It's so scary.</i>

534
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,752
I couldn't find you anywhere.
Turns out you're hiding here.

535
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,322
Why didn't you ask us to drink with you?
You're drinking alone in this place.

536
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,193
What would you like to drink?
I'll order for you.

537
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,928
Anything is fine.
I will drink whatever we have.

538
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,697
I'll mix one for you.

539
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:27,906
What is this?

540
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,509
Didn't you say you would drink
whatever we had?

541
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,645
Ah Si, you're very drunk.

542
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:36,447
No. I'm very sober.

543
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:37,715
Ah Si.

544
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,852
We're worried about you so we want
to talk to you.

545
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,887
What kind of attitude is this?

546
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,589
Don't say that, Ximen.

547
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,792
We won't drink today. Go pay the bill.

548
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,794
Ah Si, we're going to take you home.

549
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,096
It's none of your business! Get lost!

550
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,021
Shancai.

551
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,990
You got the wrong person.

552
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,044
Do you own the street? What are you doing?

553
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,846
Son of the nouveau riche,
what are you doing?

554
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,881
You're asking me? I should be asking you.

555
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:19,150
Are you drunk?
Do you know how dangerous that was?

556
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:20,385
No.

557
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,554
Why are you alone? Where's the rest of F4?

558
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,822
I don't know.

559
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,358
Stop walking around.

560
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,627
I don't know.

561
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,598
You think you look coll acting like this?
You know nothing.

562
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:36,534
Right, you know nothing.
Shancai is missing.

563
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,703
Why did Shancai dropout?
Why is Shancai missing?

564
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,739
What are you doing?
Is this just another instant relationship?

565
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,074
Why don't you look for her?

566
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,410
I don't know the answer
to those questions!

567
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,647
Don't sit here and embarrass yourself.

568
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:50,648
Go away!

569
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,391
Why? I'd like to know why.

570
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,227
Who can tell me why?

571
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,445
-A young man?
-Yes.

572
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,781
There is no young man
in this small fishing village.

573
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,885
It's true. I met him last night.
He's tall and bulky.

574
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,789
-He has dark skin.
-Doesn't ring any bells. Hey, watch out.

575
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,859
-Don't date poor men at the seaside.
-Okay.

576
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,562
Do you want to stay in
this fishing village for your entire life?

577
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,000
Mom, what are you thinking?
I really met that man last night.

578
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,438
-You're really going to work?
-Yeah.

579
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,874
-You'll work just for a few days?
-Yes.

580
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,543
The landlady offered a job to me.

581
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,813
-She told the owner of a restaurant.
-Yeah.

582
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,383
He will pay us later.

583
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,588
<i>It's great to have some help
from a young girl.</i>

584
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,790
There are many tourists
from Taipei on their vacation.

585
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,325
I need more hands right now.

586
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,561
-Please teach her what she should know.
-Okay.

587
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,031
She's smart.
She'll learn everything in no time.

588
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,267
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

589
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,002
Shancai, do you remember the way home?

590
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,370
-Yes, mom.
-Okay.

591
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,872
-Be careful.
-Okay.

592
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,740
-Mom's leaving now.
-Okay, mom, bye.

593
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,376
-Take care, ma'am.
-Okay, thank you.

594
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:26,944
-Let me show you around.
-Okay.

595
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,152
Clean up the area. There are a lot
of convenient stores around.

596
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,486
Morning.

597
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,856
You're finally here.
You're late every day.

598
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,892
There is one more staff here.

599
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,860
If you keep doing this, you'll be fired.

600
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,562
I'm sorry, boss.

601
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,066
Shancai, this is the other student worker
in my restaurant. He's Ah Song.

602
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,101
Hi, I'm Shancai.

603
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:51,702
Hi.

604
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,106
Boss, is he acting weird?

605
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:59,510
I met him on the beach last night.
Then he...

606
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,313
Ah Song, you went
to the beach again last night?

607
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,283
Shancai said she saw you
on the beach last night.

608
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,952
You always hang around until it's so late.
That's why you're always late.

609
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:09,487
No.

610
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,157
I did drink a little last night.

611
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,593
That's why I said I wanted to go diving.

612
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,498
Did we meet last night?

613
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,667
I don't remember it at all.

614
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:24,969
You don't remember?

615
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,973
How could you do that? You were drunk,
then you went to the beach.

616
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,275
You... that's dangerous.

617
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,779
Yeah. So I would be saved
by people every time.

618
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:39,217
They would have to do CPR on me.
Then they would have to kiss me.

619
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,753
The worst time was
when I was with a fat lady.

620
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,290
There was another time
when it was an old man.

621
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,759
-It's so disgusting.
-Okay. Stop your nonsense.

622
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,062
-Do your job. I'll leave you here.
-Okay.

623
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,697
That's okay. You can leave it to me.

624
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,665
Bye.

625
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,813
"Suancai" is a great name.
How did you get that name?

626
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,882
-Actually, I'm--
-When I eat braised food,

627
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,817
I always tell the cook
to put more suancai,

628
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,186
so the food won't be too greasy.

629
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,022
Actually, I'm Shancai.
