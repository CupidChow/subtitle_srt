1
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,336
Is that Ah Si?

2
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,806
The meteor necklace that he gave you.

3
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,644
He's full of nonsense.

4
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,546
No.

5
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,214
Ah Si isn't full of nonsense.

6
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,216
He did it.

7
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,086
He decided not to give up.

8
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,822
He sticks to his feelings.

9
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,192
You know what?

10
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,894
That "holding on a little longer"
I talked about?

11
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,997
Ah Si did it.

12
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,936
I still think he's full of nonsense.

13
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,454
Shancai.

14
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:38,825
Good night.

15
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,354
Looking for us?

16
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,723
I thought you abandoned your buddies.

17
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,225
Meizuo.

18
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,561
Ah Si has made a new decision.

19
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,166
A head-on conflict of you and Ah Si
is the last thing we want to see.

20
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,735
But for this situation,

21
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,370
this must be happening.

22
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,572
I know.

23
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,175
You know?

24
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,444
Don't you think this is awkward?

25
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,080
Who will feel awkward?

26
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,681
Ximen and I.

27
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,720
You're busy with your relationship.

28
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,189
How about us?

29
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,625
Lei.

30
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm telling you something seriously.

31
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,897
No matter who's with Shancai,

32
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,832
you or Ah Si,

33
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,901
we are still F4.

34
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,574
Love does have a shelf life.

35
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,609
Please believe me.

36
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:11,978
Right.

37
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,114
Ah Si is an impulsive person.

38
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,917
So...

39
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,888
Why are you laughing?

40
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,725
Actually...

41
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,362
Why are you laughing?

42
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,666
I don't know how to tell you.

43
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,368
What? We're super serious.

44
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,338
Mr. Huaze Lei.

45
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,006
Tell us everything clearly.

46
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,659
A letter without the stamp.

47
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,100
<i>Shancai.</i>

48
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,536
<i>I don't know why</i>

49
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,039
<i>I just can't tell you personally.</i>

50
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,875
<i>That's why I'm writing to you.</i>

51
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,613
<i>My father's company,
the Huaze Corporation,</i>

52
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,214
<i>is facing a tremendous problem</i>

53
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,817
<i>as he has made a bad decision.</i>

54
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,887
<i>So, I'm going to Japan to assist my father</i>

55
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,923
<i>with some cross-country cooperation.</i>

56
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,092
<i>Maybe,</i>

57
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,795
<i>this is the time
to take care of my father.</i>

58
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,832
<i>I always say,</i>

59
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,601
<i>I'm not interested in anyone's business.</i>

60
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,004
<i>But when I left,</i>

61
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,139
<i>I realized</i>

62
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,676
<i>there are so many things
that I do care about.</i>

63
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,211
<i>Just like you,</i>

64
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,712
<i>like F4,</i>

65
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,015
<i>like Yingde University,</i>

66
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,518
<i>and the time we've been together.</i>

67
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,889
<i>Since I was young,</i>

68
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,892
<i>I thought I was just
a young master of a corporation.</i>

69
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,962
<i>People around me
are no different than who I am.</i>

70
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,031
<i>So I used to think that</i>

71
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,233
<i>only the strong bond of F4</i>

72
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,801
<i>is something that I should take care of.</i>

73
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,904
<i>Until you show up in my life.</i>

74
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,407
<i>I then realized</i>

75
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,042
<i>how interesting life can be.</i>

76
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,845
<i>I hope I can be someone like you.</i>

77
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,948
<i>I hope I'm as strong as you.</i>

78
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,583
<i>I envy your freedom.</i>

79
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,019
<i>I envy your smile.</i>

80
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,856
<i>You made me realize</i>

81
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,060
<i>what a happy life is.</i>

82
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,595
<i>That it's something we need to fight for.</i>

83
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,034
<i>So, please bless me, okay?</i>

84
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,272
<i>It'll be a long journey.</i>

85
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,275
<i>I'll be doing a lot of things
that are also new to me.</i>

86
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,778
<i>So, I need your blessing.</i>

87
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,416
<i>And my dearest friend,</i>

88
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,052
<i>please promise me one thing.</i>

89
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,122
<i>Do not give up your happiness. Okay?</i>

90
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,026
<i>I know you love Daoming Si.</i>

91
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,231
<i>And he loves you too.</i>

92
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,235
<i>But just like what I've said,</i>

93
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,472
<i>I don't know why.</i>

94
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,875
<i>I can't tell you directly.</i>

95
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,612
<i>I am chasing after you
because I want to force Ah Si</i>

96
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,448
<i>to be honest with his own feelings.</i>

97
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,218
<i>I really hope that the both of you</i>

98
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,920
<i>can really face your true feelings.</i>

99
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,693
<i>This is the last thing
that I can do for the both you.</i>

100
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm so worried about that.

101
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,201
He won't change by the time I leave.

102
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,669
Right.

103
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,373
If Ah Si doesn't come back
before you leave,

104
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,108
what will you do?

105
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,212
I do have a plan B.

106
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,748
If Ah Si does not come back

107
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,383
before I leave,

108
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,586
I might bring Shancai along to Japan.

109
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,295
But I don't think I'll use plan B,

110
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,764
as Ah Si won't disappoint me.

111
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,232
Right.

112
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,069
Ah Si won't disappoint me.

113
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,737
You won't disappoint us either.

114
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,774
When are you leaving?

115
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,779
At dawn.

116
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,855
Take care.

117
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,425
Best of luck.

118
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,588
<i>When you'll see this letter,</i>

119
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,023
<i>I think,</i>

120
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,426
<i>I will have left already.</i>

121
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,530
<i>My dearest friend,</i>

122
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,766
<i>please take care of yourself.</i>

123
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,537
<i>I'll always remember you.</i>

124
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,206
<i>Lei.</i>

125
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,431
I hate hangovers.

126
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,835
I hate saying goodbye.

127
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,576
I never thought of you
bearing all that family business so soon.

128
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,079
Facing the problem

129
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,484
is the only way to sort it out.

130
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,387
It seems difficult,

131
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,922
but actually, it's not that bad.

132
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,858
You'll know someday.

133
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,260
Lei.

134
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,263
You looked more confident now

135
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,532
than when you went to France last time.

136
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,834
You never know.

137
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,636
But I can't tell

138
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,405
if I can do anything this time.

139
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,343
We have faith in you,

140
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,444
you know.

141
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,417
Time is running out.

142
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,618
I should go.

143
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,322
Ah Si.

144
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,425
I've left him a message,
but his phone is still off.

145
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,793
No worries.

146
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,294
Say hi for me.

147
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,793
I'll take care of her.

148
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,131
I'm sorry, Xiaozi.

149
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,866
I live alone so I just have tea.

150
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,601
That's totally fine. Thank you.

151
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,503
-You're welcome.
-I went to Yingde to look for you.

152
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,838
But I couldn't find you.

153
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,641
I know, Qinghe told me before.

154
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,281
It's beautiful.

155
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,949
Did Lei do this for you?

156
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,719
It's been said that he chased after you
when you came back.

157
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,120
Did Lei chase me?

158
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,688
That's not true.

159
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,123
It's impossible.

160
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,891
How about you and Ah Si?

161
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,195
Why am I asking that? It's weird.

162
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,063
No worries, Xiaozi.

163
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,232
No matter if it's Huaze Lei or Daoming Si,

164
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,067
they're both my friends.

165
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,502
Don't you think so?

166
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,637
It's better to be friends
rather than couples.

167
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,840
It's good to be friends

168
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,075
so that others won't say anything
about you.

169
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,010
It won't be so stressful.

170
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,646
Right.

171
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,982
We're strong women who throw away F4.

172
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,852
Let's drink to that. Come on.

173
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,653
I've bought a new camera today.

174
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,355
Let's take a photo.

175
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,490
For what?

176
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,858
For...

177
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,328
For being strong and independent women
we are, starting today.

178
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,330
Strong and independent women.

179
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,699
You will really do
anything you've thought of, Xiaozi.

180
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,834
Right, just a second.

181
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,935
One second.

182
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,370
Okay.

183
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,351
RECIPIENT: DAOMING FENG

184
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,956
MADAM, YOUNG MASTER HUAZE
HAS GONE TO JAPAN

185
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:32,365
MASTER AH SI
SEEMS TO BE WITH SHANCAI AGAIN

186
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,437
WE WILL GET IN TOUCH IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

187
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,141
SEND

188
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,812
<i>Did Hauze Lei tell you when he's leaving?</i>

189
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,147
He didn't tell me anything.

190
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,750
Aren't you always spending time together?

191
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:52,885
Not really.

192
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,420
This is weird.

193
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,458
Qinghe.

194
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,926
I'm so happy

195
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,327
to have a friend like you.

196
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,029
Me either.

197
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,031
I'll protect my Shancai.

198
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:06,933
-Xiaozi.
-Shancai, let's go.

199
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,634
-We're going to a good place.
-You're annoying.

200
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,002
-Where are we going?
-What did you do?

201
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,370
Bye, the son of Nouveau Riche.

202
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,840
Qinghe, I'm going. Bye!

203
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,709
BEACH CAFE

204
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,316
-Xiaozi.
-Yes?

205
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,318
Did we go here just to drink coffee?

206
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,719
No, of course.

207
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,288
Shancai, I've decided that I'm moving on.

208
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,257
I'm fighting for our love.

209
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,825
What do you mean?

210
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:35,962
Look.

211
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,930
"Blind date"?

212
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,398
BLIND DATE WITH US?

213
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,700
Right, blind date.

214
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,801
Is it too much?

215
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,403
I designed a small poster
to be posted in universities.

216
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,039
I've uploaded our photos online.

217
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,108
There's a bunch of people calling me.

218
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,576
How come you're doing this, Xiaozi?

219
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,712
This is so dangerous.

220
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,547
I don't want to date.

221
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,316
You know what? There are
a lot of news reports on blind dates.

222
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,051
You're overreacting.

223
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,787
The blind date will be during daytime
and in a public area.

224
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,457
This is the phone number
for the blind date.

225
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,325
I won't use it after all.

226
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,028
The people who are interested
are university students.

227
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,162
No, I don't want that.

228
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,330
Wait.

229
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,332
This is so dangerous.

230
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,333
I'll hang out with you.

231
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,035
Someone's coming. Please sit.

232
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,075
You're so cute.

233
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,844
I'm from the Dance Club
of Yijing University.

234
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,345
-My name's Ah Gan.
-I'm Xiaojie.

235
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,949
Mr. Ah Gan, sorry.

236
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,151
I think you should take
some medicine. Bye.

237
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,421
Xiaozi, you're so direct.

238
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,322
That's hurtful.

239
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,323
Not at all.

240
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,091
Won't waste our time
if he isn't the right guy.

241
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,626
We should be thinking of ourselves.

242
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,128
We need someone who we like.

243
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,829
Let's go.

244
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,398
Are you the student of Yuanfu University?

245
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,066
I'm Xiaozi. Please come in.

246
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,581
No more jokes, Xiaozi.

247
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,916
It's been a lot of people.

248
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:37,817
We have seen enough.

249
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,853
All the worst guys
in every university arrived, didn't they?

250
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,221
Not even a good one.

251
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,726
F4 must be the most handsome guys
in the world.

252
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,862
Forget it. Let's have some ice cream.

253
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,831
Hi, are you Miss Xiaozi?

254
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,633
Why do people keep coming?

255
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,967
Excuse me.

256
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,435
The time has passed.

257
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,403
You may leave now.

258
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,904
If apologizing is enough,

259
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,172
what do we need the police for?

260
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,513
Is there something on my face?

261
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,515
No.

262
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,717
You're just like Daoming Si...

263
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,319
Nothing.

264
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,489
You can say it. Why did you stop?

265
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,159
Fine, no worries.

266
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,794
A person who has sense

267
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,929
won't push someone to talk.

268
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,998
I don't hate you for that.

269
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,802
You're more interested in Qingyong.

270
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,204
I think I don't have a chance anymore.

271
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,339
Qingyong.

272
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,341
Don't waste the chance.

273
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,744
Shut up. I didn't ask for your opinion.

274
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,847
He speaks like Ah Si.

275
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,384
Are you Qingyong?

276
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,387
Give me a chance to introduce myself.

277
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,022
Hi, my name is Xiaonan.

278
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,023
Nice to meet you.

279
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,991
I'm Xiaozi.

280
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,694
Shancai.

281
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,095
What?

282
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,497
This is not him
even though they look alike.

283
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,299
Calm down.

284
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,701
I know.

285
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,469
I'm thinking of something else.

286
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,340
Why are you smoking?

287
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,775
Are you all right, miss?

288
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,544
We're adults.

289
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,612
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,148
I'm a bit confused.

291
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,316
Here it is.

292
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,822
What are you doing?

293
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,125
She said she's confused.

294
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,695
This will make you clear your mind.

295
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,663
Qingyong.

296
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,531
You've gone too far.

297
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:33,966
What?

298
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,836
She's the one who is impolite.

299
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,037
You can't do that, though.

300
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,271
Let's go, Shancai.

301
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,282
Shancai.

302
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,418
Qingyong is just like Ah Si.

303
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,587
It's such a coincidence.

304
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,990
This blind date is for you
to forget about Ah Si.

305
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,859
How come there's a...

306
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,964
Where are you?

307
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,402
<i>What am I doing?</i>

308
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,670
<i>What should I do?</i>

309
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,607
<i>I can't control my emotions like before.</i>

310
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,879
<i>My cold shell was broken
the moment I first saw that guy.</i>

311
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,150
<i>I felt a strong gush of sadness
rushing to my heart.</i>

312
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,488
Leave me alone!

313
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,659
You're the guy I've just met.

314
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,361
I have something to ask you.

315
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,568
Slow down. I haven't asked you yet.

316
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,505
Do you know anything about Daoming Si?

317
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,742
How did you know him? Who are you?

318
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,744
Is that weird?

319
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:52,945
No.

320
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,513
Because Ah Si is my cousin.

321
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,348
Your cousin?

322
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,717
Are you his girlfriend?

323
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,389
He loves girls like you.

324
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,058
I'm not. It's none of your business.

325
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,460
Don't you understand?

326
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,229
This is the first time we met, right?

327
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,532
There is no one here but us.

328
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,202
Even if I kill you here,

329
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,504
no one will know who is the murderer.

330
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,440
What do you want?

331
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,786
Idiot.

332
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,156
What will I get
if I kill such a stupid girl like you?

333
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:45,831
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,466
No worries, I'll get them.

335
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:56,842
Sorry.

336
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,510
No worries.

337
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,012
Why are you here?

338
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,313
What are you nervous about?

339
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,616
I just saw something horrible.

340
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,050
So...

341
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,354
Nothing, I'm leaving.

342
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:10,956
Shancai.

343
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,392
Let's go get something to drink.

344
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,527
Ten minutes only.

345
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,796
Do you want to go to a coffee shop?

346
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,633
No need.

347
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,268
Let's have a cup of tea.

348
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,555
Lei left.

349
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,197
It's so bland.

350
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,867
What?

351
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,136
The coffee.

352
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,372
This can be as good as
the premium coffee in your home.

353
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,274
We, the normal people, drink this.

354
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,543
Why are you talking like this?

355
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,047
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

356
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,286
I just want to say...

357
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,625
Daoming Si.

358
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,726
Behind you.

359
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,394
What?

360
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,431
Your cousin. Your cousin just walked past.

361
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,132
He's done something horrible to me.

362
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,300
-He...
-Shancai.

363
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,203
Can you lie a little better?

364
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,705
A lie?

365
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,240
You may leave if you want.

366
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,076
I haven't.

367
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,477
I'm telling you the truth.

368
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,546
Just like every time.

369
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,115
You're always impatient
when I really want to talk to you.

370
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,317
Or you will use some lie for it.

371
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,252
This is so ridiculous.

372
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,456
I don't even know if I have a cousin.

373
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,958
It's real. I've met him today.

374
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:55,928
Where?

375
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,898
The blind date with Xiaozi.

376
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,667
We met someone that looks like you.

377
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,035
He said he's your cousin.

378
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,703
But he's scary.

379
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,971
And I think he might...

380
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:10,442
Daoming Si...

381
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,877
Wait, Daoming Si.

382
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,178
What did you want to tell me?

383
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,713
I will listen to you.

384
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,482
I'm sorry, Daoming Si.

385
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,922
It's great to be a girl.

386
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,460
You can go on blind dates.

387
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,770
I'm not blaming you.

388
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:45,611
A relationship with someone else
should be much easier than with me.

389
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,763
Ah Si, you're here.

390
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,733
Why are you here?

391
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:11,770
How did it go with Shancai?

392
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,942
Forget it.

393
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,577
Right.

394
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,081
If a small talk
can improve your relationship,

395
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,450
you're no longer Daoming Si,

396
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,185
and she won't be Shancai.

397
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,088
Even if you stop talking,
it won't make you dumb.

398
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,690
Just joking. Nothing serious.

399
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,394
I don't know what she's thinking.

400
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,297
Every time I'm being serious,
she'll be impatient.

401
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,265
She said she met my cousin.

402
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,067
Your cousin?

403
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,570
Do you have a cousin?

404
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,339
You grew up with me.
Have you heard of one?

405
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,641
No.

406
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,543
Ah Si.

407
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,345
Did your sister talk about
this guy before?

408
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,713
I don't even remember.

409
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,316
Yes, she did.

410
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,984
I remember she talked about him.

411
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,524
Aunt Yu.

412
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,594
Aunt Yu.

413
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,895
I have a question for you.

414
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,265
A question for me?

415
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,368
Right, you're having a big problem.

416
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,504
What does that mean?

417
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,606
You can't keep a girl beside you

418
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,375
as you aren't talented at all.

419
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,712
You can only yell
at an elderly person like me.

420
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,881
So I doubt.

421
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,949
When I changed your diaper
when you were a kid,

422
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,652
the little drumstick on you is not real.

423
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,220
"Little drumstick"?

424
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,256
Why are you so annoying?

425
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,790
You've said that so many times.

426
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,026
I'll stop if I've said it ten times more.

427
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,327
Leave it, Ah Si...

428
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,395
Ask what you want to know.

429
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,934
Do I have a cousin?

430
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:51,703
Young Master.

431
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,205
How do you know that?

432
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,741
So I do have a cousin?

433
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,409
Yes.

434
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,978
He's the only son of your aunt.

435
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,149
He's been here once.

436
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,818
How come I didn't know him?

437
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,055
I feel sorry for him.

438
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,891
His parents got divorced
when he was in high school.

439
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,394
They were already married
to different spouses.

440
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,930
But no one was willing
to take care of him.

441
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,898
They gave him money.

442
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,401
I think he must be living on his own.

443
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,338
Do you mean that he's been living alone
since high school?

444
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,472
Yes.

445
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,076
He's about your age.

446
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,745
But he lives in an environment
that is so different from you.

447
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,616
I wonder how he's doing now.

448
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,804
Is that horrible?

449
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,938
Why are you here again?

450
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,340
Why are following me?

451
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,043
I don't know.

452
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:07,913
Maybe I am curious.

453
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,548
Curious?

454
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,216
Let me tell you.

455
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,951
The blind date today was a mistake.

456
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,720
We're strangers.

457
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,321
Stay away from me, please.

458
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:23,228
I'm curious to find out why you are in
a relationship with Daoming Si.

459
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,330
I'm not in a relationship with him,

460
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,466
so stop being curious about it.

461
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,974
I've been harsh to you

462
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,745
because you've been comparing me
and Ah Si.

463
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,747
I felt annoyed.

464
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,650
So I've had such a strong reaction.

465
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,320
I apologize if you're offended.

466
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,621
No worries.

467
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,718
What do you want?

468
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,620
Do you want to eat something?

469
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,123
Actually, I already left.

470
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,225
But I feel hungry now.

471
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,360
I want something to eat.

472
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,329
I've been following you for a whole day.

473
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,763
You didn't eat anything.

474
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,266
Take it.

475
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:35,934
No, thanks.

476
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,775
What do you want?

477
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,946
I was thinking of going to the bathroom.

478
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,048
But now...

479
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,818
Maybe you'll give me some medicine.

480
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,729
The bathroom is over there.

481
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,713
Where is my instant noodles?

482
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,088
Thank you.

483
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,291
I threw it away.

484
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,227
Why are you having just that?

485
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,361
That's bad for you.

486
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,431
Thank you.

487
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,735
Sit down and have some.

488
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,806
You've got everything you need.

489
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,074
You may leave now.

490
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,777
I'm so hungry right now.

491
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,845
I'll leave when I finish. Okay?

492
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,354
For real.

493
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,022
I promise.

494
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,092
Take a seat.

495
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,971
Does Ah Si still live
at that big, empty house?

496
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,173
Yeah.

497
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,344
Why did you not even say hi
to him earlier?

498
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,148
Because I hate him.

499
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:31,917
You hate him?

500
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,752
Why?

501
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,321
There's no explanation.

502
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,355
No reasons.

503
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:46,131
I saw everything today
as I was standing somewhere beside you.

504
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:52,237
Ah Si is just like a kid
who will never grow up.

505
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,773
This is none of your business.

506
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,710
And you don't have to tell me
whether he is a kid or not.

507
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,713
Don't you understand?

508
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,517
You're wasting your time with him.

509
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,421
A beautiful, wealthy woman
is what he really needs.

510
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:15,260
Not a poor girl like you
who struggles to live.

511
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,096
Are you done?

512
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,266
I know how much we're different
from each other.

513
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,236
I won't dream to be a wealthy girl.

514
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,370
I don't lie to myself.

515
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,376
You're not that stupid though.

516
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,079
You do know yourself.

517
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,288
Don't you want to marry him

518
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,658
so you two can be together?

519
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,062
Why are you acting like
you're so different?

520
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,369
I don't want that.

521
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,107
I know we're so different.

522
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,743
Even though it's a dream,

523
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,178
I'll just laugh at myself.

524
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,083
I have no other choice.
This is the real world.

525
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,921
I should be happy

526
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,856
even if there's endless darkness ahead.

527
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,461
Hello, have you been waiting for long?

528
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,464
Sorry to call you this late, Xiaozi.

529
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,300
No worries. What's wrong?

530
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,201
Ah Si, please ask your question.

531
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,340
Did you meet someone strange

532
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,942
when you and Shancai were on a blind date?

533
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,076
So you already knew that.

534
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,612
Yes, there's this strange guy.

535
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,747
I thought of you when I saw him.

536
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,449
I don't know why, though.

537
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,551
Maybe you have a similar way of speaking.

538
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,621
Actually, you look alike, too.

539
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,190
Ah Si, I think that's him.

540
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,094
Every time I see him I think of you,

541
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,829
but he's way more disrespectful than you.

542
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,131
He ruined our blind date.

543
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,634
Are you the one
who planned the blind date?

544
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:03,568
Of course.

545
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,371
Shancai wouldn't have been there
if she had known before.

546
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,873
Why are you asking about that guy?

547
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,343
That's Ah Si's cousin.

548
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,544
Ah Si's cousin?

549
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,179
What a coincidence.

550
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,748
What did you think about him
when you were on that blind date?

551
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,417
He's just a terrible guy.

552
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,619
Do you know what he did?

553
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,154
He poured water on Shancai's head.

554
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,890
-Why?
-I don't know why.

555
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,660
Maybe it's because Shancai looked at him.

556
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:29,794
He was not happy with that.

557
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,366
Thank you, Xiaozi. I'm going.

558
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,203
No worries.

559
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,139
Sorry, Xiaozi.

560
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,408
Next time it's our treat. We have to go.

561
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,317
<i>You need to apologize to Shancai</i>

562
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,718
when you meet her.

563
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,320
She's not willing to date others.

564
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,655
She didn't know she met your cousin.

565
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,723
You're being mad at her.

566
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,126
Don't you think
your relationship is intense?

567
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,328
Let me see how you can fix
your relationship this time.

568
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,030
I know. You're so annoying.

569
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,197
Copy that.

570
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:14,673
Hello?

571
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,675
Meizuo.

572
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,078
My house is at the end of that alley.

573
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,847
You're coming to my place?

574
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,550
You're at the door?

575
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,824
I'm going.

576
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:33,758
Are you?

577
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,326
There is the door.

578
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,561
That's my room.

579
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,329
Do you have windows?

580
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,431
Windows?

581
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,837
I'll get my shoes another day.

582
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,038
Bye.

583
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,173
Hey.

584
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,277
Hello.

585
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,746
Come on...

586
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,388
You've done all that?

587
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,826
Why are you here?

588
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,761
Ah Si has something to say.

589
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,996
Are you?

590
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,132
Ah Si.

591
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,903
I won't push you
if you don't want to say anything.

592
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,338
No, Shancai.

593
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,441
What? He scolded me
this afternoon just like that.

594
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,343
I hate how you date others.

595
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,646
Did you come here just to say that?

596
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,115
You have a lot of free time.

597
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,750
What's with your attitude?

598
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,384
What attitude?

599
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,755
I don't care if you think that
I've seen your cousin is a complete lie.

600
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,423
I'm a complete liar, though.

601
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,624
Are you happy with that?

602
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,693
-I'm sorry...
-What...

603
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,761
Sorry?

604
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,796
Xiaozi told me everything.

605
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,333
I've asked Aunt Yu about my cousin.

606
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,034
I'm sorry.

607
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,905
You're so cunning
on saying sorry to me so suddenly.

608
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,373
I've done something wrong, too.

609
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,775
I should listen to you...

610
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,876
All right.

611
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,145
You're such quarrelsome lovers.

612
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,580
Shancai.

613
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,982
You can't blame him.

614
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,450
He didn't know he has a cousin.

615
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,086
Your cousin was here.

616
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,422
His cousin was here?

617
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,958
Why are you letting strangers
into your house?

618
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,026
He came here on his own.

619
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,861
He stayed for a while and left.

620
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,530
Why?

621
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,665
He said he didn't want to see Daoming Si.

622
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,400
Why me?

623
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:25,870
Ah Si.

624
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,605
Have you done something bad again?

625
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,840
Nothing at all.

626
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,342
What do you mean by "again"?

627
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,711
I don't know my cousin.

628
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,413
Why would he hate me?

629
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,649
He just doesn't want to see you.

630
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,083
Leave him alone.

631
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:40,718
No way.

632
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:42,353
I must know what happened.

633
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,956
Just to prevent him
from doing something behind my back.

634
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,593
Why would he "scar" me
if he has done nothing wrong?

635
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,130
He "scares" you.

636
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,405
Why is he not wearing any shoes?

637
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,308
Hi.

638
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,311
I am.

639
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,082
I know.

640
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,320
Please give me more time.

641
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:18,957
Okay.

642
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,010
This is a perfect style.

643
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,612
Of course, the sunglasses.

644
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,014
How's that?

645
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,383
Why are you wearing those
in such hot weather?

646
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,284
Don't you feel hot?

647
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,986
It's extremely hot.

648
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,854
But this is how a detective looks.

649
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,756
Insane.

650
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,925
This is so attention-seeking.

651
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:54,859
It's fun.

652
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,794
You think it's fun.

653
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,363
Someone over there is upset.

654
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,733
I hate "snakey" guys.

655
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,102
I must find him.

656
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,136
For what?

657
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,971
To tell him to leave Shancai alone?

658
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,239
To stay away from Shancai?

659
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,641
I didn't say that.

660
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,542
Did you feel uneasy

661
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,945
as he claimed to be your cousin

662
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,146
and stayed close with Shancai?

663
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,581
Right? You can't admit it.

664
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:17,849
You crazy monkey.

665
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,183
Shut up.

666
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,552
Fine, I'll stop for now.

667
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,588
But one last thing.

668
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,323
It's "sneaky" guy.

669
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,992
-Right. "Snakey" guys.
-Shut up.

670
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,896
Aunt Yu said his cousin's family
is a bit complicated.

671
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,832
So he might feel imbalanced
when seeing Ah Si.

672
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,335
Imbalanced?

673
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,673
Do you mean he lived so differently

674
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,608
even though he is a relative of Ah Si?

675
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,576
So he's staying close with Shancai, right?

676
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:47,612
Maybe yes, maybe no.

677
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,681
Maybe it's a coincidence.

678
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,283
How come it's a coincidence?

679
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,197
Why are you here again?

680
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:07,899
I'm getting my shoes.

681
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,202
I'll help you. One second.

682
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,322
Your shoes.

683
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,423
Thank you.

684
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,959
Daoming Si wants to see you.

685
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,362
Really? I don't want to see him, though.

686
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,397
Why are you being so stubborn
about meeting him?

687
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,465
Aren't you relatives?

688
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,468
He must not want to have
a poor relative like me.

689
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,771
And I don't want them to think
I'm trying to get on their good side.

690
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,506
Why are you saying that?

691
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:50,241
Maybe that's not what they're thinking.

692
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,679
What should I tell him if we meet?

693
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,649
What can I talk about
with such a spoiled brat?

694
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,085
Actually, that's not the case.

695
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,654
There are good people like Zhuang
and Mrs. Yu in the Daoming household.

696
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,656
They're really good.

697
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,128
I'm not interested in people
from the Daoming household.

698
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,163
And I don't want to see them.

699
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:14,365
So those things have nothing
to do with me.

700
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,435
I'm leaving.

701
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,146
I have something for you.

702
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,653
What is it?

703
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,022
Don't you think they look like lanterns?

704
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,490
Lanterns?

705
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,760
Didn't you say it was dark
in front of you last time?

706
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,164
Bye.

707
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,505
They look like lanterns?

708
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,774
He wants to bring me out of the dark?

709
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,347
Wait.

710
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,920
Why did you...

711
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:13,724
What?

712
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,693
This one.

713
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,363
Why do you ask?

714
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,233
Honestly, I didn't really like you
when we first met.

715
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,069
I even find you a bit annoying.

716
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,407
However, what you did made me feel...

717
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:35,746
Because you told me last time

718
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,882
that it was dark in front of you.

719
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,387
Actually, I'm not trying to do something
on purpose to get on your good side.

720
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:46,591
I was just thinking

721
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,493
that I was once like you.
It was dark in front of me.

722
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,760
However, I can only rely on myself

723
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,430
to figure it all out.

724
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,434
If someone had been willing to provide
some encouragement for me before,

725
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,604
maybe I'd be different now.

726
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,942
Wait here. Don't go.

727
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:05,977
Hold this for me.

728
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,512
Wait.

729
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,245
