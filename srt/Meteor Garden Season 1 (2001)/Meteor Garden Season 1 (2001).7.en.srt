1
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,143
Why are you up?

2
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,781
Your fever has gone down.

3
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,184
You're not that warm anymore.

4
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,525
Sorry if I caused you any trouble.

5
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,294
If apologizing is enough,

6
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,196
what do we need the police for?

7
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,500
How's your leg?

8
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,270
It's already numb.

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,675
It's all your fault, though.

10
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,176
What does it have to do with me?

11
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,278
Why am I apologizing?

12
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,683
Why are you smiling?

13
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,856
<i>A man with such big built</i>

14
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,593
<i>is just like a kindergarten kid right now.</i>

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>Looking at him this way,</i>

16
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>I find it hard to imagine
that he's the leader of F4.</i>

17
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,401
<i>He also has a cute side.</i>

18
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,674
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,009
I'm the only one
who can take care of you now.

20
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,177
When you get home later,

21
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,212
your mom can take care of you.

22
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,484
I haven't seen my parents
for two years already.

23
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,053
What?

24
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,823
Because of my dad's work,

25
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,858
they live in our house in New York.

26
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,694
New York?

27
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,264
You live alone
in that big house in Taiwan?

28
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,670
It must be lonely
to live in such a big house, right?

29
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,074
Lonely?

30
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,277
Don't say such gross things.

31
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,013
I'm not lonely.

32
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,149
That's why you have
such a strange personality.

33
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,051
If I were you,

34
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,387
I'd surely hate the world.

35
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,460
Consider it my fault today.

36
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,463
You can ask me to make it up to you.

37
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,564
Tell me.

38
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,903
What do you want?

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,677
I didn't say I'm going to make it up
to you this way!

40
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,979
What are you doing?

41
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,150
How did you come up here?

42
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,652
You, youngsters, may love excitement,

43
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,954
but you shouldn't come here.

44
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,256
It's safer in motels.

45
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,191
If my daughter does this,

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,260
I'd surely beat her up.

47
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,068
The sun is up.

48
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,774
-Let me help you.
-No.

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,208
-Come on. It's fine.
-There's no need.

50
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,510
It's all right.

51
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,018
How are you going home later?

52
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,553
I'm taking the MRT.

53
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,159
Shancai.

54
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,130
Nothing.

55
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,345
Are you sure you don't want me
to take you home?

56
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,715
Take care then.

57
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,097
A young girl

58
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,467
doesn't come home all night

59
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,736
until morning.

60
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,638
Is that how you should act?

61
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,574
When I was young,

62
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,911
I'd surely come home before 9 p.m.

63
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,013
I'm not like you at all.

64
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,883
You have to be a good girl.

65
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,918
Come on.

66
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,020
I can take it.

67
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,222
Tell me honestly.

68
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,161
Last night, how many times

69
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,664
did he go over all your four bases?

70
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,032
Mom.

71
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,034
That's not what happened.

72
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,235
It's not?

73
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,504
Tell me honestly.

74
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,539
Did he go to fourth base?

75
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,775
No.

76
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,778
Did he go to third base?

77
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,780
No.

78
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,383
-No?
-Okay.

79
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,585
Good, then...

80
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,887
-Go to sleep.
-Okay.

81
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,690
Beauty sleep is very important.

82
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,597
Great.

83
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,934
Our daughter's third and fourth
bases are safe.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,737
-She's safe?
-They were just being romantic all night.

85
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,005
Gosh.

86
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,373
We've succeeded!

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,808
Great!

88
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,144
-This is a huge success. It's fine.
-We taught her well.

89
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,780
As long as the third and fourth bases
are safe, right?

90
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,915
Even though she didn't come home
the whole night,

91
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,417
they can be romantic

92
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,785
all they want.

93
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,787
The more romantic, the better.

94
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,556
The more solid the foundation,
the stronger the feelings.

95
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,229
<i>My house may be small,</i>

96
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,765
<i>my parents may be like no other,</i>

97
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,302
<i>but they really care about me.</i>

98
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,038
<i>I wonder if Daoming Si's home yet.</i>

99
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,474
<i>Is anyone taking care of him?</i>

100
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,876
<i>Is his fever gone?</i>

101
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,014
<i>Why am I thinking about Daoming Si again?</i>

102
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,549
<i>Do I have a fever too?</i>

103
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,189
Shancai, good morning. Congratulations.

104
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,657
Shancai, good morning. Congratulations.

105
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,725
Shancai, good morning.

106
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,127
Shancai, good morning. Congratulations.

107
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,061
Thank you.

108
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,699
Shancai, good morning. Congratulations.

109
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,967
Congratulations?

110
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,635
What exactly are they
congratulating me for?

111
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,237
Since this morning,

112
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,739
everyone's been congratulating me.

113
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,407
What exactly are they
congratulating me for?

114
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,243
Aren't you officially together
with Daoming Si?

115
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,145
The pictures are posted
on the bulletin board.

116
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,947
Everyone says this is big news.

117
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,048
Bulletin board?

118
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,017
So I've said...

119
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,018
This is so gross.

120
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,286
-This is so gross.
-Really gross.

121
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,189
SOLID PROOF
SHANCAI AND YOUNG MASTER DAOMING SI

122
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,758
IN THE MORNING
ARIZONA BUILDING

123
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,959
That's right. It's really gross.

124
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:46,893
How can this happen?

125
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,461
What's going on?

126
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,230
Zhu Yuanzhang.

127
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,799
Ming dynasty's founding emperor.

128
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,203
They say there's something
strongly related with Zhu Yuanzhang.

129
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,738
The mooncake.

130
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,742
We must eat mooncake
during Mid-Autumn Festival.

131
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,646
Everyone knows
how interesting the mooncake's origin is.

132
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,114
At that time, Zhu Yuanzhang

133
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,984
wanted to call the righteous men
to join the rebellion.

134
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,853
So he put something in the mooncake,

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,922
hoping to relay that message
to each other.

136
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,926
Shancai, can you tell us

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,795
what was inside the mooncake?

138
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,367
Egg yolk?

139
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,803
Egg yolk?

140
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,540
Give her a round of applause.

141
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,576
Shancai's answer is superb.

142
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,846
Actually, inside the mooncake was a note.

143
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,582
However, if they didn't put
that note inside back then,

144
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,852
who would have the idea of putting
egg yolk inside the mooncake now?

145
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,554
Isn't it right?
Give her a round of applause.

146
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,856
Shancai's answer is superb.

147
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,358
She has such potential.
She's our country's hope in the future...

148
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,827
<i>No way.</i>

149
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,728
<i>Even the professor is...</i>

150
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,969
-Shancai, good morning.
-Shancai, good morning.

151
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,037
Good morning.

152
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:04,938
Shancai.

153
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,573
Your hair is so nice today.

154
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,708
-That's right.
-Can I touch it?

155
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,412
-Your hair texture is so nice.
-That's right.

156
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,414
I didn't wash my hair yesterday.

157
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,651
Well... That's the charm only you have.

158
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,553
Let me smell it.

159
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,555
Shancai, you know,

160
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,224
you're really bad.

161
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,225
What do you mean?

162
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,559
That's right.

163
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,394
You have such a classy boyfriend,

164
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,729
yet you didn't tell us.

165
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,830
We had to find out

166
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,132
-from the bulletin board.
-Yes.

167
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,235
What do you take us,
your sister-like best friends, for?

168
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,870
Do we matter at all?

169
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,239
We should find more time to go out.

170
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,107
-That's right.
-How about let's treat her to lunch

171
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,542
-at the canteen now?
-There's no need.

172
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,245
-The canteen is really expensive, no need.
-It's fine. We'll treat you.

173
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,779
-We're sisters.
-There's really no need.

174
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,714
It's fine.

175
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,615
It's very cheap.

176
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,657
Good morning.

177
00:10:58,925 --> 00:10:59,826
Good morning.

178
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,761
Are you feeling better?

179
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,662
Yes, much better.

180
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,597
Hey.

181
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,266
I saw the bulletin board.

182
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,168
Bulletin board?

183
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,304
Turns out Shancai
was the one you're dating.

184
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,673
You came home from your date
in the morning, right?

185
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:15,942
So what?

186
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,246
Honestly, how was it?

187
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,950
What do you mean?

188
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,952
Stop pretending. You know what we mean.

189
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,853
How was it?

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,987
How was what?

191
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,722
Gosh, tell us about last night.

192
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,226
We messed around until morning.

193
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,195
Messed around until morning?

194
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,663
The whole night?

195
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,965
Where?

196
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,968
By the staircase.

197
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,537
You messed around the whole night
by the staircase?

198
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,506
Was it that intense?

199
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,810
It was all right. It wasn't that intense.

200
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,679
Turns out you're so creative.

201
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,747
You win.

202
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:56,649
Ah Si.

203
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,551
I've always thought you were a fool.

204
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,819
My bad.

205
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,956
You really deserve to be F4's leader.

206
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,227
-Tell us more details.
-Isn't this too much food?

207
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,228
-No.
-No.

208
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,362
-I forgot.
-No details.

209
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,496
-Tell us.
-Where do we sit?

210
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,774
Why are you blushing? Go and say hi.

211
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,675
That's right.

212
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,911
-Go and say hi.
-Go on.

213
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,746
I'm going to class.

214
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,414
Don't act this way.

215
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,184
Hey.

216
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,619
You're not a kid.

217
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,721
You just spent the night together.

218
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,923
I'm going to class.

219
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,492
Are you high school students
who fall in love?

220
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,262
It's so romantic, Shancai.

221
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,330
Why are you acting so shy?

222
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,898
Meizuo is even singing for you.

223
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,901
I never thought the cool Meizuo
sings so well.

224
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,537
Shancai, you're our goddess.

225
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,339
-Let's go.
-Let's eat.

226
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,243
You're so cool, Shancai.

227
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,845
You're so lucky.

228
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,481
You're our school's muse.

229
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,382
It's true.

230
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,616
Look, everyone's staring at us.

231
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,218
We are honored.

232
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,221
Let's always eat together here
from now on.

233
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,222
Okay?

234
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,358
We should call ourselves
Yingde's three sisters.

235
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,893
Shancai, you're here too?

236
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,827
Li Zhen.

237
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,162
Why are you here?

238
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,231
Do you also want to be Shancai's friend?

239
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,099
Let me tell you,
don't even think about it.

240
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,802
Shancai is Daoming Si's girlfriend now.

241
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,271
Her status is different from yours.

242
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,339
That's right.

243
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,808
Shancai's with us now.

244
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,344
And we're Yingde's three sisters.

245
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,912
You should leave.

246
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,213
Don't act this way.

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,449
Li Zhen is also my best friend.

248
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,219
It's all her fault
you were given a red card before.

249
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,120
That's right.

250
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,656
And she didn't even help you then.

251
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,358
You also didn't help me.

252
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,426
I...

253
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,960
We... Gosh.

254
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,798
You became close
with Daoming Si because of it, right?

255
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,234
Yes, we're all best friends now.

256
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,202
What about this?

257
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,671
Let's go to a bar tonight, okay?
Our treat.

258
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,067
Hi. Are you interested in dancing with us?

259
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,004
There's no need, thanks.

260
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,339
We'll just sit here.

261
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,474
Okay, sure.

262
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,852
Shancai, why are you still here?

263
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,687
You should dance with us.
It's boring to sit here.

264
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,921
That's right.

265
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,289
I don't know how to dance.

266
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,858
Gosh, stop being so tacky.

267
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,426
Dancing skills are not what's important.

268
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,362
Yes, the important thing
is to stand beneath the lights,

269
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,432
so that people who admire us
will see our branded clothing.

270
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,101
And our hot figures.

271
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,569
I don't have those.

272
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,339
That will make us stand out even more.

273
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:07,874
What?

274
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,575
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

275
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,618
-Isn't this our favorite song?
-Let's go.

276
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,952
Shancai, are you really not dancing?

277
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,421
-Yes. Let's go.
-No, thanks.

278
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,256
All right. We're going then.

279
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,234
<i>When you can't resist crying,</i>

280
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,902
if you do a handstand,

281
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,005
the tears that are about to fall

282
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,442
<i>won't be able to anymore.</i>

283
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,343
Shancai, where are you going?

284
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,278
I'm going across the dance floor.
I'll be right back.

285
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,759
Hi.

286
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,529
Hi.

287
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,231
-Why did you do a handstand?
-What?

288
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,799
Why did you do a handstand?

289
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,401
Why did I do a handstand?

290
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,706
If you do a handstand daily,
it will cure your gastroptosis.

291
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,509
I see.

292
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,213
-Then you're different from my friend.
-What?

293
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,447
What did you say?

294
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,917
Nothing. Thank you.

295
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,753
Why did I do a handstand?

296
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,758
-I'm so tired from dancing.
-Yes, it's so hot.

297
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,561
Shancai, where did you go earlier?

298
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,363
Nowhere.

299
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,698
Let's stop dancing.

300
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,266
-Let's play a game.
-Okay.

301
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,302
-Qianhui, bring everyone over.
-Okay.

302
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,304
Guys...

303
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,843
Hi.

304
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,447
-This handsome guy is Thomas.
-Thomas?

305
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,715
Cool.

306
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,750
All right.

307
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,519
He's Thomas.

308
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,720
He's Qinghe.

309
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,888
Hi, Qinghe.

310
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:09,889
She's Shancai.

311
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,557
And she's Li Zhen.

312
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,360
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

313
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,964
You lost. You have to accept
your punishment.

314
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,999
Truth or dare?

315
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,933
Dare.

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,068
-Dare, right?
-Yes.

317
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:26,005
Okay, go to the next table
and show them your Chanel bra.

318
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,173
Go.

319
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,107
Go.

320
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,242
-Okay, I'll go.
-Come on.

321
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,221
Okay, I refuse to accept defeat.
Let's do it again.

322
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,422
Okay.

323
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,292
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

324
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,928
Shancai lost.

325
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,796
Truth or dare?

326
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,231
Truth then.

327
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,232
Okay.

328
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,234
How much allowance do you have
for one month?

329
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,470
Three thousand.

330
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,338
How is that possible?

331
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,439
Liar!

332
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,241
How can it be that little?

333
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,175
You're kidding.

334
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,244
Three thousand is not even enough
for a meal.

335
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,345
That's right, you're lying.

336
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,279
Liars have to drink.

337
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,681
-Drink.
-Do I really need to drink?

338
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,850
Of course, you're lying.

339
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,284
Come on.

340
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,786
We're good then.

341
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,394
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

342
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,163
Li Zhen lost.

343
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,365
Truth or dare?

344
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,034
Dare.

345
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,502
Dare, right?

346
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,403
Okay.

347
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,305
Then show everyone your underwear.

348
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,775
No, I can't do that.

349
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,842
You can't?

350
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,977
Then drink up.

351
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,178
Here.

352
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,347
-Cheers.
-Drink.

353
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,184
Cheers, come on.

354
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,329
Almost there.

355
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,700
Baihe is the greatest.

356
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,902
Li Zhen lost again.

357
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,971
Cheers.

358
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,214
Li Zhen.

359
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,949
Li Zhen, are you okay?

360
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,418
Qinghe.

361
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,687
Take Li Zhen home first, okay?

362
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,155
I have to take you home, though.

363
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
I'm fine.

364
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,592
Look at her. Please take her home first.

365
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,727
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

366
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,129
-Are you really fine?
-Yes.

367
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,030
All right.

368
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,866
So anyway, it's...

369
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,048
-One beer.
-Make that two.

370
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,654
Where do you want to go later?

371
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,590
Let's go somewhere else.

372
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,892
Do youu still want to go somewhere else?

373
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,028
I haven't hooked up with a guy yet.

374
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,534
Look at that bartender.
He looks like Daoming Si.

375
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,036
Maybe it's really Daoming Si.

376
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,238
How is that possible?

377
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,340
Bartenders are poor.

378
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,475
Let's go. Let's find guys to hook up with.

379
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,077
-Come on.
-Come on.

380
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,011
Wait up.

381
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,955
Wake up.

382
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,891
We're closing.

383
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,097
Where are your friends?

384
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,800
Should I call you a cab?

385
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,442
Hey.

386
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,279
Do you remember where you live?

387
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,721
TUHAO HOTEL

388
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,266
Where am I?

389
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,244
Wait.

390
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,779
I have to calm down.

391
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,715
Last night...

392
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,489
Nothing really happened, right?

393
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,460
What should I do?

394
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,898
<i>You're a student.</i>

395
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,333
<i>You didn't come home all night again.</i>

396
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,634
<i>You reek of alcohol.</i>

397
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,237
<i>You don't have any self-respect!</i>

398
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,571
She didn't have to hit me so hard.

399
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,139
Why did you only arrive just now?

400
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,244
What are you doing?
You come to school during lunch time.

401
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,678
You're cutting classes.

402
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,814
What does it matter to you?

403
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,082
I...

404
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,817
Hey.

405
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,887
Were you waiting for me here?

406
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,823
Are you stupid? How is that possible?

407
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,559
I just happened to pass by
on the way to the canteen, okay?

408
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,593
Canteen?

409
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,228
Isn't that the opposite direction?

410
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,732
You're such a nag.
Can't I take the longer route?

411
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,233
Don't try to change the "object", okay?

412
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,235
It's the subject, you idiot.

413
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,170
You...

414
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,172
What do you want to do?

415
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,308
I should ask you.
Why do you have such a violent reaction?

416
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,643
Why is it red over here?

417
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,012
My mom hit me.

418
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,946
Your mom?

419
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,814
Because I didn't go...

420
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,216
Didn't what?

421
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,218
I didn't return her call.

422
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,552
That's why she hit me.

423
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,255
That's the reason your mom
hit you this bad?

424
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,224
You know my mom is very violent.

425
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,759
She always hit my dad too.

426
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,662
Your mom is so similar to you.

427
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,829
Who says so?

428
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,731
Let's go.

429
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:53,699
Go where?

430
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,934
To eat.

431
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,902
You ordered too much food.

432
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,238
There are only a few of us.
How can we finish all this?

433
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,173
You usually just eat cheap stuff.

434
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,242
You're so thin. You should eat more.

435
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,878
Are there more?

436
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,547
Young Master Daoming Si, your bill.

437
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,782
I'll pay for it myself.

438
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,350
Do you want to embarrass me?

439
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,584
Give me a pen.

440
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,555
I wasn't taught to make girls pay.

441
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,225
Eat up.

442
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,927
Why aren't you eating? Eat more.

443
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,496
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

444
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,100
Here, finish this too.

445
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,135
Come on. Eat first.

446
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,439
-Eat more. There's chicken here.
-Hey.

447
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,274
I ordered these for her, not for you.

448
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,242
Why are you eating so much food?

449
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,143
Shan...

450
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,325
Eat.

451
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,995
Why aren't you eating?

452
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,397
Does your face still hurt?
I'll order food that is easier to chew.

453
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,032
There's no need.

454
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,735
I'm just not too hungry.

455
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,770
Even so, you should still eat.

456
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,506
You're so sweet.

457
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,675
Shancai, let me tell you.

458
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,479
I've never seen Daoming Si care
so much about someone before.

459
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,148
You have to be careful, though,

460
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,483
he's very possessive.

461
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,219
If you talk to any guy apart from us,

462
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,921
he might kill you and that guy.

463
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,757
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

464
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,232
<i>If he finds out
about what happened this morning,</i>

465
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,234
<i>not only will Daoming Si kill me,</i>

466
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,668
<i>I'll...</i>

467
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:48,347
SHANCAI IS A SLUT

468
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,650
POOR, SLUTTY

469
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,123
SLUTTY

470
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:03,262
-Slutty and poor Shancai
-<i>I'd surely be bullied again.</i>

471
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,031
I don't want that to happen!

472
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,900
What... are you doing?

473
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,968
Nothing.

474
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,037
I want to go to the restroom.

475
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:22,781
<i>That was close.</i>

476
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,050
<i>I don't think he noticed anything.</i>

477
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,719
<i>Since I won't see that foreigner again,</i>

478
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:32,024
<i>I should just treat last night
as a secret that never happened.</i>

479
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,228
<i>Though I was only in my undergarments
when I woke up,</i>

480
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:39,231
<i>I think nothing really happened.</i>

481
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:43,168
<i>I should feel something
since it's my first time.</i>

482
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,956
If it doesn't hurt, I should be fine.

483
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,967
Qinghe.

484
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,368
Why are you here?

485
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,302
Nothing.

486
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,005
I saw that foreigner from last night
when I came to school earlier.

487
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,508
He asked me to give this letter to you.

488
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,076
Why is he writing you a letter?

489
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,377
I don't know.

490
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,913
I think I need to go
to the restroom again.

491
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,082
Shancai, do you have diarrhea?

492
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,103
What?

493
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,738
Two o'clock this afternoon?

494
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,245
What are you doing
in front of the ladies' room?

495
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,147
Nothing.

496
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,115
I was checking the reason

497
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,883
the ladies' room is always
beside the men's room.

498
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,084
It's nothing.

499
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,354
Men's room? There's no men's room here.

500
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,225
Why... why are you here?

501
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,226
Why did you bump into me?

502
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,161
Why did you take so long?

503
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,230
Meizuo and Ximen are leaving.

504
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,731
Then you should leave too.

505
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,234
-I'm leaving too. Bye.
-Hey.

506
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,435
Where are you going?

507
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,337
Something urgent came up.

508
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,508
Sorry, I should go this way. Bye.

509
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,884
Hey, Shancai.

510
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,288
What are you doing?

511
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,290
What do you mean? We've already...

512
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,226
Hey.

513
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,162
Shancai, you're screaming too loudly.

514
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,430
So what if I scream loudly?

515
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,132
Do you have any manners?
While I was drunk, you took me to a hotel!

516
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,535
I don't know where you live.

517
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,238
I can only take you to a hotel, of course.

518
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,772
Did you do anything to me?

519
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,142
Yes, I helped you remove your clothes.

520
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:06,979
Why did you hit me?

521
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,147
Why did you remove my clothes?
You're so shameless!

522
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,950
You were so drunk.

523
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,152
And you puked all over yourself.

524
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,155
You were so filthy and smelly.

525
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,625
I had to clean you up

526
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,426
so that you can sleep.

527
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,428
Then you've seen everything.

528
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,297
No.

529
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:30,068
I asked the hotel's female staff
to help remove your clothes

530
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,670
and clean you up.

531
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,572
Is that true?

532
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,539
Yes.

533
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,845
Then why are you here today?

534
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,813
I came to return your ID.

535
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,981
My ID?

536
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,383
Why do you have my ID?

537
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:49,488
Because we needed an ID
to check in the hotel.

538
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,759
I forgot to return it to you
after registration.

539
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:59,765
So you mean nothing happened between us?

540
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,067
Of course.

541
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,236
That's great!

542
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,337
Shancai.

543
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,108
<i>You have to be careful, though,</i>

544
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,510
he's very possessive.

545
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,346
If you talk to any guy apart from us,

546
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,049
<i>he might kill you and that guy.</i>

547
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,951
Who is this foreigner?

548
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,286
He was just asking for directions.

549
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,221
Do you need to shake hands
when asking for directions?

550
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,156
He was just thanking me.

551
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,057
Thank you.

552
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,291
Let go of his hand!

553
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,028
Do you think you can fool me
with such a bad excuse?

554
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,596
Are you kidding me?

555
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:37,069
Hi, I just came from Germany.
I'm not familiar with the place.

556
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,338
Please tell me if there's
a cheap hotel nearby.

557
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,772
<i>This foreigner is quick-witted.</i>

558
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,575
<i>Daoming Si must not know
what he's talking about.</i>

559
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:47,779
I don't know any cheap hotels,
but I do know some five-star ones.

560
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,184
If you're interested,
I can tell you where they are.

561
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,819
You're so incredible.

562
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,388
Daoming Si, what language
are you two speaking?

563
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,223
German.

564
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,558
German?

565
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,959
You know how to speak German?

566
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,695
How can you be so incredible?

567
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,730
Of course.

568
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,231
I studied primary school in Switzerland.

569
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,533
And we had to study four languages there.

570
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,303
As the successor
of the Daoming Enterprise,

571
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,739
I have to speak at least five languages.

572
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,809
This is the first time
I've had so much respect for you.

573
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,979
You only found out now
that I am a man of "size"?

574
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,547
It's "sense."

575
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,350
You know five languages,
but your English is so bad.

576
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,487
What other languages do you know?

577
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,021
Tell me.

578
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,523
I'll speak some Italian for you first.

579
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,625
-Okay.
-<i>Sarò solo un po 'di italiano.</i>

580
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,960
That's incredible!

581
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,395
What does that mean?

582
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,563
"I only know how to speak
a little Italian."

583
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,799
What about other languages?
Let me hear them.

584
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:41,800
I'll speak some French.

585
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,637
<i>Le français est ce que je pense
est le plus romantique</i>.

586
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,809
What does that mean?

587
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,145
I think French
is the most romantic language.

588
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,212
That's incredible!

589
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,882
What do you think?
I'm "impressing", right?

590
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,383
It's "impressive."

591
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,951
Your Chinese is bad as well.

592
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,254
Hey, lousy foreigner! Where are you going?

593
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,822
Hey, lousy foreigner! Where are you going?

594
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:04,790
What are you doing?

595
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,625
Of course, he'll leave
after asking for directions.

596
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,959
Why are you asking him to come back?

597
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,628
Why do you like hooking up with strangers?

598
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,863
And you're so friendly to them.
What's the matter with you?

599
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,399
-When did I do that?
-That's how you are!

600
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,802
So what if I do that?
What right do you have to interfere?

601
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:17,936
We're not dating anyway.

602
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,541
Aren't we dating?

603
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,883
Daoming Si.

604
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,686
<i>What a strange person.</i>

605
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,922
<i>He makes me feel like
I did something wrong.</i>

606
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,688
-Hey, Ximen.
-What?

607
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,023
I have a high-class hairstylist at home.

608
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,692
Why do you have to come here?

609
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,529
That's because Bella's
haircutting skills are great.

610
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,231
Save it.

611
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,799
Don't you think we know?

612
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,870
You want to get girl number five.
That's why you came here for a haircut.

613
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,839
I'm counting on you, Bella.

614
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,307
There's no use counting on Bella.

615
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,743
You've been here for so long.
She didn't even say hi to you.

616
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,746
You don't get it.

617
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,549
Girls always say yes and mean no.

618
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,184
The more innocent a girl is,

619
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:42,654
the more she won't show her affections
to the one she likes.

620
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,591
You mean...

621
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,295
even when a girl doesn't admit it,

622
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,665
actually she likes that person
deep inside?

623
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,700
-That's how Shancai is.
-That's how Shancai is.

624
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,637
Did I mention Shancai?

625
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,259
Baihe.

626
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,761
You asked me to come out.

627
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,229
Why are you so late?

628
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,698
Because of this.

629
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,632
What is it?

630
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,801
You're showing off your admirer's letter?

631
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,636
No, take a look first.

632
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,244
What is this?

633
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,180
Why do you have this?

634
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,948
I don't know.

635
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,285
I saw it in my mailbox
when I came out earlier.

636
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:24,222
I think somebody wants to give us a chance
to enforce justice on heaven's behalf.

637
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,357
Great. Enjoy a good show.

638
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,365
Hotel.

639
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,366
Is that Shancai?

640
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,934
-Who's that?
-She's even with a foreigner.

641
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,670
-Someone took their pictures.
-Wow, how could this happen?

642
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,772
-They went to the hotel?
-Yeah.

643
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,708
-How could this happen?
-I didn't expect she will do this.

644
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,478
Shancai.

645
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,746
Li Zhen.

646
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,280
Go home. Don't go to school?

647
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,181
Why?

648
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,217
What if Daoming Si gives you a hard time?

649
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,151
Daoming Si?

650
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,819
Why would he give me a hard time?

651
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,256
Don't you know the pictures
are already on the bulletin board?

652
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,660
What pictures?

653
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,462
Isn't that Shancai?

654
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,698
Why are there such pictures?

655
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,699
She's so pretentious.

656
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,535
She's even acting like
Daoming Si's girlfriend.

657
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,237
Daoming doesn't know this yet.

658
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,339
She'd surely get a red card
when he finds out.

659
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:15,707
Don't wait for him to give her one.

660
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,175
Let's start tomorrow.

661
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,376
Isn't this fun?

662
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,145
We can play games again.

663
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:29,521
<i>Good times don't last long</i>

664
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:36,027
<i>Every day is not a Sunday</i>

665
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:39,764
<i>After we part tonight</i>

666
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,366
It's so strange.

667
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,704
-Why does my heart hurt?
-<i>When will you come back again?</i>

668
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:50,475
I hate that guy.

669
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,114
If he didn't ask me out for a date,

670
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,683
people wouldn't think we're together.

671
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,719
It's all his fault.

672
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,625
However, I don't want to see
how sad he would be.

673
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,597
No, I have to go tomorrow.

674
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,233
If I don't,

675
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,202
it would look like I'm guilty.

676
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,472
I have to go.

677
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,440
I won't get defeated by them.

678
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,683
What a beautiful morning.

679
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,953
I'm the only one who looks
like a prisoner going to her execution.

680
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,828
I can do this.

681
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,363
I can surpass this.

682
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,845
How strange.

683
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,747
Why aren't they doing anything?

684
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,671
You bunch of jerks!

685
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,740
You dared to drag my motorbike around!

686
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,810
These things are only ridden
by poor people.

687
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,611
I want to destroy it.
What can you do about it?

688
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,313
Why are you all so bad?

689
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,882
You parasite! Give me back my motorbike!

690
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,217
Shancai, it's dangerous!

691
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,452
Give me back my motorbike! Let it go!

692
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,588
-Let go. It's dangerous!
-You jerk!

693
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,489
Let it go!

694
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,924
Shancai, it's dangerous!

695
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,926
Give me back my motorbike!

696
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,060
Don't interfere!

697
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,128
Give me back my motorbike!

698
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,396
What are you going?

699
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,397
Do you want to die?

700
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,132
Daoming Si, don't you know?

701
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,433
Shancai betrayed you.

702
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,801
Look at these pictures.

703
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,770
They're just doing that for you.

704
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,138
Look at these pictures.

705
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,609
Look how sweet they are.

706
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,511
They even went to the hotel.

707
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,348
She fooled us all, you know?

708
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,817
Qianhui, you're framing me again.

709
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,018
Why are you doing this?

710
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,887
Why are you trying to frame me?

711
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,056
Do you know what you've done?

712
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,791
You even want to blame it on me?

713
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,060
I told you before

714
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,528
that she's a bad girl, right?

715
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,462
You're lying!

716
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,363
Daoming Si.

717
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,798
I don't care what other people think.

718
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,199
I just want you to believe me.

719
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,400
That's just a misunderstanding.

720
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,768
I don't care what others think of me.

721
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,303
You have to believe me.

722
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,472
Daoming Si, don't let her fool you.

723
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,808
She's just doing this
so that you'll pity her.

724
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,243
Look at this picture carefully.

725
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,911
Do you see all these pictures?

726
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,446
Have you seen this foreigner before?

727
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,214
If they really didn't go to the hotel,

728
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,216
how come they have these pictures?

729
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:46,784
Look carefully.

730
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,219
Don't be fooled by her.

731
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,888
I'm doing this for your own good.

732
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,460
Shancai.

733
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,429
You betrayed me.

734
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,968
Daoming Si, you jerk!

735
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,904
You believe that girl.

736
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,405
You idiot!

737
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,642
Daoming Si.

738
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,176
You're so noisy, you shameless girl!

739
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,311
You got dumped, right?

740
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,979
Come on.

741
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,715
You jerk! Give me back my motorbike!

742
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,317
Shancai, it's dangerous!

743
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,219
Give me back my motorbike!

744
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,620
Shancai, don't go there!

745
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,264
Qinghe.

746
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,933
Qinghe, are you okay?

747
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,238
Qinghe.

748
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,706
Shancai.

749
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,470
Shancai, you got hurt so badly.

750
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,939
What will you tell your mom if she asks?

751
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,075
Is it still visible
even if I put my hair down this way?

752
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:17,976
Yes.

753
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,011
Then I can only dodge her.

754
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,546
-I can't let my mom see me.
-Okay.

755
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,059
Hey, Shancai.

756
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,594
My God!

757
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,230
Shancai, what happened to your face?

758
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,368
-What happened?
-Mrs. Dong, because...

759
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,436
Because when Shancai was on her motorbike,

760
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,739
a police dog suddenly came out.

761
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,173
Shancai wasn't able to dodge him.

762
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,943
She wasn't able to hit the brakes
when she turned to the side

763
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,244
and she hit a tree, so...

764
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,445
Did she hit a tree?

765
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,580
-Yes.
-That's how she get hurt.

766
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,116
-Did anything happen to the tree?
-No.

767
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,017
-No?
-No.

768
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,084
Gosh, that was close.

769
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,286
I was afraid the school would want me
to pay for that tree.

770
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,355
-They won't.
-How can I afford it?

771
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,823
Gosh, Shancai. I'm sorry.

772
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,493
I'm also very worried about you.

773
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,394
Here, sit down.

774
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,229
I'll get the first aid kit.

775
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,565
You'll get better after I put
some medicine on you.

776
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,235
You look so bad this way.

777
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,236
Gosh.

778
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,105
Why did you do all this

779
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,073
just for a dog? A dog.

780
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,242
You wouldn't be able to save a stray dog.

781
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,910
You'll turn into a stray girl yourself.

782
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,245
And...

783
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,379
Shancai.

784
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,148
Gosh.

785
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,949
You have to be careful going forward.

786
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,820
Remember that the face
is very important for a girl.

787
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,755
I'll use iodine...

788
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,223
Li Zhen, thank you.

789
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,225
-Please take care of Shancai.
-Okay.

790
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,960
-Please.
-Okay.

791
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,932
You know that Shancai and Daoming Si
are dating, right?

792
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,567
You have to help them.

793
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,803
Create some opportunities
for them in school.

794
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,473
So that she and Daoming Si can,
you know...

795
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,407
Mom.

796
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:59,610
You know,
so that she won't get hurt again.

797
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,545
Let's put some medicine.

798
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,215
It's good that it hurts.

799
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,116
Don't be scared.

800
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:06,884
It's good that it hurts.

801
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,352
Or else how would it get better?

802
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,654
<i>You have to endure it.</i>

803
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,155
<i>Gosh.</i>

804
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,494
Hey, Ah Si.
Until when will you be drinking?

805
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,629
We are so bored.

806
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,564
There are so many mosquitos here.

807
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,966
And there are no girls.

808
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,367
There's nothing to do.

809
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:59,203
We're not the type
who would come here to drink.

810
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,401
