1
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,524
Shancai.

2
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,758
You look good.

3
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,393
Yeah.

4
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,895
The air here is fresh.

5
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,563
I'm exposed to the sun every day.

6
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,532
See, my skin is tanned now.

7
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,466
You went missing.

8
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,435
Everyone is worried about you.

9
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,469
I saw you on TV,

10
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,104
so I called everyone to meet you here.

11
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,306
Qinghe.

12
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,574
Thank you so much.

13
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,411
There is no need to thank me.

14
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,380
Xiaoyou and I both feel so guilty.

15
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,616
That's okay. You don't need
to feel guilty.

16
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,150
I'm fine here.

17
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,719
It's like a vacation.

18
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,554
Besides, I live with my parents again.

19
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,455
Shancai.

20
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,690
Go back with us.

21
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,927
You should go back with us,
or I'll feel guilty.

22
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,529
Huaze Lei's money is not a problem,

23
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,564
I'll pay him back for you.

24
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,733
You helped my family,

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,167
so now, it's my time to repay you back.

26
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,169
Qinghe, I appreciate your kindness.

27
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,039
Don't feel guilty.

28
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,375
I'm only doing what I'm supposed to do.

29
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,177
Your family was dragged into this,

30
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,480
and that's why I feel sorry for you.

31
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,815
Shancai.

32
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,085
We know the reason why you are hiding.

33
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,087
But you see,

34
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,057
even if your love was taken away from you,

35
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,192
you didn't lose your friends.

36
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,928
Shancai, we're all hoping
you'll go back with us.

37
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,131
Maybe except Daoming Si.

38
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,768
Qinghe, stop talking nonsense.

39
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,870
That's not nonsense.

40
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,571
It's a fact.

41
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,708
Didn't you say Daoming Si didn't want
to pick up Shancai?

42
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,778
That he had nothing to do with her.

43
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,513
Shancai, I'm telling you,

44
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,482
many girls are chasing
after Daoming Si at school.

45
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,517
Qinghe.

46
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,751
You talk too much.

47
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,853
I'm telling the truth.

48
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,323
If it's true, then I'm relieved.

49
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,026
Because I have nothing to do
with Daoming Si now.

50
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,561
Yeah, so you don't have to hide anymore.

51
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,729
Go back to university with us.

52
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,400
You should go back with us.

53
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,017
Fine, I'll go back with you.

54
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,924
Mister, your ice cream.

55
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,479
I heard your boyfriend is here
to pick you up.

56
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,315
My boyfriend isn't here to pick me up.

57
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,017
They're my other friends.

58
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,754
Are you really going back?

59
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:53,994
That's great.

60
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,399
Starting tomorrow,

61
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,701
I'll run the restaurant by myself again.

62
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,938
I'll be so lonely.

63
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,108
I feel everyone is leaving me.

64
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,442
Ah Song.

65
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,045
I was joking with you.

66
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,514
I'll be lonely,

67
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,051
but your happiness
is the most important thing.

68
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,520
Even though I'm lonely,

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,756
as long as you will have
your happy ending,

70
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,224
I will be happy for you.

71
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,493
There won't be any happy ending.

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,962
Even if I go back to university,

73
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,764
it will be meaningless,

74
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,200
because everything is over now.

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,171
Shancai.

76
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,508
You will regret
if you keep being stubborn like this.

77
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,410
You have to be realistic.

78
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,478
If you love him,
you find a way to solve the problem.

79
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,882
If you can't let go of your feelings,
you have to fight for it.

80
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,617
Ah Song, our situation is different.

81
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,986
I can't be so selfish.

82
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,890
I can't build a relationship
by hurting my friends.

83
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,658
It's true you don't want to hurt people.

84
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,528
But with what you're doing now,
aren't you hurting the people you love?

85
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,596
And yourself.

86
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,833
I've never loved you.

87
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,972
If I loved you,
I wouldn't leave like this.

88
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,392
<i>There were many times</i>

89
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,060
<i>when I felt I was in love with Daoming Si.</i>

90
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,107
Ah Song.

91
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,410
If one day, Ah Xiang comes back,

92
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,945
you have to treasure her.

93
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,048
Promise me, you will find happiness.

94
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,686
I will.

95
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,254
I will.

96
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,358
I've almost saved enough money
to travel with Ah Xiang.

97
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,662
You too.

98
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,996
Promise me,

99
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,432
regardless of whether you or not
you two end up together,

100
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,800
you have to find your happiness.

101
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,909
Go for it, Metal Wire Artist.

102
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,579
Your nobleman riding on a pig is great.

103
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,516
That's a noblewoman riding on a horse.

104
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,551
She's a noblewoman riding a horse.

105
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,053
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,056
A nobleman riding on a pig?

107
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,691
The name is really hard to remember.

108
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,725
Besides...

109
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,160
it's hard to figure out.

110
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,562
I was going to explain it to you that day,

111
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,365
but you weren't paying much attention.

112
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,801
I thought I was artistic that day.

113
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,402
Thank you.

114
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,071
Young Master Qinghe, thank you.

115
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,772
-Thank you for your efforts.
-Thanks.

116
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,441
Mom, Dad. We're leaving now.

117
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,709
I will be back on school break.

118
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,277
Okay, you should go back
to university now.

119
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,411
Got it.

120
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,413
-Remember to come back on school break.
-I will, dad.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,381
-Okay.
-Mom, dad, goodbye.

122
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,282
Goodbye.

123
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,150
-Ma'am, goodbye.
-Shancai.

124
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,219
Take good care of yourself.

125
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,387
I will.

126
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,822
Okay. Mom, goodbye.

127
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,390
-Okay.
-Dad, goodbye.

128
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,424
Okay, goodbye.

129
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,226
-Young Master Huaze.
-Young Master Huaze.

130
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,028
Thank you so much.

131
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,396
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

132
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,231
Thank you, Young Master Huaze.

133
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,210
-Honey.
-Yeah?

134
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,479
Actually, we got it all wrong.

135
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,315
Shancai is having a rough time

136
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,584
living by herself in Taipei.

137
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,352
Yes.

138
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,024
I thought Young Master Daoming Si
truly loved our Shancai.

139
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,160
I think we're overthinking things.

140
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>Did Huaze Lei call you?</i>

141
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,836
They found Shancai.

142
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,671
She's coming back to university.

143
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,673
Huaze Lei told us to go
to the student affairs

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,142
to help her re-enrollment procedure.

145
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,276
Ah Si, if you help out,

146
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,844
it will be a lot easier.

147
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,212
You can take care of this yourself.

148
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,715
It's just a petty thing,
why won't you help Shancai?

149
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,950
You can do it yourself.

150
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,185
Just do what you have to do.

151
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,692
<i>I sacrificed a lot for her,
leaving everything behind me.</i>

152
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,895
<i>For her,</i>

153
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,664
<i>I'm even willing
to give up Daoming Corporation.</i>

154
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,466
<i>But now,</i>

155
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,568
<i>I finally understand,</i>

156
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,471
<i>somethings aren't meant to happen.</i>

157
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,506
<i>The more I give,</i>

158
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,141
<i>the greater the pain I get.</i>

159
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,595
Huaze Lei, could you please stop the car?

160
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:58,698
Stop the car.

161
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,741
<i>That girl might be...</i>

162
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,410
Shancai, where are you going?

163
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,713
You're back.

164
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,482
Yeah, I'm back.

165
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,687
<i>Great, he's finally with her.</i>

166
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,765
<i>Ah Song.</i>

167
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>Don't forget our promise at the seaside.</i>

168
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,935
<i>You have to find your happiness.</i>

169
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,738
Shancai, what are you looking at?

170
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,506
Nothing.

171
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,408
-Let's go.
-Okay.

172
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,023
<i>Ah Song chose the right path.</i>

173
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,591
<i>But I,</i>

174
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,393
<i>on that rainy night,</i>

175
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,395
<i>gave up that path,</i>

176
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,330
<i>and left that place.</i>

177
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,432
<i>Now, all I can do is to move on</i>

178
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,067
<i>and go on a different path.</i>

179
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,221
Why did you find such a huge house for me?

180
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,155
Is it?

181
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,723
I think it's just moderate.

182
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,360
That's because we have different opinions
on house size.

183
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,195
I've settled everything with the landlord.

184
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,563
This place is fully furnished.

185
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,732
Besides all these,
many are still at the back.

186
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,434
I'll get someone to move them
for you tomorrow.

187
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,035
That's fine. I can move them myself.

188
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,204
Why don't you live at my house?

189
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,773
You don't need to pay the rent,
and I'll be able to protect you.

190
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,876
Qinghe, I've already troubled you enough.

191
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,478
You know me very well.

192
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,913
It will really make me feel embarrassed

193
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,715
if you help me again this time.

194
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,783
Thank you so much.

195
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,853
Don't worry, I can take care of myself.

196
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,366
Shancai, it's been a while
since you left school.

197
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,167
How do you feel?

198
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,637
It feels weird.

199
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,606
Isn't that Shancai?

200
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,408
Didn't she drop out?

201
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,609
Why did she come back?

202
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,544
-Yeah.
-It's so strange.

203
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,746
It's F4.

204
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:01,781
Huaze Lei.

205
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,417
Shancai.

206
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,920
She was just here.

207
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,255
Why did she disappear?

208
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,592
Shancai, why are you hiding there?

209
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,595
Yeah, why am I hiding here?

210
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,298
You should go greet Daoming Si,

211
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,799
then everything will be back to normal.

212
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,235
Go talk things out with him.
I will be there with you.

213
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,872
There's nothing to talk out actually.

214
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,241
I have nothing to do with him.

215
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,915
Ah Si, grow up, will you?

216
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,819
You and Shancai pretended
to have not seen each other.

217
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,021
You're like two kids.

218
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,592
Never mind.

219
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,763
She's the one hiding from me.
Who is the immature here?

220
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,307
I think you should settle things
and just break up with her.

221
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,577
Huaze Lei, what are you talking about?

222
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,248
Didn't the two of you set
a dating deadline?

223
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,151
That deadline is almost due.

224
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,254
Ah Si, just admit it.

225
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,490
Don't push Shancai away from you.

226
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,561
Stop adding to the problem, will you?

227
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,298
I asked you to pick her up
in that fishing village,

228
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,734
because I have a purpose.

229
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,603
That is, to ask you
to officially break up with her.

230
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,376
Huaze Lei.

231
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,678
Is that what you want?

232
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,716
We each have our own stand.

233
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,019
I'm just telling you the truth.

234
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:52,291
It does not matter
who will gain the most out of this.

235
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,138
Huaze Lei, what do you mean by that?

236
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,639
Meizuo.

237
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,275
I believe Huaze Lei has his own opinion.

238
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,843
You should just be quiet.

239
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,186
Shancai.

240
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,488
I have something to tell you.

241
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,137
Why are you alone?

242
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,705
Where are Huaze Huaze Lei and the others?

243
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,809
I was with them.

244
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:17,877
I just left.

245
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,354
Don't you have something to tell me?

246
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,562
Can't you stand being with me
for a long time?

247
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,898
Is it so painful for you to stay
with me here?

248
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:39,966
No, it's not.

249
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,668
You said you had something to tell me.

250
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,305
You went missing and hid at some seaside
without telling anyone.

251
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,608
What were you thinking?

252
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,111
Life at the seaside was great.

253
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,846
It's like going on a vacation.

254
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,481
I had no stress there.

255
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,483
Life there is relaxing.

256
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,590
Don't you have something to tell me?

257
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,628
How are things going with you recently?

258
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,399
And?

259
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,108
I'm so disappointed in you.

260
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,548
Every time I open up to you
about serious stuff,

261
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,716
you start talking about unrelated things.

262
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,351
You will either hide or pretend to sleep.

263
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,222
Don't you understand what a confession is?

264
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,962
If you don't know how to face
your feelings seriously,

265
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,965
I will stop being your puppet.

266
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,967
Again and again.

267
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,338
I feel like an idiot.

268
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,574
I've had enough.

269
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,843
Daoming Si.

270
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,680
From now on,

271
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,383
I won't do anything for you.

272
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,626
What I'm saying is...

273
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,630
You hid when you saw me today, right?

274
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,203
You don't need to do that anymore.

275
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,506
From now on,

276
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,643
we will go on our separate ways.

277
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,047
I've made a promise to you,

278
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,218
that I'll let you go.

279
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,756
-I'm leaving now, goodbye.
-Daoming Si, wait.

280
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,829
I kept this necklace in my bag.

281
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,531
I will return it to you today.

282
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,054
<i>I love you.</i>

283
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,123
<i>For a moment,</i>

284
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,892
<i>I almost subconsciously said it out loud.</i>

285
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,895
<i>I almost left my pride, my dignity,</i>

286
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,797
<i>and my friends' families behind,</i>

287
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:25,898
<i>just to tell you</i>

288
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,466
<i>that I love you.</i>

289
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,893
Shancai, what are you doing here?

290
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,961
I can't find it. What should I do?

291
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,997
Huaze Huaze Lei,
please hurry and help me find it.

292
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,131
I can't find it.

293
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,599
Where is it?

294
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,519
I found it.

295
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,896
<i>I now know what loving someone is about.</i>

296
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,768
<i>Even after all the sacrifices,
I can't deny how I truly feel.</i>

297
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,904
<i>I can't stop myself from loving him.</i>

298
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,532
Have you ordered yet?

299
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,304
One filet mignon, thank you.

300
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,239
What's up?

301
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,674
Ah Si.

302
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,442
It's about Shancai.

303
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,411
What do you think of her?

304
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,546
Nothing.

305
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:55,815
Are you sure?

306
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,884
From now on, Shancai's life,

307
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,586
feelings,

308
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,921
and future,

309
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,856
are all none of your business?

310
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,024
I've already told you.

311
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,659
Whether you believe it
or not is up to you.

312
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,161
This is what you want to discuss
with me here today?

313
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,503
Huaze Lei.

314
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,673
You never cared
about other people's business before.

315
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:23,909
I know.

316
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,511
It's because of Shancai.

317
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,214
That's why you're so concerned, right?

318
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,585
That's right.

319
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,787
Ah Si.

320
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,989
I told Ximen and Meizuo before

321
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,858
that I wouldn't come between
your relationship.

322
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,627
But if now, like what you've said,

323
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,562
you have nothing to do with her...

324
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,299
then I'm asking you one last time,

325
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,636
have you decided to stop loving Shancai?

326
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,904
You're so annoying.

327
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,808
Ah Si,

328
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,143
I'm telling you, I've decided.

329
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,612
You've decided what?

330
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,882
I've decided to pursue Shancai.

331
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,756
Be my guest.

332
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,994
I have nothing to do with her anyway.

333
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,229
Then I'll frankly tell you

334
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,133
that the feelings I have for her
is more than friendship.

335
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,102
But in the past,

336
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,571
I gave up because of you.

337
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,740
I sincerely gave you my blessing.

338
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,276
Now I wonder,

339
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,579
if giving up was worth it or not.

340
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,017
If you've given up Shancai,

341
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,253
I want your blessing,

342
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,757
just like the blessing I gave in the past.

343
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,465
You don't have to tell this to me.

344
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,302
No matter whether you feel it's necessary
or not,

345
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,205
I want to tell you about this.

346
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,177
I'm telling you again,

347
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
it's unnecessary for you
to tell me this decision.

348
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,915
You want my blessing...

349
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,452
I think it's nonsense.

350
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,534
You've missed so many classes.

351
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,302
Can you understand them
when you're catching up?

352
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,570
Of course, I can't.

353
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,405
I wasn't good at this before,

354
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,175
and now I have so much to catch up.
I can't figure it out at all.

355
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,312
Should I ask my dad to find you a tutor?

356
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,647
A tutor?

357
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,849
There are university students working
as tutors,

358
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,317
while I still need a tutor to teach me?

359
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,552
You're right.

360
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,654
Shancai.

361
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,022
Let's go.

362
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,724
I'm here to pick you up.

363
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,594
You don't need to drive Shancai home.
I can do that.

364
00:24:56,595 --> 00:25:00,232
It's only common for a boy to pick up
the girl that he loves after school.

365
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,670
When did you start talking so cringy
like Ximen and the others?

366
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,773
Huaze Lei, you're not much of a talker.

367
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,009
Why are you suddenly in the mood
to joke me?

368
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,580
I have already asked professors
to print out study notes for you.

369
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,581
Let's go.

370
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,317
I think you need to cram to catch up.

371
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,652
You'll help me study?

372
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,389
Qinghe, I'm leaving now.

373
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,390
Bye-bye.

374
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,597
Why is Huaze Huaze Lei so irritating.

375
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,499
Every time I want to help out Shancai,

376
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,833
he steals the limelight.

377
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,970
I can't believe that after Daoming Si,

378
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,571
he's now getting into the scene.

379
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,011
It's a really weird thing to do.

380
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,817
-I can't take it.
-No, I mean seriously,

381
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,419
would you do that kind of things?

382
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,387
He will.

383
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,889
He definitely will, okay?

384
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,061
Call Huaze Lei and get him here.

385
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,601
He didn't pick up.

386
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,737
Leave a message.

387
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,606
There's no need for that.

388
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,543
Huaze Lei must be busy right now.

389
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,212
I think he's with Shancai.

390
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,086
Don't you know?

391
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,322
Huaze Lei started dating Shancai today.

392
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,227
You're drunk.

393
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,696
With Shancai?

394
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,364
I'm not drunk.

395
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,267
In the past few days,

396
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,237
today's the day I've been most sober.

397
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:52,544
What happened?

398
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:55,881
It just happened.

399
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,585
What did Huaze Lei tell you?

400
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,321
Huaze Lei said,

401
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,023
if I gave up Shancai,

402
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,494
he wanted my blessing to them,

403
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,997
just like he gave us his blessing
back then.

404
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,907
What are you up to?

405
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,475
Nothing.

406
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,545
I have nothing to do with Shancai.

407
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:28,914
And?

408
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,957
Like what Huaze Lei said,

409
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,730
I will give them my sincere blessing.

410
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:51,303
You have no idea how Huaze Lei's face
looked like when he told me this.

411
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,472
He was so serious.

412
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,507
He was so serious that I wanted to laugh.

413
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,410
Why was he so serious, it's not some...

414
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,016
He used to...

415
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,019
That face.

416
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,887
Wait a minute.

417
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,202
<i>Huaze Lei.</i>

418
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,304
You wouldn't be involved
in this kind of mess before.

419
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,339
Why are you doing this now?

420
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,541
I feel less and less close to you.

421
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,176
You aren't someone
who would do those things.

422
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,412
You know me very well.

423
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,914
It's just that the situation is different.

424
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:48,587
Do you think Ah Si and Shancai's
relationship will still be saved?

425
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,390
You're right.

426
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,792
But after you stepped in,

427
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,396
didn't the tension between you,
Ah Si and, Shancai returned?

428
00:29:58,697 --> 00:29:59,898
Maybe it did.

429
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,467
What did Ah Si say?

430
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,569
How could you smile right now?

431
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,038
He was totally wasted last night.

432
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,439
He said he was celebrating for you.

433
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,974
Celebrating, my ass.

434
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,743
Ximen and I both know
he's avoiding the pain.

435
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,480
I'm not speaking for Ah Si,

436
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,950
but must Shancai be the one
replacing Jing?

437
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,852
Don't describe me
as such a bad person, okay?

438
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,721
No one is going to replace Jing.

439
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,923
Shancai is not her replacement.

440
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,292
They are two complete individuals.

441
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,930
Then why are you making things
more complicated with Shancai and Jing?

442
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,833
The most important thing is,
Shancai was with Ah Si before.

443
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,536
That's the point.

444
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,404
Ah Si was with Shancai before,

445
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,074
but he isn't anymore.

446
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,743
Maybe instead of advising me,

447
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,145
you should take more time to tell Ah Si

448
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,049
to stop avoiding reality

449
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,285
and start facing his feelings.

450
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,493
I still can't understand

451
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,795
why he rushed into making
this decision overnight.

452
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,231
This can't just be overnight.

453
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,936
Maybe Huaze Lei had been holding himself
for too long.

454
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,775
Daoming Si's ex-fiancée,
stop following me, okay?

455
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,411
Come on. I just want you
to take me to Shancai.

456
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,680
I haven't met her since she came back
from the fishing village.

457
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:25,283
-What are you up to?
-Please, I miss her so much.

458
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,186
Ximen, Meizuo.

459
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,755
You should ask them for help.

460
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,256
Fine.

461
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,024
Do you know where Shancai is?

462
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,060
No matter how I ask Qinghe,
he won't tell me.

463
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,064
Where is Shancai?

464
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,165
How should I know?

465
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,933
She's been with Huaze Huaze Lei lately.

466
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,301
I can't find her either.

467
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,504
Did Shancai make peace with Ah Si?

468
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,671
How is that even possible?

469
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,040
They are avoiding each other at school,
trying their best to hide.

470
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,443
If it weren't for Huaze Huaze Lei trying
to come up with excuses to hang out,

471
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,712
-she'd have nothing to do with F4.
-What are you talking about?

472
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,248
Shancai is with Huaze Huaze Lei
since she returned?

473
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,383
It seems so.

474
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,886
Ah Si said it was over
between him and Shancai.

475
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,023
Huaze Lei seems to be trying to start over
with Shancai.

476
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,959
Daoming Si deserves it.

477
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,861
It's nonsense.

478
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,102
Ah Si, listen to me.

479
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,971
I think Shancai must have a good reason
for this.

480
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:22,841
Reason?

481
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,845
I've had enough
with these nonsense excuses.

482
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,114
No matter if it's right or wrong,

483
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,149
can she be forgiven
just because she has a good reason?

484
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,186
I can't accept this.

485
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,026
And I'm telling you,

486
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,462
it's none of your business.

487
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,464
Stop following me.

488
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,784
Little fella, want some coffee?

489
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,954
It's interesting to drink coffee outdoors.

490
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,423
-Come on.
-Why are you still here?

491
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,091
What's with the attitude?

492
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,894
Have you ever met such a kind miss
treating you to a cup of coffee?

493
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,362
No offense.

494
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,498
-You are really--
-Fine, stop it, okay?

495
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:26,938
I'm telling you,

496
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,207
this is my first time drinking coffee
at this kind of place.

497
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,881
I don't know takeaway coffee
can be so disgusting.

498
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,215
How did they make this?

499
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,451
With dirt?

500
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,857
Ah Si.

501
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,392
It's still so hard to get along with you.

502
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,227
You're not gentle at all.

503
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,097
Do you remember how we first met?

504
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,432
You left me alone on the street.

505
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,601
You're still the same.

506
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,836
You haven't changed a bit.

507
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,774
But this is pretty normal,

508
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,777
because we grew up
in a different environment from others,

509
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,813
so we take everything for granted.

510
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,116
But for common people,

511
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,485
maybe it's something hard to accept.

512
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,387
So now,

513
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,289
we feel so much pain.

514
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,393
Don't blame yourself too much.

515
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,795
There are many things we can't change.

516
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,599
Why are girls always looking for excuses

517
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,202
to get away with disloyalty?

518
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,640
Why can't girls be pure and innocent?

519
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,646
I don't know what I'm talking about.

520
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,316
I don't want to continue this talk.

521
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,820
I feel my chest is going to burst.

522
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,423
Go home already.

523
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,825
Ah Si.

524
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,293
I don't want to see you like this.

525
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,661
You still have me.

526
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,975
I'm joking.

527
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,910
I want to comfort you.

528
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,414
I should go. You'd better go home now too.

529
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,584
Don't always frown like an old man,

530
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,586
or you won't look good.

531
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,655
I'm leaving now.

532
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,268
Why are you here?

533
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,403
To buy a cake.

534
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,507
I want this grass green cake.

535
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,976
Grass green? That's matcha.

536
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,010
To go?

537
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:20,845
Yes.

538
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,580
I remember the first time you came here.

539
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,683
Meizuo said you didn't like dessert
at all.

540
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,285
You bought that cake because you thought
it was cute, right?

541
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,154
I don't know you can remember
those little details.

542
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,157
Where's your friend, Xiaoyou?

543
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,491
Why didn't she come here today?

544
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,593
While I was in the fishing village,

545
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,128
she was working here alone.

546
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,496
Since I'm back now,

547
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,198
boss gave her a few days off.

548
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,566
Besides she's about to take an exam,

549
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,834
so she didn't come here today.

550
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,004
After you get off from work,
I'll drive you home.

551
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,906
There's no need for that.

552
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,741
Are you going to say,

553
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,243
"Picking up the girl that you love
from work is a normal thing to do"?

554
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,645
Because this is a cringy thing to say.

555
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,382
Hearing your words, I realized
that I've been picking you up recently.

556
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,852
I picked you up in the fishing village.
I picked you up at school.

557
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,387
And now.

558
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,289
You'll spoil me
if you keep doing like this.

559
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,293
Maybe there isn't much time left for me
to spoil you.

560
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:13,698
Maybe this period of time will be
my very important memory,

561
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,235
because this is my first time
not considering Ah Si's feelings,

562
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,473
and I can freely express my desire
to take care of you.

563
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:24,843
Huaze Lei.

564
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,412
Is my cake ready?

565
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,217
Qinghe and Xiaoyou are the best proofs.

566
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,519
Once the damage is done,

567
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,921
your love for Shancai will be
the cause of her pain.

568
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,523
Is this what you want?

569
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,391
Ximen, this is unfair.

570
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,527
If Shancai chose Huaze Lei,

571
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,095
this problem wouldn't disappear.

572
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,664
Huaze Lei's parents
might look down on Shancai, too.

573
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:47,899
It's not just Ah Si's.

574
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,568
Stop adding to the problem, will you?

575
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,904
Do you want to see
Huaze Lei and Ah Si fighting again?

576
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,739
Conflict is not what I want.

577
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,141
I'm just telling the truth.

578
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,277
The problem is here
no matter with whom Shancai is.

579
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,179
If that's the case,

580
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,948
why don't you let them
face their feelings?

581
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,088
I don't want to see F4 split up again.

582
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,358
Do you forget that feeling?

583
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,595
Ah Si.

584
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,464
You should move on.

585
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,966
You've broken up with Shancai.

586
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,034
It's the truth.

587
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,437
Don't dwell in the past.

588
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:27,839
Enough.

589
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,475
Stop talking to me.
I don't want to hear it.

590
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,112
Ah Si.

591
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,251
Ximen.

592
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,855
Maybe you made a point,

593
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,759
but I can't do it.

594
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,765
I'm not dwelling in the past,

595
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,603
because I've never really left it behind.

596
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,174
I realized now,

597
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,545
if I lost Shancai,

598
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,618
I might even lose my strength to breathe.

599
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,303
<i>Have you been used to living alone?</i>

600
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,838
Yeah.

601
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,406
I try to be busy with work,

602
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,841
so I won't have to think too much.

603
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,977
You talk like Jing.

604
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,745
Jing?

605
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,414
After I decided to come back from France,

606
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,450
Jing has been living alone.

607
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:47,986
That's her choice,

608
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,055
but I went there and then left away.

609
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,090
For Jing,

610
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,993
leaving her was worse
than not seeing her at all.

611
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,996
But she didn't blame me.

612
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,498
She chose to keep herself busy.

613
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:04,269
Do you regret?

614
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,207
I regret it,

615
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,578
because I gave up so easily,
thinking only of myself.

616
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,881
I regret not holding on a little longer.

617
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,516
Shancai.

618
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,918
Do you understand?

619
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,954
If you don't hold on long enough,

620
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:27,725
giving up will become
your biggest regret in life.

621
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,367
You are going against your true feelings
to reject Ah Si.

622
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,137
You'll regret it in the future,
just like me.

623
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,626
These lights are...

624
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:02,927
I don't know.

625
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,796
They weren't here when I went out.

626
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:29,954
Is that Ah Si?

627
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,257
The meteor necklace he gave you.

628
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,029
He's full of nonsense.

629
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,098
No.

630
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,799
Ah Si isn't full of nonsense.

631
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,868
He did it.

632
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,637
He decided not to give up.

633
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,407
He sticks to his feelings.

634
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,810
You know what?

635
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,313
That "holding on a little longer"
I talked about.

636
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,615
Ah Si did it.

637
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,454
I still think he's full of nonsense.

638
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,073
Shancai.

639
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,277
Good night.

640
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,140
Looking for us?

641
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,342
I thought you abandoned your buddies.

642
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,077
Meizuo.

643
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,413
I think Ah Si made a new decision.

644
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:14,051
A head-on conflict of you and Ah Si
is the last thing we want to see.

645
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,821
But as things are now,

646
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,289
it can't be avoided.

647
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:20,424
I know.

648
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,551
