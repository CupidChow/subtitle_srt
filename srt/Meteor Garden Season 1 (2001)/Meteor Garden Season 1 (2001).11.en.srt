1
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,297
Hey. You don't know how to say sorry
when you bump into someone, huh?

2
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,346
What should we do after drinking?

3
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,715
No idea.

4
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,850
We don't have money.
What do you want to do?

5
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,752
Why don't you make some money
if you got nothing?

6
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,053
Got any other ideas?

7
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,190
Let's think about it.

8
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,524
Hey.

9
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,093
There's a convenient store over there.

10
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,294
Don't even think about it.

11
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,734
He looks pretty dumb.

12
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,369
Let's get some money from him.

13
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,237
Hey, young man.

14
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,673
Hey, I'm talking to you.

15
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,209
What?

16
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,612
Hey, we're lucky today.

17
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,913
We got a stoner.

18
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,217
-Look how blank his eyes are.
-Really?

19
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,219
And his hair is so funny.

20
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,887
Search for money.

21
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,088
Search for money.

22
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,727
He's really stoned.

23
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:41,728
Poor guy.

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,930
-Did you find--
-I got something.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,332
It's a luxury brand.

26
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,269
How much money is there?

27
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,538
At least NTD 30,000 or 40,000.

28
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,440
It seems that we're meant to rob him.

29
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,710
Look. He has so many gold cards.

30
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,314
This guy is really something else.

31
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,582
He has so many types of cards.

32
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,887
Look, we've got gambling money now.

33
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,555
-Should we go right now?
-For sure.

34
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,490
Hey. You're really something.

35
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,793
That's why we all lay our hands on it.

36
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,827
"LEI" OUR HANDS ON IT

37
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,262
We lay our hands on what?

38
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,730
Lay hands on his money. Split the money.

39
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,631
"LEI" HANDS

40
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,999
Let's split the money.

41
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,767
What did you just say?

42
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,369
He can talk now.

43
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,739
Everyone, just eat as much as you can.

44
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,208
-This is already my second dish.
-It smells so good.

45
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,609
I don't think we can eat anymore.

46
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,545
Everything is so delicious.
You have to eat some more.

47
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,947
Hey, Lei, pour Shancai some wine.

48
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,217
Lei, looks like you've drank a lot.

49
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,285
No.

50
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,953
I think Zhuang has drank a lot.

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,489
Don't make me laugh.
Some wine won't do me any harm.

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,558
I think Shancai is almost done.

53
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,460
She has drank so much
that she can't think straight.

54
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,499
It's been so fast.

55
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,167
You're all grown up now.

56
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,104
You're at the age when you get jealous
because of girls.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>I don't think it's jealousy.</i>

58
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,647
<i>Because I still don't understand
what Huaze Lei is thinking.</i>

59
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,617
<i>He has never told me he loves me.</i>

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,590
Ah Si, that jerk. It's already 10:30 p.m.
Why hasn't he showed up?

61
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,294
I thought he would come here frustrated,
so I hyped up the atmosphere.

62
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,932
Forget that idiot.
He's wandering on the street. Let's drink.

63
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:26,900
Come on.

64
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,605
Why did you say "Lei" in front of me?

65
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,640
Why is he suddenly talking?

66
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,008
-So what?
-What?

67
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,109
I'm going to say it again.

68
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,078
-Lay.
-"Lei," my ass!

69
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,312
Do you want me to kill you?

70
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,549
Lei and Shancai have fooled me.

71
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,617
Stop it!

72
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,586
How dare they fool me,
the best man in the world, Daoming Si!

73
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,455
-Daoming Si.
-Daoming Si.

74
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,559
Come on, let's have another one.

75
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,695
Come on, let's drink.

76
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,303
Hey, you two.

77
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,272
I've always wanted to ask you.

78
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,707
Where are you now?

79
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,677
In New York.

80
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,380
Come on.
I'm not asking about location, okay?

81
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,581
I'm asking about you two--

82
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
-You two what?
-None of your business. Stop babbling.

83
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,654
Lunatic.

84
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,556
No way.

85
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,990
Stop it. You're joking again.

86
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,725
Lei, what's wrong with you?

87
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,164
Yes, Shancai can't compete with Jing.

88
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,333
But how come you don't even touch her?

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,669
Hey, am I really that bad?

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,672
No wonder I think you two are nothing
like a couple.

91
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,175
Okay!

92
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,644
I won't force you to stay with Ah Si.

93
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,514
But your relationship
is moving way too slow.

94
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:51,151
Your slowness is giving Ah Si
the chance to sabotage it.

95
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,088
Okay, the guest room is all yours tonight.

96
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,256
Yeah, come on.

97
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,091
-Grab this opportunity.
-What? No.

98
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,059
Forget about it.

99
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,862
-Qinghe.
-Ximen, Meizuo, hurry up.

100
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,073
-I feel better now.
-Of course, you do.

101
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,044
How could I get upset
just because of a woman?

102
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,548
You don't look upset at all.

103
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,121
That's right. I should cheer myself up.

104
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,690
I was too dumb before.

105
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,793
Aren't you already cheered up?

106
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,529
Don't you two talk too much?

107
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,466
I'm not playing games with you anymore.

108
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,636
-Who's playing games with you?
-Who's playing games with you?

109
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,011
We won't open the door until morning.

110
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,445
Lei, you can do it.

111
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,681
What the heck are you doing?

112
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,819
I think it's okay.

113
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,425
<i>What is okay about this? What do you mean?</i>

114
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,103
Why are you staying far away from me?

115
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,839
No, it's not far.

116
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,276
Let's just talk, okay?

117
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,113
Let's talk about our middle school
graduation trip.

118
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,315
What do you think of it?

119
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,250
-The graduation trip?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,154
Everyone slept in the same room.

121
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,756
And we chatted all night.

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,360
I remember I went to Huadong
in middle school.

123
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,661
What about you?

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,263
Europe.

125
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,864
Europe?

126
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,466
You're so rich.

127
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,804
Why did you scoff at me?

128
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,173
You're so ugly.

129
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,508
What did you say?

130
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,879
I was just joking.

131
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,581
But,

132
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,418
after I took a closer look,
you're not that cute.

133
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,358
You're that kind of person no one will
notice if they don't pay close attention.

134
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,059
Do you want to fight or what?

135
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,528
Whether I'm cute or not
is none of your business.

136
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,931
But,

137
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,901
when I watched you play basketball today,

138
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,039
the way you strived is pretty charming.

139
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,413
I didn't get why Ah Si
was so obsessed with you.

140
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,316
I get it now.

141
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,086
I...

142
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,554
I don't know

143
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,124
how I feel towards you.

144
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,531
Ximen and the others said
that I'm only using you to forget Jing.

145
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,802
Maybe it's true.

146
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,577
Maybe I really think
that I can forget Jing this way.

147
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,913
I don't know how I feel towards you.

148
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,249
If I didn't come back,

149
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,485
maybe Daoming Si and you...

150
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,688
would have already been in love.

151
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,459
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,362
Don't say you're sorry. I have no regrets.

153
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,365
At least we've made some progress.

154
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,268
Progress?

155
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,005
You used to talk to me with a gloomy face.

156
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,108
"I'm not interested
in other people's business."

157
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,643
Now you can tell me so much.

158
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,744
I'm so happy.

159
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,180
Silly girl.

160
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,301
I think both of them
now realized how they feel.

161
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,607
But Lei is a man, and he has drank a lot.

162
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,742
It should work this time, right?

163
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,545
Otherwise,
we're just wasting our time here.

164
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,846
You're right.

165
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,282
Shancai and Lei...

166
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,252
are like two sitcom actors
when they're together.

167
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,553
What?

168
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,587
Ah Si.

169
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,989
Right, Ah Si.

170
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,790
-I've had enough. Ah Si--
-Hey.

171
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,459
Ximen, behind you.

172
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,295
You talk too much. What's behind me?

173
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,364
Hey, Ah Si.

174
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,332
Why are you standing there?

175
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,001
You must be tired.

176
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,636
Do you want to rest?

177
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,005
You can't hide this from him.

178
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,908
Ah Si.

179
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,444
Lei and Shancai are in my guest room now.

180
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,446
They will probably come out
in the morning.

181
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:26,085
If you're a man, you should give them
your blessing.

182
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,554
Do you understand?

183
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,928
Lei really has his ways.

184
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,666
Isn't it for the best?

185
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,335
Ah Si, you've finally moved on.

186
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,636
It really is for the best.

187
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,239
Perhaps you're a good man.

188
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,842
Stop it. I'm so hungry right now.
Let's get something to eat.

189
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,344
I'll tell the chef to prepare right now.

190
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,579
Come here, take your seat.

191
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,047
Let's drink all night.

192
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,315
All right, grab some wine.

193
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,713
<i>Ma'am, should I wake up Miss Shancai
and Mr. Huaze?</i>

194
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,184
Miss Shancai,
is there anything I can do for you?

195
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,285
No, thank you.

196
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,653
You can tell me if you need anything.

197
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,554
Okay.

198
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,515
<i>Huaze Lei, thank you
for telling me the truth.</i>

199
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,320
<i>Jing, it looks like I can't beat you.</i>

200
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,057
<i>You're the one he loves.
I can only be his friend.</i>

201
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,092
<i>I'm a little hurt,</i>

202
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,761
<i>but that's fine,</i>

203
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,063
<i>because I'm Shancai, the weed.</i>

204
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,262
Why did you leave so early yesterday?

205
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,730
Why did you come here so late?

206
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,699
Are you all right?

207
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,335
-Still in hangover?
-Of course.

208
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,504
What happened last night?

209
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,872
Last night?

210
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,974
Come on, Shancai and you.

211
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,543
What?

212
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,944
Don't "what" me.

213
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,281
Of course, I'm asking what did you
and Shancai do in that room last night?

214
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,717
We did nothing.

215
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,118
What?

216
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,319
I can't do that.

217
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,857
I don't blame you.
Her body isn't that attractive.

218
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,226
Yeah, she has no charm as a woman.

219
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,427
It's so pathetic.

220
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,563
I'm really sorry for her.

221
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,932
She stayed with the guy
she likes the entire night

222
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,967
but nothing happened.

223
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,336
Do you have any problem?

224
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,871
It's not what you think.

225
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,210
Shancai is a good girl.

226
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,679
My heart was almost captured by her.

227
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,482
But we didn't do anything.

228
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,386
We talked very seriously the entire night.

229
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,821
Is it because you can't forget Jing?

230
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,390
Or is there any other reason?

231
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,661
I can't betray Ah Si for my sake.

232
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,697
After all,

233
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,434
we've been friends since childhood.

234
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,570
What about Shancai?

235
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,373
As long as I know Ah Si loves Shancai,

236
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,143
nothing will happen
between me and Shancai.

237
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,677
Oh, gosh.

238
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,315
I think no one will replace Jing
in your heart.

239
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,014
Hey, why didn't you go to school?

240
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,516
Dad just called me
to persuade you to go to New York.

241
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,651
I rejected it for you.

242
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,953
I've decided to go to New York.

243
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,256
You're going to New York?
Why are you going?

244
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,227
I've made my mind
before the basketball game.

245
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,728
Whether I win or lose,

246
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,831
I will go and study in New York.

247
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,900
Mom and Dad have asked you so many times
yet you've rejected them.

248
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,235
Why suddenly go?

249
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,504
There is no why.

250
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,174
Is it because of Shancai?

251
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,011
Let's not talk about it.
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

252
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,614
I can leave tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow.

253
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,082
You can book the airline ticket for me.

254
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,419
All right, I'll go back to America anyway.

255
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,858
Are you sure about this?

256
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,626
Yeah.

257
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,344
I'm home.

258
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,381
Why are the lights turned off?

259
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,617
Is there anybody home?

260
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,786
Mom, Dad?

261
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,225
You're here.

262
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,729
Why didn't you cook dinner tonight?

263
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,069
What happened?

264
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,674
We can't live in this house anymore.

265
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,743
Why?

266
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,546
Your dad was laid off at work.

267
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,981
Is that true, Dad?

268
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,920
We can't afford
to rent this house anymore.

269
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,589
Shancai.

270
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,592
The economy has been so weak recently,

271
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,261
and our company is suffering from it.

272
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,097
So I have been laid off.

273
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,734
Why are you crying?

274
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,670
I should be the one crying.

275
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,305
You idiot.

276
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,206
Why couldn't you be more tolerant

277
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,409
so you wouldn't get laid off?

278
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,311
Why couldn't you be more careful?

279
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,046
I didn't want to end up like this.

280
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,648
Honey, I worked for that company
for over 20 years.

281
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,718
That boss just suddenly fired me
this morning.

282
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,820
I don't know what to do now.

283
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,589
I lost my job midlife.

284
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,524
I'm so useless.

285
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,326
I've achieved nothing in my life.

286
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,828
I've failed to take care of
Shancai and you.

287
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,430
Mom.

288
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,864
Stop talking like that.

289
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,232
Shancai.

290
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,002
No matter what,
you have to study in Yingde.

291
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,137
You can never leave Yingde,

292
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,109
because our future is in your future rich
husband's hands.

293
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,013
Whether that will be Daoming Si
or Huaze Lei,

294
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,916
you have to finish your degree
for this goal.

295
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,485
Well, Shancai,

296
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:44,056
I'll try my best to find a new job, okay?

297
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,725
-Okay.
-I'll try my best.

298
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,493
-Let's try our best.
-You'll try your best.

299
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,462
-Okay.
-We'll try our best.

300
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:50,730
We can do it!

301
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,764
We can do it.

302
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,865
We can do it.

303
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,595
Only this one room?

304
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,997
Yeah, this apartment sucks.

305
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,700
Hey, is this a livable place?

306
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,835
There is only one room.

307
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,638
-How can it fit three people?
-Stop complaining!

308
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,873
It's all your fault!

309
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,374
-I...
-Get out of my way!

310
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,745
Shancai, we're counting on you.

311
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,747
Do you understand?

312
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,449
Yeah, Shancai.

313
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,284
Everything falls on your shoulders now.

314
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,252
You can do it.

315
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,255
<i>If I tell them now</i>

316
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,090
<i>that things are over
between Huaze Lei and me,</i>

317
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,992
<i>and I broke up with Daoming Si,</i>

318
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,861
<i>they'll get so mad at me and chase me
out of the house.</i>

319
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,463
<i>What should I do?</i>

320
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,899
<i>I think I should save myself.</i>

321
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,034
<i>It's time to find one more job.</i>

322
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,543
Did you hear that?

323
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,877
Daoming Si is going to New York.

324
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,145
Is that true?

325
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,146
Yeah.

326
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,050
Shancai.

327
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,921
Shancai, bad news.

328
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,123
Why are you running so fast?
What happened?

329
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,324
Didn't you hear?

330
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,993
Daoming Si will drop out of school.
He's going to New York.

331
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:30,896
New York?

332
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,532
I just heard the news this morning.

333
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,434
Didn't you hear it?

334
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,240
I think he made the decision
to give you to me.

335
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:43,876
Shancai.

336
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,347
Ah Si, are you for real?

337
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,151
You can't speak English.
What are you going to do in New York?

338
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,087
That is exactly why I should go there.
I'll learn English.

339
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:55,988
But--

340
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,656
But how long will you stay there?

341
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,559
I think I'll stay there for two years.

342
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,361
What? Two years?

343
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,663
I'll take tomorrow morning's flight.

344
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,433
Ah Si.

345
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,071
Don't get me wrong.
You're not the reason I'm leaving.

346
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,672
My dad kept asking me to go there.

347
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,909
After I become the world-class Daoming Si,

348
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,043
I'll come back.

349
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,980
Ah Si, are you sure
you won't think it over?

350
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:29,889
You're really going to New York?

351
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,794
-That's right.
-Shancai, good thing you're here.

352
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,029
Tell him not to leave.
He won't listen to us.

353
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,598
I've made up my mind.

354
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,400
I won't listen to anyone.

355
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,902
I'll leave tomorrow.

356
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,571
What? Tomorrow?

357
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,174
You're really leaving tomorrow?

358
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,509
Why didn't you tell me?

359
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,577
Why?

360
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,546
Why do I have to tell you?

361
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,816
Without me interfering,

362
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,418
You and Lei will make a good couple.

363
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,986
-Am I right, Lei?
-Ah Si.

364
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,856
You two should start
building your relationship.

365
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,392
I will find a blonde girl in New York.

366
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,929
If you want to go, just go!

367
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,997
Whether it's America or Africa,

368
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,666
if you want to go, just go!

369
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,435
Whether it's three or five years,

370
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,304
you'd better leave right now!

371
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,972
You'd better leave Taiwan!

372
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,879
The reason I'm crying
isn't because I'm upset,

373
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,747
but because I'm happy.

374
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,316
I'm so happy.

375
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,122
I think there's no need to say "See you."

376
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,693
We won't see each other again anyway.

377
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,495
You idiot!

378
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,489
<i>Actually, I don't have the right
to get mad.</i>

379
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,926
<i>But he's leaving without even telling me.</i>

380
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,529
<i>It's too sudden.</i>

381
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,033
<i>This is different from breaking up
with Huaze Lei,</i>

382
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,469
<i>although I was so sad then.</i>

383
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,505
<i>I knew I didn't have a choice.</i>

384
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,841
<i>But now,</i>

385
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,712
<i>I've never thought
that guy would really leave.</i>

386
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,547
<i>It's too sudden.</i>

387
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,550
Shancai.

388
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,595
Ah Si is going to New York tomorrow.

389
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,398
Are you really okay with it?

390
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,634
When did you come here?

391
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,240
Don't you want to say something?

392
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,609
His whereabouts are not my business.

393
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,082
I remember when Jing decided
to go to France,

394
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,218
you firmly told me

395
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,920
that I had to be brave.

396
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,191
I had to let her know my feelings.

397
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,694
How about you?

398
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,035
Are you just going to let Ah Si
leave like that?

399
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,345
Ah Si, take care.

400
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:44,249
Well, maybe when you come back,

401
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,552
you can speak fluent English.

402
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,619
Of course.

403
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,789
Someone who has a good "size" like me
can learn everything really fast.

404
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,596
I think you should work hard
on your English in New York.

405
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,666
This is the first time Ah Si
has left the three of you.

406
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,402
I guess so.

407
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,839
I feel nothing when this guy is leaving,

408
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,608
but I don't want you to leave us, Zhuang.

409
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,010
Yeah.

410
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,211
He'd better leave us.

411
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,280
When Ah Si is in a bad mood,
he always vents on us.

412
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,217
I think you should find
three African Americans in New York

413
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,718
and form a black F4.

414
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,087
I think it will be difficult
to find another three.

415
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,789
Isn't it faster
if you add one new team member?

416
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,290
Me.

417
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,493
Daoming Si said I could be a member of F4.

418
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,928
Did I ask for your opinion?

419
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,898
Don't even think about it
in your entire life.

420
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,333
F4 is F4.

421
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,335
No one can replace us.

422
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:48,147
<i>All passengers traveling
on China Airlines CI604 to New York,</i>

423
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,749
<i>please proceed to gate 18 for boarding.</i>

424
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,486
<i>All passengers traveling
on China Airlines CI604...</i>

425
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,721
I'm leaving now.

426
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,656
How about waiting for Shancai?

427
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,358
Maybe she'll come here to send you off.

428
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,993
I don't think so.

429
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,795
Shancai wants you to leave
as soon as you can.

430
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,829
It's none of your business!

431
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:04,930
Ah Si.

432
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,332
Fine. I shouldn't have said that.

433
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,602
But Shancai isn't in the mood
to send you off.

434
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,772
Her dad was laid off,
and they have no savings,

435
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,475
so they moved to a cheaper place.

436
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,377
She couldn't care less about you now.

437
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,647
Honestly, I really like Shancai.

438
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,882
-No one knew it would turn out--
-That's her family problem!

439
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,050
It's none of my business.

440
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,754
Let's go. It's time to board.

441
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,489
Ah Si.

442
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,391
I have something to tell you.

443
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,239
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are ready to take off.</i>

444
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,708
<i>Please make sure your seat belts
are securely fastened, </i>

445
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,611
<i>and your seats, table trays, and footrest
are in the upright position. Thank you.</i>

446
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,286
What are you thinking?

447
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,122
I'm going to be honest with you.

448
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,390
Nothing happened
between me and Shancai that day.

449
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,259
I didn't sleep with her.

450
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,829
And I guess you're the one
she truly loves.

451
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,166
I'm not going to New York.
I want to go back!

452
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,602
Ah Si, what's wrong with you?
The plane is about to take off.

453
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,570
-You can't tell me you won't go now.
-Let me go back!

454
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,805
Sit tight!

455
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,808
Why did you hit me in the eye?

456
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,443
I'm telling you,

457
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,311
you voluntarily said
that you wanted to leave.

458
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,046
It's very immature
to change your mind now.

459
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,082
Sit tight.

460
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,751
I don't want to scold you on the plane,
but I only have so much patience.

461
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,753
-Is there anything I can do for you?
-I want to get off!

462
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,789
-Sorry. Everything is fine.
-Okay. Thank you.

463
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,807
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

464
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,781
Daoming Si went to New York
just like that?

465
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:08,086
So we will no longer see those cute guys
of F4 showing up together.

466
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,421
What a pity.

467
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,490
Xiaoyou, what are you talking about?

468
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,826
Nothing.

469
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,264
I think Daoming Si treats you differently
from others.

470
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,935
What's the difference? He's gone now.

471
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,240
He probably thought you were really
in love with Huaze Lei, so he left.

472
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,409
He left with a sad and broken heart.

473
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,244
It's so touching.

474
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,845
Xiaoyou.

475
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,747
Don't mention that man anymore.

476
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,318
I only want to focus on my work
to help my family.

477
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,954
My dad hasn't found a new job.

478
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,922
The atmosphere at home is so uneasy.

479
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,425
I think I might need another job.

480
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,261
What? You want to take one more job?

481
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,897
Can you handle it?

482
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:55,334
Don't overwork yourself
and damage your health.

483
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,537
But people say

484
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,040
that the best medicine for a breakup
is occupying oneself with work.

485
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,309
I think this is what you're doing.

486
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,477
No.

487
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,546
I'm not. Just mind your own business.

488
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,583
Didn't our boss say
that if business is good,

489
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,352
we'll get a bonus
at the end of this month?

490
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,854
Let's try our best to sell cakes.

491
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,027
Hey, Shancai, where are you going?

492
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,200
Come on, buy cakes!

493
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,035
Come on, buy cakes!

494
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,737
Hey, what are you doing, Shancai?

495
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,105
You, mister.

496
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,240
I've been shouting for a long time.
Come in and buy a cake.

497
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,309
Mister!

498
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,610
Cheapskate.

499
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,012
Xiaoyou, let's shout together.

500
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,714
-Come in and buy cakes!
-Hey, what happened?

501
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,083
What are you shouting for,
hardworking virgin?

502
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,586
What are you three doing here?

503
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,888
We're here to help you.

504
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,623
Help me with what?

505
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,861
Before Ah Si went to New York,
he told us to take good care of you.

506
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,630
I'm so touched.

507
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,734
Hey, Daoming Si is thinking about you
even after he left here.

508
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,537
Xiaoyou, please, don't be so sappy.

509
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,172
Actually, she's right.

510
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,841
Sometimes, people around us
see things more clearly than us.

511
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,578
Anyway, poor <i>suancai</i>, we're already here,

512
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,514
so how about letting us
sell cakes for you?

513
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,549
Sell cakes for me?

514
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,886
I want to sell all the cakes
and get off work early,

515
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,754
but do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

516
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,691
You rich young masters have no idea
how hard it is to sell cakes.

517
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,761
You can't sell them in your way,

518
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,731
but things will be different with us.

519
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:33,665
Yeah.

520
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,101
Leave them be.
They will figure something out.

521
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,609
BUY FIVE CAKES AND GET A KISS

522
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,315
Thank you for being here.
Please wait in line.

523
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,017
We'll get started very soon.

524
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,187
I'll sell cakes and you'll be the one
to do the kissing.

525
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,089
Why me? Why not you?

526
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,390
How about Lei?

527
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,291
Oh, gosh.

528
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,893
Now that you've decided to help Shancai,
don't limit yourself.

529
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,296
Make use of your charm, okay?

530
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,465
Miss, we can start now.

531
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,533
This way, please.
What flavor would you like?

532
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,804
Everyone, wait in line. No pushing.
One by one only.

533
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,639
Okay, five cakes coming up.

534
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,842
Four, okay, please wait a second.

535
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,310
No need to hurry. Let's wait in line.

536
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,478
How many would you like, miss?

537
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,279
-I'll have ten.
-What flavor would you like?

538
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,481
Strawberry is fine.

539
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,715
Come this way, please.

540
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,584
-How many would you like, Miss?
-Ten.

541
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,054
-Thank you.
-I bought ten.

542
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,324
Thank you.

543
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,293
What the heck are they doing?

544
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,963
I guess they just want to kiss girls.

545
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,164
Right, Xiaoyou?

546
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,201
Where's Xiaoyou?

547
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,377
Oh, gosh.

548
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,117
Here are your cakes.
Thank you. This way, please.

549
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,252
Next.

550
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:01,753
How many would...

551
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,321
I'll have 20.

552
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,601
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT
CAKES ARE SOLD OUT TODAY

553
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,175
Xiaoyou, why are you so frustrated?

554
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,810
I didn't get to buy cakes.

555
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,746
Shancai, thank you.

556
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,081
Thanks to your friends today.

557
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,550
Although the economy is weak now,

558
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,552
our business is running pretty well.

559
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,320
You're welcome.

560
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,156
I'm sorry. We might have been
carried away.

561
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,591
I hope we didn't disturb you.

562
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,594
Not at all. Actually, I hope
you can come here more often.

563
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,596
Don't forget to give Shancai a raise.

564
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,731
And this little beauty, of course.

565
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,400
Of course.

566
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,635
All right then. It's getting late now.

567
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:51,770
We should go.

568
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,104
I'm leaving now.

569
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,540
Why are you so tired
when you were just sitting there watching?

570
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,943
You know he needs 15 hours
of sleep per day.

571
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,113
Hardworking virgin, we're leaving now.

572
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,584
-Take care.
-Thank you, guys.

573
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,252
Then let's close the store.

574
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,155
Those guys.

575
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,291
Shancai, the three of them are so funny.

576
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,860
Xiaoyou.

577
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,596
It's a pity that there's one missing,

578
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,297
so they're incomplete.

579
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,465
Don't you think so?

580
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,004
<i>Daoming Si told them to take care of me.</i>

581
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,406
<i>He must be in New York right now.</i>

582
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,713
Honey, I'm home.

583
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,182
There are a lot of letters. Take a look.

584
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,384
There might be an interview invitation.

585
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,119
Yeah. Let me see.

586
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:42,521
There are so many of them.

587
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,259
Any luck?

588
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,261
Well.

589
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,695
-Honey.
-Yeah.

590
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,632
None of them is an interview invitation.

591
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,534
They're all bills.

592
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,069
Look. Water bill.

593
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,471
Electricity bill.

594
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,939
Phone bill.

595
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,340
Gas bill.

596
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,743
They're all reminders.

597
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,279
Hey, that's weird.

598
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,316
Honey, I have sent
so many job application letters.

599
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,218
Why hasn't anyone responded?

600
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,955
No wonder I heard
the unemployment rate rose again.

601
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,024
The newspapers are telling the truth.

602
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,327
They surely are.

603
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,496
Even I am unemployed now.

604
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,531
It's weird.

605
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:30,635
Do you know what I eat the most
for three meals?

606
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,837
Carrots and bok choys.

607
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,973
There is nothing good on the table.

608
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,677
Don't people always say, "Eat a lot
of vegetables and you'll be blessed"?

609
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,812
Why am I so unlucky?

610
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:46,418
I only hope what that fortune-teller
I met this morning said will come true,

611
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,520
so luck can be on our side.

612
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,256
What did that fortune-teller say?

613
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,527
She said my future doesn't depend
on my husband,

614
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,295
but my baby.

615
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,297
-Your baby?
-Yeah.

616
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,500
-Why didn't I think of it?
-What do you mean?

617
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,537
Your baby.

618
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,738
I get it.

619
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,908
She meant that we should have a baby.

620
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,142
Oh, my.

621
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:15,880
I didn't expect we would do this so soon.

622
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,984
Shancai isn't home now anyway.

623
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,218
-Hold on.
-Then let's...

624
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,253
Honey, why are you stripping?

625
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,323
Well, we can make a baby right now.

626
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,292
-No.
-Did she say we could change our luck?

627
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,527
You got the wrong idea.
Button up your clothes. Look.

628
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,662
There is an advertisement.

629
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,465
They're hiring community babysitters.

630
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,067
They're looking for someone
caring and patient.

631
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,803
To work for eight hours a day.

632
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,006
For NTD 1,000 a day.

633
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,708
This is a nice job.

634
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,276
What do I have to do with it?

635
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,413
I get what that fortune-teller meant now.

636
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,181
She said your future depends on the baby.

637
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,351
She meant you need to take care of babies.

638
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,188
-Hold on.
-And then we can pay these bills.

639
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:02,093
Are you sure they're not hiring
bricklayers, laborers, or steel fixers?

640
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,963
No. See, what a coincidence.
See for yourself.

641
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,632
Honey, I'm sorry,
this month's bills are overdue.

642
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,767
I'm counting on you.

643
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,936
Pay Shancai's tuition fee
and this month's computer expense.

644
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,207
<i>Business in the cake store
was so good today.</i>

645
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,609
<i>I'm so tired.</i>

646
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:04,122
AH SI STUBBORNLY WENT BACK TO TAIWAN.
FROM: DAOMING ZHUANG

647
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,497
<i>I received a message from Zhuang.</i>

648
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,333
<i>Yeah. How about we go to Ah Si's house?</i>

649
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,769
<i>Ximen is driving there now.</i>

650
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,338
<i>Okay, see you later. Bye.</i>

651
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,313
Didn't you go to New York?

652
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,049
I did.

653
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,617
But I came back.

654
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,855
Didn't you say you would stay there
for two years?

655
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,857
Why did you come back after two days?

656
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,760
I... I love Taiwan.

657
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,962
You love Taiwan?

658
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,132
Are you running for election? Idiot.

659
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,069
How did you know I moved here?

660
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,939
Never mind. You got tons of ways anyway.

661
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,409
What are you doing?

662
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,278
I arrived in New York the day
before yesterday.

663
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:01,846
Then I immediately flew back.

664
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,615
That flight lasted over 30 hours.

665
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,050
I feel so unwell.

666
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,453
Are you very unwell?

667
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,655
My head hurts like hell.

668
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,392
Maybe it's because the flight
was too long.

669
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,028
I feel like I'm going to explode.

670
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,866
<i>No wonder he feels this way.</i>

671
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,501
<i>He almost didn't take any break,</i>

672
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,037
<i>he flew for over 30 hours.</i>

673
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,872
<i>What a stubborn young master.</i>

674
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,108
You're so weak.

675
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,409
Get on your feet.

676
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,146
It's not about being weak.
It was a flight for more than 30 hours.

677
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,181
Try it yourself.

678
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,850
You must be a lunatic to go there
and come back.

679
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,485
Why are you calling me a lunatic?

680
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,323
Young Master Daoming Si, is that you?

681
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,059
-Did you send Shancai home?
-Hello.

682
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,594
Mom, it's not what you think.

683
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,129
I just flew back here,

684
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:53,565
so I'm suffering from jet lag.

685
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,467
You flew here? You travel
this short distance on a plane?

686
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,770
I've never been on a plane yet.

687
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,839
Come in and take a rest.

688
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,308
-Feeling unwell is the worst.
-Mom, there's no need to--

689
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,943
That's fine. Our house is up ahead.

690
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,612
-Take a rest, Young Master Daoming Si.
-Mom.

691
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,381
-You're so weird.
-Shancai, keep up!

692
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:17,155
We just moved here.
Our place is a little small.

693
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,659
Honey! You're stealing food again!

694
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,928
Young Master Daoming Si is here.

695
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,297
Hurry and clean up. Stop babbling.

696
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,901
Why is this place so small?

697
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,069
Shut up.

698
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,738
You should be thankful we got a place
to let you rest. You're talking too--

699
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,607
I'm sorry, Young Master Daoming Si.

700
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,577
We'll prepare a cozy place
to let you rest in a moment.

701
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:40,645
Right.

702
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,250
Why is the bed like this?

703
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,918
Young Master Daoming Si.

704
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,153
We'll leave you to rest.

705
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,221
Come on.

706
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,624
Young Master Daoming Si,
please take a rest.

707
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,127
-Yeah.
-Shancai, please take a rest.

708
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,962
You will sleep here tonight.

709
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,398
Your mom and I will sleep on the balcony.

710
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,400
How can you sleep there
when it's so small?

711
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,470
-It's fine. We've laid the bed.
-Good, it's great.

712
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,071
-It's so comfortable.
-Yes.

713
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,473
We haven't slept here for a long time.

714
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,074
-No.
-Oh, my.

715
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,443
You can stay with Daoming Si over there.

716
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,212
I have to stay with him?
Are you kidding me?

717
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,048
-Just take good care of Daoming Si.
-Yes.

718
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,684
Open up. Mom, Dad, what are you doing?

719
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,419
Mom, Dad, get out.

720
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,956
Shancai, don't worry.
You can leave us here.

721
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,892
-We'll never disturb you.
-We'll never disturb you.

722
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,428
What's wrong with you? Get out!

723
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,829
Suit yourselves.

724
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:38,736
Just sleep and leave me alone.

725
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,505
Don't even think about it.

726
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,152
You're the one she truly loves.

727
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,033
Hey.

728
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:10,601
What?

729
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,107
When I wasn't here,

730
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,142
how did you feel?

731
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:20,745
What?

732
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,448
Were you peaceful...

733
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,417
or a little lonely?

734
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,793
Never mind.
I don't care about how you feel anyway.

735
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,894
You should sleep now.

736
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,935
What do you think Ah Si is up to?

737
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,706
Butler Liu said he went to the airport
but only found Ah Si's luggage.

738
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,074
That jerk.

739
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,343
He didn't contact us on the day
he came back.

740
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,311
Where do you think he went?

741
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,379
How should I know?

742
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,549
It would be an easy guess if that was you.

743
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:34,385
If you're not looking for your buddies,
you must be looking for girls.

744
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,687
Ah Si is an idiot.

745
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,423
What he did doesn't make any sense.

746
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,659
We got here as soon as we received
the message from Zhuang.

747
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,095
Who knew he wouldn't show up
the entire night?

748
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,431
Lei, what do you think?

749
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,235
Maybe he went to visit
an important person in his heart.

750
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,475
Who could that important person be?

751
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,511
Isn't it obvious?

752
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,193
Hey, why are your dad's pants so short?

753
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,495
Then you can wear your own clothes.

754
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,698
How can a man like me wear
the same clothes two days in a row?

755
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,166
That's impossible.

756
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,802
So I got you my dad's clothes,
but you're complaining.

757
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,438
The problem is, I'm so ugly in this.

758
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,674
Why don't you think of it as capri pants?

759
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,179
Actually, I'm pretty handsome in this.

760
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:38,616
You arrogant pineapple head.

761
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,851
I can't stand you anymore.

762
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,420
Wear your own clothes.
Give my dad's clothes back.

763
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,157
Why are you such a nag?
I'm a man with a good "size."

764
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:47,558
- It's "sense."
-It's "sense."

765
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:48,993
I deliberately said that.

766
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,663
They can fight for something so small
like sesame and mung beans.

767
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,067
Sesame and mung beans are hard
to separate. They can be fried together.

768
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,602
What are you talking about?

769
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,105
No, I mean, they are actually
so into each other.

770
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:04,275
It seems that they're fighting,
but deep inside, they're in love.

771
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,144
-Really?
-Yes.

772
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,346
-Honey, I didn't know you love me so much.
-Yeah.

773
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,815
-We've been married for many years.
-Yeah.

774
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,150
You scold me at the dining table.

775
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,185
You even scold me
while eating late-night snacks.

776
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,053
Could you please love me less?

777
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,012
