1
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,937
What's the matter?
Is Young Master getting mad again?

2
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,005
Yes.

3
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,974
I've been with Young Master
since he was a kid.

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,177
This is the first time
I've seen him this drunk.

5
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,382
Is he really that brokenhearted?

6
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,385
He broke something again.

7
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,886
What can we do?

8
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,138
Have you been waiting for long?

9
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,474
No, I've just arrived.

10
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,546
Where are we going?
Have you thought about it?

11
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,049
I haven't. How about you?

12
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,619
I haven't either.

13
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,490
-Let's just walk along there.
-Okay.

14
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,711
<i>Huaze Lei is really handsome.</i>

15
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,315
<i>Actually, Daoming Si
is really handsome too.</i>

16
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,485
<i>But his haircut is so funny.</i>

17
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,954
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

18
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,989
<i>Didn't I say I need to forget about him?</i>

19
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,093
<i>I'll have a happy date today.
Stop thinking about him.</i>

20
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,831
What's wrong? Do you have a headache?

21
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,766
-No.
-Okay.

22
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,301
-Let's go.
-Okay.

23
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,985
<i>Lei hasn't said anything for a while now.</i>

24
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,387
Shancai.

25
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,995
This is my first time going
on a formal date.

26
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,767
Please forgive me if you're getting bored.

27
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,270
Huaze Lei.

28
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,538
Stop calling me by my full name.

29
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,573
That makes it awkward for us.

30
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,375
Just call me Lei.

31
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,543
Okay.

32
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:37,711
Lei.

33
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,045
Lei.

34
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,415
Stop calling me
if you don't have any problem.

35
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,122
-I'm sorry.
-Watch your step, miss.

36
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,190
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,299
How would this be like
if it was Daoming Si?

38
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,470
You silly head.
You can't even walk straight.

39
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,538
It's embarrassing.

40
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,106
You can hold my hands.

41
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,744
I don't want to hold your hand.
Mine will rot.

42
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,679
I'm such a good person.

43
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,080
<i>Why are you getting mad at me?</i>

44
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,750
Shancai, what are you doing?

45
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,319
What's wrong?

46
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,895
<i>Why am I always thinking about him?</i>

47
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,364
<i>Why Daoming Si?</i>

48
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,568
<i>This is my first date with Huaze Lei.</i>

49
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,269
<i>Why am I like this?</i>

50
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,506
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,298
<i>This silence is really awkward.</i>

52
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,200
<i>I have to say something.</i>

53
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,671
The weather looks bad.

54
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,074
It might rain soon.

55
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,975
Yes.

56
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,215
Why would people fly
a kite in this weather?

57
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,122
It should be more fun
to fly a kite when it's raining.

58
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,324
Do you want to try it out?

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,628
Okay.

60
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,668
Great.

61
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,537
This is the first time I have flown
a kite this high.

62
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,173
It's fun, right?

63
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,808
It is.

64
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,478
I think kites are beautiful.

65
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,380
Don't you think so?

66
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,487
Flying a kite is just like keeping an eye
on a person that's far away.

67
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,255
Where you look at them quietly.

68
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,524
It's far away.

69
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,260
But you don't feel disappointed.

70
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,331
Because you know
you're holding the string.

71
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:16,202
It's just like the strong relationship
that keeps your bond.

72
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,308
Jing is just like the kite.

73
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,044
She is far away from you

74
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:30,317
but there is a strong string
that connects you and her.

75
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,094
<i>Although you told me not to mention her,</i>

76
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:45,932
<i>she still holds a special place
in your heart.</i>

77
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,978
ONE HOUR

78
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,715
TWO HOURS

79
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,797
Yes.

80
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,499
What? She has arrived?

81
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,067
Okay. I'm going now.

82
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,808
Welcome home, miss.

83
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,810
You're getting slower, Butler Liu.

84
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,415
I went back because of your calls.
My schedule is now ruined.

85
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,650
Who are you?
Are you the one who's serving me?

86
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,752
Or am I the one working for you?

87
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,654
There are no rules here at all.

88
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,956
My apologies. My bad.

89
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,360
Let me report to you, miss.
It is unusual this time.

90
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,829
-Young Master--
-Fine. Stop it.

91
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,166
You've made it clear over the phone.
He broke up with someone.

92
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,034
Why do I need to rush back
and handle that?

93
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,636
No, not really, miss.

94
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,072
This is Young Master's first love.

95
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,474
He looked forward to this relationship.

96
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,543
Our master is not dealing with it well.

97
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,745
Such a dumb head.

98
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,780
Right. I am, miss.

99
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,217
But we tried our best to comfort him,
he didn't want to listen to us.

100
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,287
He drinks every day and breaks everything.

101
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,557
He has broken nearly
a thousand crystal glasses.

102
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm afraid that he'll break
the antique vase of our elder master too.

103
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,030
See? It's happening.

104
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,099
Could you please stop him, miss?

105
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,733
Never mind. Let him be.

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,902
I wonder how could
this kind of person be born in our family.

107
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,472
Prepare my bath with some essential oil.

108
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,274
Book a cosmetologist for me. I need a spa.

109
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,712
Right. Give him those crystal glasses
I brought back from France.

110
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,381
But...

111
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,025
Wake up, you silly boy.

112
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,295
You get addicted to alcohol
and then you break everything.

113
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,866
Why are you so useless?

114
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,201
Wake up now!

115
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,141
When did you come back?

116
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,342
This morning.

117
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,410
Why are you fighting
with me in the middle of the night?

118
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,712
Jet lag.

119
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,547
Why did you come back?

120
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:48,915
You'll know tomorrow.

121
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,531
Get on the car.

122
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,967
Who? Me?

123
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,636
It's you.

124
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,874
But I don't know you.

125
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,509
Maybe you're looking
for a different person.

126
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:17,710
It's you, Shancai.

127
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,813
I have classes.

128
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,616
I've requested a leave for you. Let's go.

129
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,653
Where are we going?

130
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,863
Excuse me. Where are we going now?

131
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,844
Why did you bring me here?

132
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,146
I'm going to class.

133
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,280
You need to come with me.

134
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,849
Where is this? Who are you?

135
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,484
Why did you bring me here?

136
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,086
Please sit down.

137
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,991
May I ask who you are?

138
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,759
I'm Daoming Si's older sister.

139
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,796
Hello.

140
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,197
Where did you go earlier this morning?

141
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,767
You.

142
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,378
Why did you come here?

143
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,546
You cheated on me, didn't you?

144
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,814
How dare you come to my place.

145
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,415
Are you taking my love as a joke?

146
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,350
Ah Si!

147
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,051
What are you doing?

148
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,686
Why are you treating a girl badly?

149
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,488
She is my guest.

150
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,723
Let's go. Leave him alone.

151
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,930
This is the wine I brought abroad.
Please try it.

152
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,466
<i>I should sneak away.</i>

153
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,701
<i>This is so awkward.</i>

154
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,138
Young Master is hiding in his room, miss.

155
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,574
If he doesn't want to come out,
then let him be.

156
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,608
Weirdo.

157
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,211
Just ignore him. Cheers, Shancai.

158
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,853
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

159
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,757
Daoming Zhuang.

160
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,162
I found out you can easily forget
about many things after drinking.

161
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,730
What do you want to forget about?

162
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,703
Just like how
I can't bear myself right now.

163
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,771
Don't say that.

164
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,440
Come on, cheers.

165
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,617
I did something bad.

166
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,756
That's why it's totally fine
that Daoming Si is mad at me.

167
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,663
No one understands.

168
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,165
My relationship with Huaze Lei
is not so good.

169
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,435
I'm here to deal with all of those things.

170
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,437
Don't worry.

171
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,573
I understand that no one should be pushed.

172
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,975
So I won't push you to do anything.

173
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,779
You might know how our family looks like.

174
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,914
My parents are not at home.

175
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,716
Ah Si and I lived alone together
for many years.

176
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,319
We do have some money.

177
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,755
But that's the reason
why Ah Si can't make friends.

178
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,993
He didn't have friends before he met
Ximen, Meizuo, and Huaze Lei.

179
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,095
So he's especially tough.

180
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,697
He couldn't go well with others.

181
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,868
Maybe it's because of how I educated him.

182
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,638
I was so young
that I only knew how to beat him up.

183
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,176
Although I always fight with him,
the truth is,

184
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,745
I really love my brother.

185
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,116
I don't know how you two will be,

186
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,951
or if I can do anything to help.

187
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:19,986
I really don't know.

188
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,320
But...

189
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:26,125
I'm truly praying
that you can stay with Ah Si.

190
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,675
Young Master is still in his room, miss.

191
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,411
Okay. Please let Butler Liu prepare a car.

192
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,312
Yes.

193
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,348
I'll ask Butler Liu to drive you home.

194
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,031
Ah Si.

195
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,071
Shancai went home yesterday.

196
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,106
Please have breakfast, Young Master.

197
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,641
So?

198
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,880
Are you doing fine
with Ximen, Meizuo, and Lei?

199
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,415
Don't talk about Lei.

200
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,917
Why? Did you have a fight?

201
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,457
You should learn how to be
with each other peacefully

202
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,326
as you are the successors
for the big four families.

203
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,728
Lei will never be in the F4.

204
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,597
I don't want to deal with him anymore.

205
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,338
Seems like Ah Si has a rival.

206
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,371
Who is he?

207
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,175
Qinghe?

208
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,210
Shancai!

209
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,479
Why are you speaking like that?

210
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,147
Chen Qinghe.

211
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,415
Let me tell you this.

212
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,951
You are now in the F4.

213
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,954
Don't do anything that can hurt us.
Do you understand?

214
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,923
Answer me!

215
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,724
I know.

216
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,726
Why has something so good happened to me?

217
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,862
Do I look good?

218
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,032
Come back here.

219
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,435
Listen.

220
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,772
From now on,
Huaze Lei is no longer in the F4.

221
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,907
Chen Qinghe is taking his place.

222
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,445
I'll beat up whoever tries
to treat him badly.

223
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,514
Clear?

224
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,615
How did this happen?

225
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,151
Why is Qinghe replacing Huaze Lei?

226
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,787
What is Daoming Si thinking?

227
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,226
<i>What can I do? I made this mess.</i>

228
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,995
Shancai!

229
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,932
I'm in the F4 now.
I can't even believe it!

230
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,268
My classmates are being nice to me now.

231
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,570
I was just dreaming about all these.
I'm so happy.

232
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,006
Qinghe, this is way too much.

233
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,042
You can stay with me so
no one bullies you.

234
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:31,811
Qinghe.

235
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,146
I forgot to tell you something.

236
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,481
What?

237
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,216
Stop talking to them.

238
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,920
Why? Shancai is my best friend.

239
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,321
Shancai and Huaze Lei.

240
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,024
I'll kick them out
of our school within a week.

241
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,126
Out of school?

242
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,361
No matter what.

243
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,296
I want you to disappear before me.

244
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,865
Are you serious, Ah Si?

245
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,266
You're talking about Lei.

246
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,135
Shut up.

247
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,204
Wait. Are you serious?

248
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,105
Wait.

249
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,007
I told you to wait!

250
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,708
How can you do that?

251
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,811
Can you please not kick them out,
Daoming Si?

252
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,179
Chen Qinghe.

253
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,019
Who told you that you have the right
to do so?

254
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,353
He has.

255
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,057
The Daoming Family has a huge influence
in the school.

256
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,558
No one can stop them.

257
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,309
Isn't it too harsh
to push someone out of the school?

258
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,545
Stop babbling.

259
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,149
This is my decision.

260
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,987
There was someone who quit school
after we gave him the red card.

261
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,057
But we've never kicked out anyone.

262
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,392
This is not something that the F4 does.

263
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,760
Right, Ah Si.

264
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,063
Think again. This is Lei.

265
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,397
He grew up with us.

266
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,399
It's still unforgivable
even though it's him.

267
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,368
Do you think he really likes Shancai?

268
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,402
Doesn't he?

269
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,504
He already has Jing.

270
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,740
Jing is getting married soon.

271
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,608
He wants Shancai as a replacement.

272
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,911
So that he can forget Jing.

273
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,579
Ah Si.

274
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,386
What's wrong with you, nouveau riche?

275
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,620
Why the long face?

276
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,255
I hate it.

277
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,894
You mean Shancai is dating Huaze Lei?

278
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,400
Idiot.

279
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,269
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T ACCEPT THE TRUTH

280
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,245
I don't think he'll change his mind.

281
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,180
Let him calm down for a bit.

282
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,050
Go!

283
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,032
I do understand something now.

284
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,703
It looks like Ah Si really loves Shancai.

285
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,273
I'm so jealous of him.

286
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,510
I can't bear to focus on a woman.

287
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,280
Is that it? Aren't you escaping from them?

288
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,481
I...

289
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,850
It's such an embarrassing situation
for Lei.

290
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,619
He might be kicked out.

291
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,788
So...

292
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,324
Why didn't that nouveau riche follow us?

293
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,628
Leave him alone.
I won't say he's actually part of the F4.

294
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,267
You can tell me what's happening now.

295
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,106
-You know what?
-What?

296
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,775
-That Shancai is being kicked out.
-Really?

297
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,779
I heard that Daoming Si was talking
with the school's president.

298
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:58,450
Every poor student
will be kicked out eventually.

299
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,518
Yes.

300
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:03,088
There will be no more poor students
in this school now.

301
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,323
Right?

302
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,992
It's great to see
that our wish has been granted.

303
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:12,131
We finally got back our own true
and pure elite space.

304
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:16,035
And Shancai can't get in touch
with our F4 now.

305
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,570
Yeah. Let's go.

306
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,343
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

307
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,451
-That is...
-Isn't that?

308
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,955
The legendary graduate
of the 16th academic year.

309
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,090
-Daoming Zhuang.
-Daoming Zhuang.

310
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,459
Why would she be here?

311
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,861
Isn't she living in America?

312
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,263
Who's that person beside her?

313
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:45,598
Is that...

314
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,567
-Shancai.
-Shancai.

315
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,936
How could she know everyone?

316
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,304
This is annoying.

317
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,743
Do you hear me?

318
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,379
You want Shancai and Huaze Lei
to quit school?

319
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,815
You can do that, right?`

320
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,316
What about Huaze Lei?

321
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,721
His father is one of our directors.

322
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,089
I want them to go.

323
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,726
If they don't go, you go.

324
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,994
No.

325
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,896
Let's talk.

326
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,933
Why are you here?

327
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,470
Stop asking me.

328
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,705
Why would I have such a bad brother?

329
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,540
You're so mean.

330
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,676
Who told you?

331
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,380
It wasn't us.

332
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,115
It was this guy.

333
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,918
You're such a jerk.

334
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,587
Sorry. Your sister is scary.

335
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,122
She's much more scarier than you.

336
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,558
You can pretend
you heard nothing, president.

337
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,294
Stop it.

338
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,561
Kick them out.

339
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,263
Kick them out if you dare.

340
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,965
Kick them out, old man!

341
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,600
-No, you can't!
-You must!

342
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,902
-No, you can't!
-You must!

343
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,170
Enough.

344
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,141
I'll quit school.

345
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,910
Are you happy now?

346
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,513
What are you talking about, Shancai?

347
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,648
-What about your mother?
-Stop talking, Qinghe.

348
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,383
I...

349
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,255
It was a huge mistake
for such a poor student like me

350
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,856
to enroll in this elite school.

351
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,359
I'll leave now.

352
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,694
It would solve everything.

353
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:23,562
I'm leaving.

354
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,332
I won't let you go.

355
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,567
I'm the one who should quit school.

356
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,342
This is all about me.

357
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,711
I should leave.

358
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,052
If Shancai is leaving, I'll leave too.

359
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,722
Shut up. No one cares about you.

360
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,923
Ah Si.

361
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,193
I'll leave if you push Lei to quit.

362
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,163
I've had enough of this.

363
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,199
Why should we, the F4, be like this?

364
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,136
Aren't we supposed to have
a strong relationship among other things?

365
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,006
Meizuo.

366
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,142
You're betraying me.

367
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,577
All of you, shut up!

368
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,481
I'm so done with all these fights.

369
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,983
Let's see.

370
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,952
We should think of a way to resolve this.

371
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,422
What can we do?

372
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,828
The Greeks made up the Olympics
to resolve the fights they had.

373
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,766
So, we're going to follow that rule.
Make a team of three.

374
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,934
The loser needs to obey the winner.

375
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,302
No regrets.

376
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,572
Why are using an old-school method?

377
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:45,244
So you want to have a physical fight
with each other?

378
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,316
This is the fairest way.

379
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,252
It's settled then. Three on three.

380
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,087
Three on three?

381
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,522
What's that for?

382
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,825
A three on three basketball game, silly.

383
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,027
Okay.

384
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,929
I'm in.

385
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,233
The losers need to quit school.

386
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,736
Wait...

387
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,938
You said three on three.

388
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,876
So it's me, Huaze Lei, and Qinghe?

389
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,715
<i>Are you really helping us?</i>

390
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,023
We're dying.

391
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,158
We'll be kicked out.

392
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,266
We can't just sit here doing nothing.

393
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,501
Let's practice.

394
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,269
The game is tomorrow.

395
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,774
They look tall but maybe
they're not good at basketball.

396
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,746
Actually, professional basketball teams
have asked them to play.

397
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:58,684
They just rejected because
they don't want to play with strangers.

398
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,589
Don't worry. I can do this.

399
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,191
I've played basketball in PE.

400
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,794
Really? Try a shot, Shancai.

401
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,964
No problem. I'll do a long shot
to scare them off.

402
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,306
That's fine, Shancai.
Everyone makes mistakes.

403
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,474
I'll pick up the ball for you.

404
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,589
What a shot!

405
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,327
Don't be shocked.

406
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,264
Let's practice. I'll help you.

407
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,002
I have someone that I want to protect.

408
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,471
Huaze Lei.

409
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,640
Huaze Lei, how about me?

410
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,442
You won't quit school.

411
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,911
Come on, let's practice.

412
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:05,851
Let's do this.

413
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,006
Why are you standing there?

414
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,977
Let me tell you.

415
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,646
I've been practicing all day.

416
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,750
Don't think you can easily win the game.

417
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,055
Although I'm not the best shooter
and Qinghe is not dribbling well,

418
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,591
we'll still work hard for the game.

419
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:25,664
Why are you so quiet?

420
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,233
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

421
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,771
I can cancel the game tomorrow

422
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,274
just tell me that you love me.

423
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,846
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

424
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,447
<i>Why are you saying that?</i>

425
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,516
<i>Why are you hugging me like this?</i>

426
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:45,751
<i>I...</i>

427
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,220
<i>I don't deserve this.</i>

428
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,624
<i>I don't deserve a hug like this.
It's just draining away my energy.</i>

429
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,359
<i>I'm about to pass out.</i>

430
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,168
Say it.

431
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:06,371
You just need to say that you love me.
Say it!

432
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:08,907
It hurts.

433
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,343
It hurts! Leave me alone.

434
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,446
Please, don't do that.

435
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,848
Please!

436
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,654
Do you really hate me?

437
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,626
Do you really like Lei?

438
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,931
<i>No.</i>

439
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,468
<i>I won't forgive myself
if I let you kiss me.</i>

440
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,504
Why Lei?

441
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,210
Why does it have to be my best friend?

442
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,486
I'm so dumb.

443
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,892
Why did I fall in love
with a girl like you?

444
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:07,833
I'm sorry.

445
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,736
I'm sorry, Daoming Si.

446
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,216
Daoming Si, the greatest in world,

447
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,320
likes a normal girl like you.

448
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,725
You're silly.

449
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,532
Don't regret it.

450
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,942
I'll be fighting hard tomorrow.

451
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:53,912
Be careful.

452
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,351
Who cares?

453
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,455
That's a good one.

454
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,258
That's the Shancai I know.

455
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,333
<i>Maybe someday I'll regret this.</i>

456
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,335
<i>Regret what I've done today.</i>

457
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,339
<i>But right now I don't have a choice.</i>

458
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,775
<i>Because I chose Huaze Lei.</i>

459
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,278
<i>I chose to have his clear eyes.</i>

460
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,046
<i>I made this choice.</i>

461
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,688
<i>Wake up, Shancai.</i>

462
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,659
Shancai!

463
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,727
Wake up now.

464
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,963
Shancai.

465
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,833
Come on.

466
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,069
Why would she wake up so early?

467
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,772
It usually takes me half an hour
to wake her up.

468
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,739
What's happening?

469
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,311
Shancai.

470
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,812
Qinghe.

471
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,149
What happened to you?

472
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:08,520
Nothing. It's just that I woke
up at three o'clock to practice.

473
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,055
I'm so nervous.

474
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,525
Why are you suddenly showing up?

475
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,793
Did you have a good sleep?

476
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,796
It was okay. But my arms are sore.

477
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,598
Great. Let's go.

478
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,935
Hey. Why aren't you nervous?

479
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,904
Nervous about what?

480
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,174
Right.

481
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,613
Don't think too much.
Let's just do our best.

482
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,115
Let's have fun, okay?

483
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,284
Let's go.

484
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,888
We haven't cheered before playing.

485
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,956
-Old-school.
-Wait.

486
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,491
Come on.

487
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,593
One, two, three,

488
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,995
-fighting.
-Fighting.

489
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:56,601
What's with the long face?
We needed to do that to win.

490
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,071
<i>F4 is playing three on three today.</i>

491
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,373
-Hurry, I want to watch.
-Really?

492
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,774
-Me too.
-Daoming Si will win for sure.

493
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,577
-Huaze Lei will quit school if he loses.
-Really?

494
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,078
-Of course.
-Which side are you for?

495
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,148
-Of course, Daoming Si.
-Stop disturbing.

496
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,518
The odds are ten to one on Daoming Si.

497
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,720
Who dares to oppose Daoming Si?

498
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,791
-Come on.
-Just let us go inside.

499
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,138
We can't lose.

500
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,107
If we lose the game, we'll be kicked out.

501
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,477
Everything that I endured
will be meaningless.

502
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,119
The game will last for ten minutes.
The team with the highest score wins.

503
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,555
The losers will need
to follow whatever the winners say.

504
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,393
-Heads.
-Tails.

505
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:56,661
Ah Si goes first.

506
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,999
-Qinghe, mark Meizuo.
-Okay.

507
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,568
-Shancai, mark Ximen.
-All right.

508
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:27,959
It's Huaze Lei's turn.

509
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,066
You'll regret it if you don't mark me.

510
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,403
Shancai.

511
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,945
You stole the ball by pretending
that you're not marking me.

512
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,113
That is so cheap.

513
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,681
Who told you to do nothing?

514
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,116
No, I did something.

515
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:57,722
<i>How can I do anything?
They're good and fast. We can't make it.</i>

516
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,906
Three minutes left.

517
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,475
<i>There are just three minutes left.</i>

518
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,477
-The result is set.
-There are still three minutes left.

519
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,246
What can you do with three minutes?
Just give up.

520
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,317
No matter what, I'll protect Shancai.

521
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,452
Go away.

522
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,560
You're awesome!

523
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,262
You scored. Yeah!

524
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,364
Huaze Lei, you scored!

525
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,067
-How many scores did we get?
-Right.

526
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,935
Great. We scored.

527
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,136
How much more do we need?

528
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,539
-Seven.
-It's seven.

529
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,207
So we need three more shots.

530
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,110
-That's easy. We have Lei.
-Okay.

531
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,812
Go away!

532
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,014
Why are you yelling at me?

533
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,816
They only got one shot.

534
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,054
Timeout.

535
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,123
Timeout for one minute.

536
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,630
Don't stand there, Qinghe. Stand here.

537
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,667
Do you want us to win this game?

538
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,469
-Of course.
-Okay.

539
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,337
Then do whatever I say.

540
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,206
What?

541
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,540
Smile.

542
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,909
-Why?
-Just smile.

543
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,581
What's with that face?

544
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,282
You told me to smile.

545
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,153
What are they doing?

546
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:37,422
What a timeout for them.

547
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,364
Let's continue the game.

548
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:47,866
It's starting.

549
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,970
Fighting. It's our turn.

550
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,321
Foul. Free throw for Huaze Lei.

551
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,260
Fighting.

552
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,900
This is amazing.

553
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,206
Here, Ah Si.

554
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,484
Foul. Free throw for Huaze Lei.

555
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,491
Come on, Lei.

556
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:52,597
Oh, no.

557
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,934
They used Ah Si's jealousy to score.

558
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,575
<i>I'll be all right
even if you say I'm cheap.</i>

559
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,210
<i>I can't lose.</i>

560
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,545
<i>I can't let Shancai get kicked out.</i>

561
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,585
Thirty seconds remaining.

562
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,122
There are only 30 seconds left.
What do we do?

563
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,593
Don't worry. Stay here.

564
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,361
I'll pass the ball to you.

565
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,763
Give it a shot anyway.

566
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,632
What if it fails?

567
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,238
If it fails, I'll make time stop.

568
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,765
Ten seconds remaining.

569
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,296
-What?
-I quit.

570
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,064
This is a stupid game.

571
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,966
What are you talking about?

572
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,234
It's boring.

573
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,002
What? Why did we stop playing?

574
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,138
Why should I sweat like this for you?

575
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,706
Dumb.

576
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,943
Ah Si, if you're leaving,
what should we do with the game?

577
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,411
It's up to you.

578
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:49,847
Daoming Si.

579
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,291
He still acts the same like before.

580
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,195
Yeah. He suddenly got mad
and quit while playing poker.

581
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,530
I can't relate.

582
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,865
How did you educate your brother?

583
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,034
Does it matter?

584
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,236
You got the result that you want.

585
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,639
You're amazing, Daoming Zhuang.

586
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,775
But for real.
It will be so embarrassing if we lose.

587
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,212
We were planning to win the game,
and then persuade Ah Si.

588
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:22,447
Right.

589
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,285
Such an act, Lei.
You've calculated everything.

590
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,388
Let's go.

591
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,791
Are we really stopping the game?

592
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,593
I made one shot.

593
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:37,562
Let's go.

594
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,747
Hey. Don't you know how to say sorry
when you bump into someone?

595
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:10,728
What should we do after drinking?

596
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,264
No idea.

597
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:15,266
We don't have money.
What do you want to do?

598
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,035
Why don't you make some money
if you got nothing?

599
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,302
Got any other ideas?

600
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,539
Let's think about it.

601
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:22,874
Hey.

602
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,409
There's a convenient store over there.

603
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,443
Don't even think about it.

604
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:31,883
He looks pretty dumb.

605
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,551
Let's get some money from him.

606
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:35,586
Hey, young man.

607
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,922
Hey, I'm talking to you.

608
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,761
Hey, we're lucky today.

609
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,229
We got a stoner.

610
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:48,533
-Look how blank his eyes are.
-Really?

611
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,668
And his hair is so funny.

612
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,136
Search for money.

613
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,471
Search for money.

614
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,110
He's really stoned.

615
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,445
Poor guy.

616
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,080
-Did you find--
-I got something.

617
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,681
It's a luxury brand.

618
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:07,552
How much money is there?

619
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,520
At least NTD 30,000 or 40,000.

620
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,722
It seems that we were meant to rob him.

621
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:15,059
Look. He has a lot of gold cards.

622
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,497
This guy is really something else.

623
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,032
He has so many types of cards.

624
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,069
Look, we got gambling money now.

625
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,704
-Should we go right now?
-For sure.

626
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,806
Hey. You're really something.

627
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:30,775
That's why we all lay our hands on it.

628
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,310
"LEI" OUR HANDS ON IT

629
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,711
We lay our hands on what?

630
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,179
Lay hands on his money. Split the money.

631
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,180
"LEI" HANDS

632
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:37,348
Let's split the money.

633
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,517
What did you just say?

634
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,751
He can talk now.

635
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,955
Everyone, just eat as much as you can.

636
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,424
-This is already my second dish.
-It smells so good.

637
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,759
Hey, you two.

638
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:50,862
I've always wanted to ask you.

639
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:53,131
Where are you now?

640
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,200
New York, New York.

641
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,970
Come on.
I'm not asking about location, okay?

642
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,037
I'm asking about you two--

643
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,240
-You two what?
-None of your business. Stop babbling.

644
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,808
Okay.

645
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,077
I won't force you to stay with Ah Si.

646
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,946
But your relationship is moving
way too slow.

647
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,884
Your slowness is giving Ah Si
the chance to sabotage it.

648
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:16,721
Okay, the guest room is all yours tonight.

649
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,855
Yeah, come on.

650
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,724
-Take advantage of the opportunity.
-What? No.

651
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,758
Yeah, whatever.

652
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,561
-Qinghe.
-Ximen, Meizuo, hurry up.

653
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,753
