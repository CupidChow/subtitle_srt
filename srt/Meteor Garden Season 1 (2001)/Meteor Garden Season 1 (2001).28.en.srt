1
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,593
<i>Let me out!</i>

2
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,162
Open the door!

3
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,398
Let me out!

4
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,036
Open the door now!

5
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,275
So even us can't get in there now?

6
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,310
I'm sorry, Young Master Ximen.

7
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,414
What do you mean?
Tell Mr. Liu to talk to us.

8
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,318
Young Master Meizuo, it's Madam's order.

9
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,154
Without an appointment,

10
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,626
we need to politely reject all guests.

11
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,928
Please make an appointment in advance,

12
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,731
no matter who you are.

13
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,640
All right. We understand.

14
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,308
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,278
Young Master Ximen.

16
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,548
Aunt Yu.

17
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,917
Even if the two of us can't get
in there now.

18
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,919
Are you just sitting there
allowing it to happen?

19
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,890
I'm old now. Who would listen
to an old woman?

20
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:42,162
The people in charge now
have their own way of doing things.

21
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,533
They used to listen to me
because they were giving me the courtesy.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,171
Now, nobody needs me anymore.

23
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,475
In that case, we're leaving now.

24
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,211
Wait, this is for you.

25
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,080
This is...

26
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,649
Young Master told me to give this to you.

27
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,626
Daoming Si is going to marry Xiaozi.
This is ridiculous.

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,997
Qinghe, it's none of your business.
Calm down, okay?

29
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,198
It's none of my business?

30
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,933
Shancai's business is my business.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,168
So what are you going to do?

32
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,536
I'll go pay Xiaozi back.

33
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,171
She has never given up Daoming Si.

34
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,441
She invited Shancai to a soiree
with Daoming Si's fake cousin.

35
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,142
She planned it all out.

36
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,146
It's clear that Xiaozi
has no moral compass at all.

37
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,349
Qinghe. Aren't you jumping
to conclusions too fast?

38
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,250
Fine.

39
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,153
Is this marriage photo fake?

40
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,924
Xiaozi is so cunning
and Daoming Si is even worse than her.

41
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,292
How could he do this to Shancai?

42
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,862
He used to pursue her like crazy,
and he even moved next door to Shancai.

43
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,597
What is he up to? He is fooling us around.

44
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,400
He's getting married all of a sudden.
He's playing with her feelings.

45
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,369
Qinghe, stop it.

46
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,373
Shancai.
I know you're really upset right now.

47
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,008
If you are, say it out loud.

48
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,846
Don't repress your feelings.
You can cry or vent out.

49
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,315
He's just a disloyal Daoming Si,
you can curse him however you want.

50
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,883
Qinghe, haven't you said enough?

51
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,785
This topic has gone too far.

52
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,629
Shancai, don't worry.

53
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,031
No matter the wedding ceremony is true
or not,

54
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,701
let's assume it's true for now,

55
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,636
I believe Ah Si was forced to do that.

56
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,172
That's right. When we were kids, we said

57
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,941
that when one of the F4 gets married,
the other three will be the groomsmen.

58
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,278
If Ah Si is getting married, he won't
just ask Aunt Yu to give us an invitation.

59
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,281
And he didn't say anything.
It's impossible.

60
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:42,916
Right.

61
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,951
The situation at his house
has completely changed.

62
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,989
Aunt Yu has lost all her power.
And there are more bodyguards than usual.

63
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,558
I think the Empress Dowager has come back.

64
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,427
And I think things will get--

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,698
Shancai. Who will visit us
at this time of the night?

66
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,967
I don't know.

67
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,456
Huaze Lei.

68
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,625
Why did you come back?

69
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,162
Meizuo called me this morning.
He said something happened to Ah Si,

70
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,397
so I came back.

71
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,833
I called you just this morning,
and you're here now.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,202
Come in. We'll talk later.

73
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,938
So how are things going with Ah Si?

74
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,539
Not good.

75
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,041
We still don't know the details.

76
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,248
Huaze Lei, you're back.

77
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,583
How are you doing these days?

78
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:32,259
<i>I'm under surveillance now.
So it's hard for me to even go out.</i>

79
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,031
Ah Si's mother and my parents decided
for this marriage.

80
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,567
They're serious.

81
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,236
They will make sure
the wedding ceremony goes as planned.

82
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,906
But didn't you reject
this marriage before?

83
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,109
Yes. But things are different this time.

84
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,414
Ah Si's mother and my parents will invest
in a new oil exploitation project.

85
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:58,752
They are in the contract signing stage
but this project requires a lot of money.

86
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,322
They lack trust
in each other's sincerity to cooperate.

87
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,791
So they want us to get married.

88
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,662
This is the only way
they can trust each other.

89
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:11,998
I get it.

90
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,934
They're all the same.

91
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,938
For Xiaozi's parents and Ah Si's mother,

92
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,807
the interest and expansion
of their corporation

93
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,909
is more important than anything else.

94
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,811
So it's useless for me to resist.

95
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,383
They even faked that wedding photo.

96
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,586
Ah Si and I have never taken
those kinds of photos.

97
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,255
It's fake.

98
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,738
I won't eat anything!

99
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,174
I won't eat anything
as long as your locking me up!

100
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,442
Get out of here!

101
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,780
-Get someone to clean this up.
-Yes.

102
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,185
Ma'am.

103
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,821
Young Master Ah Si hasn't eaten
or drank for days.

104
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,859
I think he is very emotionally unstable
and he is also throwing a fit.

105
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,929
He has signs of dehydration now.

106
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,299
Didn't I tell you to get the family doctor
to check on him?

107
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,633
The doctor is here.

108
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,336
We tried to put Young Master on an IV,

109
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,873
but Young Master Ah Si
wouldn't let us get close to him.

110
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,843
The IV bottle broke in the conflict.

111
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:36,116
I think it would be hard to get close
to him when he's conscious.

112
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,953
Why are you telling me this?

113
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,088
Figure out a way to solve it.

114
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,623
Yes.

115
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,499
What are you doing?

116
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,969
Let go of me. I told you to let go of me,
did you hear me?

117
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,071
Let go!

118
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,739
Let go of me, did you hear me?

119
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,408
What are you doing? Hey!

120
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,943
Remember what you did, let go of me!

121
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,512
Let go of me!

122
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,815
All of you, go away!

123
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,124
What should we do now?

124
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,827
We don't know what's going on
and we can't get in touch with Ah Si.

125
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,929
We can't keep waiting here, right?

126
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,968
Is there any way
to get Daoming Si out of there?

127
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,705
Then what?

128
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,209
I don't know.

129
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,245
The only thing I can think of is
to get him out of there first.

130
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,949
It seems to be the only way.

131
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:47,921
Okay.

132
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,890
Get him out of there first,
then we'll figure out the rest later.

133
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,526
But aren't there a lot
of bodyguards around Ah Si?

134
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,729
And Ah Si must be locked up.

135
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,264
Don't you remember?

136
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,066
There's a hole in the garden
at Ah Si's backyard.

137
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,634
We used to get in there when we were kids.

138
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,205
Aunt Yu put a ring of replacement keys
in the greenhouse in that garden.

139
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,372
There are keys to every door.

140
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,309
That means sneaking
into Ah Si's house won't be a problem.

141
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,277
Of course, tonight is no exception.

142
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,681
Okay, let's move now.

143
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,321
Let us do the job. You can wait here.

144
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,056
Hey, you.

145
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,994
Don't worry, we'll get it done.

146
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,645
It's was easy to walk here
when we were kids. Why is it so hard now?

147
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,213
You're 180 centimeters high now.

148
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,015
Do you think you're still
that malnourished kid?

149
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,518
Keep quiet. What if they find us?

150
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:10,803
Good evening, Aunt Yu.

151
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,341
Young Master Huaze. You can come out now.

152
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,879
Aunt Yu.

153
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,948
You can't be...

154
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,585
I'm telling you,
the keys are not where they were now.

155
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,486
Idiots!

156
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,023
How is Ah Si now?

157
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,591
He's under house arrest.

158
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,994
Madam said he would be locked up
until next week's wedding ceremony.

159
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,529
He will marry Miss Xiaozi at the church.

160
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,799
-Ah Si won't accept it.
-I know he won't.

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,835
He won't eat anything
after he was locked up.

162
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,472
I'm so worried
that Young Master won't make it.

163
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,475
Madam is afraid that he will hurt himself.

164
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,377
So she ordered them
to inject him with sedatives.

165
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,279
Ah Si won't accept it.

166
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,050
Yes. But he won't eat anything.

167
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:01,921
I'm so worried
that Young Master won't make it.

168
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,726
Aunt Yu. You have to help us on this one.

169
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,295
Of course, why do you think
I'm waiting here?

170
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,499
I gave you the invitation
to give you a hint.

171
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,602
I knew you will make a move.

172
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,973
But Young Masters, aren't you too slow?

173
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,408
You made this old woman wait for so long.

174
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,177
Aunt Yu.

175
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,746
It seems like there's nothing we can hide
from you.

176
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,617
Take these keys.

177
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,554
Here is a map. Just follow it.

178
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,156
You know the Daoming's house
like the back of your hands.

179
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,158
But you know what?

180
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,261
There are people all over the house
to guard Young Master.

181
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,296
There's one man in front of his door.

182
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,799
Young Master is asleep now. Got it?

183
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,003
Let's go.

184
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,918
I haven't been here for a decade.

185
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,421
It's so hard to walk here.

186
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,357
We should go out and go upstairs.

187
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,093
-Upstairs?
-Yeah.

188
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,845
Ma'am.

189
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,594
You may leave here for now.
I'll tell you when I'm about to leave.

190
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,495
Yes.

191
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,290
Didn't Aunt Yu say
that there would be a bodyguard here?

192
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,159
Isn't it better that there aren't any?

193
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,540
Ah Si.

194
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,581
Madam, good evening.

195
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,954
Why are you here?

196
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,492
I...

197
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,294
I heard Ah Si didn't feel well, so...

198
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,798
So we're here to check on him.

199
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,970
You want to get Ah Si out of here
for Shancai, right?

200
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,807
Hey, of course not. That's impossible.

201
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,643
What happened?

202
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,581
You again?

203
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,885
Why are you always doing pranks?
Is this something you should do?

204
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,222
Ma'am, they're always playing together.
They mean no harm.

205
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,092
Go back. Go away.

206
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:06,993
Aunt Yu.

207
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:12,465
I think you gave them the permission
to do this.

208
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:14,767
Ma'am.

209
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,869
It's not as serious as you think.

210
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,237
-They--
-Aunt Yu.

211
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,408
I respect the fact that you've been
working at Daoming's house for decades.

212
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:28,247
But maybe you're old
and you're starting to get confused.

213
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,386
I think it's time for you
to formally retire.

214
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,655
Ma'am.

215
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,791
The size of the Daoming Family's business

216
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,760
is very different
from what it was in the past.

217
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,798
The home security management
can't be as sloppy as it was before.

218
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,403
This is way beyond your ability to manage.

219
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:57,543
Even if I want to keep you in charge,
my conscience won't let me do it.

220
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,147
I think you should enjoy
your retirement life,

221
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,716
and leave family affairs aside.

222
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,353
Ma'am, what do you mean by that?

223
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,792
I know you have replacement keys
to every door in this house.

224
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
Please hand them to me now.

225
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,902
Aunt Yu. Where are the keys?

226
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,710
Young Master Ximen. Hand her the keys.

227
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,095
Get your men here to show the guests out.

228
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,602
He's my only son.

229
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,038
None of you can take him away.

230
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,524
Why are there only three of you?

231
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,159
Where's Daoming Si?

232
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,427
We failed.

233
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,762
How is he doing now?

234
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,497
-The Empress Dowager--
-He's not--

235
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,835
This is the first time
that I saw the three of you out of sync.

236
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,505
How is he doing now?

237
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,143
He's locked up in his room.
He was injected with sedatives.

238
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,779
He didn't even know that we were there.

239
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,388
Shancai, let me ask you this.

240
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,793
If Ah Si really marries Xiaozi,
what will you do?

241
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,231
What will I do?

242
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:05,037
Ximen, why are you asking that to Shancai?
How should she answer that?

243
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,307
I just want her to be prepared.

244
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,877
I don't feel good either.

245
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,384
Then what should we do now?

246
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,088
We have alerted the Empress Dowager
and Aunt Yu isn't there anymore now.

247
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,857
It will be harder to sneak in again.

248
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,060
Hey. Wasn't there a scary lady?

249
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,732
Never mind, she is of no help.

250
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,534
What?

251
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,369
Nouveau riche,

252
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,338
you're so smart today.

253
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,673
Did I say anything?

254
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,408
What did I say?

255
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,843
Call her right now.

256
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,678
You thought of something great.

257
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,079
How come we didn't think of this?

258
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,081
What did I just say?

259
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,138
Young Master.

260
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,511
You're still not going to eat anything?

261
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,215
Young Master. Stop playing games, okay?

262
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,920
You can torture yourself later.
Just eat something for me, okay?

263
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,126
No matter what you say,

264
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,896
I won't eat anything.

265
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,830
You...

266
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,266
I...

267
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,101
I'm telling you.

268
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,037
It will hurt after I beat you
with my cane.

269
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,640
If you refuse to eat,

270
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,775
I'll beat you so hard
that you will be calling for help.

271
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,912
I don't need help.

272
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,949
You should go tell my mom,

273
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,287
that if she thinks she
can make the decisions for me,

274
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,624
just because she gave birth to me,

275
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,128
I would rather die.

276
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,363
Young Master, you...

277
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,465
What nonsense are you saying?

278
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:18,003
She is your mom,
so she won't make you die.

279
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,238
You...

280
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,574
Get up and eat something.

281
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,909
You can only have strength after eating.

282
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:28,347
Then you can fight with your mom
with your strength, right?

283
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,550
Young Master, please listen to me,
Young Master.

284
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,518
There's no need for that.

285
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,554
Don't keep pushing yourself, okay?

286
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:39,358
Young Master, if you keep doing this,
your body will be ruined.

287
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:46,632
I thought you were an idiot
but at least you were fit.

288
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,633
Now...

289
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,901
You...

290
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:52,504
Young Master, could you eat something?

291
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,308
I want nothing. I don't want to eat!

292
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,443
Aunt Yu.

293
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,712
Tell them to let me go, okay?

294
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,314
Young Master.

295
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:06,085
No one in this house is willing
to listen to me now.

296
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,153
If someone would listen to me,

297
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,557
if I could let you go,
I would do it with my life.

298
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:15,828
But Young Master, I can't do that.

299
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,478
Xiaozi.

300
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,613
Why are you here?

301
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,820
-Are you alone?
-I got rid of them.

302
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,857
I want to meet Shancai.

303
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:48,594
Okay.

304
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,504
Xiaozi is here.

305
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:09,848
Shancai.

306
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,821
What's the matter?

307
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,022
Shancai.

308
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:21,293
I know you won't forgive me.
I know you think I'm shameless.

309
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,730
But I'm begging you,
I'm begging you to give up on Ah Si, okay?

310
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,699
Xiaozi.

311
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,535
Ah Si is about to die.

312
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,005
This marriage is bound to happen.

313
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,674
He's been on a hunger strike

314
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,543
since the day he learned
that we're getting married.

315
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,144
He won't eat anything.

316
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,047
I know he's getting weaker and weaker.

317
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,917
Everyone is persuading him,
but he won't listen.

318
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,220
I'm begging you,
please go and persuade him, okay?

319
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,757
His mom won't let me meet him.

320
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,361
As long as you say you will give up,
his mom will let you meet him.

321
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,395
Xiaozi.

322
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,664
Don't you think you're being unreasonable?

323
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,337
I will go.

324
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,274
Shancai, what are you doing?
Can you solve the problem?

325
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,710
Meizuo is right.

326
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,545
What can you do once you're there?

327
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,150
Daoming Si came to me every time.

328
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,120
It's time for me to come to him

329
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,555
because I want to meet him.

330
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,358
And I don't need any other reason.

331
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:30,863
Xiaozi.

332
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,402
If everything comes true
and Daoming Si can accept the fact,

333
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,971
will you be happy?

334
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,509
No.

335
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:45,944
Because I love you so much.

336
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,130
<i>What happened at this house?</i>

337
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,733
I've only been out for a while.
How could it turn out like this?

338
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,538
Why are you weird guys standing here?

339
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,107
Madam told us
to monitor Young Master's activities.

340
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,542
Monitor?

341
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,344
You're treating Ah Si like a prisoner.

342
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,879
Get out of my way!

343
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,629
Ah Si.

344
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,609
Sister.

345
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,448
I planned to punch you twice
like the last time.

346
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,021
Why are you back?

347
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,258
Look at how sick you are right now.

348
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,195
But I'm so happy.

349
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,265
You look like a matured man to me now.

350
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,700
You have guts.

351
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,970
You didn't let your sister down.
I'm so happy.

352
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,503
Xiaozi.

353
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,306
You're my future daughter-in-law.

354
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,843
I welcome your visit to my home.

355
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:04,983
But remember, you need to cut people
without dignity out of your life.

356
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,586
Just in case they have
a bad influence on you.

357
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,254
Understand?

358
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,692
<i>I won't lose to those cold eyes.</i>

359
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,163
I'm here for Daoming Si.
Where is he? Please let me meet him.

360
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,599
Ma'am, I got Shancai here
to persuade Ah Si.

361
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:22,768
There's no need for that.

362
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,404
Ma'am, please don't reject it, okay?

363
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,840
If Shancai can persuade Ah Si
to eat something,

364
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,108
wouldn't that be great?

365
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,678
Besides, he won't listen to anyone now.

366
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,715
If Ah Si is willing to listen to Shancai,
maybe it's the best solution we have.

367
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,050
Let them meet each other.

368
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,287
I can't let her influence my son again.

369
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,156
No, Shancai won't do that.

370
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,991
She promised me
that she will give up Ah Si.

371
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,126
Please let them meet each other.

372
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,062
I won't let them meet each other.

373
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,565
Okay, they won't meet each other.
How about talking through the door?

374
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:58,303
Ma'am, I'm going to marry Ah Si next week.

375
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,907
If we don't know if Shancai
and Ah Si are over,

376
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,610
how can I walk
into the church wholeheartedly?

377
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,747
Please let me talk with Daoming Si.
I'll leave after our conversation.

378
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:13,785
You go watch her.

379
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,623
Let her talk with Ah Si
in front of his door.

380
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,424
Let her go after she's done.

381
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,114
Where are you taking me?

382
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,749
Daoming Si!

383
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,419
Shancai!

384
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,453
Daoming Si.

385
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,256
Daoming Si, calm down and listen to me.

386
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,702
We can only talk like this.

387
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,804
This is the condition for meeting you.

388
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,946
Are you okay?

389
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,720
Never been better.

390
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:30,896
Ximen, Meizuo, and Lei has been here
looking for you, did you know that?

391
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,271
We were here to get you out,
but we failed.

392
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,844
That's okay.

393
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,249
You haven't eaten food for so many days,

394
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,585
aren't you hungry?

395
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,589
I'm fine.

396
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,963
Daoming Si.

397
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,935
Let's set a time.

398
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,038
If we still can't be together,

399
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,540
we'll give up.

400
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,778
Then you will accept the arrangement,
okay?

401
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,422
Why should I give up?

402
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,897
If I can give up,

403
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,069
the first time we broke up,

404
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,205
I would have already given up.

405
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,914
I don't want to think about that now.

406
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,154
We are bound to be together.

407
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,867
I know.

408
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,671
We are bound to be together.

409
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,680
I miss you so much.

410
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,272
Shancai, did it go well?
Did Ah Si agree to eat something?

411
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,409
Xiaozi, I'm sorry.

412
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,211
I didn't help.

413
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,750
Why? Why won't he even listen to you?

414
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,789
If so, you can leave now.

415
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,258
Shancai.

416
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,860
Zhuang, you're back.

417
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,295
Did you meet Ah Si?

418
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,364
Yes.

419
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,033
I'm sorry for not stopping him.

420
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,569
Because I know why he's doing that.

421
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,704
Maybe you don't know.

422
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,673
But I do.

423
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,042
So I'll be staying with him.

424
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,612
He is on a hunger strike,
so I won't eat anything, too.

425
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,382
He won't come out,
so I'll be waiting for him.

426
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,718
Shancai, you can't be
this stupid too, right?

427
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,620
Zhuang, don't worry.

428
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,724
I've never been this clear
about what I know I need to do before.

429
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,530
I will wait for him until he comes out.

430
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,881
You've done this to me before.

431
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,750
Now, you're doing it to Ah Si.

432
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:20,485
Are you satisfied now?

433
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,754
You talk too much.

434
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:34,859
Ma'am, this is Young Master's dinner
for today. Are you satisfied with it?

435
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,262
Don't send the food there.
Ah Si won't eat it.

436
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,533
Send it.

437
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,368
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,673
Mom. Are you done?

439
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,543
How far will you push them?

440
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,814
Is that joint-investment project
with He Corporation

441
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,350
really more important than your only son?

442
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,652
Do you really think so?

443
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,824
It's not your place to talk
in this family.

444
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:17,128
Mom, could you be more like a person?

445
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,464
Don't be this cold all the time.

446
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,334
You're our mother, not our god.

447
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,470
Can't you be like other mothers?

448
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:28,006
Who can communicate with us
and get to know our thoughts?

449
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,476
What I'm doing is what a mother
is supposed to do.

450
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,382
I know what is good for my son
and I know what will block his future.

451
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,516
I know it all.

452
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,585
I don't think it's necessary
to communicate.

453
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,721
This is the best arrangement
for Ah Si's life.

454
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,758
Only a daughter of the president
of a tier-one corporation

455
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,994
can match the only heir
to Daoming Corporation.

456
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,932
Even if that project fails,

457
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,602
I won't allow that kind of woman
to be with Ah Si.

458
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,004
That kind of woman?

459
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,207
What kind of woman is Shancai?

460
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,910
I'm telling you,
she's the best woman I've ever met.

461
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,048
You tried to buy her off
and failed, right?

462
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:14,919
You hurt her friends to force her
to painfully leave to protect them, right?

463
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,955
Can't you see it?

464
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:21,159
Everything you did shows your cruelty,

465
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,628
but it shows Shancai's kindness
and merits.

466
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,032
I'm telling you,
Shancai knows what true love is.

467
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,801
She knows what sacrifice is.

468
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,170
She always face the difficulties
with her strong will.

469
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,738
Have you seen that?

470
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,942
The Daoming Family heir doesn't need
these cheap love values!

471
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,678
Why are you still going on the wrong path?

472
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,814
Your son is lying in there!

473
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,650
He's so young.
His life has unlimited possibilities.

474
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,386
Why do you have to make the decisions
for him now?

475
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,990
Because I don't want to see him wasting
time to go through all the mistakes.

476
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,693
If Ah Si accepts this marriage like I did,
that will be his biggest mistake!

477
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,228
You...

478
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:01,766
Mom.

479
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,269
Do you know what?

480
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,204
All these years,

481
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,773
I can't stop blaming myself.

482
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,112
Because I didn't fight for the one I love.

483
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,581
Instead, I let you arrange my life.

484
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,983
You married me to the tycoon
of the hotel industry

485
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,551
to achieve your business goal.

486
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,223
That is a regret I can never face.

487
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:30,061
I really don't want Ah Si
to end up like me.

488
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,092
Unlimited possibilities.

489
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,138
Miss.

490
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,942
What's the matter?
Yelling this early in the morning.

491
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,810
Madam...

492
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,312
Madam went back to New York.

493
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,382
What did you say?

494
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,118
Madam went back to New York.

495
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,254
And all the bodyguards are gone.

496
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,092
And Young Master Ah Si's marriage
is called off.

497
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,934
Shancai!

498
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,569
Hey, Shancai, it's great!

499
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,171
We did it.

500
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,305
Let's go inside.

501
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,840
Yeah, lets' go inside.

502
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,709
Let's go.

503
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,470
I can't stand up.

504
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,888
