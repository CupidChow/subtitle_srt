1
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,801
If you're here to taunt me,
please go away.

2
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,047
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,249
I was out of line before.

4
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,885
Because the women around me

5
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,721
are all frivolous and easy.

6
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,990
So...

7
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,205
There are many things I don't
care about in this world.

8
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,275
I don't care about relationships,

9
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,044
including family and love.

10
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,446
However, I realized I've changed lately.

11
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,082
I became happy.

12
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,618
I'm happy every day.

13
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,160
I think it started after I met you.

14
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,668
Please don't touch me again.

15
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,903
I don't feel that way about you.

16
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,306
Okay, I promise you,

17
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,175
we'll do it your way.

18
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:01,948
Are you busy later?

19
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,985
I'm going to work.

20
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,588
I'll take you there.

21
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,166
Shancai.

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,501
Qinghe.

23
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,137
-Who is he?
-Oh.

24
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,972
He's Yamen. This is Qinghe.

25
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,973
Hi.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,974
Yamen?

27
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,177
Where are you going?

28
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,545
I'm going to work.

29
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,846
I'm taking her there.

30
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,650
Qinghe?

31
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,618
Nothing.

32
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,354
-I'll get going then. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

33
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,860
What's going on?

34
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,362
Why is Shancai
with Daoming Si's fake cousin?

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,601
Daoming Si.

36
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,605
What's up?

37
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,173
Well...

38
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,175
Well...

39
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,477
What?

40
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,047
I don't know how to say this.

41
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,615
Just say it.

42
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,223
What a nice day.

43
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,992
I really like to wander the streets
on days like this.

44
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,230
Didn't I tell you to stop daydreaming?
Why are you still daydreaming?

45
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,334
How about you skip work this afternoon?

46
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,869
Let's hang out.

47
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,907
Can we go somewhere
that doesn't require a lot of thinking?

48
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,109
Let's go to the amusement park.

49
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,679
Amusement park? Great.

50
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,181
Can I ride the roller coaster?

51
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,850
Yes. But I won't ride with you.

52
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,218
Are you scared?

53
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,224
I started thinking
you're actually pretty nice lately.

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,263
I don't know.
I tried to lie to you before.

55
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,300
But you told me the truth.

56
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,836
It's better than lying
to me until the end.

57
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,340
So... can I touch you?

58
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,377
Of course you can't.
Those are two different things, okay?

59
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,379
Don't be so serious. I'm just joking.

60
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,185
If we want to go to the amusement park,
which bus should we take?

61
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,555
I don't know either.
I haven't taken a bus for 15 years.

62
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,291
It's been 15 years? I recently...

63
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,261
This is our first date today.
Be happy, put a smile on your face.

64
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,164
You're so handsome.

65
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,732
What happened recently?

66
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,803
I've always wanted to go
to the amusement park recently.

67
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,445
<i>I can only hope, that the pain in my heart
will fade away one day.</i>

68
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,383
Okay, I know which bus we should take.
Let's go.

69
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,457
Daoming Si.

70
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,459
Shancai.

71
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:00,961
Don't go.

72
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,796
Don't go with him.

73
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,997
What are you talking about?

74
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,470
I can't live without you.

75
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,540
I can't lose you.

76
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,578
Without you,

77
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,882
I don't what will happen to my life.

78
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,952
I wouldn't be able
to live like a normal person.

79
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,890
I really have no idea what I would do

80
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,158
if I lose you.

81
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,463
You're not a kid anymore.
Don't be so naive, okay?

82
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,965
You're putting Shancai
in a difficult situation right now.

83
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,601
Right, I am a kid.

84
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,105
I used to do whatever I want to do.

85
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,575
Now I really don't know what
to do anymore.

86
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,977
Shancai, tell me.

87
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,948
What should I do to be able to love you?

88
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,584
That's enough.

89
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,820
Have you ever thought about her happiness?

90
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,591
If you've ever thought for her
from her perspective,

91
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,027
you'll give her a peaceful life.

92
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,796
That is love.

93
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,767
Happiness? I want happiness, too.

94
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,103
Shancai, listen to me.

95
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,774
No matter what happens,
I'll protect you with my life.

96
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,309
You have to believe me.

97
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,185
Are you going to get on the bus?

98
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,586
Yes, wait a minute.

99
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,625
This is the most painful moment.

100
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,061
You'll get your relief after this.

101
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,197
Don't act on emotions.
It's bad for both of you.

102
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,252
Shancai.

103
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,192
Shancai!

104
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,428
Shancai!

105
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,632
Shancai!

106
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,403
Shancai!

107
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,872
Shancai!

108
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,588
Stop the bus.

109
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,190
Sorry, Miss, I can't stop here.

110
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,526
-Please, let me get off the bus.
-No, not here.

111
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,428
I'm begging you,
I have to get off the bus now.

112
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,929
Fine, I'll park the bus aside.

113
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,938
Won't you regret this?

114
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,708
I don't know if love is real.

115
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,846
I don't know that.
So I'm going to find the answer myself.

116
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,560
Are we good to go?

117
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,396
Please drive, thanks.

118
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,922
<i>I have no time to think.</i>

119
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,925
<i>No matter what the consequences
of my actions will bring,</i>

120
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,196
<i>whether I'll regret it or not,
all I want to do is run to him.</i>

121
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,734
<i>At this moment, my body
and soul are connected together.</i>

122
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,107
Idiot. Do you know it's dangerous
to sit there?

123
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,058
<i>I don't want to lie anymore.
I've crossed that bridge.</i>

124
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,375
<i>Lei called me yesterday.</i>

125
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,710
Really? What did he say?

126
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,112
He said he's been busy.

127
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,215
But he's worried how things are going on
between Shancai and Ah Si.

128
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,519
How do you think things are going now?

129
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:28,855
How else could it be?

130
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,124
I think Lei doesn't have to worry now.

131
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,093
F4 minus one. You're here.

132
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,030
F4 minus one? Are you looking for trouble?

133
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,097
I'm telling the truth.

134
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,600
Daoming Si asked me to join F4 before
but you two wouldn't allow it.

135
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,503
-It's not that we wouldn't allow it.
-Meizuo, you're the best.

136
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,574
I haven't finished yet.
We would rather die than allow it.

137
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,475
I don't care.

138
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,845
Daoming Si, did you find that fake cousin?

139
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,814
Shut up, okay?

140
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,883
Why are you so mad?

141
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,918
Did Shancai stop talking
to you again yesterday?

142
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,353
Keep talking and I'll beat you up.

143
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,656
So that fake cousin won in the end.

144
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,958
Do you want to get beaten up?

145
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,694
Are you and Shancai okay now or what?

146
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,362
Lei's worried about you.

147
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,166
Hello.

148
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,869
Oh, I know.

149
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,905
I have things to attend to. I'm leaving.

150
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,007
Hey, Ah Si, where are you going?
You haven't finished yet.

151
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,076
I don't think there's any need for that.

152
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,415
Your family
owns Qingchi Corporation, right?

153
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,484
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,855
Judging by Ah Si and the others,
we should be more careful.

155
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,991
-Yeah.
-What do you mean? I don't understand.

156
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,827
Shut up. I'll tell you if need to know.

157
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:52,739
Shancai.

158
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,376
What are you doing?

159
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,482
It's not my stomach rumbling.

160
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,217
It's not mine either.

161
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,753
Why don't you just admit
that you're hungry?

162
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,388
Why do you keep nitpicking?

163
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,391
I'm telling the truth. It's not like
I'm the one who always hungry.

164
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,360
You're so cute when you act like this.

165
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,298
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're thinking about.

166
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,333
I'm the one who wants
to know what you're thinking about.

167
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,137
You must be thinking

168
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,873
about me, right?

169
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,642
Idiot.

170
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,413
Yeah, I shouldn't be talking like that.

171
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,085
You have a passport, right?

172
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,720
Passport?

173
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,489
Didn't you get one for me last time
when we went to Liuqiu?

174
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,993
Right. I want to take you to New York.

175
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,494
What?

176
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,597
Are you talking about
that shopping mall New York New York?

177
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,270
I want to make a plan in advance.

178
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,339
What plan?

179
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,841
-I want to take you straight to--
-Wait. Don't rush.

180
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,176
I don't think it's a good idea.

181
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,777
Why?

182
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,779
Because I don't want to do it.

183
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,248
You don't want to do it?

184
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,553
Because we have to go to school.
And New York is so far.

185
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,288
And my English sucks.

186
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,956
Don't avoid my question.

187
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,692
I'm asking you.
Why did you get off the bus that day?

188
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,395
Am I having the wrong idea again?

189
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,163
What are you talking about?

190
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,366
Why did you get off the bus?

191
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,068
Why?

192
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,903
Because...

193
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,541
<i>Is this guy making me confess my love
to him?</i>

194
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,444
<i>Xiaoyou.</i>

195
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,413
-Here's the last one.
-Okay.

196
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,388
Shancai isn't here today,
so your workload is heavier than usual.

197
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,589
I'm so sorry.

198
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,758
Boss, that's okay.

199
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,660
The economy is weak now
and there is less business here.

200
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,232
It's not just here.
Everyone is having a hard time now.

201
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,467
Welcome.

202
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,436
-Ximen.
-Hi.

203
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,506
Aren't you the one
who helped us last time?

204
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,108
-Sorry for the hassle last time.
-Not at all.

205
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,911
Could I borrow her for a while?

206
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,080
But I don't have enough hands here
right now.

207
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,615
I see.

208
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,284
How about this?

209
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,021
I'll buy all the cakes
and desserts you baked today.

210
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,724
What? You're going to buy all of them?

211
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,226
There's a tea party at my place tomorrow.

212
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,096
Okay, thank you.

213
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,565
Are you free now?

214
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,572
<i>It's so hard to say the words
that are deeply hidden in my heart.</i>

215
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,576
<i>But I have to make today a real start.</i>

216
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,413
<i>I have to say "I love you" out loud.</i>

217
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,383
<i>Or else we won't get started.</i>

218
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,891
Well...

219
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,327
Well, what? Say it.

220
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,063
I'm too scared to say it if you're so mad.

221
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,731
What do you mean?

222
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,366
Say it now.

223
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,104
I'm so hungry. Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat bento?

224
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,109
I made it myself.
You haven't had lunch, right?

225
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,111
But they're just normal dishes.

226
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,315
-You made it for me?
-Yeah.

227
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,750
But I don't know if you'll like it.

228
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,085
I want to eat it.

229
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,235
What? Is this thing like a jellyfish?

230
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,004
Jellyfish? That's a mini sausage.

231
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,106
Mini...

232
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,880
How is it?

233
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,750
It has its unique flavor.

234
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,785
Unique?

235
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,488
You don' have to eat it
if you don't like it.

236
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,623
Young Masters like you

237
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,526
must be eating dishes prepared
by master chefs every day, right?

238
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,194
Of course, you won't like
these simple dishes.

239
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,232
Wasn't there any other girl who prepared
a bento for you before?

240
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,969
There was but I thought they
were terrifying so I didn't eat them.

241
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,540
Then why are you eating this now?

242
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,515
I thought you would start over
with Xiaozi.

243
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,384
Xiaozi?

244
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,855
I saw you two sitting in a cafe that day.

245
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,925
How could I be sitting
with someone I don't love?

246
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,660
You don't know me at all.

247
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,662
Then will you be my boyfriend?

248
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,964
Hey, are you okay?

249
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,068
Why are you saying that like it's nothing?

250
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,570
For real?

251
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,872
-Come here.
-What?

252
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,374
Just hide. Your feet.

253
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,043
-For real?
-Yeah.

254
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,078
Hey, look.

255
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,247
There aren't many people here.

256
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,115
We won't be spotted.

257
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,085
-Really? How do you know that?
-Yeah.

258
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,387
I just wanted to be
with you without anyone else,

259
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,089
so I checked this place before.

260
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,024
Really?

261
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,194
Hey, don't do it.
What if someone comes here?

262
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,863
What's the problem?
We'll make out in front of them.

263
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,000
We can't. Someone will come here.

264
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,003
I haven't finished what I was saying.

265
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,505
I hope we can keep it confidential.

266
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,141
Keep what confidential?

267
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,210
Our relationship.

268
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,347
You want us to be
in a secret relationship?

269
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:38,050
No. I mean, we won't keep it
that way forever.

270
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,721
Could we keep it confidential
before someone finds out?

271
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,389
Are you kidding me?

272
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,127
Don't disturb me here! Get out of my face!

273
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,496
-Sorry. We didn't know you're here.
-Get lost!

274
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:52,932
Are you mad?

275
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,136
Of course, I'm mad!

276
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,105
A secret relationship.

277
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,674
Why? Are you embarrassed of me?

278
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,680
<i>No, we'll be doomed in the end.</i>

279
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,816
<i>Everything will happen all over again.
I can't give up.</i>

280
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,686
Daoming Si, listen to me.

281
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,556
I want to be with you.

282
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,960
But if your mom finds out,

283
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,063
she will try to sabotage
our relationship again, right?

284
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:26,866
I don't...

285
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,803
I don't want to break up
with you like the last time.

286
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,272
I've had enough.

287
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,742
On that rainy night,

288
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,878
my heart was broken.

289
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,314
I don't want
to go through that pain again.

290
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,956
I've made up my mind.

291
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,359
I will do whatever I have to do.

292
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,462
For you, I will even go against my mom.

293
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,265
Idiot.

294
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,500
I'm not telling you to do that.

295
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,937
I'm just really scared.

296
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,075
Maybe on our way to New York,

297
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,577
Xiaoyou and Qinghe's families
will be ruined.

298
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,980
I really want to be with you,

299
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,418
but I can't leave them behind.

300
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,326
Fine.

301
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,596
Let's keep our relationship as a secret
for now.

302
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,467
But I'm telling you,
we can't hide it for long.

303
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,570
We'll see when the time comes.

304
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,207
Okay. Thank you, Daoming Si.

305
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,044
Wait, what are you doing?
What if people find out?

306
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,213
We're in a relationship now
and you're still holding it back?

307
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,147
I'm not.

308
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,949
What's wrong with a kiss?

309
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,317
No.

310
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,120
My heart is pounding so fast now.

311
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,654
Another day, okay?

312
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,391
Am I too bossy?

313
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,060
Of course, you're bossy.

314
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,062
If you have a tea party at your place,

315
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,432
you must have desserts prepared
by chefs from luxury restaurants.

316
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,869
You bought all the cakes in our store.
What will you do?

317
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,237
I'll eat it myself.

318
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,873
How could you eat them all by yourself?

319
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,075
Xiaoyou.

320
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,077
You look good.

321
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,646
What? Yeah.

322
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,982
I have something to tell you.

323
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,985
Something to tell me?

324
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,754
I don't know how to say this.

325
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,590
It's about Ah Si and Shancai.

326
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,060
You know,
Ah Si has never given up Shancai,

327
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,063
which means they are likely to start over.

328
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:43,435
But if they really do,
it will be bad for you.

329
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:48,507
Ximen, I've been thinking
a lot these days.

330
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,976
I hope Shancai can find her happiness.

331
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,615
Although something has happened
to my family and it scares me,

332
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,353
I believe that Shancai loves Daoming Si
and I should absolutely root for her.

333
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,156
But something bad might happen
to your family again.

334
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,260
If it really happens to my family,

335
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,263
I believe my whole family
will make it through.

336
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,333
That's how Shancai got
to where she is now.

337
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,703
You're stronger now.

338
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,041
You're nothing like that girl crying
on the side of the street.

339
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,013
You're the one who made me strong, Ximen.

340
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:36,956
From that time, I've told myself
that I need to change.

341
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,193
I told myself
that I shouldn't look down on myself.

342
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,532
It's my honor.

343
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,902
Next time, you have to find a good man
to be your boyfriend.

344
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,444
Ximen, are you good to go?

345
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:01,847
I should go.

346
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,951
In behalf of Ah Si, let me thank you
for what you did for Shancai.

347
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,054
We'll try our best
to deal with everything else.

348
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:15,027
-That's it. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

349
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,002
So is she your type?

350
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,505
No way.

351
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,196
I want to call him so bad
but I don't have anything to tell him.

352
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,166
I don't know what other girls
who are in love

353
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,302
talk about with their boyfriends
on the phone.

354
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,807
Whatever. I'll just call him.

355
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,388
Hello, it's me.

356
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,490
What's up?

357
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,559
Nothing.

358
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,629
Then why are you exercising?

359
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,898
How do you know?

360
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,401
How long have you been there?

361
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,805
You're exercising while talking
on the phone. Are you an idiot?

362
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,473
Why did you spy on me from behind?

363
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,408
I'm here to see you.

364
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,178
-Can we hang up now?
-Right.

365
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,713
What do you want to tell me?

366
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,086
Aren't we too obvious standing here?
If your mom finds out it won't end well.

367
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,254
Relax, I'm in disguise wearing
a hat and sunglasses.

368
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,856
-That's Daoming Si.
-In disguise.

369
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:51,857
Whatever. Follow me.

370
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,592
It's too dangerous. We can't do this.

371
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,794
What are you looking at?

372
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,529
I'm not with Shancai, do you hear me?

373
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,868
If you scold them like that,
won't they know that we have a secret?

374
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,003
-Idiot.
-I...

375
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,304
Hello.

376
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,406
Xiaoyou.

377
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,409
-What?
-Just hide.

378
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,310
What's wrong?

379
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,445
Did you tell Shancai
that you would come here?

380
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,814
I'm not here for her.

381
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,020
It's Ximen. Why are we hiding?

382
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,055
We're hiding from Ximen. Go inside.

383
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,926
Ximen.

384
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,429
I'm here for you.

385
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,670
I love you.

386
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,572
Xiaoyou.

387
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,244
Thank you, Xiaoyou.

388
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:46,945
I love you too.

389
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,381
What are they talking about?

390
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,383
Love.

391
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,286
Your friend Xiaoyou seems
to be more straightforward than you.

392
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,891
Ximen, I'm serious.

393
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,861
You look so beautiful when you're serious.

394
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,165
But for me, you're a little too serious.

395
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,301
What do you want me to do?

396
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,439
Date? Kiss? Get laid?

397
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,943
If you want, I can do every one of them
with you.

398
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,218
I'm sorry that I slapped you.

399
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,021
But what you just said is too much.

400
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,558
That's who I am.

401
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,930
For me, every woman's shelf life
is just a week.

402
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,165
And those things are all
in the standard procedure.

403
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,634
Xiaoyou,

404
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,870
I'm not a good fit for you.

405
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,006
I can only be your good lover
for one week.

406
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,410
But what you need is a good man.

407
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,579
But didn't you say

408
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,281
that a man who treasures the girl he loves
is a good man?

409
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,319
And you said, you're not a good person,
but you're a good man.

410
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,955
Why did you choose to live like that?

411
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,658
Haven't you ever met a girl
who you wanted to treasure--

412
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,559
Xiaoyou.

413
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,062
Don't pretend that you know me.

414
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,498
I hate women like this.

415
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:19,938
Ximen is angry.

416
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,808
It's the first time I saw him like that.

417
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,344
It's the first time I saw Xiaoyou
like that.

418
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,648
You stay here with your friend.
I'll go around the back to find Ximen.

419
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,459
Xiaoyou.

420
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,329
I happened to be nearby.
I heard everything.

421
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,499
I didn't mean it. I think...

422
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,400
Shancai.

423
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,770
Darn it, you really heard everything?

424
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,574
Don't get too upset.

425
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,776
I won't.

426
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,112
He said he didn't love me,

427
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,316
and I slapped him.

428
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,418
This is my first time slapping someone.

429
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,188
My hand hurts so bad.

430
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,925
I have to try harder.

431
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,395
Try harder? Try harder for what?

432
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,298
I want to know...

433
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,433
I want to know more about Ximen.

434
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,069
I think I already know a bit about him.

435
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:27,706
But didn't he just reject you?

436
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,544
Shancai, you don't have to say anything.

437
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,947
Just tell me to go for it, okay?

438
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,748
Xiaoyou.

439
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,785
Please, say it to me, okay?

440
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,256
Go for it.

441
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,067
Ximen.

442
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,769
What's up?

443
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,006
Nothing, I'll go on a date later.

444
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:02,908
What about you?

445
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,078
What happened?

446
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,648
Oh, I just change it up every now
and then.

447
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,286
The thing between Shancai
and Yamen is over, right?

448
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,057
I guess so.

449
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,629
Sometimes, I can't figure out
what women are thinking.

450
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:28,500
You can't figure it out
because you're serious.

451
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,938
If you aren't serious,
things will get a lot easier.

452
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:35,907
Ximen.

453
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,344
You're with a different girl every day.

454
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,413
There are no true feelings in it.

455
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,415
Don't you get bored?

456
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:50,922
Those girls are different on the outside
but they're all the same inside.

457
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,692
I don't need to try to remember them.

458
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,596
For me, their shelf life expire fast.

459
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,933
There's nothing boring. Isn't it great?

460
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,703
Ximen, I've always wanted to ask you,

461
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,173
women are not canned food,
how could they have a shelf life?

462
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,178
Ah Si.

463
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,881
I'm actually jealous of you.

464
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:20,385
Sometimes, it's great to be brainless.

465
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,356
Do you want to get beaten up?

466
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,398
<i>I want to know...</i>

467
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,534
<i>I want to know more about Ximen.</i>

468
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,337
<i>I think I already know a bit about him.</i>

469
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,772
Shancai, you don't have to say anything.

470
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,275
Just tell me to go for it, okay?

471
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:54,486
<i>When Xiaoyou was saying that,
I could see her shoulders shivering.</i>

472
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,723
<i>I thought she would cry
after Ximen rejected her.</i>

473
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,459
<i>But she smiled,
saying she would try harder.</i>

474
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,296
<i>I didn't know she was this strong now.</i>

475
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,834
<i>Compared to her,
I seem to be more cowardly.</i>

476
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,287
Thief! There's a thief! Help!

477
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,031
-Hello.
<i>-Help! There's a thief!</i>

478
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,300
<i>-Who's there? Help!</i>
-Hello, Shancai.

479
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,239
<i>-Help! There's a thief! Help!</i>
-Shancai!

480
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,909
Did you see the face
of the man breaking into the house?

481
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,713
No. It was too dark,
so I didn't see his face.

482
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,381
And he immediately ran away.

483
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,985
There have been cases
in which women's underwear was stolen.

484
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,787
You have to be careful
since you live here alone.

485
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,221
-Okay, got it.
-Here is your ID card.

486
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,490
-Thank you. Okay.
-Here, sign your name here.

487
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,427
Right, if there is a burglar breaking in,
don't fight with them.

488
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,529
-That could be dangerous.
-Okay, got it.

489
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,063
We'll plan more patrols nearby.

490
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,131
Thank you.

491
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,438
Thank you. Sorry for the hassle.

492
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,173
-Stay safe.
-Thank you.

493
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,257
Shancai!

494
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,661
Shancai. Open up.

495
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,162
-Daoming Si.
-Shancai.

496
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,031
Shancai!

497
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,299
Daoming Si.

498
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,400
Are you hurt?

499
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,735
-Where's that thief?
-I'm fine.

500
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,003
How did you know about the thief?

501
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,839
Don't you know you just called me?

502
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,273
I don't know.

503
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,476
I was so worried about you.

504
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,845
Did you come here in your pajamas?

505
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,014
It was great that I was thinking
about Xiaoyou so I wasn't asleep.

506
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,716
I knew it the moment that thief broke in.

507
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,152
Don't let me catch him
or I will tear him in half.

508
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,055
-Are you leaving?
-What?

509
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,957
I said are you leaving?

510
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,560
I can stay here if you want.

511
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:20,765
No, I just want to discuss the things
between Xiaoyou and Ximen with you.

512
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,736
Tell her to give up. It's impossible.

513
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,373
It's better if she gives up early.
Otherwise, she will get hurt really bad.

514
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,812
Okay. Don't think about that now.
Sleep early, close the doors and windows.

515
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,282
What kind of people are your neighbors?

516
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,017
I think the next door
hasn't been rented yet.

517
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,085
There's no one there.

518
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,921
-Okay. You should sleep early.
-Okay.

519
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,890
Or do you want me to stay here with you?

520
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,791
Stop it. Go home already.

521
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,180
Xiaoyou.

522
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,349
Why are you here so early?

523
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,287
The servant told me when I came back
that you were waiting for me this morning.

524
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,423
I'm sorry for waiting outside your house.

525
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,225
That's okay.

526
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,494
But how did you know
what time I would come back?

527
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:26,998
I would be waiting until you were here.
Unless you wouldn't come home at all.

528
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,637
Actually, I'm here to apologize to you.

529
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,839
Apologize to me?

530
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,975
I'm so sorry for what happened yesterday.

531
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:38,376
Sorry for what?

532
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,347
I slapped you.

533
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,017
Oh, it's okay.

534
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,552
Have a seat.

535
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,593
Actually, you don't need
to apologize to me.

536
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,630
Every time I dump a woman, I get slapped.

537
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,332
I'm used to it.

538
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,970
I can't accept this.

539
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,972
You've fully recovered.

540
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:13,345
There was a moment yesterday
that I thought I broke your playboy mask.

541
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,621
I will put it this way.

542
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,024
I'll never get into a relationship...

543
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,495
with girls in Yingde.

544
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,864
Do you know why?

545
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,337
Is it because they're too close
to your life,

546
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,672
so things will get complicated?

547
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,107
You're so smart.

548
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,510
You're a good friend of Shancai, right?

549
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,414
Shancai is the girlfriend
of my good friend.

550
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,016
For me,

551
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,952
dealing with you is more complicated
than dealing with girls in Yingde.

552
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,259
Sorry for saying it so frankly.

553
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:04,663
But isn't it great that all of us
can be friends and hang out?

554
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,033
It's time to get to school.

555
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,868
Aren't you running late, too?

556
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,237
I'm going upstairs to take a bath.

557
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,550
What's the matter, Xiaoyou?

558
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,185
I want the full set.

559
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,724
I want the full service.

560
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,859
Ximen, didn't you say

561
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:39,264
that you were fine with dating,
kissing, and getting laid?

562
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,370
You're not the kind
of girl who would say that.

563
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,305
You're acting so weird.

564
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,209
If I can't say it,
how can I love a man like you?

565
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,951
I'll give you my phone number.

566
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,757
You can contact me
after you find a good time.

567
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,295
I'm leaving now, bye-bye.

568
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,634
Sorry for wasting your time. Bye-bye.

569
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,955
I have to try harder.

570
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,124
Go for it.

571
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,764
<i>Mom, over here.</i>

572
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,600
Why did you come here?

573
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,502
Oh, what a nice place you got.

574
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,338
Yeah, Qinghe and Huaze Lei found it
for me.

575
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,939
It's so good.

576
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,977
Last night, I didn't know why,

577
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:03,548
maybe it was the heat,
but your dad and I can't fall asleep.

578
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,550
So we were worried
that something happened to you

579
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,619
and I'm here to check on you.

580
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,354
What's in it, Mom?

581
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,023
Take a look.

582
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,161
-Fish?
-Yeah, a fish.

583
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:21,766
Don't treat it like any other fish.
Your dad caught it in the sea.

584
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,170
-Dad caught it?
-Yeah, your dad can catch fish now.

585
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,305
Do you have a kitchen here?

586
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,174
I will cook fish soup
so you can get some nutrition.

587
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,775
-Yeah, it's back there.
-Okay.

588
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,047
-I'll go check who's there, Mom.
-Okay.

589
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,454
Qinghe, why did you come here so early?

590
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,857
I saw the news this morning.

591
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,626
It said that there's
a freak stealing women's underwear.

592
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,795
-Why are you so loud?
-What freak?

593
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,064
Ma'am, you're here.

594
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,900
You were worried after watching the news
this morning so you came here, right?

595
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,970
My god, how could I leave you here?

596
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,505
See, why are you exaggerating it?

597
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,942
Ma'am, relax. I'll protect Shancai.
I even brought breakfast for you.

598
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,176
-Thanks.
-Oh, it's just for two.

599
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,344
It's okay, I'll buy some more.

600
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:09,247
I saw people moving in next door
on my way here.

601
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:11,182
-Really?
-You have neighbors?

602
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,984
That's great. We can take care
of each other.

603
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,485
Come on. Mom will take you to greet them.

604
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,820
-Mom, it's too early.
-Too dangerous.

605
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,223
You have to know your neighbors.

606
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,224
Wait for me.

607
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,658
Come on.

608
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,693
Ma'am, don't rush.

609
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,796
What if this neighbor is a freak
who also steal people's underwear?

610
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,866
Hey, it's bad luck to say that.
We can't be so unlucky.

611
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,801
No. I think I can protect Shancai
by myself.

612
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,570
Excuse me, anybody home?

613
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,839
Is there anybody home?

614
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,911
Young Master Daoming Si.

615
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,748
Why are you here?

616
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,416
What are you doing here?

617
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,119
I've rented this house.

618
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,623
Why did you rent this house?

619
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:57,262
Because of what happened yesterday,
I want to stay near to protect you.

620
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,730
Yeah.

621
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,933
Young Master Daoming Si
can protect Shancai this way.

622
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,668
<i>Daoming Si, what are you up to?</i>

623
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,637
How much did you pay to rent this house?

624
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,105
NTD 200,000.

625
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,107
NTD 200,000?

626
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,176
I said I would pay NTD 200,000 every month
to rent this house.

627
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,845
And he said I didn't need a warrantor.

628
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,480
And he gave me so much furniture.

629
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,216
Are you an idiot? You paid NTD 200,000
to rent such a shabby house.

630
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,051
You should return the house
as soon as possible.

631
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,553
You talk too much. I've already rented it.

632
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,628
<i>I'm not an idiot.</i>

633
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,130
<i>Of course, I can see it.</i>

634
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,100
<i>You're worried about me
so you rented the house next to mine.</i>

635
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,673
<i>This gesture is really surprising.</i>

636
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,310
What did Qinghe bring you this morning?

637
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,146
I think it's misua.

638
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,349
Is this something edible?

639
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,084
Try it.

640
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,089
I'll do it for you.

641
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,671
<i>This shabby house, misua, and Daoming Si</i>

642
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,607
<i>can get into the "incompatible stuff"
top ten list.</i>

643
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,011
Why are you laughing?

644
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,380
Nothing.

645
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,758
<i>When did that woman become such
a daredevil?</i>

646
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,059
She doesn't look like one.

647
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,029
Yeah, this sounds exactly like
what Shancai's friend would do.

648
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,432
She has taken the initiative.

649
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,369
Pushing her away doesn't sound
like something you will do.

650
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,037
Give me a break.

651
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,106
You know very well
that she's the type I fear the most.

652
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,273
Yeah.

653
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,542
She is very brave.

654
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,913
But she is too pure
for a veteran like you.

655
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,951
If you treat her badly,
even I can't just sit here and watch.

656
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,453
I'm also afraid
that Shancai will punch me.

657
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,625
Yeah, don't you keep all your girlfriends
for just one week?

658
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,694
If you do that to Xiaoyou,

659
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,163
even if she doesn't hate you,
Shancai won't let you get away with it.

660
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,733
In my opinion,
you'd better not touch this hot potato.

661
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,302
Got something to do?

662
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:19,937
I have a date.

663
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,474
Then you should leave now.

664
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,244
Are you okay here alone?

665
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,346
I got nothing to do anyway.

666
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,383
Okay.

667
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,719
-I'll get going.
-Pay the bill if you leave first.

668
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,754
I know.

669
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,731
Hey, Ximen, why are you here alone?

670
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,199
Would you like to come and join us?

671
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,669
I got something to do today.
Another day, okay?

672
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,405
Okay. I'm leaving now, bye.

673
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,340
Xiaoyou.

674
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:30,942
It's Ximen.

675
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,511
What time will you get off from work?

676
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,062
<i>The lights in Daoming Si's place
are still on.</i>

677
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,830
<i>Is he still awake?</i>

678
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,071
<i>The ceiling here is so low.</i>

679
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,974
<i>And this old house smells moldy.</i>

680
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,276
<i>How could anyone sleep here?</i>

681
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,816
<i>I didn't know Shancai was living
in this kind of environment.</i>

682
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,728
<i>What we've been through
made our connection stronger.</i>

683
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,386
