1
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,358
Gosh. Is this your house?

2
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,561
It's just as big as my bathroom.

3
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,565
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,001
This is not a zoo.
There's nothing worthy to look at.

5
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,803
The size doesn't matter.

6
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,273
How about the neighborhood?
Is it safe living by yourself?

7
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,342
It's fine.

8
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,510
Right, we can call Ah Si to come here.

9
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,746
-No.
-Why?

10
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,715
Why?

11
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,918
Because my house is too small,
and there's no place to sit.

12
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,454
You would get bored
and would want to leave soon anyway.

13
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,289
So why bother inviting more people?

14
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,459
Speaking of Ah Si, I don't know
what he's doing right now.

15
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,027
Why didn't he go to school again today?

16
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,397
Aren't things going well between him
and Xiaozi recently?

17
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,667
Shancai, do you know
how they are recently?

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,502
How would I know that?

19
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,842
Just drink and stop asking her questions.

20
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,580
Who could that be? I'll get the door.
You can keep drinking.

21
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,215
Coming.

22
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,383
Cheers.

23
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,489
Why is beer without ice so disgusting?

24
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,968
I thought we'll never meet again.

25
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,138
However, I have a question for you.

26
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,507
What exactly did you do?

27
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,945
Xiaozi's mother and Ah Si

28
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,615
decided to cancel the engagement.

29
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,350
Cancel the engagement?

30
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,721
When will you stop meddling
with Daoming Si's life?

31
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,690
I didn't do anything.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,292
I knew you would say something like that.

33
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,562
Your parents must be teaching you

34
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:20,367
mean and dirty tricks
that normal people can't think of.

35
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,937
Mrs. Daoming, you're damaging your dignity
with these words.

36
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,207
How dare you talk to me like that.

37
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,010
You want to lecture me
even if I am older than you?

38
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,414
Sorry, ma'am. I think there might be
some misunderstanding

39
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,049
between Ah Si and Xiaozi.

40
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,018
There's none. And you don't have the right

41
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:42,756
to say anything about it
even if there is a misunderstanding.

42
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,562
I heard your parents moved
to a fishing village.

43
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,631
What a pity.

44
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,235
If they hadn't rejected my offer,
they will be living happily now.

45
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,371
Isn't it great if you just accepted
the NTD 10 million?

46
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,745
Is inviting men to your house
one of your skills too?

47
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,686
Stop being rude to me, you silly, old hag.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,155
Old hag?

49
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,759
Yes, that's you, old hag.

50
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,494
If your son is so precious,

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,296
why don't you just keep him
on a leash at your big house?

52
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,399
Miss Shancai.

53
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,569
Who do you think you are?

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,272
How dare you speak to me like that.

55
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,807
I'm a nobody.

56
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,077
Perhaps to you I'm just like a weed.

57
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,813
But I'm going to tell you clearly,

58
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,749
I've never done anything for people
to look down on me and despise me.

59
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,953
But now, I sincerely despise you.

60
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,190
You're the worst person I've ever met.

61
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,193
To you, no one is worthy
except you and your son.

62
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,695
You treat others like they are nothing.

63
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,799
You're not welcome in my world.
Get out of my house.

64
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,920
Shancai, you were awesome.

65
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,488
Have you seen her face?

66
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,490
She was furious.

67
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,493
Shancai, you've been saying
you're just a weed,

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,495
but you're way stronger than that.

69
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,263
You have earned my respect.

70
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,765
That is unbelievable.

71
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,734
I don't know what I did just now.

72
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,238
I'm just so mad at her
so I said all those mean things.

73
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,842
So, Ah Si broke up with Xiaozi.

74
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,945
I did think those two weirdos
would break up eventually.

75
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,580
It just happened quicker than I thought.

76
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,983
What are you going to do, Shancai?

77
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,018
Ah Si's mom won't give up so easily.

78
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,487
Right, I agree with Lei.

79
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,356
We should come up with a solution.

80
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,625
You can't escape anymore.

81
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,328
I won't run away nor admit defeat.

82
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,563
The more she fights,
the stronger I will be.

83
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,433
I'll fight her to the end
just like a tenacious weed.

84
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,034
How will you fight against her?

85
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,303
How?

86
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,505
She's a legend in the hotel industry.

87
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,442
Plus, she's the queen
of the Daoming Corporation.

88
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,612
So? She's just a human being as well.

89
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,280
You're too naive.

90
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,983
-She can bring you down easily.
-Right.

91
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,552
You're telling me this now?
You just said you will support me.

92
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,754
Now you're scaring me.

93
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,689
I'm not going to lose.

94
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,391
We are not scaring you.

95
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,960
We just want to know
how you're going to do it.

96
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,031
Well, I...

97
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,034
Hey, what kind of attitude is that?

98
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,038
Get in a relationship with Ah Si.
What do you think?

99
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,940
No, thanks.

100
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,508
That is a good idea.

101
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,843
Get together with her only son.

102
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,913
She'll go mad, and thus,
the war between the two women begins.

103
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,882
This is the perfect way to deal with her.

104
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,517
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,152
Yeah, that's right.

106
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,922
Or have a baby with Ah Si,
then you'll definitely win this battle.

107
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,423
Have a baby?

108
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,258
That is way too much.

109
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,260
The Empress Dowager
will abandon that child.

110
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,797
Or she will just make Shancai
and her child disappear...

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,667
Excuse me.

112
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,170
Did I really say something outrageous?

113
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,872
-Yes.
-You said it.

114
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,442
Could I take them back?

115
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,845
Stop kidding. You've got witnesses.
We're cheering for you.

116
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,916
You've said it. You can't back out now.

117
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,551
There's nothing to fear.

118
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,055
Besides, you are the one that Ah Si loves.

119
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,524
There is no escaping this.

120
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,926
Sooner or later, you will have
to face the Empress Dowager.

121
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,628
No matter what,

122
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,698
-we'll help you as much as possible.
-Right.

123
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,467
Do your best. We'll stand by you.

124
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,768
We'll support you.

125
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,509
<i>If I can choose,</i>

126
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,511
<i>I would rather have Lei beside me,</i>

127
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,146
<i>and not Daoming Si.</i>

128
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,983
<i>Lei always makes me feel calm.</i>

129
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,485
<i>Daoming Si has such a horrible mother</i>

130
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,620
<i>and has a complicated family.</i>

131
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,223
<i>His world is such a dangerous one.</i>

132
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,227
<i>Why would I push myself towards a war?</i>

133
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,496
<i>Why would I step into that danger?</i>

134
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,779
I'm thinking that
if Ah Si can accept Xiaozi,

135
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,448
will this be a happy ending?

136
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,083
I know what you mean.

137
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,986
Do you think it's wrong for us

138
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,856
to encourage Shancai and Ah Si
to be together?

139
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,094
There is an old saying,
"We make our own future."

140
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,963
All of us know that well.

141
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,566
But that might not apply to us.

142
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,569
Stop overthinking.

143
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,539
Lei.

144
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,742
What if you didn't give up Shancai
because of Ah Si,

145
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,310
how do you think this would have turn out?

146
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,613
We're all friends.

147
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,481
I'm not disregarding Lei's feelings

148
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,084
nor am I standing by Ah Si, but...

149
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,888
I just think this is not the right time
to bring that up.

150
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,897
Let's get something to drink.

151
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,704
<i>Buy every house near that poor girl,</i>

152
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,240
including the house she's living in now.

153
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,943
Yes, madam. I'll do it right away.

154
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,519
-Are you serious?
-Ouch!

155
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,721
She is challenging my mother
after I cancelled my engagement?

156
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,357
Yeah, basically. That hurts. Let go!

157
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,828
We wanted to tell you last night,

158
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,029
we just couldn't find you.

159
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,565
Yes. But your mother knows
where she lives now.

160
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,501
She might do something
that Shancai won't be aware of.

161
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,170
Shancai is living on her own now.

162
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,139
You should think about this seriously.

163
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,408
We'll visit her frequently if you want.

164
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,644
No need, thank you.

165
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,079
You're not going there.

166
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,316
She's a single lady
and you're both lady-killers.

167
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,184
She would be more in danger
with you than my mother.

168
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,487
-Hey.
-You should be thankful, though.

169
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,256
What? Why? Just stay away.

170
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,691
You guys can't see her.

171
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,227
Lei, you too.

172
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,028
Fine, we're not going to see her.

173
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,697
But you should go and see her tonight.

174
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,432
Just to be a brave knight. Right?

175
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,033
What "night"?

176
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,602
Why are you saying
such a disgusting thing?

177
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,604
What? What are you thinking?

178
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,773
You said a "great night..."

179
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,309
I told you to be a brave knight!

180
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,579
Why would that be called a "knight"?

181
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,315
A brave knight! To protect her!

182
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,284
You idiot.

183
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,753
What idiot?
You're such a bunch of weird guys.

184
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,954
-Why blame us?
-Silly head.

185
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,990
We're being serious.

186
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,825
You made it sound erotic.

187
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,760
What? It was you, not me.

188
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,662
-Why you...
-Hey...

189
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,847
It's from mom.

190
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,190
<i>Dear Shancai.</i>

191
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,659
<i>How's your day?</i>

192
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,195
<i>I'm missing you so much.</i>

193
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,499
<i>I'm getting used to the village life.</i>

194
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,301
<i>But I feel so sorry</i>

195
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,738
<i>that I can't give you money
for your living expenses now.</i>

196
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,574
<i>So please take care of yourself</i>

197
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,943
<i>with your part-time salary.</i>

198
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:29,482
<i>Your dad is not doing well
with village work.</i>

199
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,553
<i>He feels dizzy and throws up
once he's on the boat.</i>

200
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,488
<i>He can't work properly.</i>

201
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,891
<i>So we just have limited income now.</i>

202
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,495
<i>Nevertheless, your dad is working hard.</i>

203
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,565
<i>Shancai, please take care of yourself.</i>

204
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:50,136
<i>Be brave when I'm not by your side.</i>

205
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,704
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

206
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,590
-Landlord.
-Here you are, Shancai.

207
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,994
Great. Please move out immediately.

208
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,696
Why?

209
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,532
Is it because of the unpaid rent?

210
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,667
I'll get paid on the 5th, next month.

211
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,369
I'll pay you at once.

212
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,971
-Please, I beg you.
-Impossible.

213
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,873
The house has been sold.

214
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,009
I can't rent it out anymore.

215
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,079
So I'm hoping you can leave tonight.

216
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,515
For the rent that you owe me,

217
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,551
I'll just let it go.

218
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,520
But you better move out immediately.

219
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,758
Or I'll throw all your stuff
out on the streets.

220
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,628
I'll be back in two hours.

221
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,104
<i>What should I do?</i>

222
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,473
<i>Where am I going to go?</i>

223
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,511
<i>I just vowed to fight the old hag,</i>

224
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,648
<i>and now I'm homeless.</i>

225
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,999
Why would she move out suddenly?

226
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,768
-Why?
-How would I know?

227
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,737
It must be because of her parents.

228
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,106
They have unpaid rents, too.

229
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,176
-Maybe that's why she ran away.
-Impossible!

230
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,944
You must have forced her to leave, right?

231
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,379
Why are you beating me? Stop it.

232
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,648
Stop right there! Where is she?

233
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,216
-Help!
-Where is she?

234
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,501
<i>This is the voice mail service.</i>

235
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,303
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

236
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,307
<i>Hi, this is Shancai.
Please leave a message.</i>

237
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,742
<i>Shancai, this is Daoming Si.</i>

238
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,344
<i>Where are you? Call me back.</i>

239
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,522
<i>Hi, this is Shancai.
Please leave a message.</i>

240
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,660
Call me, Shancai.
You know I'm not a patient person.

241
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,810
<i>It's late.</i>

242
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,547
<i>Maybe it's not a good time
to call Qinghe or Xiaoyou.</i>

243
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>But I have no money.</i>

244
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,151
<i>I can't stay out here like this.</i>

245
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,787
<i>Maybe I should try calling them.</i>

246
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,730
Out of battery.

247
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,078
<i>You have ten messages.</i>

248
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,981
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

249
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,550
<i>Call me if you get this message.</i>

250
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,785
<i>Press one to repeat the message.</i>

251
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,288
<i>Press two for the next message.</i>

252
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,561
<i>Shancai, this is Daoming Si.</i>

253
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,429
<i>You silly girl, what are you doing?</i>

254
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,597
<i>Call me back.</i>

255
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,138
<i>I'm not a patient person.</i>

256
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,372
<i>Call me quickly!</i>

257
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,577
<i>You're driving me crazy.</i>

258
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,911
<i>Call me now.</i>

259
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,983
<i>Where are you, Shancai?</i>

260
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,719
<i>No matter how late it is,</i>

261
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,221
<i>call me if you hear this. Daoming Si.</i>

262
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,094
<i>You're driving me crazy.</i>

263
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,463
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

264
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,831
<i>Call me now.</i>

265
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,034
<i>Shancai...</i>

266
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,803
<i>Shancai...</i>

267
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,205
<i>Shancai...</i>

268
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,307
<i>Shancai...</i>

269
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,602
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,305
I just heard all your messages.

271
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,144
I finally found you.

272
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,548
How did you know where to find me?

273
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,720
I slapped you the last time we're here.

274
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,524
And I've been regretting it ever since.

275
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,193
<i>You're the perfect match.</i>

276
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,695
<i>Your mother likes her.</i>

277
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,263
I think you would make a great couple.

278
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,798
You should be with her.

279
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,433
Stop talking!

280
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,969
Do you know your love stresses me out?

281
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,737
We can never be together.

282
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,040
Xiaozi is a nice girl.
You should be with her.

283
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,441
Don't come for me...

284
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,987
You're always finding reasons...

285
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,223
to avoid me.

286
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,262
I don't know what to do with you.

287
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,167
Stop running away. Okay?

288
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,706
Let's face the problem together.

289
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,110
Just trust me.

290
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,480
Leave it all to me.

291
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,751
Daoming Si.

292
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,490
Hey, Daoming Si.
Why are you bringing me to your house?

293
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,825
I can't be here.

294
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,193
Let's face my mother.

295
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,794
Didn't you start a war with her?

296
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,230
Let's do this. I'll be your shield.

297
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,498
Where is my mother?

298
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,866
Madam is not here, master.

299
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,135
She went back to London.

300
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,903
Madam won't be here for a while

301
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,039
because of some urgent matters.

302
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,507
Awesome. You can stay here.

303
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,743
Why? This is weird.

304
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,244
Take her luggage to the guest room.

305
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,012
Wait. Let me think about it.

306
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,714
I said something rude
to your mother yesterday.

307
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,049
And now, I'm here.

308
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,951
Why are you talking so much?
Take this to her room.

309
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,419
-No, Daoming Si.
-Stop it.

310
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,020
-Stop this argument.
-Wait!

311
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,489
Where do you think you are right now?

312
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,025
Do we still have rules to follow
inside this house?

313
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,866
<i>This old woman is still alive.</i>

314
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,035
-Mrs. Yu.
- Mrs. Yu.

315
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,704
Who is she?

316
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,808
Why did you come back, Aunt Yu?

317
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,815
Look here, Shancai is my friend.

318
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,683
She'll be living here from now on.

319
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,286
So you're Shancai.

320
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,223
Master.

321
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,826
Madam has gone back to London.

322
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:38,097
She told me to keep
this household organized.

323
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,000
Madam said she needs someone

324
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,569
who will take charge of everything
while she's away.

325
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,905
So I'm here.

326
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:52,044
<i>Even though she's old,
she's forceful and strict.</i>

327
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,579
<i>She's full of confidence.</i>

328
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,920
If master is insisting to let
Miss Shancai stay here,

329
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,823
I won't object to that.

330
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,726
Miss Shancai, you can stay here as a maid.

331
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,562
A maid?

332
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,097
You're asking Shancai to be a maid?

333
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,433
Aunt Yu, are you out of your mind?

334
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,901
Master.

335
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:21,040
Even your father won't dare speak
to me like that.

336
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,914
Youngsters nowadays,
without working for anything,

337
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:32,551
expect everything to be handed
to them for free.

338
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,521
So they stick to anyone
who can provide free food and shelter.

339
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:36,822
You old...

340
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,025
...lady, I can't hold my temper
if you act like this.

341
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,795
Please be gentle, ma'am.

342
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,363
I didn't say I want to stay.

343
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,434
Perhaps the times really have changed.

344
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,203
The youngsters are not able
to endure hardships.

345
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,772
They are useless like bugs.

346
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,208
Don't even talk
about accepting challenges.

347
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,143
-I'm not--
-If not,

348
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,446
why can't Miss Shancai work here

349
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:04,350
as payment for her meals and lodging?

350
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,254
Why don't you earn your stay here
by working?

351
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,555
There is nothing that I can't do.

352
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,091
Ma'am, you better not look down on anyone.

353
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,525
If I'm going to live here,

354
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,527
I will definitely not stay here for free.

355
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,796
Is that so?

356
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,531
Then are you prepared to do
what you just said?

357
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,333
That's right.

358
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,570
I will work hard while I'm staying here.

359
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,338
Shut up, you two.

360
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,507
How can I allow that?

361
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,175
Stop kidding, Aunt Yu.

362
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,243
Daoming Si.

363
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,879
She is right.

364
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,782
I'm homeless and have no money
at the moment.

365
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,752
Also, we said we would fight together.

366
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,488
When your mother gets back,

367
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,223
how will I face her?

368
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,759
I can't tell her that I was forced
to leave by the landlord,

369
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,994
that's why I'm living here shamelessly.

370
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,930
I need a proper reason.

371
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,198
I feel like I can hold my head high

372
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,867
if I am working here as a maid.

373
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,702
This is too much.

374
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,637
You want to be at my beck and call?

375
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,740
-But...
-No, I disagree.

376
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,309
I'm totally against this.

377
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:05,611
Fine.

378
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,713
Then I'll have to think of another way.

379
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,749
You really want me to treat you
as a servant?

380
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,287
Whatever.

381
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,862
Then I'll guide and teach you what to do.

382
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:28,067
There are lots of work to do
in this huge house.

383
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,668
You'll be working hard.

384
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,639
I won't give you special treatment

385
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:37,276
just because you're a friend
of the young master. Understand?

386
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,713
- Yes.
-Louder, I can't hear you.

387
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,247
Yes.

388
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,583
Very good.

389
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,319
Come, it's time to change
into the servant's uniform.

390
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,365
Come in.

391
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,837
Young Master, you've become more mature
since the last time I saw you.

392
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,406
Aunt Yu.

393
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,608
What were you thinking?

394
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,511
Shancai is...

395
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,481
She's my guest.

396
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,750
Why did you want her
to work here as a maid?

397
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,086
Master has grown up.

398
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,589
You don't listen to me anymore.

399
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:29,495
Our young master, who used to pee
in his bed when he was a boy,

400
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:33,632
is all grown up, and is now talking
to me in this manner.

401
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,502
Didn't you retire last year
because of back pains?

402
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:37,870
Why have you come back?

403
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,507
At your age, you should be resting now.

404
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,710
What? I've said before

405
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,012
that as long as I'm needed
by the Daoming family,

406
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,314
I will never retire.

407
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,785
Madam asked me to come back.

408
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,120
It's because of you, master.

409
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,023
-And that girl.
-My mother?

410
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,727
Did you come back just to help her out?

411
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,896
What are you saying?

412
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,666
Am I puppet that can be controlled
by anybody?

413
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,235
A puppet that cannot think on its own?

414
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,807
Madam did call me back.

415
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,876
But it's up to me

416
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,179
how I will run this household.

417
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,484
I'm not going to forgive someone
who did wrong, even if it's you, master.

418
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,353
I'm afraid you're too old to know
who's right and who's wrong.

419
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,457
I may be old,

420
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,861
but I can tell from your conversation
with that young lady,

421
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:40,132
she is the one you love.

422
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:45,537
Maybe I'm old now, I can't be too sure.

423
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,572
I'll be going then.

424
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,140
Hey, Aunt Yu.

425
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,811
What's the matter, Young Master?

426
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,446
What do you have in mind?

427
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,787
Well, I may be old,

428
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,922
but I'm not coldhearted.

429
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:08,460
Fine. How about making her
your personal maid?

430
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,929
How is that?

431
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,847
<i>Wake up at 5:00 a.m.</i>

432
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,752
All floors must be cleaned
before 6:00 a.m.

433
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,188
Breakfast prepared by 7:00 a.m.

434
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:41,894
And you! Come back right after
you have finished your classes.

435
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,097
No time for wandering around.
Do you hear me?

436
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,300
There's no secret to being a good maid,

437
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,435
except serving your master well.

438
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:56,475
I decided to make you
the young master's personal maid.

439
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,977
I am the law here.

440
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:04,049
Starting tomorrow, you will wake him up.

441
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,485
You will take care of all his needs
until he sleeps.

442
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,153
When I say "go," you go.

443
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,923
Now go and wake the young master!

444
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,426
What was that? She's the law.

445
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,261
This is too weird.

446
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:22,301
I never thought that I would be
Daoming Si's personal maid.

447
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,970
And I need to wake him up every day.

448
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,176
No matter, I'll treat it
like any other normal job.

449
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,534
Daoming Si.

450
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,372
Young Master, wake up.

451
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,052
Young Master, wake up.

452
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,725
You're running late for school.

453
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,997
Why isn't he responding?

454
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,698
He's like a dead man.

455
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:37,309
<i>This is the first time
I've looked at his face this close.</i>

456
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,312
<i>Such a pointy nose.</i>

457
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,980
<i>His lashes are long too.</i>

458
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,588
What are you doing? Let go, you pervert!

459
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,023
What are you doing?

460
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,090
What?

461
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,592
Why are you so rude?

462
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,160
Can't you be more gentle
when waking me up?

463
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,062
Why did you hug me?
Are you pretending to be asleep?

464
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,865
Why would I do that?

465
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,134
I must be dreaming.

466
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,569
You must be dreaming
about something disgusting.

467
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,772
And this early in the morning?
I can't believe you.

468
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,609
Can I control my dream?

469
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,783
Why are you being shy?

470
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,285
I'm not! Wake up.

471
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,653
You're running late for school.

472
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,231
Really? This is not making any sense.

473
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,933
Shancai is now your personal maid.

474
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,536
Twenty-four-hour service.

475
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,571
You're so lucky, Ah Si.

476
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,374
We're still worrying about you not being
able to fight the Empress Dowager.

477
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:46,244
So, are you going to school
and go home together from now on?

478
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,246
Sleep in the same house?

479
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,881
None of your business.

480
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,217
That's great.

481
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,487
Your sister called us yesterday
and asked us to support you two.

482
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,223
She said she doesn't want anyone else
get manipulated by your mother.

483
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,359
Like what happened to her.

484
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,993
But seeing the situation now,

485
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,296
-it seems everything's fine.
-Right.

486
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,666
So grab this opportunity

487
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,368
while Shancai is your personal maid.

488
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,403
Just like what we've said before,

489
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,605
-You know...
-do it before the Empress Dowager returns.

490
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,174
-What?
-You know...

491
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,643
What's that?

492
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,412
Gosh, that one!

493
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,114
Ah Si is not brave enough.

494
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,716
He can't do anything when he sees Shancai.

495
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,053
You're talking so much nonsense today.

496
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,088
-That's what you are.
-Right.

497
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,023
Or you can call Shancai now

498
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,692
and say you'll be at her room tonight.

499
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,060
No.

500
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,603
I'll call her. I'm not afraid.

501
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,405
I'll dial it for you.

502
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,479
Hey, Shancai.

503
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:57,215
I'll come to your room
at 12:00 p.m. tonight. Bye.

504
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,264
It's almost 12:00 p.m.

505
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,032
What should I do?

506
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,802
What does he want?

507
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,204
Gosh.

508
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,241
I've locked the door.
I'll just pretend to be asleep.

509
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,051
No way. He must have a key to my room.

510
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,954
What should I do?

511
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,557
I'm so nervous.

512
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,058
He is always like this.

513
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,393
He doesn't care about others.

514
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,994
He gets everything he wants.

515
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,799
Gosh! Just let that man fall asleep.

516
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,168
This is ridiculous.

517
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,503
I'm his employee now.

518
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,338
It is sexual harassment

519
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,340
if he comes to my room at midnight.

520
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,176
Right. I can tell him that.

521
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,313
No way. He's stupid.

522
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,848
He won't understand.

523
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,917
Should I just wait for him to violate me?

524
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,088
I must escape. I'll go to Xiaoyou's place.

525
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,091
I'll leave the rest for tomorrow.

526
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,196
You're so slow. Are you a turtle?

527
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:20,799
It's already late...

528
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,534
Shut up. This is just the right time.

529
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,736
-The right time?
-Follow me.

530
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,338
We can't do that.

531
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,490
You came for me at night
just for stargazing?

532
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,927
How weird. I can't focus it
at the right spot.

533
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,863
Isn't that the eastern side?

534
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,905
<i>I'm really an idiot.</i>

535
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,207
<i>Why did I think too much?</i>

536
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,215
Are you an idiot? Why are you laughing?

537
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,449
Right.

538
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,453
Be quiet. You're too noisy.

539
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,592
What are you looking at? I want to see.

540
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,629
Wait. It's not adjusted yet.
Why are you so impatient?

541
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,431
-Let me see.
-Don't touch it!

542
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,400
-There's nothing...
-There will be a huge difference...

543
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,968
Let me take a look.

544
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,436
-Adjust later.
-Why are you so annoying?

545
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,771
I haven't found it yet.

546
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,372
What are you looking for?

547
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,241
Let me see. I'll help you find it.

548
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,215
Daoming Si, are you done?

549
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,419
What are you doing? I'm so sleepy.

550
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,155
I have to wake up by 5:00 a.m.

551
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,690
What are you...

552
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,291
Hey, I got it. Come on!

553
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,759
There's a meteor shower tonight.

554
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,061
A meteor shower?

555
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,063
Come on, quick!

556
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,300
There's nothing there.

557
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,269
Be patient.

558
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,643
Gosh, I see it! It's so beautiful.

559
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,447
Did you see the one that is circled
by a ring of light?

560
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:20,285
Yes. It shines like a diamond.

561
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,089
The meteor that's wrapped
in that ring of light,

562
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:27,292
doesn't it look like
it's being carried by Cupid's wings?

563
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,962
You mean the light that surrounds
the meteor is Cupid's wings?

564
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,099
Right. So, if any couple
can see this meteor

565
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,136
before it falls down from the sky,

566
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,772
they will be locked closely together,

567
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,477
just like being held together tight
by Cupid's wings.

568
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,381
They're now forever marked
with the symbol of love.

569
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,384
Here.

570
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,994
It's a diamond.

571
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,797
I tried to find a necklace
just like the meteor that you saw,

572
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,832
but I failed to find one.

573
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,402
So I had one custom made.

574
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,670
This is for you.

575
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,606
No, I can't take this.
This is too expensive.

576
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,041
You can't say no.

577
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,143
-But...
-I'll help you put it on.

578
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,698
You.

579
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,735
Do I need a reason

580
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,037
to give a gift to the girl I love?

581
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,510
Shancai.

582
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,413
Let's date officially.

583
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:28,473
What if my love for you
is only one-tenth of your love for me,

584
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,441
would you still date with me?

585
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,877
Only one-tenth?

586
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,414
-You...
-I'm sorry.

587
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,584
I think it's better to make things clear
from the beginning.

588
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,887
Because I have no confidence in loving you

589
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,924
as much as you love me.

590
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,233
All right.

591
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,170
When we're together,
I'll do my best to make up

592
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,073
for the remaining nine-tenths.

593
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,845
What if you can't?

594
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,517
If I can't...

595
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,654
I won't force you.

596
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,026
We'll break up then.

597
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,730
Live our own lives.

598
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,535
If that day comes,

599
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,572
I will let you go.

600
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,213
I don't like to drag this too long.

601
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,516
Let's give ourselves two months.

602
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,419
Give me an answer tomorrow morning.

603
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,198
What time is it now?
I still haven't seen her.

604
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,567
I must wake her up.

605
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,472
Good morning, Mrs. Yu.

606
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,911
I've cleaned the entrance hallway
and wiped the bookshelves.

607
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,613
I'm going to wake the master up.

608
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,185
Why is she so lively today?

609
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,059
Good morning, Young Master.

610
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,930
Why are you up so early?

611
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,032
How can I sleep?

612
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,439
I've made my decision
regarding what you said last night.

613
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,076
I'm willing to give it a try.

614
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,747
I will do my best to date you
in the next two months.

615
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,449
I'm looking forward to this.

616
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,722
Hey.

617
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,224
Hey.

618
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,963
Did you hear me?

619
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,765
Daoming Si!

620
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,535
I heard you. Why are you yelling at me?

621
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,438
Why are you being shy?

622
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,574
I'm not.

623
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,310
I'll get dressed for school then.

624
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,143
Really? When did this happen?

625
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,778
It's been two or three days.

626
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,379
I see.

627
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,583
But who would set a trial period
when they are dating someone?

628
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,986
A two-month trial period.

629
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,721
That is ridiculous.

630
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,023
Right. Daoming Si warned me today.

631
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,192
He told me not to cling
to Shancai anymore.

632
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,061
He's saying Shancai is his girlfriend.

633
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,497
He will beat me up
if I get too close with Shancai.

634
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,699
He's just joking with you.

635
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,370
You know what?

636
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,772
Everyone is buttering up Shancai
at school now.

637
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,842
They treat her nicely, but it's all fake.

638
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,877
She's not happy.

639
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,546
They don't match at all.

640
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,750
And when you see them
having lunch at school,

641
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,819
they look very awkward.

642
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,791
Though I've always been supportive
of Shancai's love life,

643
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,728
there is such a big gap
between her and Daoming Si.

644
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,766
If they can't overcome that
from the start,

645
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,102
things would only get
more complicated in the future.

646
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,737
Right. It's a mistake to date Daoming Si.

647
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,706
If she were with me,

648
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,075
I would guarantee
that nothing bad would happen to her.

649
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,680
<i>That's because everyone ignores you.</i>

650
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,649
-Xiaoyou.
-What?

651
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,918
Why don't you help me out?

652
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,187
Let's break them up.

653
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,756
We'll make them break up in two months.

654
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:48,826
You're so bad, Qinghe.

655
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,895
Shancai is our friend.

656
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,898
We should support her no matter what.

657
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,634
I know you love her.

658
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,670
But you need to let her go
if you really love her.

659
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,506
Love is letting someone go?

660
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,307
I'm feeling miserable.

661
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,310
Hey, Shancai. It's me.

662
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,713
Are you dating Daoming Si?

663
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,717
Qinghe told me.
He's here at the cake shop.

664
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,442
