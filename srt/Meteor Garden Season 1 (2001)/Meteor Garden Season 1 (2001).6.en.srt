1
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,256
Today is my 24th birthday.

2
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:33,193
I have an announcement to make.

3
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,530
I, Teng Tangjing,

4
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,701
will go back to Paris next month.

5
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,270
And I won't be back in the country

6
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,673
anytime soon.

7
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,409
Dad, Mom,

8
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,845
please forgive my willfulness.

9
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,415
Pretend that I've already gotten married.

10
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,650
Jing, what are you talking about?

11
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,851
You just came back.

12
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,888
Mom, I've already decided
to go back to France

13
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,024
to continue my doctorate in Law.

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,029
And I'll work pro bono all my life.

15
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,530
Stop talking nonsense.

16
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,766
You're my only daughter.

17
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,135
You're going to be the successor
of Teng Enterprises.

18
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,069
Dad.

19
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,606
Your company is not mine.

20
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,711
I want to establish my own career
and fulfill my dreams.

21
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,316
From now on,

22
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,586
I'm not going to be
Teng Enterprises' doll anymore.

23
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,724
Elegant clothes...

24
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,560
and beautiful hair...

25
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,698
are not important to me anymore.

26
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,001
From now on,

27
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,504
I'm going to be myself.

28
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,060
Huaze Lei.

29
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,297
Don't disturb him now.

30
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,904
<i>What will Huaze Lei do?</i>

31
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,872
<i>If Jing leaves,</i>

32
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,175
<i>they might not see each other again.</i>

33
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,058
Regarding the contract with our company,

34
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,995
could you put in a good word
to your father?

35
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,533
I never interfere
with my father's business.

36
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,237
Regarding your company's contract,

37
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,206
we can talk about it
when I become the successor.

38
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,477
However, that would be
seven or eight years from now.

39
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,545
If your company has not gone bankrupt yet,

40
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,447
I'll consider it.

41
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,548
Thank you.

42
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,784
<i>Cocky kid.</i>

43
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,586
<i>Just like his father.</i>

44
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,128
What are you doing over there?

45
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,196
You were eavesdropping.

46
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,433
I didn't do it on purpose.

47
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,335
I was going to...

48
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,075
<i>I have to say something.</i>

49
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,780
It's so nice to be the son
of a great businessman.

50
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,681
Looking at how great you think you are

51
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,450
makes me want to puke.

52
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,851
I am great.

53
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,187
For big enterprises like ours,

54
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,722
if they can't find my dad,

55
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,023
they'll whine to me.

56
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,160
This is a dog-eat-dog world.

57
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,495
Business owners who use back doors

58
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,765
would go bankrupt, of course.

59
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,135
Poor girls like you won't understand.

60
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,906
It's so rare for you to speak
like a human being.

61
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,912
Maybe that's what you did
to get that model earlier.

62
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,247
You were just playing her like a toy.

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,382
You frivolous jerk.

64
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,583
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,754
All those girls approach me
because of our money.

66
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,557
It's all because the Daoming Si name

67
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,358
can satisfy their desires.

68
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,394
Do you think I'd like that kind of girl?

69
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,962
Listen carefully.

70
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,531
Stop speaking nonsense.

71
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,703
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,312
However,

73
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,548
you should also apologize to me
about that day.

74
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,284
I don't know why you did that,

75
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,320
but if you apologize,

76
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,722
I'll just think I was bitten by a dog
and forget about it.

77
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,225
Dog? You're calling me a dog?

78
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,827
That's just a metaphor. Just apologize.

79
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,462
No. Why should I apologize?

80
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,732
It's your fault. Apologize now.

81
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,567
It's all your fault.

82
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,970
What did I do wrong? Tell me.

83
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,371
Apologize to me.

84
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,406
Look at yourself.

85
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,508
You're acting like an idiot.

86
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,478
Don't drink if you can't handle it.

87
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,080
What does it matter to you?

88
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,218
This is Armani.

89
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,620
<i>Get away!</i>

90
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,624
<i>Shancai, wake up.</i>

91
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,060
Shancai, wake up.

92
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,595
Ouch.

93
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,464
Ouch? That hurt, right?

94
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,867
You're a student, yet you got so drunk.

95
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,469
Is that something you should do?

96
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,675
You're so noisy.
My head is going to explode.

97
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,210
Shancai.

98
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,913
Do you know how you got home last night?

99
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,681
That's right.

100
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,384
Didn't I attend Jing's party last night?

101
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,854
Why can't I remember how I got home?

102
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,560
Young Master Daoming Si took you home.

103
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,296
What kind of expression is that, Mom?

104
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,797
What are you thinking again?

105
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,468
Shancai, you're really my good daughter.

106
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,305
Look at what I have. Ta-da!

107
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,508
What's that?

108
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,844
It's your progress chart
towards becoming Cinderella.

109
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,414
Look. This is the first time
he visited our house.

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,183
This is when he kissed you.

111
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,685
This is yesterday

112
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,454
when he took you home
because you're drunk.

113
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,655
This is great.

114
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,457
-What's this then?
-Oh.

115
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,127
This is a crow, which is you now.

116
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,229
It's going to be a phoenix soon,

117
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,432
which is you in the future.

118
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,367
This is great.

119
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,369
Everything is going according to plan.

120
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,739
My beautiful dream
would finally come true!

121
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,374
You mean Daoming Si and me?

122
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,275
I...

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,645
That's how you were yesterday.

124
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,048
Daoming Si smelled so badly
because you puked all over him.

125
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,583
That's right.

126
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,485
I remember now.

127
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,889
This is Armani.

128
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,358
Get away!

129
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,429
Good thing Daoming Si didn't mind,

130
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,431
or else I'll deal with you.

131
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,300
This is my dream.

132
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,668
All right. Wake up.

133
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,838
Go to school now.

134
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,073
Then act cute and apologize to Daoming Si

135
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,642
when you see him.

136
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,478
All right?

137
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,746
Based on our progress chart,

138
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,081
I think you can get him
after two more times.

139
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,649
My head is going to split open, Mom.

140
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,784
Stop talking about that.

141
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,819
I don't care. Go to school
even if your head splits open.

142
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,787
All right?

143
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,822
Breakfast is already on the table.

144
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,923
Remember to eat it.

145
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,526
Wear nicer clothes and act cute.

146
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,502
It's on the headlines today.

147
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,303
TENG ENTERPRISES' SUCCESSOR CUT HER HAIR

148
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,808
<i>I wonder if Huaze Lei is okay.</i>

149
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,129
What is it?

150
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,031
Why do you keep staring at me?

151
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,300
Nothing.

152
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,702
Are you okay?

153
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,804
I'm good.

154
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,272
Should I not be okay?

155
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,779
You were shocked
by Jing's decision, right?

156
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,483
Do you think what she's doing is good?

157
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,553
There's nothing bad about it.

158
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,124
This is a decision she made.

159
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,326
That's how Jing is.

160
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,697
No matter what anyone says,

161
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,198
it won't change anything.

162
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,072
When we were little,

163
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,375
Jing always says she wants to be herself.

164
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,644
So...

165
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,113
I think Jing made a decision

166
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,215
that really suits
her personality this time.

167
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,416
You know,

168
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,418
you might not be able to see
each other anymore, though.

169
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,088
Don't you want her to stay?

170
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,725
Maybe we should make a wish again.

171
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,926
I'll buy the firecrackers.

172
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,528
Let's make her stay, okay?

173
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,696
There's no need.

174
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,798
I told you.

175
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,169
Jing's decision won't be swayed by anyone.

176
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,572
I also won't force her to do anything.

177
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,376
So you've decided to just let her go?

178
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,055
<i>If Jing leaves,</i>

179
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,157
<i>will Lei's heart leave with her?</i>

180
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,126
<i>Or will space and time</i>

181
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,862
<i>provide closure for their feelings?</i>

182
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,299
<i>How about Lei and me?</i>

183
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,970
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

184
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,805
<i>How can I have such despicable thoughts?</i>

185
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,195
Jing.

186
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,764
Shancai.

187
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,605
By the way, thanks for attending
my birthday party yesterday.

188
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,276
I'm sorry I ruined the party's mood.

189
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,912
I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable.

190
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,048
I came today to get my grades.

191
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,420
Jing, don't go to France.

192
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,889
You can also study law in Taiwan.

193
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,524
Shancai.

194
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,093
What's the matter?

195
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:41,961
Please.

196
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,632
I know I don't have a right to say this,

197
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,434
but for Lei's sake...

198
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,604
please stay.

199
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,841
I'm begging you not to leave.

200
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,879
All this time,

201
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,382
meeting with Huaze Lei at the rooftop

202
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,685
has been giving me the strength
to come to school.

203
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,692
However, I know how much he likes you.

204
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,895
Now, you're leaving.

205
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,932
I think he'll be really sad.

206
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,173
I don't want him to be sad

207
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,510
all the time.

208
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,814
So...

209
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,184
for Huaze Lei's sake,

210
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,953
can you please stay?

211
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,526
Actually, I understand how you feel
more than you know.

212
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,696
However, that's not possible.

213
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,298
I won't change anything

214
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,766
once I've already decided.

215
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,571
I know I won't succeed.

216
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,909
I also know how stupid
I'll look if I do this.

217
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,081
Shancai.

218
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,782
However,

219
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,652
Jing...

220
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,487
please stay.

221
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,557
I really don't know what to do anymore.

222
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,060
Even if there's just
a one-in-a-million chance,

223
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,995
I still have to try it.

224
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,265
I'm begging you.

225
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,237
Don't leave Huaze Lei.

226
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,408
Shancai.

227
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,881
I think making a decision
is just like shopping overseas.

228
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,518
If you didn't buy something you like

229
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,287
and came back to Taiwan,

230
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,691
you can't ever have it anymore.

231
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,061
People would often say,

232
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,265
"I should have done that back then."

233
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,435
I don't want to say such a thing.

234
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,704
I hate having regrets.

235
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,276
I hope I can live my life my own way.

236
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,148
Regardless if the road is muddy
or if it's flat,

237
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,017
that's my own choice.

238
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,155
I also hope to be Teng Tangjing,

239
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,257
not the Jing from Teng Enterprises,

240
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,960
and not anyone's Jing.

241
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,864
That's why...

242
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,567
I have to go.

243
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,936
This is my choice.

244
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,205
Do you understand?

245
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,813
Jing.

246
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,184
I'm sorry, I was too impulsive.

247
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,453
Not at all.

248
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,221
I feel very happy.

249
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,824
You're really brave.

250
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,160
No wonder you can battle
with the four of them.

251
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,529
I really like you.

252
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,871
It's true.

253
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,773
Bye.

254
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,523
<i>What an amazing girl.</i>

255
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,992
<i>She has everything a girl wants,</i>

256
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,162
<i>but she's leaving all of it behind</i>

257
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:39,966
<i>so that she can live her dream.</i>

258
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,034
<i>No wonder Huaze Lei likes you.</i>

259
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,175
What was that?

260
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,043
Did I ask you to do that?

261
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,912
Why do you have to tell her those things?

262
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,080
What exactly were you thinking?

263
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,449
You even went down on your knees.

264
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,684
I really can't believe you did that.

265
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,486
But...

266
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,422
I saw how sad you were.

267
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,992
And you might not see each other anymore.

268
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,193
That's none of your business!

269
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,698
Huaze Lei, I...

270
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,667
Scram! Go!

271
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:42,762
<i>Lei, when you can't resist crying,</i>

272
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,797
<i>if you do a handstand,</i>

273
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,199
<i>the tears that are supposed to come out</i>

274
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,168
<i>won't be able to anymore.</i>

275
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,870
<i>Do you know how to do it now?</i>

276
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,980
You still haven't found him?

277
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,649
Please check again for me, okay?

278
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,017
Okay, thanks.

279
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,623
It's still turned off.

280
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,491
We can't find him.

281
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,898
<i>He's not even seeing her off.</i>

282
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,438
What?

283
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,572
What are you doing?

284
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,175
This is my gift to Jing.

285
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,944
It's so unique.

286
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,879
What's inside?

287
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,582
Do you want to see it?

288
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,284
Yes. Can I?

289
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,620
All right.

290
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,288
I'll let you take a look.

291
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,424
Be careful. I wrapped it for a long time.

292
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,760
Hold this for me.

293
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,602
Daoming Si, you're so lame!

294
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,703
You're giving this to Jing...

295
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,905
<i>That guy is so stupid.</i>

296
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,708
<i>If Huaze Lei's thoughts</i>

297
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,977
<i>can be even half as callous as his,</i>

298
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,379
<i>he wouldn't be in such pain.</i>

299
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,650
Hey! What are you thinking?

300
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,952
Daoming Si.

301
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,255
Have you ever liked anyone before?

302
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,226
Like?

303
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,895
What do you mean?

304
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,532
I was just thinking.

305
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,036
Maybe that's how it is
when you like someone.

306
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,372
You have to silently repress your feelings

307
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,174
and set the other person free

308
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,245
to do what they want.

309
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,148
Maybe it's about being unselfish.

310
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,720
Maybe time will heal all wounds

311
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,490
and provide closure.

312
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,959
Stupid girl.

313
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,162
Isn't it stupid to do that?

314
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,931
If so, doesn't it seem like
nothing ever happened?

315
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,734
What if I die tomorrow?

316
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,369
Won't I have regrets then?

317
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,472
If I were him,
I'd do my best to fight for it.

318
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,912
Why did you suddenly ask
such a weird question?

319
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,648
<i>This guy is so simpleminded,</i>

320
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,152
<i>yet what he said was wise and true.</i>

321
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,857
<i>He simply blurted out the answer
that Huaze Lei and I couldn't figure out.</i>

322
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:33,999
Actually, I was thinking

323
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,569
that maybe you're really smart.

324
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,138
You only figured it out now?

325
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,378
<i>Passengers of Air France Flight 284,</i>

326
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,182
<i>please proceed to the boarding gate
after check-in.</i>

327
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,924
I'm sorry, I can't find Lei.

328
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,129
Take care of yourself.

329
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,163
Okay.

330
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,931
You too.

331
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,600
Jing.

332
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,934
This is my gift for you.

333
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,904
-Thank you.
-Jing, beware of that gift...

334
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,773
It's nothing.

335
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,842
Whatever this gift is, I'll treasure it.

336
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,211
Keep in touch.

337
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,312
Okay.

338
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,480
Jing.

339
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,219
If you see Lei,

340
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,921
please say hi to him for me.

341
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,991
I'll go now.

342
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,281
<i>I can imagine how amazing Jing would be</i>

343
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,484
<i>after leaving her elegant clothes behind</i>

344
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,953
<i>and walking the streets of Paris
in her jeans.</i>

345
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,321
<i>In that time,</i>

346
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,490
<i>she must be wearing
the best pair of shoes.</i>

347
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,568
Lei still didn't come in the end.

348
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,470
Let's go.

349
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:20,206
Lei!

350
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,411
What are you doing? Jing already left.

351
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,547
When did you arrive?

352
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,049
An hour ago.

353
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,817
An hour ago?

354
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,152
Did you see Jing?

355
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,821
Yes, behind the pole.

356
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,022
Behind the pole?

357
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,190
The pole?

358
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,694
Why did you hide?

359
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,263
You're so useless!

360
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,933
If you really like her, go after her!

361
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:54,173
The four of you have been sheltered
your whole lives.

362
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,675
That's why you don't have
the courage to face pain.

363
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,645
Jing bravely chose her own path.

364
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,014
Can't you be brave too?

365
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,258
I'm taking the next flight there.

366
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,396
You finally thought it through!

367
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,632
Go on!

368
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,673
Shancai.

369
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,643
I really like your personality.

370
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,412
You have the strength of character
that I don't have.

371
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,447
You have taught me

372
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,417
that I can't get anything by waiting.

373
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,853
I will only have happiness

374
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,888
if I fight for it.

375
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,696
Thank you.

376
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,133
Thank you very much.

377
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,282
Traveling thousands of miles
to pursue love.

378
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,484
How hopelessly romantic.

379
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,186
You win.

380
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,055
Take care.

381
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,634
Huaze Lei, goodbye.

382
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,955
HUAZE

383
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,787
Though Lei usually look indifferent
and unconcerned,

384
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,156
he's quite tough when he gets serious.

385
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,859
However, Shancai is actually
the one who convinced him.

386
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,929
Isn't she quite enamored with Lei?

387
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,164
Haven't I told you?

388
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,766
That's impossible.

389
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,771
When did he tell us, "That's impossible"?

390
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:49,174
Didn't he have a fight
with Lei because of that?

391
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,176
Never mind, pretend he said that.

392
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,480
Without Lei, though,

393
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,082
it will be lonely.

394
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,153
Maybe after some time,

395
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,855
he'll come back with Jing.

396
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,268
Shancai.

397
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,272
Let's go on a date.

398
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,640
What?

399
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,009
What did you say?

400
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,813
You heard me. I'll tell you
the time and place later.

401
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,214
The plane is too loud.

402
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,984
What exactly did you say? Speak louder.

403
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,720
How can I say such a thing twice?

404
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,988
Are you stupid?

405
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,524
Hey, let's go.

406
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,262
That guy is crazy.

407
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,899
-Shancai, let's go.
-Okay.

408
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,354
Lei should have seen Jing by now, right?

409
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,191
They should have met already.

410
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,463
Hey, Ah Si, what are you doing?

411
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:24,002
The Ah Si who doesn't even
read newspapers is reading a book.

412
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,137
What are you doing?

413
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,138
Give it back!

414
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,507
"The Psychology of Dating."

415
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,741
You're going on a date?

416
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,742
With whom?

417
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,713
The model you met at the party?

418
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,081
That's right.

419
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,585
I want to learn some things
from that book.

420
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,494
<i>Huaze Lei should have already seen Jing.</i>

421
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,174
Shancai, where did you go?

422
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,542
I've been looking everywhere for you.

423
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,611
Do you want to eat the bread I bought?

424
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,946
Or do you want some cold noodles?

425
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,650
The sweetness of the bread
will make you feel fuller, though.

426
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,986
Or do you want them both?

427
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,520
Shall I buy it for you?

428
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,692
What do you want?

429
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,463
Sunday, Times Square, 2:00 p.m.

430
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,566
Hey, what did you say?

431
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,002
He's asking you out for a date.

432
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,870
You dare to do that to my Shancai...

433
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,339
Why did I blurt out, "My Shancai"?

434
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,407
What did you say?

435
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,808
It's nothing.

436
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,711
Aren't you giving me your bread?

437
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,115
Why is everyone acting so strangely?

438
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,696
Gosh.

439
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,032
Why did I blurt that out?

440
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,359
<i>No way.</i>

441
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,994
<i>How is that possible?</i>

442
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,496
<i>There's no reason for that guy to date me.</i>

443
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,999
<i>What exactly is he planning to do?</i>

444
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,002
<i>Sunday, 2:00 p.m., at the Times Square.</i>

445
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,937
<i>Maybe he's going to give me
a hard time again.</i>

446
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,575
Oh, why did the weather change suddenly?

447
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:44,843
It's raining so hard.

448
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,545
It's so cold.

449
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,849
Sunday, Times Square, 2:00 p.m.

450
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,020
<i>He wouldn't really be waiting
for me there, right?</i>

451
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:55,954
Let's go, hurry.

452
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,255
What are we eating for dinner?

453
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,492
I'll let your dad eat bitter melon
so he can cool down.

454
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,362
There's burdock.

455
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,664
I want to buy burdock.

456
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,499
It's NTD 17, then...

457
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,501
-Then...
-Mom, what time is it?

458
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,402
What time?

459
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,970
It's 2:30.

460
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,005
Why? Are you hungry again?

461
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,807
-No.
-Okay.

462
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,209
Don't scare me.

463
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,544
We just finished eating lunch
and you're hungry again,

464
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,079
just like your dad.

465
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,615
<i>What am I worried about?</i>

466
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,817
<i>There's no reason for me to go.</i>

467
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,353
<i>I have to see that guy even on a Sunday.</i>

468
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,888
<i>That's so pitiful.</i>

469
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,624
That's on sale, right?

470
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,025
-Did you punch the discount in?
-I did.

471
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,427
-You did? Are you sure?
-Yes, I did.

472
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,995
-Of course.
-Don't make a mistake.

473
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,997
Mom, I have to go.

474
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,065
Where are you going?

475
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,800
I just have something urgent to do.

476
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,735
Are you coming home for dinner then?

477
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,837
Yes. Mom, lend me your umbrella.

478
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,506
What about me then?

479
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,974
You unfilial girl!

480
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,343
Sorry, continue punching them in.
Did you make any mistake?

481
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,445
-No.
-Do it again. I didn't see it.

482
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,637
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

483
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,905
Do you want to borrow one of ours?

484
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,039
It's raining so hard.

485
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,509
Don't talk to me!

486
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,710
Scram, you ugly girl!

487
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,718
She was being nice.
Why are you so mean to her?

488
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,420
Why did you only arrive now?

489
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,122
Do you know I've waited for you
for four hours?

490
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,524
You set this yourself. I didn't agree.

491
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:40,659
Why are you saying this?

492
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,360
I've waited for you for four hours.

493
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,829
Who do you think you are?

494
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,331
If I don't come,
why don't you just go home?

495
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,934
You didn't call me.
And I don't have your number.

496
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,302
How'd I know if you're coming or not?

497
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,103
What if something happened
to you on the way here?

498
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,172
I would wait for you
until nighttime, miss.

499
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,582
It's so cold.

500
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,219
Fine, I'll buy you some tea.

501
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,554
Let's go!

502
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,866
What is this guy doing?

503
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,868
He's the one who wanted to wait,
why he gets angry?

504
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,237
His legs are so long and he's walking
so fast. I can't catch up...

505
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,606
Hi, miss. Can you help us
fill out a survey?

506
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,441
-Please. Are you in a hurry?
-I'm in a hurry.

507
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,009
The Dong Foundation
is conducting a survey.

508
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,377
We're giving away free movie tickets.

509
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,846
It's not convenient for me now.

510
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:35,914
Really?

511
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,816
We just need three minutes
of your time, miss.

512
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,521
What are you doing?

513
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,390
Nothing. I'm sorry.

514
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,359
Why do you like talking to strange men?

515
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,493
Act more decently, okay?

516
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,028
-Let's go.
-Who says I don't act decently?

517
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:50,929
It hurts!

518
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,942
Daoming Si.

519
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,877
Is it expensive to drink tea
at such a place?

520
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,820
<i>I only have NTD 150?</i>

521
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,455
Oh, no.

522
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,691
Daoming Si.

523
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,362
If I'm buying,
I should decide where to go.

524
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,530
Why? You don't have money?

525
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,498
I'll pay for it.

526
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,066
Don't look down on me.

527
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,134
I may only have NTD 150,

528
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,003
but it's really the thought that counts.

529
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,238
Miss, you only have NTD 150.

530
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,506
How can you enter this restaurant?

531
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,941
It's not even enough for the tip. Okay?

532
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,841
It's my treat.

533
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,043
What do you mean by that?

534
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,345
Are you saying poor people
don't have the right to pay the bill?

535
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,613
Don't be such a snob.

536
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,648
You only have NTD 150.
Why do you insist on paying?

537
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,551
Do you really have to tell everyone
how much money I have?

538
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,853
What do you want me to do then?

539
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,622
Why are you shouting at me?

540
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,123
Who is the one shouting?

541
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,592
You! You don't even want to admit it!

542
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,126
Do you want people to laugh at me?

543
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,294
Who dares to laugh at us?

544
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,796
Young Master Daoming Si, welcome.

545
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,130
See? He's here to laugh at us.

546
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,433
Don't "welcome" me now! Get lost!

547
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,301
Don't come here no matter what you hear.

548
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,202
Go!

549
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,270
You think he doesn't know

550
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,072
how embarrassing you are
if you threaten him?

551
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,207
Let me tell you. Let's not argue here.

552
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,910
Let's argue somewhere else. Come out.

553
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,148
Why should we even pick a place to argue?

554
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,334
All right. Let's not argue anymore.

555
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,268
Fine.

556
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,803
Aren't we going for some tea?

557
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,473
Let me bring you to a place
with good tea for just NTD 150.

558
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,641
Sure, let's go.

559
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,546
The door is locked.

560
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:49,547
Open the door!

561
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,715
Who's out there?

562
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,217
Stop screaming.

563
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,185
It's embarrassing to be locked out here.

564
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,921
And I even warned them
not to mind us earlier.

565
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,125
Based on my previous experience,

566
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,027
my warnings are usually very effective.

567
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,697
All right. You owe me then.

568
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,066
Let's walk down a few floors
before we take the elevator.

569
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,134
I owe you?

570
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,102
You were the one who brought me here.

571
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,804
You just want to save face.

572
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,874
It's so cold.

573
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,175
Let's take the elevator.

574
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,511
Weren't you afraid of being laughed at?

575
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,179
Let's take the elevator here.

576
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,314
It's locked too.

577
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:27,919
Don't glare at me.

578
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,988
We can always walk up again.

579
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,790
You want them to laugh at us?

580
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,491
Let's go down.

581
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,133
Is anyone there?

582
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,768
Open the door!

583
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,336
Is anyone there?

584
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,140
How strange.

585
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,609
Why is the door on every level locked?

586
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,979
Daoming Si,
don't you think it's ridiculous?

587
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:09,127
No way. Even the first floor is locked.

588
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,128
Open the door!

589
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,664
Is anyone there? Open up!

590
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,065
Stop screaming.

591
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,203
The first floor is a supermarket.
It's closed already.

592
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,704
Nobody would hear you.

593
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,040
Why didn't you say so earlier?

594
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,477
How would I know
we'd get to the first floor?

595
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,479
What should we do then?

596
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,814
Let's go back to the restaurant.

597
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,785
<i>No way.</i>

598
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,520
<i>It's closed here too.</i>

599
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,456
<i>Who can come and save us?</i>

600
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,265
Daoming Si.

601
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,134
Don't you have a phone?

602
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,201
Where is it?

603
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,207
It's dead.

604
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,576
Why did you bring a phone
with dead battery?

605
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,785
What time is it now?

606
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,125
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

607
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,394
<i>Daoming Si is probably seething.</i>

608
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,163
<i>He's not answering me anymore.</i>

609
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,436
<i>It feels so hot and stuffy.</i>

610
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,407
<i>No.</i>

611
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,309
<i>I can't remove my jacket,</i>

612
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,579
<i>especially since I'm wearing a bra
with the hook in front.</i>

613
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,647
<i>It's so dangerous.</i>

614
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,320
<i>Don't come over!</i>

615
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,988
Don't come near me!

616
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,226
<i>Don't do this, Daoming Si!</i>

617
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,634
Shancai.

618
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,636
What are you doing?

619
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,605
Don't come over!

620
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,107
If you come over, I'll bite my tongue
and commit suicide.

621
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,244
I'm in pain.

622
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,046
Don't come over!

623
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,414
If you come over, I'll kick you.

624
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,348
Get away from me!

625
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,884
You perverted maniac! Go away!

626
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,153
You want to touch me?
You're 100 years too early!

627
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,656
How strange.

628
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,059
Why is he just lying there?

629
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,962
Doesn't he usually fight back?

630
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,534
Daoming Si.

631
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,609
No way. You have a fever.

632
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,414
You took this opportunity
to hit me. You...

633
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,116
I didn't do it on purpose.

634
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,118
Why didn't you tell me
you're not feeling well?

635
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,820
How would I know if you don't tell me?

636
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,460
<i>My God.</i>

637
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,128
<i>In this kind of building,</i>

638
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,764
<i>no one would notice the stairwell.</i>

639
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,799
<i>Daoming Si is sick.</i>

640
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,034
<i>What should I do?</i>

641
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,008
<i>This is all because this guy
wanted to wait in the rain.</i>

642
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,409
<i>That's why it turned out this way.</i>

643
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,111
<i>He deserves this.</i>

644
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,513
<i>However...</i>

645
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,130
What are you doing?

646
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,531
You'll feel warmer this way.

647
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,700
Stop it.

648
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,201
Come here.

649
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,103
Let go of me.

650
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,505
Keep quiet. Do as I say.

651
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,507
Come and lie down.

652
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,348
Sleep here first.

653
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,718
Someone would come for us in the morning.

654
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,821
Don't talk. Go to sleep.

655
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,872
Why are you up?

656
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,510
Your fever has gone down.

657
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:53,945
You're not that warm anymore.

658
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,587
Sorry if I caused you any trouble.

659
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,089
If apologizing is enough,

660
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,958
what do we need the police for?

661
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,162
How's your leg?

662
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,332
It's already numb.

663
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,203
It's all your fault, though.

664
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,938
What does it have to do with me?

665
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,140
Why am I apologizing?

666
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,045
Why are you smiling?

667
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,552
<i>A man with such big built</i>

668
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,088
<i>is just like a kindergarten kid right now.</i>

669
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,090
<i>Looking at him this way,</i>

670
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:42,593
<i>I find it hard to imagine
that he's the leader of F4.</i>

671
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,729
<i>He also has a cute side.</i>

672
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,669
I'm sorry.

673
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,671
I'm the only one
who can take care of you now.

674
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,839
When you get home later,

675
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,808
your mom can take care of you.

676
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,046
I haven't seen my parents
for two years already.

677
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,617
Because of my dad's work,

678
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,554
they live in our house in New York.

679
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,155
New York?

680
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,992
You live alone
in that big house in Taiwan?

681
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:21,165
It must be lonely to live
in such a big house, right?

682
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,535
Lonely?

683
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,905
Don't say such gross things.

684
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,408
I'm not lonely.

685
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,377
That's why you have
such a strange personality.

686
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,413
If I were you,

687
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,949
I would surely hate the world.

688
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,988
Consider it my fault today.

689
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,292
You can ask me
to make it up to you. Tell me.

690
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,665
What are you doing?

691
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,305
I didn't say I'm going to make it up
to you this way!

692
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,641
What are you doing?

693
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,745
How did you come up here?

694
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,181
You youngsters may love excitement,

695
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:11,616
but you shouldn't come here.

696
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,885
It's safer in motels.

697
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,120
If my daughter does this,

698
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,155
I'd surely beat her up.

699
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,450
