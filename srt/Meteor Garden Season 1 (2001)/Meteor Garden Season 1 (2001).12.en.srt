1
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,527
What do you think Ah Si is doing?

2
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,696
Mr. Liu said he only got his luggage

3
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,264
when he went to pick him up
at the airport.

4
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,801
This guy doesn't contact us
the first day he returns.

5
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,271
-Where exactly did he go?
-How would I know?

6
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,940
If it were you, it would be easy to guess.

7
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,776
If you didn't contact us,
then you must have gone to a girl.

8
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,112
Ah Si is an idiot, though.

9
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,814
He doesn't do things the normal way.

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,317
We even came here immediately
upon receiving Zhuang's text.

11
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,453
Who knew that guy would not
come home the whole night?

12
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,989
Lei, what do you think?

13
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,793
Maybe he went to the person
that's most important to him.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,933
Who's the most important person to him?

15
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,836
Do you even need to ask?

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,283
Why is your dad's pants so short?

17
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,919
Short? Then wear your own clothes.

18
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,023
How can someone like me
wear the same clothes two days in a row?

19
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,557
That's impossible.

20
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,193
That's why I gave you my dad's clothes.
You're even whining about it.

21
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,696
The problem is,
does this look good at all?

22
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,098
Just treat it like capri pants.

23
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,937
Actually, I look quite handsome
in these clothes.

24
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,041
What an egocentric pineapple head.

25
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,142
I can't take it anymore.

26
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,277
Wear your own clothes
and give back my dad's clothes.

27
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,913
Why are you such a nag?

28
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,615
I'm a man with a good "size."

29
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,116
-It's "sense."
-It's "sense."

30
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,551
I said that on purpose.

31
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,055
These two can fight
over really petty things.

32
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,591
Petty things are really
what couples fight about.

33
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,728
-What?
-No, what I mean is,

34
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,530
harsh words or deeds
demonstrate one's love.

35
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,733
When they fight, they show
their love for each other.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,568
-Is that the case?
-Yes.

37
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,271
Honey, then you really love me.

38
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,106
Since we got married so many
years ago, until now,

39
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,974
you're speaking harsh words daily,
three meals a day

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,676
and even during supper.

41
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,645
Can you not love me so much?

42
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,180
I feel too much pressure.

43
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,248
Don't think too much.

44
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,150
I'm only saying harsh words
because you deserve it.

45
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
-I...
-I can't say enough harsh words to you.

46
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,755
-It has nothing to do with love.
-It has nothing to do with it?

47
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,223
-Yes.
-Fine. Hurry.

48
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,691
-Don't get mad.
-We'll be late for class.

49
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,793
So what if we're late?

50
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,696
You're Daoming Si. You own the school.
It doesn't matter if you're late.

51
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,198
I'm different from you.

52
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,667
Dad, Mom, we're going to school.

53
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,003
They're sleeping so soundly.

54
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,239
Let's go.

55
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,054
Honey, hurry.

56
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,693
Here.

57
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,897
Look. The Cinderella progress chart.

58
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,866
We're so ahead of schedule.

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,869
Not only that, we've advanced so quickly.

60
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,304
Our daughter can join the Olympics.

61
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,739
And be the long jump champion.

62
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,241
Great.

63
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,676
That guy slept with our daughter
last night.

64
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,279
He did spend the night at our home.
He didn't sleep with our daughter.

65
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,413
It's almost the same.

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,682
I never thought we'd be like
President Chen Shuibian.

67
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,252
-Our daughter is getting married too.
-This is great!

68
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,388
-We're having a wedding soon.
-I have to prepare to cry then.

69
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,124
-Why should you cry?
-Because that's what people always do.

70
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,692
That's how the situation becomes touching.

71
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,133
I don't want to let my daughter go.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,135
All right, honey. Stop crying.

73
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:05,739
I'm going to become a mother-in-law.

74
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,009
I don't want to let my only beloved
daughter go too after hearing you cry.

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,880
I never thought I'd become
a father-in-law.

76
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,850
I never thought we'd become rich so soon.

77
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,151
That's right.

78
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,424
-Welcome, Young Master Daoming Si.
-We have class. Why are you shopping?

79
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,694
-Any new arrivals? I want to wear it now.
-Of course. This way please.

80
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,433
Help me choose a nice outfit.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,235
Why should I choose the clothes
you're wearing?

82
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,436
How about this one?

83
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,905
This is fresh
from our collection in Paris.

84
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,207
You can try it.

85
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,541
I'll try it.

86
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,785
These clothes all look so expensive.

87
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,025
It's NTD 58,000?

88
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,261
This shirt costs NTD 58,000?

89
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,430
Our family can live on that
for two months.

90
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,432
Are they for real?

91
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,668
It's too wasteful to buy clothes
for that amount.

92
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,740
It looks so nice. It suits you.

93
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,442
What do you think?

94
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,179
<i>Darn. Everything suits him.</i>

95
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,547
<i>How infuriating.</i>

96
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,916
It looks strange.

97
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,053
Is that so?

98
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,228
Then how about this one?

99
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,897
This one only costs NTD 120,000.

100
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,299
What about this one?

101
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,501
It suits you.

102
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,270
You look stupid.

103
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,844
Then how about this one?

104
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,479
This one only costs NTD 160,000.

105
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,948
It's so ugly.

106
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,616
How infuriating.

107
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,789
<i>Why does every single one of these
ridiculously expensive clothes suit him?</i>

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,293
<i>Why does he care so much about what I say?</i>

109
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,929
How about this one? It's nice, right?

110
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,733
I think the previous one looks better.

111
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,270
Are you playing a prank on me?

112
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,612
I told you.

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,248
He couldn't endure it for long.

114
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,184
I just didn't think it would be this fast.

115
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,754
He must really miss us.

116
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,356
So much so that his hairstyle changed.

117
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,457
Nonsense.

118
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm afraid you'd be too "boring"
without me.

119
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,294
That's why I came back.

120
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,263
It's "bored."

121
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,932
Before studying English in New York,

122
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,968
shouldn't you learn your Chinese well
in Taiwan first?

123
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,836
Where did you go last night?

124
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,905
We were at your house the whole night.

125
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,707
You just arrived, and you didn't go home.

126
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,276
-Where exactly did you go?
-Why are you back again?

127
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,944
Shancai, why are you with him again?

128
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,714
Nouveau riche, listen carefully.

129
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,317
I slept at Shancai's house last night.

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,685
You slept at Shancai's house?

131
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,920
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

132
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,321
Because you were jet lagged yesterday,

133
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,956
and he was so dizzy he couldn't stand...

134
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,758
And she looks so ugly
while sleeping, you know?

135
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,960
-What are you saying?
-Shancai, this isn't true, right?

136
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,695
He didn't really sleep
in your house, right?

137
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,001
He really slept in my house.

138
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,268
No way!

139
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,670
You're kidding.

140
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,538
-Let me explain.
-That's impossible.

141
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,308
-How can this happen?
-Qinghe, calm down.

142
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,809
I told you he was jet lagged.

143
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,778
He came to my house
and my mom asked him to stay.

144
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,947
-He's so thick-faced. That's what it is.
-What should I say?

145
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,249
Though I forced you to drop out before,

146
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,718
and did many bad things to you,

147
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,755
you didn't need to tell me that
at the last minute.

148
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,258
You think you're the only one
who can play mean tricks?

149
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,161
Fine, you win.

150
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,466
We're all good then.

151
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,836
F4 is back to normal again.

152
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,572
Let's go to class.

153
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,275
Shancai, I'm going to class.

154
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,745
Nouveau riche, don't say
she's your Shancai from now on.

155
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,982
Stop crying. Are you crazy?

156
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,284
Why are you crying?
Let's go to class. Come on.

157
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,658
<i>I know I have many feelings</i>

158
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,960
<i>that I can only keep in my memories.</i>

159
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,236
You're all I think about.

160
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,207
Why can't you be happy?

161
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,080
Even I have someone I want to protect.

162
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,449
Huaze Lei.

163
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,994
I'm home.

164
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,003
Mom, what happened?

165
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,740
Mom.

166
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,976
What exactly happened?

167
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,015
Your dad borrowed NTD 1,000,000
from the loan shark.

168
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,518
One million?

169
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:03,923
And he bought lotto tickets
with that money and lost everything.

170
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,963
Dad, is this true?

171
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,335
I thought I would win.

172
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:21,474
And I thought you would be marrying
into a rich family soon.

173
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,111
So what if I borrow some money?

174
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,481
I never thought I'd have such bad luck.

175
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,751
I didn't win any prize.

176
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,753
I lost all of it.

177
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,822
Dad, you're too ridiculous.

178
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,523
How can you do that?

179
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,793
Dong.

180
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,096
Let's get a divorce.

181
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,132
I'll take care of Shancai.

182
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,134
Mom.

183
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,505
I can't take it anymore.

184
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,308
I can't take it anymore.

185
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,611
Never mind that we're all squeezing

186
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,113
into this lousy house.

187
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,050
I even usually have to pretend
to be caring

188
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,254
and babysit other people's kids
to earn our living expenses.

189
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,059
Now our debt suddenly
increased by one million.

190
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,195
I can't take it anymore.

191
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,898
Do you want us all to die?

192
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,702
I... I didn't do it on purpose.

193
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,904
Mom, calm down. Don't be too impulsive.

194
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,172
Mom!

195
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,175
I was wrong.

196
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,211
Mom.

197
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,914
I also don't want this to happen.

198
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:39,652
The loan shark's interest
would kill all of us.

199
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,456
And collectors from triads
would come to our house.

200
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,760
We'll all commit suicide then.

201
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,766
Shancai, it's all my fault.

202
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,235
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,472
Your mom is right.

204
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:04,043
Let's... get divorced.

205
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,113
-Dad.
-Don't less a useless person like me

206
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,282
drag everyone down.

207
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,656
No.

208
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,527
Honey, I... I wasn't serious.

209
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,629
Honey, I'm sorry.

210
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,998
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,903
<i>I would find a way
to get that NTD 1,000,000.</i>

212
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,406
<i>Even if I lose my pride,</i>

213
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,208
<i>I would surely find a way.</i>

214
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,817
Miss Shancai.

215
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,886
-Thank you.
-Why are you here at this time?

216
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,789
There's no need. Thank you.

217
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,092
What's the matter?

218
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,162
Sorry to disturb you so late.

219
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,032
I have a favor to ask.

220
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,771
Please lend me one million.

221
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,508
My dad borrowed NTD 1,000,000
from a loan shark.

222
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,610
We have to return this money,

223
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,812
but our living expenses
is already a problem.

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,515
If this goes on,

225
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,617
our whole family is doomed.

226
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,786
I knew it. I can't take poor people.

227
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,154
I...

228
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,056
I may be poor, but I don't want
to borrow money from you either.

229
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,161
I just have no other way.

230
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,163
And I...

231
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,233
I can lend you the money.

232
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,203
-Really?
-Yes.

233
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,704
You're lending me one million?

234
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,206
NTD 1,000,000

235
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,508
Thank you.

236
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,345
I can't return the money
to you immediately,

237
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,181
but no matter how many years it takes,

238
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,116
I'd surely return the money
to you, even if gradually.

239
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,486
There's a way for you
not to return the money.

240
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,055
A way not to return the money?

241
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,757
I really don't need to return the money?

242
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,594
You don't have anything valuable
to "pawnshop" anyway.

243
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,429
It's "pawn."

244
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,897
It's the same.

245
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,667
What is the way not to return the money

246
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,701
that you mentioned earlier?

247
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,536
I'm willing to do it. Tell me quickly.

248
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,872
Wait for me at the alley by your house
this Saturday at 1:00 p.m.

249
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:13,973
You'll know then.

250
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,175
All right. Stop talking. Go home quickly.

251
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,344
-But you...
-All right. Go home.

252
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,446
I'll ask Mr. Liu to take you home.

253
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,115
Go home.

254
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,252
Bye.

255
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,874
<i>What is Daoming Si planning?</i>

256
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,176
<i>I don't need to return the one million?</i>

257
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,349
Ximen.

258
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,651
Do you have a new girlfriend lately?

259
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,921
Please, is it news
if I have a new girlfriend?

260
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,890
It is news if I don't change
my girlfriend, okay?

261
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,824
Cool.

262
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,125
Honestly, though,

263
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,661
why did you ask us to come
to this art exhibit?

264
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,531
Because my new girlfriend is studying art.

265
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,266
So I wanted to see an art exhibit

266
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,201
and find things we can talk about.

267
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,641
Ah Si is so strange today.

268
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,844
Not only doesn't he feel bored
in such a place, he looks quite happy.

269
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,446
Ah Si, you look quite happy.

270
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,749
Don't you feel bored here?

271
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:30,917
Of course not.

272
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,653
I'm a man with good size... I mean, sense.

273
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,388
How can I feel bored?

274
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,823
Not bad. He remembers it's "sense."

275
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,859
Everything is going well for me now.

276
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,827
Of course my English would "improving."

277
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,596
It's "improve."

278
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,166
Ah Si's English improved,
but his Chinese is still so funny.

279
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,268
Did I ask for your opinion?

280
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,572
Lei, it's none of your business.

281
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,241
You're just jealous.

282
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,109
Lei is jealous of you?

283
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,611
Why do you say that?

284
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,012
Are you crazy?

285
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,447
Anyway, you don't understand.

286
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,949
It's almost Saturday.

287
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,450
That's why I'm especially happy.

288
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,862
SATURDAY

289
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,403
Coming.

290
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,542
-Mrs. Wang, please come in.
-Shancai.

291
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,477
Thank you. Is your mom here?

292
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,845
My mom?

293
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,246
She went out.

294
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,284
What's the matter?

295
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,455
I need to go out. I wanted your mom
to help me take care of Xiaolong.

296
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,890
What should I do then?

297
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,293
Shancai, are you free today?

298
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,394
Me?

299
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,429
I have to attend to something.

300
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,365
Can you help me take care of Xiaolong?

301
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,933
I can pay you by the hour.

302
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,534
But I...

303
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,138
It's fine. Never mind if you can't.

304
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,606
We'll go ahead.

305
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,142
Xiaolong, can you stay at home
by yourself?

306
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,812
There's food in the refrigerator.
Just microwave it and it's ready to eat.

307
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,980
You know how to do that, right?

308
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,215
Mrs. Wang.

309
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,283
I'm going out today.

310
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,985
I can take Xiaolong with me.

311
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,720
Really?

312
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,722
Thank you, Shancai.

313
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,824
Xiaolong, you have to be good.

314
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,093
Listen to Shancai. Okay?

315
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,496
Shancai, I'll leave him to you then.
Thank you.

316
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,730
Okay, it's fine.

317
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,741
Hey, I'll be right there.

318
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,048
What should I do?

319
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,350
There's nothing else I can do.

320
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,384
Let's go.

321
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,457
Sorry, I'm late.

322
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,260
Why are you so slow?

323
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,995
You're always late on our dates.

324
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,764
Date? What date?

325
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,534
Aren't you telling me the way
not to return the money?

326
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,835
You're so stupid.

327
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,504
You don't need to return the money
if you spend the day with me.

328
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,773
What? What are you talking about?

329
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,078
Shancai, turns out you're an escort.

330
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,080
Who's that little punk?

331
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,348
What punk? How rude.

332
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,918
My name is Xiaolong, stupid guy.

333
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,954
He's my neighbor's kid.

334
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,790
My mom is babysitting recently
to make more money,

335
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,126
but she happened to be out today.

336
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,195
So I'm helping her babysit.

337
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,864
<i>Why did you bring a third wheel?</i>

338
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,199
<i>You're so stupid.</i>

339
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,300
Shancai.

340
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,770
I think this old guy's temper is not good.

341
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,839
Old guy? You said I'm an old guy?

342
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,273
Who are you talking about, punk?

343
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,508
Who's the old guy?

344
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,111
-Why are you screaming?
-Who's screaming?

345
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,412
Calm down, you two.

346
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,446
-What a nag.
-What a nag.

347
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,483
-Women shouldn't interfere when men fight.
-Women shouldn't interfere when men fight.

348
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,822
What should we do now?

349
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,593
Shancai.

350
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,362
Didn't you tell me earlier
that you're taking me out?

351
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,531
Let's go to the zoo, okay?

352
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,700
-The zoo?
-Hey.

353
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,536
You were so manly earlier.
Now you're acting cute.

354
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,404
-What a brat.
-Daoming Si.

355
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,474
-You want to go to the zoo?
-Yes.

356
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,046
I'll return the one million
to you gradually.

357
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,983
Let's all go out and have fun today, okay?

358
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,919
I don't want to go to the zoo
with this punk.

359
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,721
I also don't want to go with this old guy.

360
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,755
What old guy?

361
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,190
Stop arguing, stupid guy.

362
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,491
Do you want to go or not?

363
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,726
I'm not going.

364
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,832
Shancai, come on.

365
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,634
I want to see the king penguins.

366
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,436
I hate animals the most.

367
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,010
Okay, I want to see them too.

368
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,078
-Let's go then.
-Okay.

369
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,781
Hey, don't go.

370
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,449
It's smelly at the zoo.

371
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,294
Shancai.

372
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,764
What is that big monkey trying to find?

373
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,766
He's helping him catch lice.

374
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,569
-Lice?
-Look. It's so big.

375
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,370
What are lice?

376
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,706
A kind of bug in monkeys.

377
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:24,343
They get lice by scratching their backs?

378
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,711
Yes.

379
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,652
Why is it standing up there?

380
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,488
Look! That zebra is drinking water.

381
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,958
He's so cute! He's moving his neck.

382
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,194
Look! He's moving his tail.

383
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,802
Shancai, come on. Let's go see the camels.

384
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,903
Okay.

385
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,074
What's the matter, Xiaolong?

386
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,209
My legs hurt. Let's rest for a while.

387
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,879
-Let's sit over there to rest, okay?
-No.

388
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,114
I'm afraid we won't have time if we rest

389
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,817
because it's almost closing time.

390
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,152
What should we do?

391
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,724
Sit on my shoulder. I'll take you around.

392
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,533
Shancai, look at the camels.

393
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,235
Yes.

394
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,703
They're so cute.

395
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,053
He can even fall asleep this way.

396
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,656
What a troublesome punk.

397
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,301
Wow, the parents are so young.

398
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,243
You and Xiaolong look quite alike.

399
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,446
I'm way cuter than him, okay?

400
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,081
Is that so?

401
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,282
Of course.

402
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,285
-Hey.
-What?

403
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,621
You don't need to return
the one million to me.

404
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,292
What's the matter?

405
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,796
Don't say anything. This brat is so heavy.

406
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,831
-Let's go.
-Daoming Si.

407
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,635
Why are you helping me?

408
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,137
I betrayed you before.

409
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,740
I've always wanted to ask you.

410
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,508
Why are you so nice to me?

411
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,446
Because...

412
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,981
Because you're stupid.

413
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,183
I'm stupid?

414
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,819
Why is a stupid guy calling me stupid?

415
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,254
Please use your brain to think, okay?

416
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,391
-I'm seriously asking you a question.
-I'm also answering seriously.

417
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,694
Why is a stupid girl
bringing a stupid kid?

418
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,129
How can you do that?

419
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,298
What if he hit his head
when you put him down that way?

420
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,399
He won't die.

421
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,468
He won't die,
but he'll be stupid like you.

422
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,269
When I saw you put Xiaolong
on your shoulders,

423
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,704
I thought you're a kind-hearted person.

424
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:06,939
I was wrong.

425
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,674
Who told you to bring this punk?

426
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,209
Good thing Xiaolong is here.

427
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,745
You used one million to buy my day.
Who knows what you want to do?

428
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,580
Maybe you're thinking of doing bad things.

429
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,681
Let me tell you,

430
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,449
even if you use 100 million,

431
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,052
-I won't sell my body to someone like you.
-Am I that kind of person?

432
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,220
Yes, you are.

433
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,925
Let me tell you, I won't ever get along
with a stupid person like you!

434
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,293
Me too.

435
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,395
Stupid girl.

436
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:36,635
Shancai, are you fighting
with that old guy because of me?

437
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,638
No, it has nothing to do with you.

438
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,373
Come on, I'll take you home.

439
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,043
Xiaolong, let me tell you,

440
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,546
you can't be as annoying as him
when you grow up, no matter what happens.

441
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,850
When he put me on his shoulder, though,

442
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,585
he felt like my dad.

443
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,055
He's way more handsome than my dad.

444
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,490
Actually, he's quite all right.

445
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,507
Have a drink.

446
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,044
How's your weekend date with Shancai?1

447
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,113
How did you know?

448
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,649
Who are you trying to fool?

449
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,718
You were smiling the whole day yesterday.

450
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,387
Everybody can tell, okay?

451
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,192
Shancai, you're really pretty.

452
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,328
Daoming Si, you're really handsome too.

453
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,031
Was that how it went?

454
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,366
Or is it more rated R?

455
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,303
Why do you look so unhappy?

456
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,605
Did you have a fight?

457
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,674
I got it right.

458
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,743
You're really so lame.

459
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,612
You can't even handle Shancai.

460
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,282
You must have been too rough
or you threw a fit for no reason.

461
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:58,784
How lousy.

462
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,487
I think you should go
and ask Lei's opinion.

463
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,389
-Doesn't Shancai like his style?
-Hey.

464
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,558
You two are really talkative.

465
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,594
Are you done?

466
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,562
Scram! Who told you to come to my house?

467
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,164
Bastards.

468
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,240
Is that really what you've decided to do?

469
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,407
I have no choice.

470
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,176
My family is in a bad situation.

471
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,078
Now I owe Daoming Si one million.

472
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,113
How can I not find another job?

473
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,584
Welcome.

474
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,052
What would you like to have?

475
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,990
-Miss, I want a strawberry cake.
-Okay.

476
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,928
Shancai, actually,
I think you and Daoming Si...

477
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,796
Don't mention Daoming Si again.

478
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,899
There's nothing left to say between us.

479
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,934
I think I should just work hard
and earn money.

480
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,171
Miss, are you looking for a job?

481
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,208
This is my business card.

482
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,512
A modeling agency?

483
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,414
I think you're quite pretty.

484
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,449
Are you interested in becoming
a freelance model?

485
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,619
Model? I don't think I can do it.

486
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,887
No way.

487
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,557
Our company is currently looking
for print models.

488
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,125
It's mainly focused on print ads.

489
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,526
If you are photogenic enough for film,

490
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,028
and there's a project,

491
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,564
you might earn around
NTD 8,000 to 10,000 a day.

492
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,899
Shancai, go and try it.

493
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,267
I think it's quite nice.

494
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,140
Miss, excuse me. My cake.

495
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,241
I'm sorry.

496
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,210
-How much is it?
-Ninety.

497
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,444
-Ninety?
-Yes.

498
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,683
Ninety dollars.

499
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,153
-We welcome you to audition with us.
-Okay.

500
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,225
Shancai, you met a scout.

501
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,261
It's so cool to be a model.

502
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,762
Do you want to try it?

503
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,966
Please, how would that kind
of job suit me?

504
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,601
I don't have a good figure.

505
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,002
Who knows?

506
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,671
Those models are all quite thin.

507
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,573
And you really need the money.

508
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,475
If you don't make it,

509
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,277
you won't lose anything.

510
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,614
And models nowadays usually take
a different approach.

511
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,350
Maybe you can win them over
with your approachable looks, Shancai.

512
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,852
Xiaoyou, I know what you mean.

513
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,153
By approachable looks,

514
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,990
you mean my ordinary looks, right?

515
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,058
Are you encouraging me or insulting me?

516
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,426
No.

517
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,762
I was just thinking that
if there's a will, there's a way.

518
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,864
You're so cute, Shancai.

519
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,401
Go and audition. Stop looking at this.

520
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,836
Go and try it.

521
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,508
<i>At a time like this,</i>

522
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,910
<i>I have to grab every opportunity.</i>

523
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,079
<i>I have to go and find a new job tomorrow.</i>

524
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,486
Did you keep the business card well?

525
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,321
You have to audition tomorrow.

526
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,556
Yes, I kept it in my bag.

527
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,860
Don't you think it's strange for me
to audition as a model, though?

528
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,195
No, I think it's a good opportunity.

529
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,497
Try it.

530
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,732
Hey, miss.

531
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:02,968
Yes, you.

532
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,002
Me?

533
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,238
Let me see your fortune.

534
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,639
My fortune?

535
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,309
Your physiognomy looks strange,

536
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,344
so I want to see your fortune.

537
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,412
Really?

538
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,281
You're poor, right?

539
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,416
Yes.

540
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,752
How does she know? Do I look that poor?

541
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,887
No.

542
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,989
Your current situation is bad.

543
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,457
And...

544
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,795
There's a guy around you, you know?

545
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,496
As long as you're with him,

546
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,165
bad things will happen.

547
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,500
A guy?

548
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,569
If you want to be happy,

549
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:41,073
I suggest you cut off
any relations with him.

550
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,944
Is Daoming Si the one she's referring to?

551
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,613
If you want to find a boyfriend,

552
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,215
based on your physiognomy,

553
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,185
you should find someone younger.

554
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,853
Someone younger?

555
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,357
-And...
-Thank you. We're in a hurry.

556
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,491
Sorry.

557
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,628
Shancai, I think that woman is strange.

558
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,930
Don't listen to her.

559
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,766
Really? But I think she's quite accurate.

560
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,067
<i>You really believe her?</i>

561
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,435
<i>That's just a coincidence.</i>

562
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,905
Why is this place so strange?

563
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,541
It should be here.

564
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,447
Who is it?

565
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,819
Excuse me.

566
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,289
Someone gave me this card
for me to come here.

567
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,594
-You're here for an audition?
-Yes.

568
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,597
I want to know what kind
of person you're looking for.

569
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,367
We need someone your type.

570
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,502
Come on in.

571
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,904
Come in.

572
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,076
Very good.

573
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,778
Okay, one more.

574
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,847
Okay, smile.

575
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,450
Smile more naturally.

576
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,618
That's right.

577
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,319
Very good.

578
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,622
I'll change the film.

579
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,558
Drink some water.

580
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,093
Relax a bit.

581
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,262
You'll get used to it.

582
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,198
Don't be nervous.

583
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,768
Are you done?

584
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,438
-Let's continue.
-Okay, thanks.

585
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,039
-Relax a bit.
-Okay.

586
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,842
Okay, relax.

587
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,011
Don't be too restrained. Relax.

588
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:27,512
Come on.

589
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,181
Sit forward.

590
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,049
Okay, again.

591
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,921
-Unbutton your shirt a bit.
-What?

592
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,756
Open one button.

593
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,526
Make a shy expression.

594
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,903
Open one more button.

595
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,905
Open another one?

596
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,175
Open it.

597
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,543
Aren't you a university student?

598
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,545
You should be very experienced
about these things.

599
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:01,813
What do you mean?

600
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,816
Aren't university students quite open?

601
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,885
Does that have anything to do
with taking pictures?

602
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,186
Of course it does.

603
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,889
The model we need is mainly
for adult magazines.

604
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,394
Sorry, I don't think I'm suited for that.

605
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,631
Why are you making it a big deal?

606
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,100
Since you're already here,
you should try it.

607
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,735
Your qualifications are good.

608
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,904
You have the innocent image
of university students.

609
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,473
We can make you famous
in the entertainment industry.

610
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,108
You have to remove your clothes
to be famous.

611
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,376
I don't want to remove my clothes.

612
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,144
I don't want to enter
the entertainment industry.

613
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,480
Cut it out. Why did you come here
if not for the money?

614
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,016
That's right. You don't need
to show the vital parts.

615
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,452
-It's nice to shoot with a shirt on too.
-No, get away!

616
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,754
You pervert! I don't want
to take those pictures!

617
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,289
-Remove her clothes.
-What are you doing?

618
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,791
-Stop struggling.
-No, don't do this!

619
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,628
-No, I don't want to!
-Take it off. You'll get used to it.

620
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,796
Let go of me!

621
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,966
Help!

622
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,569
This delivery came at such a bad timing.

623
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:58,670
Cover her mouth.

624
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,875
-Sorry, I came in on my own.
-Hey.

625
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,812
How much is it?

626
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,147
Sir, it's NTD 600.

627
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,186
What are you doing?

628
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,923
Mind your own business.

629
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,559
That girl doesn't look like
she's consenting.

630
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,161
Let her go.

631
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,031
I have a few thousand dollars here.

632
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,465
Take it and go, okay?

633
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,267
You never saw anything today.

634
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,268
Okay?

635
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,238
This is sexual harassment.

636
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,472
You're dead, punk.

637
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,381
-My bag.
-Leave your bag. Let's go.

638
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,864
Thank you.

639
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,899
Are you stupid?

640
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,133
What were you thinking?

641
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,469
You're too engrossed in your dream
of stardom so you were fooled.

642
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,771
That's why I say women are stupid.

643
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,340
You say I'm stupid?

644
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,909
Use your brain and think, okay?

645
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,611
You think you have what it takes?

646
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,413
You were probably praised a bit
so you had a dream of getting famous.

647
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,915
You think you can be a star?

648
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,383
You think I want to?

649
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,952
If my dad wasn't fired from his job,

650
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,721
if we're not buried in debt,

651
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,823
and if my tuition wasn't so expensive,

652
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,758
I won't have any dreams of stardom.

653
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,794
I know I don't have what it takes.

654
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,164
I also know you must think I'm so stupid.

655
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,266
Yes, I'm an idiot and I'm stupid.

656
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,469
That's why I was tricked
to go to such a place,

657
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,537
but what does that have to do with you?

658
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,054
Thank you.

659
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,530
Aren't you a university student?

660
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,300
I think you're only one
or two years older than me,

661
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,369
yet you have to make a living
for your family.

662
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,971
You're quite pitiful.

663
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,274
You don't need to pity me.

664
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,177
That's life.

665
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,448
All right.

666
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,484
I can recommend you to do part-time work
at the fast-food chain I'm working at.

667
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,386
The starting hourly rate is NTD 80.
It's quite good.

668
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,691
Don't look at me with that expression.

669
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,192
I'm different from those people earlier.

670
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,393
I won't trick you.

671
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,930
Then thank you.

672
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,532
Why are you thanking me?

673
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,801
We can go there now.

674
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,803
I'm close with the owner.
It wouldn't be a problem.

675
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,172
-We're going now?
-Yeah.

676
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,408
-Let's go.
-Okay.

677
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,615
Thank you for what you did earlier.

678
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,050
It's nothing.

679
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,919
Actually, I'm not really that good.

680
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,655
If there's one more of them earlier,
I'm dead.

681
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,034
Shancai, you're really working two
part-time jobs now?

682
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,169
Yes. Bye.

683
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,437
Shancai.

684
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,372
-What?
-I...

685
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,242
Let's talk tomorrow. I'm going to work.

686
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,376
Bye.

687
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,011
She's so pitiful.

688
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,714
She goes to class in the morning
and works two jobs at night.

689
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,016
Why is she working two jobs?

690
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,653
-It's nothing.
-I'm asking why she's working two jobs?

691
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,759
Stop.

692
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,927
She goes to school daily.

693
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,230
Then aside from the cake shop,

694
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,832
she found work at a fast-food chain.

695
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,506
Why are you so mad?

696
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,775
She's working so hard
to return the money to you.

697
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,080
Who wants her to return the money?

698
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,283
You don't want her to return the money?

699
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,160
This is your meal number six.

700
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,963
It's NTD 119.

701
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,799
Thank you.

702
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,169
I want a burger and potato balls.

703
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,336
Please wait.

704
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,085
I see you're adapting quite nicely.

705
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,654
How are you? Do you feel tired?

706
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,423
Actually, I'd be lying
if I say I'm not tired,

707
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,592
but I'm Shancai, the weed.

708
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,260
Though with my salary,

709
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,763
there's still a long way to go
before I can pay back all our debts.

710
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,398
I think that as long as I work hard,

711
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,633
to give my family some hope,

712
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,202
I can do my best.

713
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,039
Not bad. You're quite cheerful.

714
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,575
Actually, I was quite worried initially.

715
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,944
I recommended this job to you.
Will you be able to handle it?

716
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,146
Seeing you today makes me feel at ease.

717
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,616
A friend once told me

718
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,219
that humans are actually very weak.

719
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,655
When something happens,
they won't be able to take it

720
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,957
if no one is beside them.

721
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,359
So no matter what happens,

722
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,661
you must always be
at your dad's side. Okay?

723
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,965
Are you feeling grateful to me?

724
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,100
I taught you such an important lesson.

725
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,206
Actually, I really need to thank you.

726
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,675
It's for recommending me to this job.

727
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,612
Because I already know
about what you said earlier.

728
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,881
To show my appreciation,

729
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,616
I'll treat you to some shave ice later.

730
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,683
Sure.

731
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,094
Daoming Si!

732
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,696
Daoming Si, what are you doing?

733
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,832
I was just stretching my joints,
you wench.

734
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,768
There's a guy around you, you know?

735
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,605
As long as you're with him,
bad things will happen.

736
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,574
You're so infuriating!

737
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,477
Who are you? Why did you hit me?

738
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,313
Hey, punk. Let me tell you,
I'm Daoming Si.

739
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,149
You're scum!

740
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,517
Who do you think you are?

741
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,287
The only thing you do is flirt with
different guys. You think you're all that?

742
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,655
Do you feel happy doing that?

743
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,623
-What?
-You slut!

744
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,861
Get lost.

745
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:35,199
You always use your own biases
to judge people.

746
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:39,570
How can you understand
that friendship between people

747
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,773
is not as cheap as what
your limited brain thinks?

748
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,009
A person who thinks
he's God's gift to humans

749
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,611
would never understand that.

750
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,113
Shancai.

751
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,248
I hate you the most!

752
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:51,649
Don't come near me!

753
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,685
Shancai.

754
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,788
Shancai.

755
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,633
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,335
It's all my fault.

757
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,238
I didn't mean to do it.

758
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,874
I just...

759
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,511
I just couldn't bear seeing you
so close with another guy.

760
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,814
You need to look sad now.

761
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,248
You're a bunch of idiots!

762
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,984
Don't complain. Just do what we say.

763
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,621
So...

764
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,258
So... So...

765
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,860
One more syllable.

766
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,295
Why should I apologize to that person?

767
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,329
That's ridiculous.

768
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,765
-No, I won't apologize no matter what.
-You beat up the person

769
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,134
beside Shancai for no good reason.

770
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,335
And what did you call her?

771
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:45,570
A slut.

772
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,572
Don't you think you went too far?

773
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,574
If I were Shancai, I would hate you too.

774
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,042
You made her sound so disgusting.

775
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,477
No wonder she hates you.

776
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,513
Lei, what do you think?

777
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,783
What do you mean?

778
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,817
Let me tell you.

779
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,986
Shancai really might not talk
to you anymore.

780
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,388
So what?

781
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,724
Regardless if she hates me or likes me,

782
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:11,963
I never really cared
from the very start...

783
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,367
Go and apologize.

784
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,669
It's your fault however you look at it.

785
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,371
Why should I...

786
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,375
Shan...

787
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:25,943
Shancai.

788
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,716
Ah Si has something to say to you.

789
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,553
Shancai, it seems Daoming Si
is in a bad mood.

790
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,921
Who cares?

791
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,724
He's invisible to me from now on.

792
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,326
-Invisible?
-That's right.

793
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,462
I won't talk to him again.

794
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,075
See?

795
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,724
Welcome.

796
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,725
Thanks.

797
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,096
Why aren't you resting at home today?

798
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,263
You even came to work.

799
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,100
Never mind. I'm not a homebody anyway.

800
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,401
I should just come to work.

801
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,636
Actually, I'm fine.

802
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,004
Welcome.

803
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,339
You can also order here.

804
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,845
Sir, we'll go ahead.

805
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,683
Hurry, or else Shancai would be
off from work already.

806
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,451
You have to speak to her nicely today.

807
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,420
You can't wear that expression
like she owes you money.

808
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,122
She really owes me money.

809
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,290
Young Master Ah Si,

810
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,192
you came to apologize today.

811
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,927
Please mind your attitude, okay?

812
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,129
All right?

813
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:53,764
You're hurt so you can't go
to the audition.

814
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,133
I'm sorry.

815
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:02,974
What's the matter?

816
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,345
Isn't that the person who hit me?

817
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,381
I'm sorry, Xiaoshun.

818
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,016
I got you involved in this.

819
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,552
Why did he hit me, though?

820
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,221
Because...

821
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:22,493
I think he likes you, right?

822
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,287
