1
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,522
-You're really going to work?
-Yeah.

2
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,891
-You'll just work for a few days?
-Yes.

3
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,560
The landlady offered a job to me.

4
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,730
-She told the owner of a restaurant.
-Yeah.

5
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,266
He will pay us later.

6
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,705
<i>It's great to have some help
from a young girl.</i>

7
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,940
There are many tourists
from Taipei on their vacation.

8
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,475
I need more hands right now.

9
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,545
-Please teach her what she should know.
-Okay.

10
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,914
She's smart.
She'll learn everything in no time.

11
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,484
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

12
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,119
Shancai, do you remember the way home?

13
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,420
-Yes, Mom.
-Okay.

14
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,089
-Be careful.
-Okay.

15
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,824
-Mom's leaving now.
-Okay, Mom. Bye.

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,360
-Take care, ma'am.
-Okay, thank you.

17
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,928
-Let me show you around.
-Okay.

18
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,867
Make sure to clean up the area.

19
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,535
Remember to check everything on the edge.

20
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,603
Morning.

21
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,806
You're finally here.
You're late every day.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,908
There is one more staff here.

23
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,111
If you keep doing this, you'll be fired.

24
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,946
I'm sorry, boss.

25
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,082
Shancai, this is the other student worker
in my restaurant. He's Ah Song.

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,917
Hi, I'm Shancai.

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,653
Hi.

28
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,523
Boss, is he behaving weird?

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,228
I met him on the beach last night.
Then he...

30
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,130
Ah Song, you went
to the beach again last night?

31
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,466
Shancai said she saw you
on the beach last night.

32
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,069
You always hang around until it's so late.
That's why you're always late.

33
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,637
No.

34
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,474
I did drink a little last night.

35
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,777
That's why I said I wanted to go diving.

36
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,615
Did we meet last night?

37
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,450
I don't remember it at all.

38
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,652
You don't remember?

39
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,790
How could you do that?
You're drunk, then you went to the beach.

40
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,359
You... that's dangerous.

41
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,962
Yeah. So I would be saved
by people every time.

42
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,200
They would have to do CPR on me.
Then they would have to kiss me.

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,904
The worst time is
when I was with a fat lady.

44
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,374
There's one time when it was an old man.

45
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,010
-It's so disgusting.
-Okay. Stop your nonsense.

46
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,212
-Do your job. I'll leave you here.
-Okay.

47
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,880
That's okay. You can leave it to me.

48
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,816
Bye.

49
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,830
"Suancai" is a great name.
How did you get that name?

50
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,965
-Actually, I'm--
-When I eat braised food,

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,934
I always tell the cook
to put more suancai,

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,269
so the food won't be too greasy.

53
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,106
Actually, I'm Shancai.

54
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,586
Welcome. Table for two?

55
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,454
This way, please.

56
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,934
Excuse me.

57
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,805
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

58
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,215
Hey, get back to work. Okay?

59
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:44,851
Okay.

60
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,586
Hurry.

61
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,827
The weather is so nice, though.

62
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,296
We should go on leave
in this kind of weather.

63
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,965
"Leave" your face! You're working now.

64
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,934
Yes, class president.

65
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,135
What class president?

66
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,106
People always go to the beach to relax.

67
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,974
When was the last time
you came to the beach?

68
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,877
A long time ago.

69
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,482
Why didn't I fall in love
with you instead?

70
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,967
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,071
-I...
-Don't touch me.

72
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,476
Let's just pretend that nothing happened.

73
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,649
Don't talk to me ever again.

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,801
When did you come here?

75
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,175
You're so similar to Ah Xiang.

76
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,843
Ah Xiang?

77
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,548
Ah Xiang used to be our class president.

78
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,551
I've always liked her.

79
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,053
I teased her all the time.

80
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,956
She was very honest.

81
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,292
And she was hardworking.

82
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,795
If I made a mistake, though,

83
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,165
she would beat me up when she got mad.

84
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,705
However, she left me already.

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,775
She ignores me now.

86
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,552
<i>Why is this weirdo crying?</i>

87
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,095
Qinghe.

88
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,431
You sent Shancai all these messages?

89
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,735
Yes, I always go online to collect
photos for her and send her messages.

90
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,237
She doesn't answer any calls,

91
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,707
but I can still send her messages
and photos to show her how I feel.

92
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,677
She should be able to read
my messages by accident.

93
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,746
Yes. I believe that Shancai
would surely contact us,

94
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,281
if she sees them.

95
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,216
Qinghe, you're so sincere.

96
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,087
That jerk Daoming Si.

97
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,356
He said he likes Shancai,
but he's not doing anything.

98
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,091
He even gets drunk at night.

99
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,694
Shancai's gone and he doesn't even care.

100
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,229
Of course, because a lot of girls
are professing their love to him.

101
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
The other day, a schoolmate

102
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,933
gave him a cake she personally baked.

103
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,736
Really? Did he accept it then?

104
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,375
No, he gave it to me.

105
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,645
If I were him, I'd surely stay away
from girls who like me.

106
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,946
I won't let them get near me.

107
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,883
Xiaoyou, do you still like me?

108
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,552
I'm treating you as my best friend.

109
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,855
Here you go again.

110
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,891
I never had any feelings for you, okay?

111
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,360
Really?

112
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,895
Didn't you just break up
with your boyfriend?

113
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,397
You must be feeling empty.

114
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,534
After I broke up with such a bad guy,

115
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,136
I don't think about him anymore.

116
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,807
Then Shancai should already have
forgotten about Daoming Si too.

117
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,445
<i>I think she'd accept me just like you.</i>

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,090
However, what if there are other guys
around Shancai?

119
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,192
What should I do then?

120
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,228
Hey?

121
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,196
Xiaoyou.

122
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,536
You really won't cut me some slack.
And you say you like me.

123
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,330
Suancai.

124
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,332
I'm busy. Don't talk to me.

125
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,135
And my name is Shancai, not Suancai.

126
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,238
It's just a name.

127
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,175
The fishes in the ocean don't have a name,

128
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,910
but they're living happily.

129
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,646
You're not a fish. How would
you know if they're happy or not?

130
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,450
Hey, Suancai.

131
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,718
Do you want to discuss
philosophical topics with me?

132
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,756
I remember Zhuang Zi said,

133
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,158
"You are not a fish, how would
you know the happiness of a fish?"

134
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,194
However, I feel that

135
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,596
when I think those fishes are happy,

136
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,065
I become happy too.

137
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,734
I don't want to talk about
whether the fishes are happy or not.

138
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,436
That's right.

139
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,271
We were talking about your name.

140
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,976
A name is just a term.

141
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,878
Just like mobile numbers.

142
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,413
The numbers don't mean anything.

143
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,215
If you're able to reach the person,

144
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,383
that's when it becomes meaningful.

145
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,055
Just like your friends.

146
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,389
They remember you,

147
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,824
not your name.

148
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,759
And they remember who you are.

149
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,561
Get back to work!

150
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,799
Okay.

151
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,567
Somebody's unhappy.

152
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,374
-Suancai.
-You're still talking.

153
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,376
I want to ask you about something else.

154
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,648
Why are you working here?

155
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,551
Because I need money.

156
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,953
That's direct.

157
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,957
Weren't you studying in an elite school?

158
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,092
Don't you need to go to class?

159
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,427
You're so troublesome.
What does it have to do with you?

160
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,332
I heard from the owner
of the guesthouse I'm staying at

161
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,369
that you're a rich man's fiancée.

162
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,573
Look. Look at this news.

163
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,509
It's the owner of this company, right?

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,614
That's so cool.

165
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,785
This merger seems to have led
to a big chain reaction.

166
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,025
You're like the modern-day Cinderella.

167
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,827
I really don't know
why you're staying here.

168
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,797
You should go back to your boyfriend.

169
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,134
Being together with the one you love
is the best thing ever.

170
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,736
What right do you have to say that?

171
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,705
Didn't you also let go
of the one you love?

172
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,007
You don't do anything and
just let your imagination run wild.

173
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,375
You think you can be happy that way?

174
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,111
Before you say that about me,
can you think about yourself first?

175
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,300
Why did you ask me to come to the pub?

176
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,669
It wasn't my idea. Ask Ximen.

177
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,104
Ximen.

178
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,706
Kiss me if I finish this in one shot.

179
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,976
I'd never refuse

180
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,645
a beautiful girl's request.

181
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,815
I can't take it. What a playboy.

182
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,453
Hi, Lei. Long time no see.

183
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,455
It's been awhile. How are you?

184
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,624
Still the same as before.

185
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,029
You're still so quiet.

186
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,798
That's why Shancai told me
that when she's with you,

187
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,166
she becomes dull.

188
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,235
Can I use this?

189
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,239
It's Ximen and Meizuo's idea
to gather tonight.

190
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,376
Though, I don't think it would be useful,
just go with them.

191
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,911
Try not to mention Shancai.

192
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,080
Why?

193
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,449
You're Damoing Si's ex-fiancée?

194
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,584
What ex-fiancee?

195
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,952
Just call me Xiaozi.

196
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,354
I'm Qinghe.

197
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,424
Qinghe. I know you're
Shancai's best friend.

198
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,859
Me? I'm Shancai's best friend too.

199
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,328
And, like what you said,

200
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,196
I'm Daoming Si's ex-fiancée.

201
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,398
So their problem is my problem.

202
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,966
I can't just watch and not do anything.

203
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,802
Then what are you planning to do?

204
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,304
Shancai's gone. Are you
going to claim lost territory?

205
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,572
What?

206
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,873
That's how it works.

207
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,343
Shancai and Daoming Si had
already broken up.

208
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,945
You can be reinstated to fiancée again.

209
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,948
It's fine. Shancai's also avoiding Daoming
Si. That's why she's not coming back.

210
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,317
We're not that certain.

211
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,453
That's the situation.
Ask Huaze Lei if you don't believe me.

212
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,455
I'm not interested
in other people's business.

213
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,891
Don't worry.
I won't take advantage of the situation.

214
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,527
And I don't even know what's going on.

215
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,664
Can you tell me what exactly happened?

216
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,402
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si, you're here.

217
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,903
Why are you so slow? Here, sit down.

218
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,505
Why are you so late?

219
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,173
What do you want to order?

220
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,842
Why did you ask me to come here?

221
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,243
Sit down first.

222
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,544
Ah Si's here.

223
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,047
-Ah Si, long time no see.
-Waiter.

224
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,216
You're still so handsome.
I think I'm in love with you again.

225
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,552
-Xiaozi. You haven't ordered, right?
-Yes.

226
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,254
Ah Si hasn't ordered too. Then...

227
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,322
What would you like to have?

228
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,958
I think we should order more red wine.

229
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:52,925
We already finished it.

230
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,761
Do you want to eat anything?

231
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,629
Ximen, just order for us.

232
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,065
-Order and we can share.
-Okay.

233
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,566
Order more for Ah Si.

234
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,801
It looks like he became thinner.

235
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,669
Qinghe, are you hungry?
Do you want to eat anything?

236
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,505
Of course I'm hungry.

237
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,973
I'm not sure what's good here.

238
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,374
Then I'll order for you.

239
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,243
Red wine.

240
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,944
-Then a pizza...
-Hey.

241
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,679
I heard the caviar here is good.

242
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,714
Order one for Ah Si.

243
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,750
Hey. Caviar? I like that too.
Order one for me.

244
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:22,755
Okay, two orders of caviar
and fried chicken.

245
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,957
-Then... What?
-Ximen.

246
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,192
Is this why you asked me to come?

247
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,662
Yes, let's just have a get-together.

248
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,063
Why should we all meet?

249
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,633
It's been awhile since we all went out.

250
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,802
The more, the merrier. Right?

251
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,003
Am I right, Lei?

252
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,105
Ah Si, Ximen doesn't mean...

253
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,373
You know what this is?

254
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,275
This is lame.

255
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,645
You act like we're so close. Why?

256
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,413
Ah Si.

257
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,949
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:50,983
Ximen, never mind.

259
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,519
Ah Si, isn't that too much?

260
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,154
Did I ask you to play these lame games?

261
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,825
You're just acting out a lousy
friendship scene.

262
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,827
Just talk nicely.

263
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,962
You got dumped then you act this way.

264
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,997
Look at yourself!

265
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,666
Ximen, stop it.

266
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,002
You're the lame one.

267
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,004
Why did you hit him?

268
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,544
This is why

269
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,446
Shancai dumped you.

270
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,020
Stop fighting!

271
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,388
You and Qinghe should go home first.

272
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,389
They'll be fine.

273
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,891
You useless jerk!

274
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,859
All right! That's enough!

275
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,893
It's none of your business!

276
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,246
Shancai, because you're here,

277
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,514
we're having a nice meal.

278
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,148
We usually don't have a chance to do this.

279
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,385
That's right. Here.
This bamboo shoot is so sweet.

280
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,720
You've never tried this before.

281
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,654
No.

282
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,356
Eat some fish.

283
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,561
Usually, we only eat fish once a year
during Chinese New Year.

284
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,029
Now, we live by the sea.

285
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,063
We can have fish daily.

286
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,733
Before, they used to say that

287
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,735
you'd have good luck if you
eat radish daily.

288
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,203
It was useless, though.

289
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,440
Actually, as long as we can
all eat together,

290
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,708
I'm happy no matter what we eat.

291
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,814
Actually...

292
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,318
We're so not used to you speaking

293
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,186
such sweet things.

294
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,325
Actually, I know you said
those things to comfort us.

295
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,396
You've already received Young Master
Daoming Si's diamond necklace.

296
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,933
Next time, you'd surely receive
his diamond ring.

297
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,267
A ring?

298
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,105
If she get a ring, that means
he's proposing to her.

299
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,007
Honey.

300
00:17:55,575 --> 00:18:00,046
That means there are less chances
for us to eat with Shancai.

301
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,881
That's right. After they get married,

302
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,849
how would she have time for us?

303
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,654
Shancai, eat some more.

304
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,224
-Here, eat some fish.
-Thanks, Dad.

305
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,527
Here, Honey, eat more.

306
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,095
Okay.

307
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,363
Here.

308
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:41,520
<i>Since I left Yingde Academy
and Daoming Si,</i>

309
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,290
<i>I turned off my phone completely.</i>

310
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,193
<i>Just like mobile numbers.</i>

311
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,961
The numbers don't mean anything.

312
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,796
If you're able to reach the person,

313
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,132
that's when it becomes meaningful.

314
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,110
<i>Shancai.</i>

315
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,478
<i>Where exactly are you?</i>

316
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,415
<i>No matter how late it is,
call me when you get this message.</i>

317
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,650
<i>Daoming Si.</i>

318
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,255
<i>You're driving me crazy.</i>

319
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,758
<i>Shancai, where are you?</i>

320
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,726
<i>Call me now.</i>

321
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,229
<i>Shancai...</i>

322
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,733
<i>Shancai...</i>

323
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,036
<i>Shancai...</i>

324
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,417
NEW MESSAGE

325
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,389
SHANCAI
WHERE ARE YOU

326
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,693
WE MISS YOU SO MUCH

327
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,930
They're all from Qinghe.

328
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,544
Has Daoming Si already forgotten about me?

329
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,592
Did he really forget me already?

330
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,490
Have you really forgetten me?

331
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,291
Ah Xiang!

332
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,629
I really miss you!

333
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,234
I'm waiting for you to come back!

334
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,601
<i>Shancai, come back soon.</i>

335
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,370
<i>We're all waiting for you.</i>

336
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,744
I'm really mad.

337
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,345
I want to end my friendship
with that fool.

338
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,346
That's enough. Calm down.

339
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,715
Calm down?

340
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,150
Look at my face, okay?

341
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,555
It seems that we haven't had a fight
with each other for so long.

342
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,590
I think Ah Si won

343
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,293
in your fight this time.

344
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,196
Are you laughing at me?

345
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,463
Lei.

346
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,867
Ah Si lost his mind and beat Ximen up.

347
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,535
Ximen didn't lose his mind.

348
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,637
So he didn't use that much force.

349
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,673
That's why he received
a lot of punches from Ah Si.

350
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,174
Let's not discuss this, okay?

351
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,376
If he doesn't change his bad temper,

352
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,945
I won't talk to him ever again.

353
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:31,217
I think Ah Si purposely
let himself fall apart.

354
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,187
Or, rather, he doesn't have
the capacity not to fall apart.

355
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,023
He and Shancai keep breaking up

356
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,693
and getting back together.

357
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,761
They made their love affair so sad.

358
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,865
No wonder Ximen couldn't take it anymore.

359
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,334
You can't take it anymore too, right?

360
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,736
However,

361
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,373
it seems the problem
is not between them this time.

362
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,208
You mean...

363
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,409
Ah Si's mom.

364
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,445
That's right.

365
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,614
This is too coincidental.

366
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,916
After the empress dowager came back,

367
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,118
weren't we worried about Shancai?

368
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,855
Then the empress dowager suddenly
went back to New York.

369
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,792
Shancai also dropped out
and disappeared during that time.

370
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,327
Ximen.

371
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,597
Do you still remember that Ah Si met us
that afternoon before Shancai dropped out?

372
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,132
He was in bliss

373
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,767
and wanted us to fall in love too.

374
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,504
It's not possible for them
to break up overnight.

375
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,606
What's not possible
between their personalities?

376
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,074
Ximen.

377
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,844
Stop acting mad at him in front of us.

378
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,647
Let's check and see

379
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,282
what the root of the problem is.

380
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,851
We made an effort to ask
Ah Si to come out and have fun

381
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,119
so that he'll be in a better mood.

382
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,554
Instead, let's follow what Lei says

383
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,189
and check what exactly happened.

384
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,792
Ximen, check with Xiaoyou.

385
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,561
I'll check with nouveau riche.

386
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,039
Qinghe's family's financial applications
with the bank

387
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,007
seemed to have happened
at the same period too.

388
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,277
I think I get it now.

389
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,415
Your dad's work and the financial
situation of Qinghe's family.

390
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,251
I'm sure that they both happened
because of Shancai.

391
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,188
Is Daoming Si's mom really that powerful?

392
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,293
Her contacts and power in the financial
sector is beyond your imagination.

393
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,562
Actually, it's not hard to understand.

394
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,731
She used the blow
to your financial situation

395
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,966
to force Shancai to retreat.

396
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,169
She used us to threaten Shancai?

397
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,438
That's right.

398
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,774
It's impossible for the empress dowager
to let the Daoming family's successor

399
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,176
be with an ordinary girl like Shancai.

400
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,311
Actually, we already know
this would happen.

401
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,680
We just didn't think it would be
this quick

402
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:45,718
that we didn't have any time to react
and Shancai already dropped out.

403
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,355
Maybe I should say
that she gave up on her relationship

404
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,589
to protect you and Qinghe.

405
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,132
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

406
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,768
Actually, these are just her tricks.

407
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,072
She used her career and power
to achieve such plans.

408
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,809
Actually, you, Shancai, and Qinghe...

409
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,845
are all innocent.

410
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,751
I can only say that this world
is really unfair.

411
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,797
Good thing we didn't have
many customers today.

412
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,133
Or else, I'd surely tell the boss
that you went diving during work.

413
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,469
I knew it.

414
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,305
You're a nice girl.

415
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,774
You're really nice.

416
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:16,875
Want some help?

417
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,045
Look. You're pretty,

418
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,448
treats every customer nicely,

419
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,849
and has a nice temper.

420
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,319
Surely, your boyfriend wouldn't dump you.

421
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,090
You dare say that about me.

422
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,424
Aren't you the same?

423
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,226
Why did you and Ah Xiang break up?

424
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,105
This beach is the place where she left me.

425
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,775
We originally came here for a vacation,

426
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,944
but she left on her own.

427
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,947
I really like this place.

428
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,748
So I didn't want to leave.

429
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,885
She said I'm too impractical.

430
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,388
It's been so long.

431
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:09,094
She finally had it
during our vacation here.

432
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:10,963
<i>Ah Song.</i>

433
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,333
I know you have beautiful dreams.

434
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,968
And I also know that you're very romantic.

435
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,403
However, have you ever thought about us?

436
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,272
Where does our future lie?

437
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,144
It's like you found home in this beach.

438
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,080
What about me, though?
Have you ever considered me?

439
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,451
My family is still waiting for me
to earn money and support them.

440
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,053
I keep thinking that
I haven't finished my work yet.

441
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,089
However, you...

442
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,291
you just keep getting more relaxed.

443
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,966
Don't put too much pressure
on yourself, okay?

444
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,435
You can't be the class president forever.

445
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,473
You're a woman too.

446
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,376
You need to relax.

447
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,811
I'm a woman that needs
a sense of security.

448
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,083
If I cannot rely on a man
with a sense of responsibility,

449
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,552
then I'd just rely on myself.

450
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:12,357
Because by relying only on myself
will I not have expectations and get hurt.

451
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,336
So she left.

452
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,506
She went to find her sense of security.

453
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,576
And me?

454
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:36,248
I stayed in this beach
to wait for her to come back.

455
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,320
So you've been waiting for her
all these months?

456
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,122
That's right.

457
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,392
I'm here waiting for her
to find the answers.

458
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,065
How do you define
sense of security, though?

459
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,634
I'm not sure either.

460
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,606
Ah Song.

461
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,375
I think you'd both find the answers.

462
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,350
Will she really be back?

463
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,688
Ah Song, pull yourself together.

464
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,696
It's so good to have someone
to chat with while I'm lonely.

465
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,334
Yes. So you have to pull yourself together
and wait for Ah Xiang to come back, okay?

466
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,570
Okay.

467
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:37,843
Okay, pull myself together
and start working.

468
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,411
Come on.

469
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,415
By the way, it seems a television show
did an interview here yesterday.

470
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,651
Really? I didn't notice.

471
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,120
If I interviewed me,

472
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,555
I'd surely mention the work
I've done here.

473
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:51,757
What does that mean?

474
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,558
I studied art.

475
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,728
My greatest dream
is to get enough travel funds

476
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,932
and go to Italy to see Michaelangelo
and Da Vincci's works.

477
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,006
SHANCAI WHERE ARE YOU

478
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,542
<i>This fishing village has
around 1,000 residents.</i>

479
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,211
<i>However, during summer, it's a place
where water sports enthusiasts...</i>

480
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,514
To all the gods out there,
please let me find Shancai.

481
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,517
Please, be it the Jade Emperor
or other gods, please.

482
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,951
<i>And because the fishing volume is huge,</i>

483
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,221
<i>aside from enjoying the water activities,</i>

484
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,890
<i>people would also come
to the restaurant here.</i>

485
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,559
-Shancai.
-<i>And enjoy the freshest seafood</i>.

486
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,528
<i>Aside from being fresh,</i>

487
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,265
<i>the prices of food here are not that high.</i>

488
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,368
<i>So everyone is welcome to come and enjoy</i>

489
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,470
<i>their summer or holidays here.</i>

490
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,711
Shancai is really good.

491
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,546
She worked at a pastry shop.

492
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,614
And she became a model on a magazine.

493
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,950
Then she became a maid in Ah Si's house.

494
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,287
Now she even found work by the beach.

495
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,758
No matter where she goes,
she can rely on herself and work.

496
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,360
I really admire her.

497
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,629
That's Shancai.
Her determination is really strong.

498
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,665
All right.

499
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,100
I told you what Xiaoyou said.

500
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,801
Tell Ah Si when he comes later.

501
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,203
I'll go ahead.

502
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,804
You still don't want to talk to him?

503
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,606
Why do you have to do this?

504
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,208
Just reconcile with him.

505
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,477
Just tell Ah Si

506
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,045
there's news about Shancai already.

507
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,813
See if he wants to pick her up.

508
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,282
I'm busy. I'll go ahead.

509
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,284
Lei.

510
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,853
Tell Ah Si.

511
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,754
Okay.

512
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,793
-Ximen.
-Yes.

513
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,628
Are you still mad at Ah Si?

514
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,064
I have a date, okay?

515
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,399
I'm not that lame.

516
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,633
Really?

517
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,436
That's good then.

518
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,406
Ah Si.

519
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,475
Good news.

520
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,643
We found Shancai.

521
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,311
Do you want to go...

522
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,014
I didn't say it clearly.

523
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,683
-Qinghe found Shancai by accident...
-You don't need to tell me about that.

524
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,286
Who's going to pick her up?

525
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,487
Who are you picking up?

526
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,656
They all have nothing to do with me.
Go if you want to.

527
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,291
Stop acting this way, okay?

528
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:07,959
Let's go together then.

529
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,162
Why should I go pick her up?

530
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,432
She was the one who left me.

531
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,411
-Honey, get it drier.
-Okay.

532
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,214
That's fine.

533
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,454
Village Chief, Ms. Landlady.
Why are you here?

534
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,856
So many people came.

535
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,625
Have a seat. Let's chat.

536
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,327
Ah Yue, let me ask you.

537
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,330
There are rumors all around the village
and we were wondering what's happening.

538
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,531
-What is it?
-What is it?

539
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,233
Don't pretend you don't know.

540
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,602
Don't think that people
from the suburbs are easy to fool.

541
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,939
You say your daughter's boyfriend
is a rich guy.

542
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,173
We won't believe you.

543
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,508
We're not that gullible.

544
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,344
-Well... That's right.
-We weren't trying to fool you.

545
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,481
Our daughter really has
a very rich boyfriend.

546
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,216
We just can't tell you his name,

547
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,884
or else you might die from shock.

548
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,787
Just return the money you borrowed.

549
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,890
With your daughter's looks,
she can get a rich boyfriend?

550
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,758
I think she has a long way to go.

551
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,727
Village Chief.

552
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,362
You have to believe us.

553
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:21,833
After my daughter marries
her rich boyfriend,

554
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,168
her fiancé,

555
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,704
I'd surely have an open banquet here
where you can eat for free anytime

556
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,039
for three days and three nights.

557
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,941
It's not that we don't believe you,

558
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,543
but there's no proof.

559
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,944
How can we believe it?

560
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,946
And we all know for a fact

561
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,350
that your daughter is close with Ah Song,

562
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,352
who's been staying here for awhile.

563
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:41,953
Village Chief.

564
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,722
You have to mind your words.

565
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,091
Our daughter is a decent girl.

566
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,793
-That's right.
-She has a very good reputation.

567
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,530
Aside from dating Daoming Si,

568
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,298
Qinghe drove her home,

569
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,733
then Huaze Lei went on a date with her.

570
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,104
Now, my best decorative art

571
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,506
is to be revealed to the world.

572
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,452
What do you think, Shancai?

573
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:19,024
Do you feel moved by art?

574
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,093
Moved by art?

575
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,131
What is the name of this work?

576
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,535
It's called, <i>Lady on a Horse.</i>

577
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,471
Look at how powerful her form is.

578
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:34,973
It's bold, right?

579
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,974
Yes.

580
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,376
This is a lady on a horse?

581
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,512
Yes.

582
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:41,579
You know what?

583
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,816
I spent a lot of time just to find
this piece of wood by the beach.

584
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,186
And I even sent this clothes hanger
to the dry cleaners.

585
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,120
Here.

586
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,056
And this wire too.

587
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,094
I really like it. How about you?

588
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,830
Tell me. What do you think of this work?

589
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,466
Honestly,

590
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,535
I don't really get it. Sorry.

591
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,445
Gosh, I'm sorry.

592
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,348
I really see you
in a different light, though.

593
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,783
Turns out you really
have things you want to do.

594
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,853
I don't really know how to appreciate art,

595
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,956
but I believe people who can
understand it would think it's great.

596
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,029
I think so, too.

597
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,736
That's why I want to go to Italy
to watch and learn from them.

598
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,372
So I need to work hard

599
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,240
and save up for my travel funds.

600
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:43,975
Yes.

601
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,544
Is this the beautiful dream
Ah Xiang mentioned?

602
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,514
Yes.

603
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,516
We said we'll go together.

604
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,656
She's also the only one
who understands my work.

605
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,524
She also admires me.

606
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,330
However, a year ago,

607
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,333
I started doubting my capabilities.

608
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,636
I completely lost the courage
to create things.

609
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,172
At that time,

610
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,107
Ah Xiang kept encouraging me.

611
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,810
However, her tolerance

612
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,212
became a kind of pressure
between us instead.

613
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,716
Maybe that's when I started...

614
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,085
becoming impractical.

615
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,155
Because I wanted to escape
from that kind of pressure.

616
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,394
Until she finally left me.

617
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,068
How about you? What's your dream?

618
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,070
Me?

619
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,175
Actually, I don't have any special dreams.

620
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,813
I just want to live together
happily with my family.

621
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,082
And not worry about making a living.

622
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,483
That's good enough for me.

623
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,827
Shancai.

624
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,696
I'll be honest with you. Don't get mad.

625
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,967
I think you should go back.

626
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,370
You won't find the happiness
you want right here.

627
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,042
Actually, you and I are the same.

628
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,112
We're just escaping from reality.

629
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,750
So I know how you feel.

630
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,592
-Stop pushing us. Shancai!
-Go.

631
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,395
Move.

632
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,964
Explain it to them.

633
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,199
Tell them there's nothing
between you and this guy.

634
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,504
Because they want us to return the money
and leave the fishing village.

635
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,139
-Just make it clear.
-Just do it.

636
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,342
Shancai, can you ask Young Master
Daoming Si to come here?

637
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,178
-That's right.
-Bring that rich fiancé of yours here.

638
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,312
Never mind.

639
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,082
Your dad was bluffing that your fiancé
is a rich business owner.

640
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,951
I think you and Ah Song are the ones
that are dating.

641
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,620
I'm sorry, you've really misunderstood.

642
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,288
There's really nothing
between me and Shancai.

643
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,523
-That's right.
-Did you hear that?

644
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,525
You're really good at arguing.
If it's really as you say

645
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,227
that there's nothing between you two,
what are you doing this late at night?

646
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,295
-That's right.
-That's right.

647
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,397
What's the matter with you?

648
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,899
Who I meet at what time

649
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,234
and who my boyfriend is
are none of your businesses, okay?

650
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,703
-None of our businesses?
-Stop it.

651
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,505
-Pay back my money.
-Come on.

652
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:30,041
I think you're just making up stories
to scam us out of our money.

653
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,576
-Stop right there.
-You scammer.

654
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,478
We're not scamming you.

655
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,013
We're definitely not doing that.

656
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,581
-We'll surely pay you.
-Yes.

657
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,749
Tomorrow.

658
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,717
We'll pay you tomorrow, okay?

659
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,753
-Sure.
-Tomorrow.

660
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,488
-Pay us tomorrow.
-Pay us tomorrow.

661
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,356
-Okay.
-You must pay us tomorrow.

662
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,261
Tomorrow.

663
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,763
Tomorrow shouldn't be a problem, right?

664
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,566
Young Master Daoming Si can come
to our fishing village, right?

665
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,000
-Shancai.
-Right?

666
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,136
-Shancai, no problem, right?
-I've already told them.

667
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,272
I just couldn't let that go.

668
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,808
How can they say I'm bluffing?

669
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,310
I...

670
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,112
Shancai, just call Young Master
Daoming Si again.

671
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,814
Borrow money from him again.

672
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:10,748
Okay?

673
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,383
Tell him you're borrowing it now.

674
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,053
After you marry him, you actually
don't need to pay him back anymore.

675
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,322
Shancai, do you have a phone?
Call him now.

676
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,323
Call him.

677
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,224
I can't.

678
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,327
I won't make this call.

679
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:23,628
What?

680
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,131
Because I've already broken up with him.

681
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,199
-What?
-What?

682
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,936
I said I'm on vacation because of the
university's anniversary celebration.

683
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,271
I lied to you too.

684
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,374
Actually, I already dropped out.

685
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:41,079
And the house we were living in
has already been sold by the landlord.

686
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,548
And we owe them many months of rent.

687
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,687
You can say I left Taipei
with nothing and came here.

688
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,656
This...

689
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,524
-That...
-That...

690
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,029
-Tomorrow morning...
-Tomorrow morning...

691
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,018
Honey, what should we do?

692
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,486
-What else?
-Yeah.

693
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,887
Tell the truth.

694
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,722
Ask them to forgive us.

695
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,591
I'll speak to them.

696
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,092
-Okay.
-Okay.

697
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,094
Everyone, please listen to me.

698
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,398
-We really didn't mean to lie to you.
-Yeah.

699
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,732
We're really sorry.

700
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,568
However, we're really
having a hard time now.

701
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,203
So please let us go this time.

702
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,906
Give us a few more days.
We'd surely think of way to pay you back.

703
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,153
Shancai.

704
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,721
Shancai, we finally found you.

705
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,225
So it's really true.

706
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,761
So there really is a rich fiancé.

707
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,263
He's really a prince charming.

708
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,497
He's so handsome.

709
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,166
Shancai, I finally found you.

710
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,867
-Qinghe.
-Hi, Mrs. Dong.

711
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,003
-Hi.
-Why are you here?

712
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,671
We came here to pick you up.

713
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,074
Young Master.

714
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,842
You're Shancai's boyfriend?

715
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:20,611
Then you must be here
to pay Ah Yue's debts.

716
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,348
She owes me over NTD 80,000 in rent.

717
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,615
Can you pay it for her?

718
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,051
-I'm sorry, you're mistaken.
-No, he's not her boyfriend.

719
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,721
He's not her boyfriend.

720
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,955
He won't pay her debt.

721
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,390
Me. I can pay for it. How much is it?

722
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,524
Okay, NTD 80,000.

723
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,132
I only have NTD 20,000.

724
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,669
Here's NTD 85,000.
Do you want to count it?

725
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,170
That's fine. Thanks.

726
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,609
Ah Yue, we're sorry.

727
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,711
-Please forgive us.
-Sorry.

728
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,314
How about going to my house
for dinner tonight?

729
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:58,850
I knew everything you said is true.

730
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,118
You can come again next time.

731
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,453
-Ms. Landlady.
-Don't be mad.

732
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,789
Thank you.

733
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,331
Shancai, you look good.

734
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,832
That's right.

735
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,234
Because the air is nice here.

736
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,002
And I bathe in the sun daily.

737
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,104
See? My skin is so dark.

738
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,740
You went missing. We were
all so worried about you.

739
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,410
I saw you on television and
told everyone to find you here.

740
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,913
Qinghe, thanks a lot.

741
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,884
There's nothing to thank me for.

742
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,786
Xiaoyou and I both feel very guilty.

743
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,954
There's no need to feel guilty.

744
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,556
It's good for me to live here.

745
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,124
It feels like I'm on a vacation.

746
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,926
And I can even live with my parents.

747
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:42,994
Shancai.

748
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,029
Go back with us.

749
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,466
Go back with us. Otherwise,
we won't be able to live with ourselves.

750
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:51,769
I'll help you return Huaze Lei's money.

751
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,272
It's my way of repaying you

752
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:55,473
for helping my family.

753
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,775
Qinghe, I know you're nice to me.

754
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,511
You don't need to think
about it and feel guilty.

755
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,947
Because I just did what I should do.

756
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,683
You two got involved.

757
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,052
I feel so bad about it.

758
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,555
Shancai.

759
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,724
We all know you hid here
because you had your reasons.

760
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,793
However, as you can see,

761
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,629
even if you were forced
to give up on your relationship,

762
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,798
you didn't lose any friendship.

763
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,468
Shancai, we really hope
you can go back with us.

764
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,770
Maybe only Daoming Di doesn't want that.

765
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,107
Qinghe, don't talk nonsense.

766
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,042
I'm not talking nonsense.

767
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,844
I'm telling the truth.

768
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,145
Didn't you say that

769
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,280
Daoming Si doesn't want
to come and pick up Shancai?

770
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,682
And he himself said that

771
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,617
there's nothing between him
and Shancai anymore.

772
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:40,952
Shancai, let me tell you.

773
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,021
There are lots of girls who are pursuing
Daoming Si in school now.

774
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,022
Qinghe.

775
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,357
You really talk too much.

776
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,292
I'm telling the truth.

777
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,796
In that case,
I don't need to worry anymore.

778
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,632
Because there's nothing
between Daoming Si and me anymore.

779
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,000
That's right. Stop hiding.

780
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,335
Go back to school with us.

781
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,639
Go back with us.

782
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:17,889
Okay, I'll go back with you.

783
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,518
