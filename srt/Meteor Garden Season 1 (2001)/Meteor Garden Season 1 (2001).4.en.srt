1
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,658
I never expected Shancai
would get a fever.

2
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,095
Ever since she was little,
she rarely catches a cold.

3
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,298
People say that only idiots
and stupid people don't get sick.

4
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,300
Now we have proof
that my daughter is not an idiot.

5
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,604
-This is great.
-What are you talking about?

6
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,739
I heard something though.

7
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,342
They said it's easier for people
who are in love to catch a cold.

8
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,679
-Maybe our daughter is in love!
-In love!

9
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,781
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

10
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,450
Should you be saying that
at a time like this?

11
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,085
I'm sick.

12
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,153
-Oh, that's right.
-You have a fever.

13
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,788
-Get well first.
-That's right.

14
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,091
Here. I made egg porridge.

15
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,093
Feed her slowly.
I'm going to my part-time job.

16
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,594
-Go to work.
-I'm leaving now.

17
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,063
-I'll handle this. Come on.
-I'm leaving.

18
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,733
Hey!

19
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,838
How can you eat
your daughter's egg porridge?

20
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,141
That's because I can't resist the smell.

21
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,510
I'm so hungry, Honey.

22
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,813
We only eat carrots every day.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,515
I'm not a rabbit.

24
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,318
Of course, you're not a rabbit.

25
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,087
-You're almost bald.
-Bald?

26
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,890
Being bald is better than being stupid,
like our neighbor.

27
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,492
You're not stupid.

28
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,961
But the problem is your daughter
is really sick,

29
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,697
yet you're still eating her one
and only nutritious egg porridge.

30
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,532
Don't you have any conscience?

31
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,367
Don't you know we're very poor?

32
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:52,372
We used all our money
to pay for her tuition and our rent.

33
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,174
You should ride out the storm with us.

34
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,077
Are we so poor that I can't even have
a bite of her porridge?

35
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,011
Of course, you can't.

36
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,813
-If you take a bite, I'll take one too!
-Stop.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,416
-If you eat it, I can eat it too!
-Stop arguing!

38
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,852
Can you two stop arguing? I'm sick.

39
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,521
Do it for me.

40
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,858
-That's right.
-It's all your fault.

41
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,959
-Get out.
-Okay.

42
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,995
-You don't have to take care of her.
-It's all my fault.

43
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,930
-Go to work.
-I'll go to work. I'll do my thing.

44
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,533
He's even stealing porridge.

45
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,136
Shancai.

46
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,272
I've thought about it.

47
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,175
If you feel too much pressure,

48
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,011
you don't have to study
in that elite school anymore.

49
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,813
Really?

50
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,980
Yes.

51
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,616
I've really thought about it.

52
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,319
I think you should just date
that nouveau riche guy

53
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,588
who brought you home, Qinghe.

54
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,789
That would be quicker.

55
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,992
-I want to throw up.
-Maybe we can even save

56
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,095
on tuition for your elite school.

57
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,498
Hey, Shancai.
Do you think that makes sense?

58
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,700
I think it's a good idea.

59
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,590
Are you in a better mood today?

60
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,632
I heard that Shancai is sick.

61
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:26,933
What?

62
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,236
That Shancai is sick?

63
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,471
Why are you so concerned?

64
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm not.

65
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,509
Who says I'm concerned?

66
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,913
I was just wondering why that kind
of person would get sick too.

67
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,615
I'm home.

68
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,351
You! Who are you?

69
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,620
Why are you in my house?

70
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,755
This is our house!
What are you trying to do?

71
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,657
Are you a thief?

72
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,160
A thief came to our house!

73
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,495
Why did you come to our house?

74
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,097
You know him, Shancai?

75
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,269
What are you doing in our house?

76
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,504
Are you trying to pull some tricks here?

77
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,974
Check out his gangster looks.

78
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,911
Look at his pineapple hairstyle
and his lifeless eyes.

79
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,646
You know he's not a good person.

80
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,348
Yes. Dad, Mom, let me tell you.

81
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,350
This person bullied me until I got sick.

82
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,718
Get him out of here now.

83
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,587
Oh, you jerk.

84
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,056
You're bullying our daughter, Shancai.

85
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,491
How dare you!

86
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,492
You have no manners!

87
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,828
Nobody taught you how to respect others?

88
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,863
Do you have a father? What's his name?

89
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,665
I'll call your dad about this.

90
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,933
My father's name is Daoming Cheng.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,034
What?

92
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,670
Your dad's name is embarrassing, right?

93
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,506
-Speak clearly. What's his name?
-We can't hear you!

94
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,743
My father's name is Daoming Cheng.

95
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,211
Daoming Cheng.

96
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,948
Daoming Cheng.

97
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,018
Dad, Mom, you're so embarrassing.
Why are you kneeling down?

98
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,022
We're not kneeling. Our legs gave way.

99
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,623
Why did your legs suddenly give way?

100
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,824
He's Daoming Cheng's...

101
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,928
That guy who owns
a telecommunications company.

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,096
Two television networks, right?

103
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,564
Three oil factories.

104
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,366
Four semiconductor firms.

105
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,037
One hundred seventy-six
international six-star chain hotels.

106
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:22,075
And 17,845 supermarket chains
that are open for 24 hours.

107
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,678
That Daoming Cheng?

108
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,379
-That Daoming Cheng?
-That Daoming Cheng?

109
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,248
-Is that right?
-Yes.

110
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,150
But my father is not in Taiwan right now.

111
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,252
So you might not be able
to contact him by phone.

112
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,155
-That's fine.
-Of course, your father is not in Taiwan.

113
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,556
He's so busy. How can he be in Taiwan?

114
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,259
-We're the only ones in Taiwan.
-We're the only ones in Taiwan.

115
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,795
Look. This is Mr. Daoming's son.

116
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,865
-Daoming Cheng's son is in our house.
-Comes to our house.

117
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,367
-How exactly...
-Our house...

118
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,403
Wait, let's...

119
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,539
-Let's think about this.
-Yes.

120
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,613
The way to treat our honored guest...

121
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,783
The way...

122
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,294
The way is not the universal way.

123
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,697
The way...

124
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,666
I think we should stop.

125
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,935
Our daughter doesn't look very happy.

126
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,436
Yes, let's...

127
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,372
What should we do then?

128
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,040
Let's make some tea.

129
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,975
Make some tea.

130
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,979
Young Master Daoming Si. Here, have some.

131
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,915
-Have some tea.
-Eat some fruits.

132
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,817
Please enjoy.

133
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,719
Hold this for me first. Here.

134
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,590
Mr. Daoming, this is my business card.

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,896
I'm very honored that you came
to our simple home.

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,700
Your house may be smaller
than our fish pond but it's quite cozy.

137
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,568
The fishes in your pond are all dead.

138
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,570
Shancai.

139
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,672
Fish pond? You're being too humble.

140
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,875
I think it's your swimming pool.

141
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,411
Swimming pool? Why are you so humble?

142
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,312
Don't just stand. Sit down.

143
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,815
Your legs would get sore
if you just stand. Drink some tea.

144
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,850
Have some fruits.

145
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,052
You're rarely here.

146
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,086
Come on.

147
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:18,291
Daoming Cheng's son is really different.

148
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:22,262
Look at that charisma.
And those bright eyes.

149
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,297
He's really the elite among elites.

150
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,099
The best among the best.

151
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,634
Right?

152
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,136
Looking at you, I'd think about

153
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,272
-England's Prince Charles.
-Prince Charles.

154
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:37,077
Can an elite like you stay and eat dinner
with ordinary citizens like us?

155
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,611
Dad, isn't that too much?

156
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,180
Why are you asking him
to eat at our house?

157
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,347
-Well...
-That's right.

158
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,017
He shouldn't just eat here.
He should spend the night over.

159
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,919
-What do you think?
-Mom, aren't you going overboard?

160
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,287
We're not close with him.

161
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,090
-We'll be close if he spends the night.
-We'll be close if he spends the night.

162
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,561
Well...

163
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,830
Why is this place so small?

164
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,598
Can anyone live here?

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,534
What exactly are you here for?

166
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,772
I heard you're sick so I paid you a visit.

167
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,375
They say only idiots get sick
in summer, okay?

168
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,978
Do you want me to punch you again?

169
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,381
Young Master Daoming Si, I'm sorry.

170
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,550
I didn't discipline my daughter well.

171
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,553
How can I let her hit people randomly?

172
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,523
I'm sorry. She doesn't know how
to respect and deal with people.

173
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,024
Here. Young Master Daoming Si.

174
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,427
I've also prepared dinner.

175
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,028
Here, please have a seat.

176
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,764
Mom, you hit me with a pan?

177
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,234
Yes. What else should I hit you with?

178
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,368
It's very oily.

179
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,737
You're getting a hot oil treatment
at the same time.

180
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,744
Mr. Daoming, please enjoy.

181
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,746
Our dishes are very simple.

182
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,414
I'm not sure if they'll suit your taste.

183
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,085
-What's this?
-Arden Lettuce.

184
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,887
Arden Lettuce.

185
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,958
I think your mother wouldn't cook
this kind of vegetable, right?

186
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,595
The chef is the one who cooks
at our humble home, not my mother.

187
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,464
"Humble home"?

188
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,435
Young Master Daoming Si.

189
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,838
Your mother is the Chairman's wife.

190
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,307
Of course, she wouldn't cook herself.

191
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,577
She must ask the maids to make sure
you get enough nutrition, right?

192
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,245
-That's right.
-No, you've misunderstood.

193
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,948
Mother is not the Chairman's wife,
she's also a Chairman herself.

194
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,550
Because she's always out of the country,

195
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,119
our butler's the one
who manages the maids.

196
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,556
-Butler.
-Who calls his own mom, "Mother"?

197
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,291
Are you stupid?

198
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,660
All right. I'll stop.

199
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,333
Do you need another butler?

200
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,669
Yes.

201
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,673
If the economy becomes bad,
it's going to be hard to find work.

202
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,042
Let's eat.

203
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,611
We can eat? Okay.

204
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,547
Eat slowly.

205
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,848
Eat some more.

206
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,283
Don't be shy.

207
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,256
-It's really a bit bland.
-It's good.

208
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,429
It's delicious.

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,299
<i>He's so well-mannered.</i>

210
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,735
<i>He's indeed a high-society heir.</i>

211
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,570
Even simple dishes are good, right?

212
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,974
Thank you for this wonderful dinner.

213
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,742
Though this house is smaller
than our fish pond.

214
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,211
And this table is not even half
of my bathtub.

215
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,212
I'm sure it is.

216
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,615
The dishes are only a tenth
of what they serve at my house

217
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,650
but they're really delicious. Thank you.

218
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,254
-You're done eating?
-Aren't you too shy?

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,521
I'm done.

220
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,024
Are you full?

221
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,092
Yes.

222
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,126
-Then...
-<i>Wow.</i>

223
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,328
<i>This guy is so well-mannered.</i>

224
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,596
<i>He's so polite.</i>

225
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,497
Go away.

226
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,668
You dared to do that to a girl?

227
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,270
You deserved it!

228
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,771
Who told you to be with such a tacky guy?

229
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:52,972
See how I'll deal with you two.

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,308
<i>I can't let him fool me.</i>

231
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,377
<i>He's a really bad person.</i>

232
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,913
<i>Young Master Daoming Si,
you're going home?</i>

233
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,016
<i>Shancai, walk him out.</i>

234
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,222
Why did you come to my house?

235
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,824
And you even pretended to be nice.

236
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,761
Pretend? I didn't pretend.

237
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,063
I really haven't tasted
those dishes before.

238
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,465
And they're really delicious.

239
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,335
Your house is so warm.

240
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,838
After my sister left,

241
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,776
I always eat alone at home.

242
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,080
<i>-Every family has its own problem indeed.</i>
-I had fun today.

243
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,749
<i>There are really some things
that money can't buy.</i>

244
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,785
<i>Like a family's warmth.</i>

245
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,289
Are you going to Hawaii?

246
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,392
I don't have any money.
Of course, I'm not going.

247
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,796
That's why I hate poor people.
They can't even afford NTD 50,000.

248
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,733
Never mind. I'll pay for you.

249
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,703
Why do you need to pay for me?
You're crazy.

250
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,039
And I'm going on a three-day cruise
around Taiwan.

251
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,674
Qinghe and I have already made plans.

252
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,378
You're going on a cruise
with nouveau riche?

253
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,081
That's right.
And I'm really looking forward to it.

254
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,050
You'll go to Hawaii.
I'll go around Taiwan.

255
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,186
We won't see each other
for at least a week.

256
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,821
I don't need to see your annoying face!

257
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,022
Goodbye.

258
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,330
Leave now.

259
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:34,907
<i>Meizuo.</i>

260
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,910
Tell the others that we won't go
to Hawaii anymore.

261
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:39,979
What?

262
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:40,980
What did you say?

263
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,250
Isn't it tacky to go
to Hawaii during spring time?

264
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,319
Let the other students go there.

265
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,488
Then where should we go?

266
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,657
Look at penguins in the South Pole
or go to Hokkaido to look at icebergs?

267
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,659
It's a secret.

268
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,162
Should we tell Lei?

269
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,730
Anyone can tell him.

270
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,066
I've already invited Jing anyway.

271
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,434
Will he not come?

272
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,137
Where exactly are we going?

273
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,344
It's the sea.

274
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,712
There are seagulls over there.

275
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,080
This is great!

276
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,949
Shancai, are you happy?

277
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,351
Of course, I am.

278
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,253
Since I entered Yingde,

279
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,756
I had to suppress my emotions
and be prepared to fight.

280
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,425
I have to be ready for war every day.

281
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,859
I wasn't in the mood to have fun.

282
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,262
I'm so happy right now.

283
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:33,866
Even the humid air feels so nice.

284
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,902
Shancai, look. It's the cruise.

285
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,303
We can go fishing at night.

286
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,071
How do we fish from up there?

287
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,407
We need to tell the captain
when we want to go fishing.

288
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,076
Then we'll ask him
to lower the boat a bit.

289
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,678
Then we can go fishing.

290
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,246
It's just quite dangerous to do that.

291
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,248
Is that true?

292
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,883
Of course, not.

293
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,052
Can't you tell I'm joking?

294
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,222
Your joke is not funny at all.

295
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,859
I'm still thankful
you brought me here, though.

296
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,294
This is great.

297
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:05,498
Our classmates from Yingde
should already be in Hawaii, right?

298
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,970
<i>I wonder how Huaze Lei is doing.</i>

299
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,673
<i>Is he still being singled out
by Daoming Si?</i>

300
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,679
That's weird. How come my dad
and the others are not here yet?

301
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,747
NORWEGIAN STAR

302
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,093
Why does that person look so familiar?

303
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,362
He looks like Daoming Si.

304
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,464
Daoming Si?

305
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,268
It's so hot.

306
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,238
That's right. Why did we come here?

307
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,073
It's humid and it's hot. How annoying.

308
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,077
Isn't that Shancai?

309
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,012
Why is she here?

310
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,348
Why is it her again?

311
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,649
How annoying.

312
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,992
What are you doing here?

313
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,426
Didn't you go to Hawaii?

314
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,530
Why would I want to go to a place
I've been to 100 times before?

315
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,000
I think it would be quite fun
to go on a boat.

316
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,302
-No way.
-You're kidding.

317
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,105
My dad rented this boat
to go on a pilgrimage around Taiwan.

318
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,074
Your dad just rented this boat.

319
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,343
I bought this boat.

320
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,345
It's mine, okay?

321
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,282
And let me also inform you.

322
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,817
I've already bought another boat

323
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,453
for the people in your hometown
to go on the pilgrimage.

324
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,323
They were so happy,
they forgot you were here.

325
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,459
By the way,

326
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,464
if you're not afraid to ruin our mood,
you can come aboard with us.

327
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,400
Who would want to join you?

328
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,805
Shancai, you two are here.
Let's board together.

329
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,075
There's no need. We won't join you.

330
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,143
Why?

331
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,179
Didn't you come here
to board a boat anyway?

332
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,982
And we'll have a party tonight.

333
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,350
You're welcome to join.

334
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,521
Join us.

335
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,556
Come on.

336
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,195
What? You're leaving me here alone.

337
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,564
People would laugh at me if I go home.

338
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,266
Wait. Please wait for me.

339
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,103
-Why are you still standing there?
-I thought you're leaving me.

340
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,205
How can I do that? Let's go.

341
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,577
NORWEGIAN STAR

342
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,587
It should be somewhere here, right?

343
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,457
It seems to be right ahead.

344
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,325
We're almost there.

345
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,493
Here. Room number 9001.

346
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,036
-The room is so big.
-It's huge.

347
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,974
Why is your room so big?

348
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,545
Then my room must be big too.
I'm going to check my room.

349
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,114
-Bye, see you later.
-Bye.

350
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,059
The sea is so big.

351
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,996
The air feels so nice.

352
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,269
-It really feels nice.
-Yes.

353
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,848
It's better to sit on Hawaii's beach
and watch girls while drinking, right?

354
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,253
Someone said he'll bring us
somewhere more fun than Hawaii.

355
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,022
If I only knew, I'd bring some girls here.

356
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,924
That's why I hate this place.

357
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,126
Lei, are you asleep?

358
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,930
Drink with Ah Si.

359
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,331
This place is already bad.

360
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,401
Isn't it even worse
with you two acting like this?

361
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,078
Let's drink next time.

362
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,548
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

363
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,083
Shancai.

364
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,555
Jing.

365
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,090
Why don't you sit with us?

366
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,826
It's fine. I'll just walk around
with Qinghe.

367
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,727
Okay.

368
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,663
Don't forget to join the party tonight.

369
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,733
What? I didn't bring
an outfit for that though.

370
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,569
She didn't bring one?
She doesn't have one.

371
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,237
That's right.

372
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,140
It's fine. I'll lend you my clothes.

373
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,575
There's no need.

374
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,243
That would be embarrassing.

375
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,746
It's okay.
It'd be more fun if there are more people.

376
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,414
But...

377
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,217
I'm going fishing
with Qinghe tonight, right?

378
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,118
What?

379
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:54,854
I see.

380
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,724
Hey, Mrs. Dong.

381
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,559
Shancai? Wait a moment.

382
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,662
Excuse me. I'll just take this call.

383
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,231
-It's fine.
-Hello.

384
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,766
Mom.

385
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,902
<i>Shancai, you have to grab
the opportunity with Qinghe.</i>

386
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,872
Stop saying weird things.

387
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,875
Let me tell you that Qinghe
and I aren't the only ones on the boat.

388
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,343
Our classmates are here too.

389
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,345
Do you want me to grab
the opportunity with all of them?

390
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,748
<i>Then is that Dao guy there?</i>

391
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,250
Yes. So, what?

392
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,751
<i>That's great.</i>

393
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:30,456
<i>I let you study in Yingde
so that you can become Cinderella.</i>

394
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,492
<i>That big fish is also there today.</i>

395
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,095
-<i>Catch it--</i>
-You're such a nag. I'm hanging up.

396
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,463
<i>I'll let your dad talk to you.</i>

397
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,597
<i>Shancai.</i>

398
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,065
<i>You caught a big fish?</i>

399
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,135
<i>Let me have more allowance, okay?</i>

400
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,070
What kind of parents are you?

401
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,540
My phone!

402
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,250
Cool.

403
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,019
She's got an attitude.

404
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,297
Your hair is so nice.
It's so straight and shiny.

405
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,634
Did Huaze Lei
and Daoming Si make up already?

406
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,137
I don't think so.

407
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,873
Ah Si's personality is more childish.

408
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,943
And he's overbearing sometimes.

409
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,146
We forced Lei to come here.

410
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,382
I hope they can make up here.

411
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,987
Your skin is so nice.

412
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,223
You'll look really pretty with make-up on.

413
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,593
I'll choose a cocktail dress
for you later.

414
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,896
Then I'll get you all glammed up
and surprise all of them.

415
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,395
Jing.

416
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,465
Isn't it inappropriate for me
to dress up like this?

417
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,568
How come? You look beautiful.

418
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,602
Really.

419
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,970
Let's go.

420
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,339
Folks.

421
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,874
Look.

422
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,377
What do you think?

423
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,678
She's beautiful, right?

424
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,781
Is that the poor girl Shancai
who's always in braids?

425
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,351
Jing. Why are you so nice to Shancai?

426
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,186
It's so infuriating.

427
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,788
That's right. What is she doing?

428
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,023
You look cute.

429
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,425
You look nice all dressed up.

430
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,665
<i>Everyone's attention is on me.</i>

431
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,934
<i>I'm just like the princess in fairy tales.</i>

432
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,506
Shancai.

433
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,178
You look really beautiful
dressed like this.

434
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,280
Thank you.

435
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,536
Shancai. May I have the honor
of dancing with you?

436
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,238
I don't know how to dance though.

437
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,773
It's fine. I can teach you.

438
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,636
Thank you.

439
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,614
Shancai, can I dance with you?

440
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,828
<i>This is a dream.</i>

441
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,663
<i>Like that of Cinderella's.</i>

442
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,801
<i>I just hope the bell won't ring
when the clock strikes at midnight.</i>

443
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,980
She's way out of line.

444
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,249
F4 is everyone's dream.

445
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,286
That girl didn't only dance
with Ximen and Meizuo.

446
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,488
Now, she's even dancing with Huaze Lei.

447
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,657
Stop it. I've had enough.

448
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,960
How can we let
that poor girl steal our spotlight?

449
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,662
Baihe, have another drink.

450
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,065
What are you planning?

451
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,719
Everyone, it's 11:59 p.m.

452
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,089
Let's play a special game
for 10 seconds, okay?

453
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:08,427
It's the exciting kissing game
in the dark.

454
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:13,065
Anyone can freely kiss
anyone they want in the dark.

455
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,500
Let's start now.

456
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,400
Begin.

457
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,304
-Who pushed me?
-Turn on the lights.

458
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,273
Where's Daoming Si?

459
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,508
What's going on?

460
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,675
What are you doing?

461
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,211
-Where's Daoming Si?
-Turn on the lights.

462
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,479
Where's Ximen?

463
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,918
How come it's you?

464
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,653
I thought it's Daoming Si.

465
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,455
Why did you come over here?

466
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,756
You were the one who grabbed me.

467
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,625
Where's the sea?

468
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,893
Shancai.

469
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,430
<i>I kissed Daoming Si.</i>

470
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,937
I didn't know who pushed me earlier.

471
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,205
Turns out it was you.

472
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,107
Shancai, that girl...

473
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,278
-Did you kiss Daoming Si?
-Shut up!

474
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,445
I don't want to hear it!

475
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,283
-You...
-What are you looking at?

476
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,684
She initiated it.

477
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,994
<i>I kissed a pig!</i>

478
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,108
That was your first kiss, right?

479
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:35,647
I never thought...

480
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:37,916
You never kissed anyone before.

481
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,788
And your first time is with me.

482
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,091
You were so daring.

483
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,894
You must be touched, right?

484
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:51,997
Do you want to set the mood a bit?

485
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,200
-Let's do it one more time.
-Don't come near me!

486
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,506
<i>I'm being punished by God.</i>

487
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,842
<i>It's all because I'm dressed up
in a way I shouldn't be</i>

488
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,743
<i>and forgot who I am.</i>

489
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,845
<i>I was even so excited
to come to such a place.</i>

490
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,946
<i>Cinderella?</i>

491
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,081
<i>A dream?</i>

492
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,716
<i>It's all just wishful thinking.</i>

493
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,517
<i>When the bell rang at midnight,</i>

494
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,952
<i>not only am I not a princess anymore,</i>

495
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,487
<i>I even kissed a pig!</i>

496
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:44,983
<i>Why am I blushing?</i>

497
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,488
Why are you two suddenly standing
so straight and blushing like tomatoes?

498
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,723
Because they kissed last night.

499
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,525
That's not true, is it?

500
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,227
Daoming Si.

501
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,663
I don't know. She suddenly ran towards me.

502
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,997
I'm really bothered by it.

503
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,701
How tacky.

504
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,770
Her strategy is really despicable.

505
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,807
Taking advantage of the mess,
that girl even made the first move.

506
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,876
That's right. She's so vulgar.

507
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,744
That's not what happened.

508
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,281
Someone tripped me last night.

509
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,949
He happened to be standing in front of me.

510
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,418
You don't have to explain to me.

511
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,953
It doesn't matter to me who you kiss.

512
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,722
You're even trying to reason out?

513
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,391
Lei, don't believe what this girl says.

514
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,827
She's very manipulative.

515
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,100
Where are you going?

516
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,868
<i>I'm really such a fool.</i>

517
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,804
<i>I thought Huaze Lei would come
to my rescue.</i>

518
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,705
That's right.

519
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:41,907
That's right.

520
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,986
Shancai.

521
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,155
Open the door.

522
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,227
What do you want? I want to sleep.

523
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:03,829
Are you all right?

524
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,597
I'm fine.

525
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,932
I'll go find you later.

526
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:08,767
Okay.

527
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,308
<i>Regardless of what happened,</i>

528
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,445
<i>Jing still gave me the Cinderella's dream.</i>

529
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,083
<i>I have to return the dress to her.
And formally thank her.</i>

530
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,985
Hey, Daoming Si!

531
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,453
You dare to bully Shancai.

532
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,021
Let's have a match.

533
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:15,700
This is what we'll compete for.

534
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:17,602
Holding our breath.

535
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,105
See who can hold
their breath longer underwater.

536
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,441
Do you dare to do that?

537
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,543
Are you ready?

538
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,912
We'll jump on the count of three.

539
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,951
-One.
-Get ready? Are you a kid?

540
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,739
You're very disappointed, right?

541
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,042
Why?

542
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,546
Because Shancai's not here.

543
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,748
Why do you care about her so much?

544
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,322
You really like her, right?

545
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,192
I realized it

546
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,363
when you had a fight with Daoming Si
that day because of her.

547
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,403
Actually, I'm a little bit jealous.

548
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,809
Because you're no longer the Lei
that only belongs to me.

549
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,988
When you were dancing with her last night,

550
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,358
that's how I felt too.

551
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,195
If you say so.

552
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,330
What else do you want to say?

553
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,966
"I think you two look good together"?

554
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,871
Lei.

555
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,506
Why are you smiling?

556
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,644
You know, you always say one thing
and do another.

557
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:09,381
You're always so nice
and takes care of everyone.

558
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,219
And you maintain
your heiress image very well.

559
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,056
Even if someone gets hurt
because of your inconsistent acts,

560
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,293
you don't care.

561
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,296
Lei.

562
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,465
I really didn't mean to do that.

563
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,634
Stop playing around with me.

564
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,870
You say I like Shancai.

565
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,339
Then let me tell you.

566
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,809
You're the one I like.

567
00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,531
<i>I can't move.</i>

568
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,667
<i>My last ounce of strength left me.</i>

569
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,703
<i>I became as heavy as this boat.</i>

570
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,906
Shancai.

571
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,474
Shancai your face!

572
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,543
Why am I here?

573
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,345
You fainted underwater
in less than three seconds.

574
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,314
Bro, you can't even swim
and you dared to compete with me?

575
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,949
That doesn't count. Let's do it again.

576
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,585
You do it yourself. I'm hungry.
I want to eat something.

577
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,558
Daoming Si, wait for me. Daoming Si!

578
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,534
Daoming Si, I lost to you on that one.
Let's compete for something else.

579
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,902
Are you sure I'll lose to you?

580
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,305
We can arm wrestle or run a race.

581
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,173
Let me find something to eat first, okay?

582
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,708
Stop nagging.

583
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,977
All right. I'm hungry too.

584
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,552
Why is there only wine?

585
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,855
Why there is no food in here?

586
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,023
The kitchen.

587
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,958
Let's go to the kitchen.

588
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,101
Why is there nothing here?

589
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,505
Can't you ask the chef to cook for you?

590
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,073
That's boring.

591
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,875
I want to see
if I can make some food on my own.

592
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,515
By the way, I brought fishing rods.
We can go fishing.

593
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,816
I'm really good at it.

594
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,751
We're so high up. How can we go fishing?

595
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,087
We can take a small boat and go.

596
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,522
Hey.

597
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,458
That's a good idea.

598
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,210
What should we do now?

599
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,647
This was your great idea.

600
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,417
How would I know
that there's no fire in the kitchen?

601
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,788
I got stung.

602
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,890
Why are you complaining
about a wound so small?

603
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,358
Shancai is braver than you.

604
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,961
You're saying this like you know her
really well.

605
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,029
Of course I do.

606
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,765
Shancai and I have been classmates
from primary school to junior high school.

607
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:18,036
And the Shancai I know
would never let anyone bully her.

608
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,905
And she won't allow her classmates
to be bullied too.

609
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,342
When we were in junior high,
she was bullied because of our classmate.

610
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,646
And those people even got a local gangster
and they beat her up so badly.

611
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,515
She didn't even cry.

612
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,351
That's how she spent her years
in junior high.

613
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,186
I heard it was the same for senior high.

614
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,690
Can you still find that local gangster?

615
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,359
Who knows where they are now?

616
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,132
She's really a cheerful and strong girl.

617
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,700
She's nice to everyone.

618
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,303
That's why she has a lot
of friends around her.

619
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,074
I don't like to drink
the milk from our school meals.

620
00:37:56,708 --> 00:38:00,011
She'll always drink it for me,
even though she gets diarrhea every time.

621
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,281
So you know how important I am to her.

622
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,619
I think she just likes to drink it
because she's poor.

623
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,254
Of course, not.

624
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,589
She's a thoughtful and considerate girl.

625
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,225
Do you like Shancai?

626
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,861
No.

627
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:21,166
It's a shame though.
That girl likes me now.

628
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,700
You're lying.

629
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,636
Who says I'm lying?

630
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,405
You saw it at the party last night.

631
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,840
She came over to kiss me.

632
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,176
And she even held me really tight.

633
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,812
Her lips were so soft.

634
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,180
You're lying.

635
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,216
How dare you throw ice at me?

636
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,619
You're lying. You're a liar!

637
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:44,956
Don't run!

638
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,591
Don't run!

639
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,626
Come over here!

640
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,965
<i>-Shut up!
-Get your hands off me!</i>

641
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,033
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

642
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,201
<i>Get lost!</i>

643
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,669
Get your hands off her!

644
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,870
Huaze Lei.

645
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,174
I said get your hands off her.

646
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,478
I'm sorry I said those things earlier.

647
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,447
Because I was just...

648
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,448
It doesn't matter.

649
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,485
I'm not interested
in other people's business.

650
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,188
When your tears are about to fall,

651
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:19,324
you can do a handstand

652
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:25,330
to stop them from flowing.

653
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,133
<i>Did you get it?</i>

654
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,670
It's really beautiful though.

655
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:45,750
You say I like Shancai.

656
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,751
Then let me tell you.

657
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:48,920
You're the one I like.

658
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,779
Don't run!

659
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,381
-Shancai!
-Don't run!

660
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,082
Shancai, help! Shancai.

661
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,417
Shancai.

662
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,719
Daoming Si keeps chasing me.

663
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,721
Why is Daoming Si chasing you?

664
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,257
We caught a lot of fish, but this guy...

665
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,725
Who are you calling "this guy"?

666
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,793
Cut it out.

667
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,361
Why did you two go fishing?

668
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,830
We're hungry and he didn't
want to ask the chef to cook for us.

669
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,132
So we can only go fishing.

670
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,133
Daoming Si.

671
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,812
You disgusting guy!

672
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,114
You must be thinking about
kissing Shancai again, right?

673
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,617
What? Who do you call a disgusting guy?
Who's disgusting?

674
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,253
-Don't run!
-<i>How nice.</i>

675
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,190
<i>At a night like this,
it's a good thing that I'm not alone</i>

676
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,292
<i>to continue thinking about sad things.</i>

677
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,729
<i>Though that jerk Daoming Si
was the one who barged in here,</i>

678
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,398
<i>it feels a bit different from usual.</i>

679
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,467
Go away! It hurts!

680
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,702
Cut it out!

681
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,304
Stop hurting him!

682
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,974
What are you two idiots doing?

683
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,342
Stop it.

684
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,246
What's the matter, Lei?

685
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,451
What? Don't you mind at all?

686
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,120
Lei.

687
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,456
I really don't mind.

688
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,258
In fact, I'm so happy right now.

689
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,230
This means I'm very important to you.

690
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,868
I forget that Lei's a boy, too.

691
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,070
No.

692
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,139
This is not what I want.

693
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,309
Don't worry.

694
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:55,313
Sometimes, you need
to let things happen naturally.

695
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,214
No.

696
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,282
I don't want this.

697
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,325
Jing.

698
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,460
I didn't know you're all here.

699
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,762
Get down and grab something to eat.

700
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,150
Ximen, get up.

701
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:36,087
Meizuo, get up. Hurry up, get down
and grab yourself something to eat.

702
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,823
Qianhui.

703
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,659
Get up.

704
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,599
Hurry up, let's eat.

705
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,568
Ah Si.

706
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:53,171
Is this some kind of joke?
What are you thinking?

707
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,507
Look at what you're wearing.

708
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,309
Go ahead and eat my sashimi.

709
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,710
I caught the fish myself.

710
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,079
Sashimi.

711
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,713
Oh, my gosh.

712
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,349
There must be something else
you could do, right?

713
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,819
That's why I hate virgins the most.

714
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,221
What? Daoming Si's still a virgin?

715
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:15,927
You talk too much.

716
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,829
How can I do those things
with a girl I don't like?

717
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,363
You annoying jerks.

718
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,433
Grab a chair and sit with us.

719
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,368
-Okay.
-Yeah.

720
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,870
Give me the chopsticks.

721
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,543
Since we're all here,
I'll give you a riddle, okay?

722
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,045
-What riddle?
-Okay.

723
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:41,352
-The riddle is "kiss".
-Pass the chopsticks over here.

724
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,955
-"Kiss"?
-Guess a location.

725
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,123
-A location?
-Yeah.

726
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,424
A location for the kiss?

727
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:47,892
What else?

728
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,794
You'd better be careful with your answer.

729
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,662
Do you already know the answer?

730
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,164
No, I don't.

731
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,466
Has anyone guessed it yet?
I'll tell you the answer now.

732
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,902
The answer is "Jiji" train station.

733
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,337
It's so funny, right?

734
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,206
Because you'll make "Jiji" sounds
when you kiss.

735
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,941
Isn't it funny?

736
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,010
Your joke is so lame.

737
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,202
