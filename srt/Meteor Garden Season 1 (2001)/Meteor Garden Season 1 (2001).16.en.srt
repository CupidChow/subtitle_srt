1
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,022
I'm so happy today.

2
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,991
Shopping can really make you happy.

3
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,226
I think you're the only one who's happy.

4
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,697
And you're from a rich family.
What pressure could you have?

5
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,333
How could I not have any?
I have to learn a lot of skills at home.

6
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,335
And school is really boring.

7
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,236
But things are better now
since I now love someone.

8
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,038
I really feel that I'm in love.

9
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,506
Really?

10
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,444
I'm thinking,
if I can conquer that arrogant man,

11
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,512
I'll have the sense of accomplishment
as a woman.

12
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,247
I see.

13
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,583
Hey, Shancai, how about you?
Are you in love with anyone?

14
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,786
It's not Daoming Si, right?

15
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,189
No, I don't like him.

16
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,323
That's great.

17
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,225
So are you in love with someone?

18
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,560
Not right now.

19
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,062
"Not right now."
It means you loved someone in the past.

20
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,965
What kind of person is he?

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,234
He...

22
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,902
He's quiet.

23
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,571
A little dumb.

24
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,807
Dumb? You have a weird taste.

25
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,743
You're the one who has a weird taste.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,646
Actually, he's not really dull.

27
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:30,083
I should say that when we were together,
I would become dumb.

28
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,489
I think that's because you were
comfortable and relaxed with him.

29
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,224
I think it's pretty important.

30
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,225
Is it?

31
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,260
Shancai, cheer up.

32
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,429
You can surely find a boy
who's better than him.

33
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,065
If I'm a boy,
I'd surely like a girl like you.

34
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,667
Thank you.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,303
If you were a boy,
would you love a girl like me?

36
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,008
Why are you reacting like that?

37
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,978
I was joking. Don't get upset.

38
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,247
I'm joking, too. This is for you.

39
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,149
Thank you for shopping with me today.
Bye-bye.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,718
This is that dress earlier.

41
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,687
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

42
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,622
It's okay.

43
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,524
I think that dress would suit you well.

44
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,125
You'll be so beautiful in it.

45
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,494
I really want to be friends with you.

46
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,096
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

47
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,591
Come with me for a while.

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,633
So I'm telling you.

49
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,336
Nothing happened that night.

50
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,338
I won't see her ever again.

51
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,574
Didn't I tell you?

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,509
I'll make the decisions in my life.

53
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,344
I won't let my mom interfere
with my decisions.

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,981
Are you listening to me?

55
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,416
Yes.

56
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,952
Then why do you have that expression
on your face?

57
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,254
I've already explained it to you.
Can you pretend to be happier?

58
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,195
I really don't know what to do with you.

59
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,097
The weather suddenly changes
from hot to cold lately.

60
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,266
Especially at night.
Can't you wear more clothes?

61
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:28,735
Here.

62
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,617
I'm fine. Take it back.

63
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,952
Are you crazy? Put it on.

64
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,822
I said I'm fine. Take it back.
Don't mind me!

65
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,090
What's the matter with you?

66
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,691
Are you not feeling well?

67
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,763
Hey!

68
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,639
I've been with Xiaozi the whole day today.

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,974
And we're best friends now.

70
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,743
Why were you with her?

71
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,180
Initially, I thought
she's very overbearing.

72
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,650
However, I think she's quite nice
and thoughtful.

73
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,153
And she's tall, very elegant,
and has a great figure.

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,822
She's quite an attractive woman.

75
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,525
What's this?

76
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,928
Xiaozi gave it to me.

77
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,463
What does this mean?

78
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,666
She bought you with this?

79
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,901
Can't I buy clothes for you
if you want them?

80
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,870
Why are you taking her gift
and speaking on her behalf?

81
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,405
Don't use this to make a fuss, okay?

82
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,940
That dress is not the point.

83
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,576
The point is, I think Xiaozi really wants
to have a relationship with you.

84
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,711
And she really puts importance
on your marriage arrangement.

85
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,580
-Aside from that...
-Aside from that, what?

86
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,549
Aside from that,
your family backgrounds are similar.

87
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,151
Your mom likes her, too.

88
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,652
I also think you're quite a match.

89
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,154
Just date her.

90
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,689
Don't talk.

91
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,325
Do you know your feelings
make me feel very pressured?

92
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,160
And it's impossible for me to be with you.

93
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,429
Xiaozi's qualifications are excellent.
Just date her.

94
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,496
Don't come to me again--

95
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,915
<i>I hate violent guys the most.</i>

96
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,051
<i>However, I always make
the situation worse.</i>

97
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,654
<i>I always make him
want to use violence on me.</i>

98
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,491
<i>This is what happens every time.</i>

99
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,126
<i>The situation is always the same.</i>

100
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,764
<i>Even God is telling us not
to mess around anymore.</i>

101
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,804
Now that things turned out this way,

102
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,205
is it time for us to get involved?

103
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,209
Though I don't like that type of girl,

104
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,344
I have no choice.

105
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,013
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

106
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,483
We're saying we need to pursue
that He Yuanzi

107
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,884
so that she won't bother Ah Si.

108
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,186
Have you been listening to us?

109
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,654
Even though you weren't there today,

110
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,956
we already told you what happened earlier.

111
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,958
It seems like that fiancée
that Ah Si's mom has found

112
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,260
already accepted the marriage arrangement.

113
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,764
And Ah Si and Shancai also had some
misunderstandings because of her.

114
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,267
Should we get involved
and help Ah Si resolve this?

115
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,937
So that's what you're talking about.

116
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,506
You'll help, right?

117
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,210
If the three of us pursue her,
surely one of us can attract her.

118
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:31,644
No way.

119
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,415
This is her family's problem.

120
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,018
If we get involved,

121
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,487
I'm afraid it would only make things
more complicated.

122
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,123
Our objective is to actually
make things more complicated.

123
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,495
Ah Si, what's the matter?

124
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,929
Why are you soaked?

125
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,531
Did something happen?

126
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,233
Why do you have that expression
on your face?

127
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,837
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si.

128
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,773
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si.

129
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,541
-Ah Si.
-Ah Si!

130
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,055
<i>I hit her again.</i>

131
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,428
<i>Maybe we've really reached
the end of the road this time.</i>

132
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,769
<i>Xiaozi's qualifications are excellent.
Just date her.</i>

133
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:30,937
Don't come to me again--

134
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,190
This monkey is really as energetic
as her nickname.

135
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,392
We went to the theme park.

136
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,895
I almost vomited after riding
the roller coaster so many times.

137
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,897
Then we went shopping at the mall.

138
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,032
Now she wants to go to the movies.

139
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
I'm so tired.

140
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,036
Shopping for jewelry is already so tiring,
and she even asked me to buy bras with her

141
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,605
and buy sanitary pads
from the supermarket.

142
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,107
And she bought a lot of them.
This is so embarrassing!

143
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,142
How about me?

144
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,409
I'm Ximen.

145
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,111
Have you ever seen me carry these things?

146
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,013
Hey, what are you whining about?

147
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,515
Are you saying bad things behind my back?

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,751
We were discussing about which movie
you might like to watch.

149
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,786
There's no need to discuss.
I've already made a decision.

150
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,421
Let's watch
<i>The Widow of Saint Pierre</i>, okay?

151
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,224
-Okay.
-Okay, I'll go buy the tickets.

152
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,133
Thank you.

153
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,114
I got the tickets.
It's 20 minutes until showtime.

154
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,951
Though this movie is quite good,
I think you're both really tired now.

155
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,686
You might fall asleep
while watching melodramas.

156
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,987
Let's watch an action film instead.

157
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:34,327
Ximen, based on what Xiaozi said,
let's watch the one you wanted to watch.

158
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,397
-<i>Driven</i>?
-Yes.

159
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,599
-Are you okay with that, Xiaozi?
-Okay.

160
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,669
-I'll go buy the tickets then.
-Okay.

161
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,143
Turns out you want to watch this movie.

162
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,212
It's good. It's quite nice.

163
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,248
You know, I haven't gone out
to watch movies in a while.

164
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,750
Because my dad said that
since I like watching movies,

165
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,086
he would set up a home theater for me.

166
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,354
He told me not to go out so often.

167
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,290
Watching movies in theaters outside
has its own pleasure, though.

168
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,260
That's right. For example, I can
eat ice cream while watching movies.

169
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,328
That's awesome.

170
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,796
You want to eat ice cream?

171
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,865
-I'll go buy it.
-Okay.

172
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,434
Wait.

173
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,804
Do you need me to hold them for you?

174
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:19,906
Never mind.

175
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,355
-I got the tickets.
-Okay.

176
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,190
Where's Meizuo?

177
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,025
He went to buy ice cream.
He'll be back soon.

178
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,995
Where are all the stuff?

179
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,563
He brought them with him.

180
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,698
He brought all the things with him to...

181
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,402
-Please hold this for me.
-It's okay.

182
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,944
It's chocolate? I forgot to tell you
that I only eat vanilla.

183
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,312
I'm allergic to chocolate.

184
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,481
You can eat it yourself.

185
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,289
Miss.

186
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,692
I couldn't resist but buy you ice cream.

187
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,595
Because you're just too cute.

188
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,729
Really?

189
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,664
Yes.

190
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,399
Oh, thank you.

191
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,337
I realize you're quite good with girls.

192
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,938
It's such an honor to be with you.

193
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,642
As long as you're happy,
we're very willing to be with you.

194
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,412
Really? Don't you feel bored?

195
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,748
I decide everything from where
we're going and what we're eating.

196
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,016
No.

197
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,252
We're happier that we can please
a beautiful girl.

198
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,088
Even though we're a bit tired,
it's all worth it.

199
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,557
You're such a gentleman.
It makes me feel embarrassed.

200
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,592
Then if I say I don't want to watch
a movie anymore,

201
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,927
you won't get mad, right?

202
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,764
No, of course not.

203
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,399
Why would we get mad, right?

204
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,968
-Then what do you want to do?
-I want to look for Shancai.

205
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,437
Shancai?

206
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
Sure. I think she's working right now.

207
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,241
-Let's go then.
-Sure.

208
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,214
Welcome.

209
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,349
Hi.

210
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,085
We're here.

211
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,420
Hello.

212
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,822
Why are you all here?

213
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,857
And why did the three
of you come together?

214
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,226
We were on a date earlier.

215
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,099
A date?

216
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,967
The three of you?

217
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,036
Why is it the three of you?

218
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,672
They picked me up from my school today
to take me out.

219
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,973
So I came out with them.

220
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,909
We went to the theme park
and to the coffee shop for some tea.

221
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,278
Then we walked around two
department stores in the East District.

222
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,880
Then we went to the cinema
to watch a movie.

223
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,449
We couldn't pick a film, though,
so we came over to see you.

224
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,517
Shancai.

225
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,053
We were with Xiaozi the whole day.

226
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,721
You know what?

227
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,056
Aside from shopping,

228
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,792
I rode the roller coaster
with her five times.

229
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,394
I almost vomited.

230
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:55,962
I sincerely made an effort, right?

231
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,397
But why?

232
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,998
Why did you do that?

233
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,500
At first, I also thought it was strange.

234
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,336
In the end, I realized they wanted me
to give up on Ah Si.

235
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,104
That's why they asked me out on a date.

236
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,105
What?

237
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,306
Why?

238
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,575
-You got us.
-You got us.

239
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,444
Don't think too lowly of me.

240
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,380
I caught on to what you're planning
a long time ago.

241
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,250
It's a shame you both are not my types.

242
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,018
You did those things on purpose.

243
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,953
You gave us a hard time earlier.

244
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:25,391
You didn't want to watch the movies,
though we've already bought the tickets.

245
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,859
Who told you to have bad intentions?

246
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,030
Miss, our motives might not be
that honorable,

247
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,899
but we don't have any bad intentions.

248
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:33,800
That's right.

249
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,103
Having two more choices
is not bad for you.

250
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,674
All right. Even so,
I would still choose my fiancé, Ah Si.

251
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,744
Because you two have poor stamina,
and always say yes to girls.

252
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,078
It's so boring.

253
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,180
Boring?

254
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,415
You said I'm boring?

255
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,484
No girl has ever said I have poor stamina.

256
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,419
Shancai, aren't these two guys boring?

257
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,855
They think I'm that kind of girl
who doesn't have a mind of her own.

258
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,590
They think I'm not sincere about Ah Si.

259
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:01,194
That's why they thought of such
a stupid way to test my feelings.

260
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,297
If you want to separate me and Ah Si,
I won't let you succeed.

261
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,267
Give the things we bought to the girls
who won't say no to you.

262
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,735
Thank you for taking me out today.

263
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,337
I'll contact you again. Bye.

264
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,508
Shancai.

265
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,677
She's Daoming Si's fiancée?

266
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,589
Xiaoyou.

267
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,924
If you don't mind,

268
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,860
you can have those things.

269
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,529
There are a lot of sanitary napkins
over there. Enjoy.

270
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,197
I don't know if you use them.

271
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,266
Hey.

272
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,134
Why did you...

273
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,071
What do you think?

274
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,339
Let's go.

275
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,523
Mrs. Daoming.

276
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,228
You're here.

277
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,431
Yes. Why were you looking for me?

278
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,367
Nothing.

279
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,738
I didn't have a chance to chat with you
when I came back this time.

280
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,240
So I especially asked you to come over.

281
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,710
Zhuang bought a batch of good wine
last time.

282
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,879
I was just worrying I have no one
to enjoy it with.

283
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,381
Come. Drink with me.

284
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,782
Here, have a seat.

285
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,995
So, how are you this year?

286
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,930
Not bad.

287
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,733
Here, the wine is already ripe.

288
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,841
This is good wine.

289
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,279
Lei.

290
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,983
I watched you and Ah Si grow up together.

291
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,921
Yes, you took care of me
since I was little.

292
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,222
I'm very grateful.

293
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,059
I watched you grow up.

294
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,796
And I also know about the relationship
between you and Teng Tangjing.

295
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,701
I came back from Paris this time.

296
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,904
Before I returned, I met with Jing.

297
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,239
She told me

298
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,342
that she might not come back anymore.

299
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,712
I think you know

300
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,482
that Jing is a very opinionated girl.

301
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,219
She has clear plans for her future.

302
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,955
Otherwise, you wouldn't have left Paris
by yourself.

303
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,760
Mrs. Daoming, why are you suddenly
mentioning Jing now?

304
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,630
Is there something wrong with that?

305
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,967
Could it be that Jing's position
has been replaced in your heart?

306
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,802
I don't understand what you mean.

307
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,273
Actually, I know a little

308
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,509
about Shancai's feelings towards you.

309
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,011
I think you've misunderstood.

310
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,780
Ah Si is the one Shancai likes.

311
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,853
That's what I'm most worried
about with you youngsters.

312
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,088
You're smart.

313
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,326
Of course, you know
that Shancai only had feelings for Ah Si

314
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,162
because she couldn't make you like her.

315
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,433
Of course, we can't really
blame anyone for that.

316
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,068
However, Lei,

317
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,770
have you ever thought

318
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,340
that Ah Si has always been unreasonable
when he was a kid?

319
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,676
And he's very possessive.

320
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,778
Do you still remember?

321
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,113
He liked to snatch your toys away
the most when he was little.

322
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,716
If he said he must have them,
then he would have them.

323
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,252
Once he got them, though,

324
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,387
he'd throw them on the side
after a few days.

325
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,589
Ah Si was just naughty when he was little.

326
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,493
I hope it's just like you said,

327
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,896
that he was just being naughty
when he was little.

328
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,199
What I'm worried about now, though,

329
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,868
is that Shancai is just like
your toy back then.

330
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,837
Ah Si likes it

331
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,305
and must have it.

332
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,441
He's always been unpredictable.

333
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,042
And he doesn't know
how to treasure things.

334
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,712
I'm really worried that Shancai
would get hurt in the future.

335
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,181
Once he gets Shancai,

336
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,284
maybe that's the beginning
of her being cast side.

337
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,186
I don't think so.

338
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,522
That would be best, of course.

339
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,325
Or else Shancai would really
be so pitiful.

340
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,627
In order to let go
of her feelings for you,

341
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,763
she accepted Ah Si's pursuits.

342
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,199
If she gets dumped by Ah Si
because of that,

343
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,000
it would be too cruel for her.

344
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,971
By the way, Lei,

345
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:44,376
I heard that your father's
Huaze Assets Insurance

346
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,179
is facing a very big loss

347
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,749
because of lost profits
from enterprise investments lately.

348
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,550
Do you know about this?

349
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,752
I'm not too sure.

350
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,589
I was thinking

351
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,625
that your father's current loss
is very serious.

352
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,128
If this continues,

353
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,664
the Huaze Enterprise might not
be able to get back on its feet.

354
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,002
I really don't want that to happen.

355
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,939
That's why I was thinking

356
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,442
that may be able to help...

357
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,914
as long as you're willing to be
with Shancai again.

358
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,585
Mrs. Daoming, don't you think doing so
is not quite decent?

359
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,922
I run such a huge enterprise.

360
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,625
It's impossible to do everything decently.

361
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,161
Are you willing to just watch your father

362
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,063
encounter such a serious problem
and do nothing?

363
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,966
My father would take responsibility
for his own career.

364
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,837
Are you willing to see Huaze Enterprise
go bankrupt?

365
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:45,905
Thank you.

366
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,606
My father has his way to resolve things.

367
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,944
Then aren't you worried that Shancai
would get dumped by Ah Si someday?

368
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,078
Mrs. Daoming.

369
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,314
Regarding this, I have more faith
in your son than you.

370
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,084
Toys and lovers are different.

371
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,356
It seems you're all very stubborn.

372
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,260
Mrs. Daoming, let me tell you clearly.

373
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,862
Regarding Shancai,

374
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,865
I'll be the good friend
who will protect her my whole life.

375
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,535
And I want to tell you one thing.

376
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,138
Ah Si is definitely the type of person

377
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,208
that rebels more intensely

378
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,076
the more you pressure

379
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,978
and force him.

380
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,179
So,

381
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,982
if you try really hard to separate them,

382
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,886
it might only cause Ah Si to hate you,
and make things even worse.

383
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,989
Why would you do that?

384
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,291
I've said my piece.

385
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,759
Mrs. Daoming.

386
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,062
I'll go ahead.

387
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,697
Thank you for today.

388
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,575
Mrs. Daoming, let me tell you again.

389
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,178
I'll be the good friend
who will protect Shancai my whole life.

390
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,946
I won't let her get hurt.

391
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,366
Xiaozi?

392
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,770
What's the matter?
Why are you crouching over here?

393
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:29,408
What happened?

394
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,610
Do you want to go shopping again?

395
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,179
It's already so late.
The stores are closed now.

396
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,615
Xiaozi.

397
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,019
Ah Si... Ah Si wants
to officially date me.

398
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,521
I'm so excited that I couldn't sit still.

399
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,758
<i>I saw Ah Si by our street
when I went home today.</i>

400
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,103
Why are you here?

401
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,539
Xiaozi.

402
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,042
Let's date officially.

403
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,546
I'll try hard to like you.

404
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,085
Didn't you say it's fine to be in love?

405
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,921
I'll work hard to like you.

406
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,494
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

407
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,263
He said he'll try to like me.

408
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,798
He'll try to like me.

409
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,266
I'm so happy.

410
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,101
I'm so happy that I'm becoming
so ridiculous.

411
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,970
I was so happy I just couldn't calm down.

412
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,538
Shancai.

413
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:36,075
I never thought I'd lose myself
when I like someone.

414
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,010
I don't feel like myself anymore.

415
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,082
Congratulations.

416
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,125
I can't believe it.

417
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,127
Do you really want to date her?

418
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,529
You're going to accept your mom's plans?

419
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,164
That's so strange.

420
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,501
Did I ask for your opinion?

421
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,337
And I've already made my decision.

422
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,706
Daoming Si!

423
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,241
Is it true?

424
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,477
Nouveau riche.
What are you shouting about?

425
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,845
You really have no class.

426
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,581
-Let's go.
-Wait, let me ask you a question.

427
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,783
Our classmates all say that you
have a fiancée. Is that true?

428
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,686
So what if it is?

429
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,187
So, it's true.

430
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,789
Then you've finally given up on Shancai.

431
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,091
That's great. Daoming Si, congratulations!

432
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,129
What's the matter?
I'm sincerely congratulating him.

433
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,531
Since you already have a fiancée,

434
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,466
I'll ask Shancai out when I get back.

435
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,834
And you won't get mad at me anymore.

436
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,036
Cut the crap.

437
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,505
-Daoming Si!
-Nouveau riche.

438
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,307
Try to speak more crap and you'll see.

439
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,619
<i>Qinghe congratulated me.</i>

440
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,021
<i>He's right.</i>

441
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,425
<i>Shancai and I will go our separate ways
from now on.</i>

442
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,795
<i>Everything is over.</i>

443
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,097
<i>Everything...</i>

444
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,133
<i>is all in the past.</i>

445
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,424
Daoming Si, over here.

446
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,195
-Sir, table for one?
-No, I'm looking for someone.

447
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,129
This way, please.

448
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,432
Am I late?

449
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,268
No, I was afraid I'll be late
so I came early.

450
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,637
Do you want anything to drink?

451
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,005
One cappuccino.

452
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,042
Hey, we ordered the same thing.
I really like cappuccino, too.

453
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,810
I also ordered a cheesecake.

454
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,480
Their cheesecakes are really good.
Do you also want to order one?

455
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,682
I'll have royal milk tea instead.

456
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,424
This is our first date
so I prepared a small gift for you.

457
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,263
Well, I didn't prepare anything.

458
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,966
It's okay. There's no hard rule
about exchanging gifts.

459
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,235
I just wanted to give one to you.
I hope you like it.

460
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,303
Thank you.

461
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,440
Do you want to open it
and see if you like it?

462
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,575
I'll open it at home.

463
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,982
You know, when I was choosing
the gift for you yesterday,

464
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,717
I wondered about the kind
of person you are

465
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,152
and the kind of things you would like.

466
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,020
You know, I was so troubled.

467
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,892
You're so quiet today.

468
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,666
Thank you.

469
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,844
The cappuccino smells so good.
Do you want to try it?

470
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,045
It's really good.

471
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,781
No, it's yours.

472
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,883
-It's not good to do so.
-It's fine. I don't mind.

473
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,518
If it was other people, I would mind,

474
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:07,986
but you're my boyfriend.

475
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,122
I don't want to drink it now, though.

476
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,925
It's okay. You can take a sip.
It's really good.

477
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,293
I said I don't want to.

478
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,599
Have you ever thought about
knowing more about me?

479
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,102
Like my zodiac sign, blood type,
and see if we're a match?

480
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,572
I'm not interested in zodiac signs
or blood types.

481
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,708
Zodiac signs are just for reference.

482
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,812
I know who I'm compatible with.
Why should I let others tell me?

483
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:35,914
Why should I let others control me?

484
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,184
Zodiac signs and qualifications
are all nonsense.

485
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,955
Actually, I don't really believe
these things, too.

486
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,257
I just wanted to find something
to talk about.

487
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,260
Never mind. I don't want
to have a drink anymore. I'm leaving.

488
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,972
Ah Si, wait.

489
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,909
Why are you walking so fast?
You're not... You're not in a race.

490
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,678
Daoming Si!

491
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,380
You're so noisy!

492
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,482
I hate it when people walk slowly!

493
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,750
Is this what you call a date?

494
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,186
How is this different from
when we weren't together before?

495
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,055
I was so looking forward to this date
with you yesterday.

496
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,092
I woke up really early to prepare
and even chose a gift for you.

497
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,462
After we met, though,
you won't even look at me.

498
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,397
You also don't want to talk to me.

499
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,333
You even left the gift I gave you
on the table.

500
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,003
I don't know why we're even together.

501
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,072
If this is what you call
officially dating,

502
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,075
then it's really disappointing.

503
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,547
Okay, fine.

504
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,150
What do you want me to do then?

505
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,521
Stand beside me first.

506
00:29:58,864 --> 00:29:59,831
And then?

507
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,101
Then match my steps.
You can't walk ahead by yourself.

508
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,069
Smile and chat with me.

509
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,937
Why is it so troublesome?
Don't keep holding my arm.

510
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,739
So what? We're a couple.

511
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,940
-I...
-You know what?

512
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,576
I'm still so happy about what you
told me that day.

513
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,579
I'm really glad that you said
you'd try to like me.

514
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,382
But now I'm suspecting...

515
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:19,851
What are you suspecting?

516
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,989
How would I know if you were just being
impulsive when you said those things?

517
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,859
You're so troublesome.
I told you I'd work hard on it.

518
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,095
And this is not something that can
happen in one or two days.

519
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,430
Then when will it happen?

520
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,898
How would I know?

521
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,166
I don't care. You have to know.

522
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,968
I like you. I clearly know that.

523
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,205
So if you like me,
it has to be clear, too.

524
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,208
Why are you so overbearing?

525
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,576
I'm not as overbearing as you.

526
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,745
If I say you're overbearing, you are.
There's no negotiation.

527
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,246
All right. I'm overbearing then.

528
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:11,837
And then?

529
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,139
Did they get along?

530
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,007
Yes.

531
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,910
Though Miss Xiaozi is the one
who's always initiating now,

532
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,681
she and Young Master meets
around two or three times a week.

533
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,853
It seems Ah Si
has finally realized things.

534
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:31,323
What about that poor girl Shancai?

535
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,593
Well, aside from school,

536
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,595
she doesn't have much contact
with Young Master.

537
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,165
However, Miss Xiaozi often visits her.

538
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,602
Xiaozi often visits Shancai?

539
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,271
What's going on?

540
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,775
I think Miss Xiaozi is too naive.

541
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,244
She will tell Shancai everything
that's happening

542
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,578
between her and Young Master.

543
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,116
Why are there so many tricks
up that poor girl's sleeves?

544
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,787
I think she must have not given up
on Ah Si yet.

545
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,430
Hey, Shancai. Where are you?

546
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,666
You're still at home?
Come out quickly, okay?

547
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,401
I have so many things to tell you.

548
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,936
All right. See you later, bye.

549
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,115
<i>I thought at first that I can start over.</i>

550
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:34,719
<i>However, I don't know why
I became Xiaozi's love consultant.</i>

551
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,822
<i>Why did it turn out this way?</i>

552
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,423
Then we left...

553
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,926
Shancai, are you listening to me?

554
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:41,927
Yes.

555
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,529
Then we went to a very romantic park.

556
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,698
Usually, in places where girls
think it's romantic,

557
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,600
aren't guys supposed to feel excited?

558
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,702
He didn't even kiss me, though.

559
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,438
Not only that, he just sat there
and said nothing.

560
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,308
Are we really a couple?

561
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,444
<i>I'm so pitiful.</i>

562
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,047
<i>Should I really listen to her rant
about this?</i>

563
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,882
<i>I don't want to listen at all.</i>

564
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,784
Shancai, have you ever kissed him?

565
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,219
What?

566
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,254
You did, right? Tell me honestly.

567
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,327
He must still like you.

568
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,430
How is that possible? That's not true.

569
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,366
He's willing to meet a girl
three times a week.

570
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,901
That's record-breaking already.

571
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:23,869
Really?

572
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,938
Yes, think about it. He even held hands
with you on the streets.

573
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,507
That's such a miracle.

574
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,110
If the F3 finds out about this,
they might fall into shock.

575
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,678
Really?

576
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,414
Yes. Why should I lie to you?

577
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:41,553
All right.

578
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,689
Shancai, I'm sorry.

579
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,626
Maybe I'm just too impatient,
so I'm talking nonsense.

580
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,229
Since I was little,
my parents treated me so nicely.

581
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,064
I also didn't encounter
much challenges in my life.

582
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,834
So I really feel troubled
about this relationship.

583
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,270
I'm not confident about it at all.

584
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,106
Does Ah Si even like me?

585
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,678
<i>I think she really likes Daoming Si.</i>

586
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,986
Ah Si's fiancée rants to you every night?

587
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,426
Either she has nothing better to do,
or she has ulterior motives.

588
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,328
No.

589
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,196
I think she's really troubled.

590
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:29,134
Huaze Lei, talk to Daoming Si.
Tell him to be nicer to Xiaozi.

591
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,769
I don't want to do such a thing.

592
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,971
Do you think he'll listen to me?

593
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,607
It's better if other people
don't get involved.

594
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,677
If they're compatible, they are.
If not, they're not.

595
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,545
Other people cannot help them.

596
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,180
You're right.

597
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,415
However...

598
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,383
Shancai, stop it.

599
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,920
Let Xiaozi worry about her problems
with Ah Si herself.

600
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:51,723
If you provide any opinions
on their problems,

601
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,192
what do you think Ah Si
and the others would think?

602
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,062
What do you mean?

603
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,464
I don't want to listen to what's happening
between them.

604
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:02,500
Every time Xiaozi tells me
about her and Daoming Si,

605
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,035
I am also the one who feels troubled.

606
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,104
I don't want to know about them at all.

607
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,072
Shancai.

608
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,608
In this matter,

609
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,010
aren't you the one who shouldn't get
involved the most?

610
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,882
Similarly, there has always been tension

611
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,987
that cannot be broken
between me, you, and Ah Si.

612
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:27,192
I'm also not in a position
to encourage or suggest Ah Si

613
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,827
to be nicer to Xiaozi.

614
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,296
Do you understand what I mean?

615
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,333
Because if I do that,

616
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,502
people might think

617
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,704
that I also have ulterior motives.

618
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,341
Huaze Lei.

619
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,110
Let's go to class.

620
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,783
<i>What Lei said really shocked me.</i>

621
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,486
<i>This is the first time he clearly told me</i>

622
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,222
<i>about this intractable love triangle
that exists</i>

623
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:00,458
<i>between me, Daoming Si, and him.</i>

624
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,994
<i>Yes, he's right.</i>

625
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:07,666
<i>I really shouldn't involve myself
in Daoming Si and Xiaozi's problems.</i>

626
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,601
<i>It won't help in any way.</i>

627
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,603
<i>It would only make things
more complicated.</i>

628
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,174
Ah Si.

629
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,909
Ah Si.

630
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,178
Ah Si, wait.

631
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,479
What do you want?

632
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,114
Don't come looking for me in school.

633
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,516
Why is Xiaozi here?

634
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,317
She's Xiaozi?

635
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,719
Scram! Go back!

636
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,287
No, I came here especially for you.

637
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,923
Stop being ridiculous, okay? Go home.

638
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,525
They're not like a couple at all.

639
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,695
It doesn't seem right for us
to watch them.

640
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,496
Let's go. Don't let them see us.

641
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,298
I want you to kiss me.

642
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,367
I want you to kiss me now!

643
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,402
What did you say?

644
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,371
You want me to kiss you?

645
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,239
Yes, kiss me.

646
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,675
I want you to prove
that you don't like Shancai anymore.

647
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,546
Every time I'm with you,

648
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,614
you always look like
your mind is somewhere else.

649
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,684
I'm always guessing.
Who are you thinking of?

650
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,553
What exactly are you thinking about?

651
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,590
If a boyfriend makes his girlfriend
feel so insecure,

652
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,158
isn't this too much?

653
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,563
If you don't have any feelings
for Shancai anymore,

654
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,964
why can't you kiss me?

655
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,600
Prove it to me.

656
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,137
Prove it.

657
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,407
Close your eyes.

658
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,426
Weren't you hoping
that Ah Si would be nicer to Xiaozi?

659
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,163
You don't need to be worried now.

660
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,967
Why are you so quiet?

661
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,136
Did their kiss have a huge impact on you?

662
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,873
A huge impact? Of course not.

663
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,076
Isn't this great?
This is what I hoped for.

664
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,880
I feel like summer break, spring break,
and winter break have been put together.

665
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,149
No. That's not enough to describe
my excitement.

666
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,885
I should say it's like when man stepped
on the moon for the first time.

667
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,421
My heart is full of joy. I'm ecstatic!

668
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,125
What?

669
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,731
You talk nonstop whenever someone
guesses correctly what you're thinking.

670
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,134
I don't.

671
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,137
Don't act like you're a psychologist.
Like you're so observant or something.

672
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,505
Why aren't you that focused in class?

673
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,175
You left your bag.

674
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,571
Shancai.

675
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:35,773
Qinghe.

676
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,044
What's the matter?

677
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,480
Why do you have that expression
on your face? Are you in a bad mood?

678
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,148
No.

679
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,783
Tell me.

680
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,752
Did anything happen?

681
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,788
I really can't take my stupidity anymore.

682
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,691
I always think I know what's going on.
I don't use my brain.

683
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,693
I always think that what I think is right.

684
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,029
Then I realize that's not the case
at all later on.

685
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,665
And I'll find out that
I'm just wasting my time.

686
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm so stupid.

687
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,969
From Li Zhen to Xiaoshun.

688
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,070
And now...

689
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,006
Why do you say that?

690
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,974
That's your strength.

691
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,243
You always believe that people are kind.

692
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,312
That's why you're so nice to them.

693
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,749
The people you mentioned
were indeed out of line,

694
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,550
but you still chose to forgive them.

695
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,120
You're that nice.

696
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,188
Really?

697
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,157
Of course.

698
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:30,028
That's what I like about you.

699
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,963
Is that so?

700
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,266
Yes, it is.

701
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,336
That's the Shancai I like.

702
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,708
Why did I just confess my feelings?

703
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:45,777
You're right.

704
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,780
I just have to figure things out
at the critical moment.

705
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,715
It's not too late yet.

706
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,151
Hey.

707
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,153
Shancai.

708
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,988
Shancai.

709
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,992
I have to pull myself together
and start over.

710
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,094
If I think about it carefully,

711
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,596
I feel less stressed now.

712
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,067
I just went back to square one,

713
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,135
to my ordinary life before
when I had nothing.

714
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,404
It's not true
that you don't have anything.

715
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,672
I'll always be beside you.

716
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,743
I'm putting everything behind me.

717
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,411
Qinghe.

718
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,479
Present.

719
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,115
Thank you. Good thing you're beside me.

720
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,351
You have to be my good friend forever.

721
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,752
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

722
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:44,769
Hey.

723
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,538
Huaze Lei, why did you call me?

724
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,707
Because I saw a frustrated lady
in front of me.

725
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,810
I feel sorry for her,
so I want to treat her to a cup of coffee.

726
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,013
Frustrated lady?

727
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:00,885
Please mind your words,

728
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,821
or there will be no pretty lady
drinking coffee with you.

729
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,501
Every time we get to this season,

730
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,770
I enjoy wandering around the streets.

731
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,639
I was looking for a coffee shop
to have a cup of coffee,

732
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:23,441
then I saw you.

733
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:30,181
You often wander around by yourself
and drink coffee alone.

734
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,050
Don't you feel lonely?

735
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,219
Only frustrated people feel lonely.

736
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,022
Don't try to imply things, okay?

737
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,425
I've already thought it through.

738
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,036
<i>We also went out on a date before.</i>

739
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,005
<i>It would've been nice if we were able
to chat naturally</i>

740
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,840
<i>like what we're doing now.</i>

741
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,013
What's the matter?

742
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,850
Nothing. I just think
the atmosphere is nice.

743
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,118
I feel comfortable.

744
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,858
I really want to soak in hot springs
in this type of weather.

745
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,827
You want to soak in hot springs
in such a hot day?

746
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,329
You took me to fly a kite
when it was raining last time.

747
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,131
You're so weird.

748
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:25,870
Shancai.

749
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:27,505
What a coincidence.

750
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,874
Yeah, what a coincidence.

751
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:31,509
Have you been here long?

752
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:32,977
Yeah, we've been here for a while.

753
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,149
Who is he? Are you on a date?

754
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,986
No, he's Huaze Lei.
We just met by accident.

755
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,387
So you're Huaze Lei.

756
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,124
Hi, I'm Ah Si's fiancée.
My name is Xiaozi.

757
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,625
Can we sit with you?

758
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,296
Who sits this way on a date?
Come and sit together.

759
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:53,965
Come on.

760
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,299
Hurry.

761
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,302
Don't just stand there. Come and sit down.

762
00:43:58,903 --> 00:43:59,904
Have a seat.

763
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,041
Are you on a date?

764
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:04,942
Yes.

765
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,311
It looks like everything is going well.

766
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,515
Yes, look at us sitting together.

767
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,017
It's like two couples on a double date.

768
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:14,819
Yes, it looks like it.

769
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:15,953
Stop talking nonsense.

770
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,579
