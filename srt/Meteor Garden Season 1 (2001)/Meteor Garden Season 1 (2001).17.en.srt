1
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,304
Hello?

2
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,074
Huaze Lei, why did you call me?

3
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,443
Because I saw a frustrated lady
in front of me.

4
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,613
I feel sorry for her,
so I want to treat her to a cup of coffee.

5
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,615
Frustrated lady?

6
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,587
Please mind your words,

7
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,457
or there will be no pretty lady
drinking coffee with you.

8
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,103
Every time we get to this season,

9
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,271
I enjoy wandering around the streets.

10
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,375
I was looking for a coffee shop
to have a cup of coffee,

11
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,076
then I saw you.

12
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,950
You often wander around by yourself
and drink coffee alone.

13
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,585
Don't you feel lonely?

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,855
Only frustrated people feel lonely.

15
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,624
Don't try to imply things, okay?

16
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,993
I've already thought it through.

17
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,571
<i>We also went out on a date before.</i>

18
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,674
<i>It would've been nice if we were able
to chat naturally</i>

19
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,275
<i>like what we're doing now.</i>

20
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,381
What's the matter?

21
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,519
Nothing. I just think
the atmosphere is nice.

22
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,753
I feel comfortable.

23
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:08,689
Yeah.

24
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,360
I really want to soak in hot springs
in this type of weather.

25
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,529
You want to soak in hot springs
in such a hot day?

26
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,964
You took me to fly a kite
when it was raining last time.

27
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,733
You're so weird.

28
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,405
Shancai.

29
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,074
What a coincidence.

30
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,376
Yeah, what a coincidence.

31
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,111
Have you been here long?

32
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,546
Yeah, we've been here for a while.

33
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,918
Who is he? Are you on a date?

34
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,388
No, he's Huaze Lei.
We just met by accident.

35
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,056
So you're Huaze Lei.

36
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,525
Hi, I'm Ah Si's fiancee.
My name is Xiaozi.

37
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,394
Can we sit with you?

38
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,732
Who sits this way on a date?
Come and sit together.

39
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,767
Come on.

40
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:54,701
Hurry.

41
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,938
Don't just stand there. Come and sit down.

42
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,506
Have a seat.

43
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,744
Are you on a date?

44
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,678
Yes.

45
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,047
It looks like everything is going well.

46
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,250
Yes, look at us sitting together.

47
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,586
It's like two couples on a double date.

48
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,254
Yes, it looks like it.

49
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,756
Stop talking nonsense.

50
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,858
Why are you so mad?

51
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,627
I'm sorry. He's feeling embarrassed
so he's acting tough.

52
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,296
That's okay. We've been used to it.

53
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,765
He behaved like this just now.

54
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,067
He kept saying he was bored
and wanted to go home.

55
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:30,036
So I thought we should go to a hotel,
but he tried to run away.

56
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,940
Don't you think your relationship
is moving too fast?

57
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,544
No. After all, we've already kissed,
so I think we can move to the next stage.

58
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,679
Stop talking too much, will you?

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,281
What's the matter?

60
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,916
Your girlfriend has done so much for you.

61
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,417
You should be thankful.

62
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,554
A good man shouldn't let a girl down.

63
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,722
That's what I'm talking about.

64
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,959
I tell you what, my family has
a vacation mansion on the hill.

65
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,295
School is off tomorrow anyway.
Let's go together, shall we?

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,065
No, you two can go without us.

67
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,601
Huaze Lei and I will be two third wheels,
so it's going to be so weird.

68
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,669
Right, Huaze Lei?

69
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,804
Is there a hot spring?

70
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,139
Yes, so you're into hot springs?

71
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,241
What a coincidence.
Our hot spring is pretty good.

72
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,744
Really? Fine, I'll go.

73
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,379
Great. Let's all go together.

74
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:23,790
Ma'am.

75
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,292
Anything new?

76
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,127
Ma'am,

77
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,964
Young Master and Miss Xiaozi
went into Miss Xiaozi's mansion.

78
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,568
My man saw them go in there together.

79
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:39,005
In this situation, they will spend a night
in the mansion tonight.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,944
Xiaozi is a smart kid.

81
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,912
She learned what I taught her very well.

82
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,684
But Young Master Huaze and Miss Shancai

83
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,052
went with them.

84
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,924
What? What's going on?

85
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,194
The four of them met in a café.

86
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,665
I don't know how, but they went
to Miss Xiaozi's mansion together.

87
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,237
That poor woman Shancai
keeps lingering around them.

88
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,372
What is she up to this time?

89
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,408
Wait.

90
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,880
You said she was with Huaze Lei before.

91
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,615
Then the four of them went together?

92
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,515
Yes.

93
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,420
Could it be that she gave up Ah Si

94
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,557
and went back to pursue Huaze Lei?

95
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,560
This is good.

96
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,998
After tonight, Ah Si and Xiaozi
will get into a serious relationship.

97
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,901
She will give up then, right?

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,655
It's so comfortable.

99
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,358
Shancai, what's the matter?

100
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,227
Why are you so lifeless?

101
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,599
No, I'm just thinking your mansion
is awesome.

102
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,201
Really? I think it's not bad.

103
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,139
But the house is kind of old,
and the rooms are a little small.

104
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,008
But it's still pretty good
when I come here every now and then.

105
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,578
Xiaozi.

106
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,316
It's great that you are
in a serious relationship with Daoming Si.

107
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,719
Do you think so?
I'm feeling kind of happy, too.

108
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,789
-Great.
-Thanks.

109
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,728
<i>No, I don't think it's great. I'm hurt.</i>

110
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,631
<i>Since I saw them kissed,</i>

111
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,567
<i>there's a wound on my heart.</i>

112
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:52,672
<i>Daoming Si's love is so strong
and so heavy</i>

113
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,674
<i>that I feel like I can't breathe anymore.</i>

114
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,678
I don't know what other couples are like,

115
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,647
but I keep telling myself

116
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,116
not to treat Ah Si like a normal boy.

117
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,852
Otherwise, I will think that
he doesn't love me enough.

118
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,022
Sometimes his indifference makes me mad,

119
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,292
but when I speak out what I think,
he's willing to cooperate with me.

120
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,693
<i>If you run away,</i>

121
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,429
I'll chase after you.

122
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,898
No matter where you are,

123
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,900
even if you're in hell,

124
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,104
No matter which corner
of the world you're in,

125
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,906
I'll chase you down.

126
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,277
<i>I thought I could put an end to it
this time,</i>

127
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,879
<i>and run away from him.</i>

128
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,317
<i>But why does it seem that I'm getting
sucked into a bigger vortex</i>

129
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,754
<i>with a wound hurting like hell
on my heart?</i>

130
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,558
Well, that's fine.

131
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,660
I don't have to compare with others.

132
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,829
I believe our relationship
will get better.

133
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,633
If he won't take the initiative, I will.

134
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,970
I even hope we can move
into the next stage tonight.

135
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,705
Shancai!

136
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,409
Is there anyone outside?
Come in and help us!

137
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,079
What happened?

138
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,481
Shancai fainted in the hot spring,
and I can't carry her.

139
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,533
Maybe she's been in there for too long
so she fainted.

140
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,568
I think she'll be fine.

141
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,804
Xiaozi.

142
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,006
Take her back to her room.

143
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,974
Oh, follow me.

144
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,086
Here, drink some water.

145
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,454
Thank you.

146
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,860
What happened to me?

147
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,262
You've been in the hot spring for too long
so you fainted.

148
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,465
Huaze Lei, did you save me?

149
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,968
So you saw everything, right?

150
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,971
Didn't I already put your robe on?

151
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,575
So you saw everything
when you were putting my robe on?

152
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,610
Yes.

153
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,678
I saw you,

154
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,381
but what else could I do
in that situation?

155
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,719
Yeah, right. But still, you're a guy.

156
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,054
Why didn't you get a girl to save me?

157
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,691
-Where's Xiaozi?
-She might be sleeping now.

158
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,528
Ah Si is in the same room with her.
And we are sharing this room.

159
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,664
Why should we sleep in the same room?
There are enough rooms for us.

160
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,366
-I'll talk to her.
-Hey, stop.

161
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,568
I don't think you should disturb them.

162
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,904
Maybe they're doing it now.

163
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,072
Doing it?

164
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,141
Are they?

165
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,378
Oh, right, silly me.

166
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,648
You can stop them if you want.

167
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,117
Should I smash down their door for you?

168
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,387
Why would I stop them?

169
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,924
Because since you came here,

170
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,726
you're about to cry.

171
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,766
Huaze Lei, why did you agree to come here?

172
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,403
Didn't you say we shouldn't get things
more complicated?

173
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,905
Then why are we here?

174
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,643
I think we shouldn't avoid
what is meant to happen.

175
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,080
We met at the coffee shop,

176
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,883
so do we have to pretend
we can't see each other?

177
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,120
Maybe this is a chance

178
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,592
for everybody to either
make things clearer or more confusing.

179
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,330
<i>If I could, I would rather become blind.</i>

180
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,184
Ah Si.

181
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,255
My mom said I'll live at your place
in the next semester.

182
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,325
I'll be learning how to be a good wife
in the following days.

183
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,563
If you think four years in college
is too long,

184
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,132
it's okay if you choose to marry
before graduation.

185
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,314
Do you agree with this?

186
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,785
Are you satisfied with the decision
your parents made for you?

187
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,524
Of course, it's not my place
to criticize you.

188
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,530
Apparently, your future
has been decided, hasn't it?

189
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,434
You mean, you want to decide
who you'll love?

190
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,774
Didn't you already decide
that I'm the one?

191
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,575
Why are you asking so many questions?

192
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,452
Fine.

193
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,422
If you aren't going to answer,
I won't ask anymore.

194
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,460
But please look at me right now.

195
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,340
<i>I must stop going back and forth
about my feelings towards Daoming Si.</i>

196
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,476
<i>Can I rush into their room?</i>

197
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,346
<i>Of course, I can't. Absolutely can't.</i>

198
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,352
<i>But an inexplicable pain
is gripping my heart.</i>

199
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,590
Huaze Lei, are you sleeping now?

200
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,326
Not yet.

201
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,664
Why did they only give us one blanket?

202
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,433
Does it matter?

203
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,669
It's warmer this way.

204
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,039
And this room is so cold.

205
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,978
Could I hold your hand?

206
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,452
Yes.

207
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,095
<i>Tonight, there's one more wound
on my heart.</i>

208
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,466
<i>Maybe the one who can heal the wound
is Huaze Lei.</i>

209
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,804
<i>He's beside me,
so I'm not that lonely now.</i>

210
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,508
Huaze Lei, thank you.

211
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,576
For what?

212
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,215
Thank you for saving me in the hot spring.

213
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,284
It just happened this way.

214
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,388
The moment I finished shower,
I heard Xiaozi yelling that you fainted.

215
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,824
She's so impetuous.

216
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,893
And fierce.

217
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,562
I've met many girls
who are from rich families.

218
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,564
I haven't met her type of girls before.

219
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,803
Yeah, but I think she's pretty cute.
I like her.

220
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,673
She is so reckless that she always
makes people so nervous.

221
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:47,146
But I think she's a girl
with both maturity and willfulness,

222
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,182
so you won't hate her.

223
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,051
She's just like Daoming Si in some ways.

224
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,221
She's not exactly like Ah Si.

225
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,659
No one can match his willfulness
after all.

226
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,394
Yeah.

227
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,729
You finally smiled.

228
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,399
-I didn't smile before?
-You don't think so?

229
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,002
You've been putting
on a grumpy face the whole day.

230
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,972
I've been putting on this face
since I enrolled in Yingde.

231
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,041
I've been like this for a long time.

232
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,576
You are bickering with me now.

233
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,178
This is the Shancai I know.

234
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,981
You were so frustrated just now.

235
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,183
Shut up.

236
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,155
Fine. You can vent
all your problems on me.

237
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,058
I don't have any problems.
Besides, why should I vent on you?

238
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,161
You don't? You've already thrown
two pillows, miss.

239
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,364
Fine, I'll throw a third one. You still...

240
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,668
<i>I feel like I'm on the rooftop.</i>

241
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,037
<i>When I'm at my worst times,</i>

242
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,441
<i>Lei will always be blowing a gentle wind
to my heart.</i>

243
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,043
<i>I no longer feel heartbroken
at the thought of him,</i>

244
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,447
<i>and my feeling towards him
is not love anymore.</i>

245
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>But I know I'll like Huaze Lei forever.</i>

246
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,453
Come here. Hey!

247
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,855
-Hey.
-I'm tired now. Stop.

248
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,196
Put your clothes on.

249
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:12,899
Why?

250
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,635
Why can you say it so calmly?

251
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,804
It may seem like
I never take things seriously,

252
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,140
but I'm not joking about this.

253
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,776
Don't you feel anything?

254
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,078
No.

255
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:31,217
Really? So men prefer half-naked women.

256
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,321
I shouldn't have taken off all my clothes.

257
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,792
Then...

258
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,763
-How do you like this?
-Xiaozi.

259
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,366
Or you don't like me in a robe?

260
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,735
Do you like stockings or sexy underwear?

261
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,971
-Listen to me, okay?
-I don't want to listen.

262
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,639
-Listen to me, okay?
-I don't want to listen!

263
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,376
-Listen to me, okay?
-I can't hear you.

264
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,312
I told you I'll try to like you.

265
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,648
I tried my best to like you.

266
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,885
But I'm sorry.

267
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,588
Sorry.

268
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,798
Why did you apologize?

269
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,470
What do you mean?

270
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,607
You really pissed me off.

271
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,811
You have to be clear.

272
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,147
I really can't be in a relationship
with you.

273
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,487
What's that sound?

274
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,357
It seems to come out from Ah Si's room.

275
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,162
All I can think about is Shancai.

276
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,333
Why are they together?

277
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,902
What are they doing?

278
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,038
Is Shancai still--

279
00:18:59,105 --> 00:18:59,972
Enough!

280
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,607
Stop it!

281
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,144
Hey, should we go take a look?

282
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,313
Maybe Daoming Si is forcing her
to do it now.

283
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,648
Really, Ah Si?

284
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,850
I think it's the other way around.

285
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,488
Anyway, I think we'd better
go check it out.

286
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,923
Hey.

287
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,726
How can you still say that?

288
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,599
You're still in love with Shancai?

289
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,905
When she was in the hot spring with me,
she smiled to me and congratulated me.

290
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,007
She doesn't love you.

291
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,109
You still don't care
even if she doesn't love you?

292
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,417
Then why are you still with me?

293
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,418
Xiaozi.

294
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:55,061
I'm sorry, I didn't know you're busy.
Sorry for disturbing you.

295
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,403
Do whatever you want to do.

296
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,374
You can hit me
until you're not mad anymore.

297
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,286
-What did you see?
-What? Nothing.

298
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,888
I didn't see Xiaozi
sitting on Daoming Si, half-naked.

299
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,937
You're so mean. I love you so much.

300
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,040
Why are you doing this to me?

301
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,918
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,170
<i>I can't sleep. I can't even close my eyes.</i>

303
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>Xiaozi was sitting on Daoming Si,
half-naked.</i>

304
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,045
<i>I came in at the worst timing.</i>

305
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,281
<i>I didn't want to see that scene.</i>

306
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,817
<i>I didn't want to meddle in their affairs.</i>

307
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,586
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

308
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,832
What's up?

309
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,837
Why did you get up so early?
You didn't sleep well last night?

310
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,106
No.

311
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,275
Yeah?

312
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:55,614
<i>I'm getting dumber in front of Daoming Si.</i>

313
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,583
<i>I wasn't like this in the past.</i>

314
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,686
<i>The days when we would fight
with each other are gone.</i>

315
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,390
<i>Maybe it's because my intention
is so fierce.</i>

316
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:09,128
<i>There is chemistry
between Daoming Si and me.</i>

317
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,932
<i>I can get along with Huaze Lei now,</i>

318
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:18,771
<i>but I can't hold Daoming Si's hand
and sleep like what I did with Huaze Lei.</i>

319
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,009
I'm going back to my room.

320
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,711
I'm going home.

321
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,614
Please tell Lei for me.

322
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,549
Okay, got it.

323
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,741
Xiaozi.

324
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,712
We should go now.

325
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,247
Okay.

326
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,216
But I want to sit here
for a little longer.

327
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,318
I'll tell the chauffeur
to drive you home, okay?

328
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,254
Oh, okay.

329
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,291
I met Daoming Si in the yard.

330
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,126
He said he was leaving.

331
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,964
Ah Si? Maybe he's feeling embarrassed.

332
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,335
He didn't leave me alone the whole night,

333
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,804
but he feels awkward in the morning.

334
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,242
Is that so?

335
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,279
We're leaving now. Thank you, Xiaozi.

336
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,382
See you later.

337
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,583
Yeah, bye-bye.

338
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,452
Huaze Lei.

339
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,656
Is seeing people making out
a disgusting thing?

340
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,027
Honestly, I'm sorry for you.

341
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,763
This is a very awkward situation.

342
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,033
Yeah, I feel so uncomfortable.

343
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,503
I don't understand why people like
watching porns?

344
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:36,875
Some situations can be considered
as jokes.

345
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,079
But of course, it differs from people
to people.

346
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,849
You feel so uncomfortable
because the person you saw was Ah Si.

347
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,153
That's not the case.
There's no difference.

348
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,589
They are so close now.

349
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,658
I won't meddle in their affairs.

350
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,394
I think you're like a prophet.

351
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,998
Didn't you say we shouldn't pretend
not to see each other since we've met?

352
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,367
It turned out I really saw it.

353
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,436
I think I will get a stye.

354
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,205
Cry if you want to.

355
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,175
No one who wants to cry.
What are you talking about?

356
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,082
Could I lean on your back?

357
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,503
I'm home.

358
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,008
What are you doing?

359
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,278
Dad, you're not borrowing
high-interest debt again, are you?

360
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,013
No. This is...

361
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,984
Shancai, we were afraid you'll
get worried so we didn't tell you.

362
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,455
We can't afford to live in Taipei anymore.

363
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,590
I know.

364
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,562
The economy is so weak right now.

365
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,099
Employees are being laid off
and companies are being shut down.

366
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,635
I can't find any job.

367
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:49,208
I have a friend in the country.
He's a fisher and he has a boat.

368
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,143
He asked us if we want to help.

369
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,113
You mean, we're going to live
in a fishing village?

370
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,349
Is dad capable of being a fisher?

371
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,152
-Yes.
-Are you joking right now?

372
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,289
Just ask your mom.
I read a lot of fishing magazines.

373
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,624
-Yeah, read a lot.
-Right?

374
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,760
-And my favorite TV program is...
-<i>Fishing King.</i>

375
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,662
-That one introducing fishing.
-Yeah.

376
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,231
I'm telling you, it's going to be fine.

377
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,301
I've decided that I'll fight
with the ocean for the rest of my life.

378
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,872
-We'll depend on the ocean for living.
-Yeah, we've decided to sail out.

379
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:25,110
<i>Today is our happy</i>

380
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,412
<i>-Sailing day
-Sailing day</i>

381
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:34,219
-<i>Enjoy sailing with...</i>
-<i>Enjoy sailing with...</i>

382
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:41,660
When I mentioned this to your dad
about a week ago,

383
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,529
he was interested in this.

384
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,466
We haven't made up our mind
until last night.

385
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,502
We didn't want to hide it from you,
Shancai.

386
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,138
-Mom, I'm not unhappy about this.
-Yeah.

387
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,408
I'm just thinking,
is Dad really capable of fishing?

388
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,943
Hey, look at your dad.

389
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:02,181
So brave, motivated, and decisive.
How good is that?

390
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,283
-Motivated and decisive?
-Yeah.

391
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,151
Why do I think it's a rush decision?

392
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:07,953
How could it be?

393
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,390
Actually, my friend will cover our food
and housing expense.

394
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,092
Your dad will be working hard,

395
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,196
so he can pay your tuition in Yingde
University and the rent of this place

396
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,664
with his salary.

397
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,935
Your job salary
will all go into your tuition.

398
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,103
You don't need to pay
for our other expenses with it.

399
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,005
Isn't our life much easier that way?

400
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,407
Yes.

401
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,445
Actually, we've made Shancai's life
so hard with us.

402
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,248
Dad, Mom.

403
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,785
You mean, you'll leave me here?

404
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,089
Of course. We spent so much money
on your tuition of Yingde University.

405
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,657
If you drop out,

406
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,660
all the money we've paid before
will all go to waste.

407
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,696
How could you do that?

408
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,397
Shancai, I mean,

409
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,533
when one day I save enough money,

410
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,002
or there are job opportunities,

411
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,238
we'll move back here and stay with you.

412
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,740
But for now,

413
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,610
Shancai, you'll have to take good care
of yourself.

414
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:09,414
Yes, Shancai, you need to be strong
by yourself.

415
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,283
Be strong by myself?

416
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,321
-Hey, honey, let's pack things up.
-Yeah.

417
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,790
There is so much luggage
and we're running late. Hurry up.

418
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,361
Hurry up.

419
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,664
Dad, Mom.

420
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,534
Couldn't you think about this
for a few more days?

421
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,976
I really don't want to get separated
from you.

422
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,416
Shancai, we'll write you letters.

423
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,985
You can call us.

424
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:48,620
Mom.

425
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,823
When you're home alone,

426
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,493
remember to lock all the doors and windows
before you sleep.

427
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,329
Remember to wear your coat
before going out.

428
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,500
Pay attention to your nutrition.
Don't just eat instant noodles every day

429
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,536
to save money.

430
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,738
And...

431
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,641
Shancai.

432
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,555
Shancai is living alone now?

433
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,824
Her parents are going
to a fishing village?

434
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,359
-Just these two, right?
-Yes.

435
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,228
Yeah, poor Shancai.

436
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:36,268
She can't get to work,
because her parents are moving today.

437
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,969
-It will be NTD 180.
-Okay, NTD 180.

438
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,772
Will her dad get used to fishing?

439
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,709
How should I know?
I'm so troubled right now.

440
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,480
Maybe Shancai will drop out
in the next semester,

441
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,750
and I'll never see her again at school.

442
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,719
Then what's left for me?

443
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,520
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

444
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,356
She must be so sad.

445
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,492
If I suddenly got separated
from my parents, I would cry my eyes out.

446
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:04,663
Yeah, if Shancai is crying before me,

447
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,867
I'll hug her and tell her,

448
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,003
"Shancai, if you're sad,

449
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,139
you can lean on my shoulder."

450
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,042
When I met her today,

451
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,978
she said she's strong enough
to handle any problem

452
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,682
by the time she got into university.

453
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:28,520
But I'm afraid that Shancai may be hiding
her sorrow in her heart,

454
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,322
instead of truly being strong.

455
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,191
She doesn't like people to pity her.

456
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,593
Really? Then what should we do?

457
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,730
Qinghe, Shancai's parents are away
from her.

458
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:40,265
You have to take good care of her.

459
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:43,068
Yes. I'll protect my Princess Shancai.

460
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,871
She lost her family all of a sudden.

461
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,073
I have to nurture her with love.

462
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,509
Qinghe.

463
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,312
<i>Don't add fuel to the fire, okay?</i>

464
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,783
Xiaoyou, are you trying
to tell me something?

465
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,987
Nothing, I'm thinking you're really
a good man.

466
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,859
Xiaoyou.

467
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,763
All I can say is,
thank you for your admiration.

468
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,167
But I can't accept your love.

469
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,868
It's not because you're not good enough.

470
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,439
It's because I've already given my heart
to Shancai.

471
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,314
Xiaozi.

472
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,485
Xiaozi.

473
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,093
Xiaozi.

474
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,101
I was calling you just now.
Why didn't you answer me?

475
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,339
You've been staying here for so many days.

476
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,541
You won't come home or go to school.

477
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,677
Your dad is worried about you.

478
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,149
I see how unhappy you are,

479
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,984
and I'm also worried about you.

480
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,921
Mom, leave me alone. I'm fine.

481
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,458
Did you have a fight with Daoming Si?

482
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,427
Do you need me to make a call?

483
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,429
Please don't make a call.

484
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,499
Unless you don't care about how I feel,

485
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,334
or you want to embarrass me.

486
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,170
Okay, I won't make the call.

487
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,008
I heard from Mrs. Daoming

488
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,044
that you often hang out with a girl
called Shancai recently.

489
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,847
Is she very cunning or problematic?

490
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,518
Mom, please stop this nonsense, okay?
She is my important friend.

491
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,053
Besides, how could you just believe
what other people have said to you?

492
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,655
Don't you think that's weird?

493
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,530
Mom, I'm sorry.

494
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:58,270
I don't blame you.

495
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:00,805
Mom.

496
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,077
I would like to ask you a favor.

497
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,566
<i>From today, I'll be living alone.</i>

498
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,612
Xiaozi?

499
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,382
It's so dark outside at your place.
I even bumped into something.

500
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,017
You should've opened the door sooner.

501
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,919
Won't you invite me in?

502
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,088
Oh, come in, please.

503
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,395
-Take a seat.
-Yeah.

504
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,932
-Why did you come here so late?
-Oh, I have something to tell you.

505
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,268
-Something to tell me?
-Yeah.

506
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:07,772
<i>Is she about to tell me about
her making out with Daoming Si?</i>

507
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,009
-It's--
-I'm sorry, I don't want to hear it.

508
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,420
Xiaozi, didn't you find it weird
that I'm the only one home?

509
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,888
Yeah, a little.

510
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,591
It's because my parents have moved away.

511
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:29,260
From today, I'll be living alone.

512
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,163
I think it's something new
and I'm very nervous.

513
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,967
Really? Your parents won't be watching
your every move. You're free now.

514
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,803
Yeah, so from now on,

515
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,740
I have to take care of everything
in my life.

516
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:47,779
So I have no time to think
about other things.

517
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,952
If you want to talk with me
about something,

518
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,755
I might not be able
to give you advice anymore.

519
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,892
Shancai, do you hate me?

520
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,795
No, it's not what you think.

521
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,996
I didn't mean that.

522
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,334
If you hate me, I can understand.

523
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,671
I lied to you.

524
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,674
Maybe because I envy you,

525
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,742
that's why I did not tell you.

526
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,013
Actually, nothing happened that night.

527
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,550
Ah Si told me that he couldn't be with me,

528
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,786
so nothing happened between us.

529
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,189
I was pretty satisfied with my body,

530
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,925
and I thought if I took off my clothes,
he would...

531
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,729
You know, he would go weak in the knees
or be attracted to me or something.

532
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,231
So I just took off all my clothes.

533
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,201
I couldn't believe he didn't even move
a muscle. He didn't show me any respect.

534
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,938
That was a huge humiliation for a woman.

535
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:56,715
Today, I've told my mother to go
to Ah Si's house to cancel the engagement.

536
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,952
Why? I thought things were going well
between you two.

537
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,356
Although things didn't end up well
between Ah Si and me,

538
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,859
I still hope we can still be friends.

539
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,496
I came here today to say this to you.

540
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:16,468
Through my engagement
with Daoming Si, I met you,

541
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,838
and I became friends with you.
I'm so happy.

542
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,345
Sorry, I'm having an allergic reaction.
Why does my nose keep running?

543
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,219
<i>I just told those harsh words to her.</i>

544
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,856
<i>Sometimes, I find Xiaozi annoying.</i>

545
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,191
<i>I think she can feel it, too.</i>

546
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,796
<i>But she came here so late at night,
just to tell me this.</i>

547
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,532
Sorry, I'm leaving now.

548
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,067
Xiaozi.

549
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,469
If you don't mind,

550
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,872
I want to be your friend forever.

551
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,380
I'll be rooting for you forever.

552
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,983
I won't bring you any problems anymore.

553
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,618
Xiaozi.

554
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,786
Listen to me.

555
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,355
If you really consider me as your friend,

556
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:14,292
stop caring about how I feel
and lying to yourself.

557
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:16,928
I didn't.

558
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,063
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

559
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,902
I forgot to tell you.

560
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:29,107
Ah Si rejected me because he said
all he can think about is you.

561
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,218
I saw the four of them went--

562
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:45,857
Young Master.

563
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,595
My son came home.

564
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,366
Tell the cook to prepare dinner for Ah Si.

565
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,301
Yes.

566
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,937
Don't bother. I'm not hungry.

567
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,939
I have something to tell you.

568
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,776
Who taught you to be so rude?

569
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,112
Have you greeted me since you came in?

570
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:11,649
Mom.

571
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,261
What?

572
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,131
Can't I can't hug you now
that you're all grown up?

573
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,337
I want to cancel the engagement
with Xiaozi from the He Corporation.

574
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,807
What did you say?

575
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,978
I told Xiaozi I don't love her,

576
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,913
and I won't marry her.

577
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,618
You call the family of He
and apologize to Xiaozi right now.

578
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,486
I'll forget everything.

579
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,587
That's impossible.

580
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,892
In fact, I think I've already told her
what I really feel

581
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,260
so I don't need to apologize to her.

582
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,598
Call the He family's number for me.
I'll explain to President He myself.

583
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:01,499
Yes.

584
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,370
Ah Si, what are you doing?

585
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,271
Mom.

586
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,474
Listen to me, Shancai is the one I love.

587
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,010
I won't marry any other woman except her.

588
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:13,378
How dare you!

589
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,680
It's not your place to decide.

590
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,918
I've already chosen President He's
daughter, Xiaozi, as your future wife.

591
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,288
I'm telling you, that poor woman Shancai

592
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,124
won't marry into the Daoming Family,

593
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,326
and she won't be able to do it
even in her next life!

594
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,560
Mom!

595
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:33,731
Why are you treating my lifetime happiness
like your business resource?

596
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,900
This is what happened to my sister.

597
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,069
You separated her from the man she loved,

598
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,772
and you forced her to marry the son
of a tycoon in hotel industry.

599
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,208
My sister never told me this,
but I always knew.

600
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,611
That was the biggest regret in her heart.

601
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,916
I won't be your puppet like my sister.

602
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,153
Then I can tell you,

603
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,023
I won't let you do anything that will
make the Daoming Family regretful.

604
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,893
Your marriage to Xiaozi is final.

605
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,028
If I can't even make the decision
of such things,

606
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,965
how could I, Daoming Feng,
have a place in business?

607
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:11,736
If you selfishly force me
to be together with Xiaozi,

608
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,938
she will regret this for her entire life.

609
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,842
And I'll be in pain forever.

610
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,646
Mom, are you really going to ruin my life?

611
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,785
If you marry that poor girl Shancai,
your life will be ruined.

612
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,291
If our family can unite with the property
business of the He Family,

613
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,127
will there be any competitors in business
after you're in charge?

614
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,598
If you love me,
you should thank me for what I did.

615
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,632
Mom.

616
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,303
All you ever think about
is money and your business.

617
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:50,274
Why don't you think about
how to make your son happy?

618
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,778
Don't you want me to be happy?

619
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:57,348
Mom.

620
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,684
Are you really going to ruin me?

621
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:01,619
Shut up!

622
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,723
I won't let you take control of my life.

623
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,060
I won't let you ruin my happiness.

624
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:13,464
If I can, I would rather not be your son.

625
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:16,067
I would rather not be Daoming Si!

626
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,704
Stop! Ah Si!

627
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,676
Gosh. Is this your house?

628
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,846
It's just as big as my bathroom.

629
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,950
What are you doing here?

630
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,420
This is not a zoo.
There's nothing worth to look at.

631
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,055
The size doesn't matter.

632
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,525
How about the neighborhood?
Is it safe living by yourself?

633
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,660
It's fine.

634
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,996
Right, we can call Ah Si to come here.

635
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,164
No.

636
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,065
Why?

637
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,233
No particular reason.

638
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,403
Because my house is too small,
and there's no place to sit.

639
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,906
You would get bored
and would want to leave soon anyway.

640
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,607
So why bother inviting more people?

641
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,777
Speaking of Ah Si, I don't know
what he's doing right now.

642
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,312
Why didn't he go to school again today?

643
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,816
Aren't things going well between him
and Xiaozi recently?

644
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,952
Shancai, do you know how they are
recently?

645
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,787
How would I know that?

646
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,127
Just drink and stop asking her questions.

647
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,998
Who could that be? I'll get the door.
You can keep drinking.

648
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,600
Coming.

649
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,807
Why is beer without ice so disgusting?

650
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,420
I thought we'll never meet again.

651
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:45,423
However, I have a question for you.

652
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:47,792
What exactly did you do?

653
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:53,431
Xiaozi's mother and Ah Si

654
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:55,967
decided to cancel the engagement
at the same time.

655
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,568
Cancel the engagement?

656
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:02,006
When will you stop meddling
with Daoming Si's life?

657
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,008
I didn't do anything.

658
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,611
I knew you would say something like that.

659
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,881
Your parents must be teaching you

660
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:14,685
mean and dirty tricks
that normal people can't think of.

661
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,022
Mrs. Daoming, you're damaging your dignity
with these words.

662
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:21,692
How dare you talk to me like that.

663
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,328
Do you want to lecture me
even if I am older than you?

664
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,053
