1
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,904
Shancai, you got hurt so badly.

2
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,906
What will you tell your mom if she asks?

3
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,241
Is it still visible
even if I put my hair down this way?

4
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,476
Yes.

5
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,311
Then I can only dodge her.

6
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,813
-I can't let my mom see me.
-Okay.

7
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,259
Hey, Shancai.

8
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,464
My God!
Shancai, what happened to your face?

9
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,166
What happened?

10
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,735
Mrs. Dong, because...

11
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,837
Because when Shancai was on her motorbike,

12
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,039
a police dog suddenly came out.

13
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,440
Shancai wasn't able to dodge him.

14
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,708
She wasn't able to hit the brakes

15
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,244
when she turned to the side
and she hit a tree, so...

16
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,746
Did she hit a tree?

17
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,913
That's how she get hurt.

18
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,649
Did anything happen to the tree?

19
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,083
-No.
-No?

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
Gosh, that was close.

21
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,654
I was afraid the school would want me
to pay for that tree.

22
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,656
-They won't.
-How can I afford it?

23
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,660
Gosh, Shancai. I'm sorry.
I'm also very worried about you.

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,827
Here, sit down.

25
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,663
I'll get the first aid kit.

26
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,899
You'll get better after I put
some medicine on you.

27
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,602
You look so bad this way.

28
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,171
Gosh. Why did you do all this

29
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,407
just for a dog? A dog.

30
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,177
You wouldn't be able to save a stray dog.
You'll turn into a stray girl yourself.

31
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,211
And...

32
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,281
Shancai, gosh.

33
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,183
-You have to be careful going forward.
-Okay.

34
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,753
Remember that the face
is very important for a girl.

35
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,955
I'll use iodine...

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,657
-Li Zhen, thank you.
-It's okay.

37
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,626
-Please take care of Shancai.
-Okay.

38
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,794
-Please.
-Okay.

39
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:19,066
You know that Shancai and Daoming Si
are dating, right?

40
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,170
You have to help them. Create some
opportunities for them in school.

41
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,840
So that she and Daoming Si can,
you know...

42
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:27,974
-You know...
-Mom.

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,777
You know, so that she won't
get hurt again.

44
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,345
Let's put some medicine.

45
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,148
It's good that it hurts.

46
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,185
Don't be scared. It's good that it hurts.

47
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,553
Or else how would it get better?

48
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,054
You have to endure it.

49
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,756
Gosh.

50
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,560
Hey, Ah Si.
Until when will you be drinking?

51
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,662
We are so bored.

52
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,464
There are so many mosquitos here.

53
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,099
And there are no girls.

54
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,634
There's nothing to do.

55
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,370
We're not the type
who would come here to drink.

56
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,346
This is what brokenhearted people do.

57
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,783
Drink while sitting by the river
with the cold wind blowing.

58
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,219
Then look at a faraway direction.

59
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,487
And suddenly take a sip.

60
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,757
It's even better
if there's sad background music.

61
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,058
It seems they can't show

62
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,994
how brokenhearted they are
if they don't do this.

63
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,929
Look over there.

64
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,399
Hey, I didn't notice it
if you didn't mention it.

65
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,306
Love is really bad for people.

66
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,015
Hey, it seems Ah Si
really had a lot to drink.

67
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,151
I'm afraid he'll continue
doing so the entire night.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,721
What should we do then?

69
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,891
There are two options.

70
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,161
One, give him more to drink
and get him drunk.

71
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,033
Then there's only one way left.

72
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,701
Let's knock him out with the beer bottle

73
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,936
and get him unconscious,

74
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,305
so that we don't need
to get into such a sad mood here.

75
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,042
Will you do it or will I?

76
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,678
You, of course.
I've never hit one of our own before.

77
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,480
Have I ever done that then?
If Ah Si gets back at me tomorrow,

78
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,481
what should I do?

79
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,184
Then... let's do it together.

80
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,953
None of us will be on the losing end.

81
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,254
All right.

82
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,456
-Hey.
-Hey.

83
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,193
Where's Ah Si?

84
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,774
Daoming Si, are you okay?

85
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,343
Why did you drink so much?

86
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,778
What do you care?

87
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,848
But you...

88
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,517
Tell me.

89
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,620
Why did you betray me?

90
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,924
Why are so you bad?

91
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,327
You crushed my heart

92
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,397
in just one night.

93
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,302
If your goal is to step on my pride,

94
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,104
you did it.

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,275
How can you just tell me...

96
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,578
to believe you?

97
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,916
What exactly do you want me to do?

98
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,757
I... I'm not...

99
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,965
<i>I feel so happy to be able to look at you</i>

100
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,633
<i>at such a close distance.</i>

101
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,303
<i>This kind of happiness
only existed in my dreams.</i>

102
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,739
<i>Yet it's so real now.</i>

103
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,607
<i>You must not know</i>

104
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,376
<i>that I've always liked you.</i>

105
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,212
<i>I really hope time stops right now.</i>

106
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,914
<i>Because when you wake up,</i>

107
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,150
<i>all of this will end.</i>

108
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,754
<i>It's also time for me
to hide all of it again.</i>

109
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,862
Are you awake?

110
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,664
I'll get you some water.

111
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,033
There's no need.

112
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,467
Where are we?

113
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,569
We're in a hotel.

114
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,705
A hotel?

115
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,707
Why am I here?

116
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,676
I brought you here.

117
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,979
Because you said
you don't want to go home.

118
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,881
What time is it now?

119
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,149
It's around 9 a.m.

120
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:10,817
It's 9 a.m.?

121
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,222
Why did you drink so much?

122
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,692
Is it because of the pictures?

123
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,827
What do you care?

124
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,629
What right do you have to interfere?

125
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,231
Do you know that you kissed me earlier?

126
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,971
So what?

127
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,275
I know.

128
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,444
You may have kissed me earlier,

129
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,612
but you saw Shancai,

130
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,680
and not me.

131
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,782
I don't mind, though.

132
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,119
Because I can see your pain.

133
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm so foolish.

134
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,062
I've disgraced myself.

135
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,832
I don't blame you, though.

136
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,335
Because I know that when you love someone,

137
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,304
you'll only remember

138
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,540
the good things about her
no matter how she treats you.

139
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,311
And you can't see anyone else.

140
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,079
You can only see her.

141
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,948
You also don't care about
what other people think.

142
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,283
Daoming Si, I don't care
what other people think.

143
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,751
I just want you to believe me.

144
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,354
That was just a misunderstanding.
I don't care what others think of me.

145
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,655
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

146
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,292
No matter what happens,
it cannot diminish your love for her.

147
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,927
I'm the same as you.

148
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,496
Daoming Si.

149
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,434
Go away.

150
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,737
Why are you treating me this way?

151
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,607
If Shancai can do it, I can too!

152
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,675
I can speak loudly
and walk with big steps like her!

153
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,911
I can also pretend to be strong!

154
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,181
As long as you like it,
I can change for you.

155
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,016
I can change everything for you!

156
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,018
You and Shancai are different.

157
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,121
If you continue talking,
I won't play nice.

158
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,292
Also,

159
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,895
don't ever mention what happened today.

160
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,879
This wench can still fight back.

161
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,314
How can she have this much energy?

162
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,551
How can I lose to weak heirs like you?

163
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,785
Let me tell you.

164
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,188
Your punches are lighter
than mosquito bites.

165
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,255
Say that again.

166
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,795
-You bunch of--
-Stop talking.

167
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,967
-I'll...
-Stop talking.

168
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,585
Shancai.

169
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,321
Can't get up anymore? You wench.

170
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,056
Daoming Si.

171
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,058
Daoming Si, Shancai betrayed you.

172
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,578
If you say you didn't do it,

173
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,481
I believe you.

174
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,507
Hey, I'm fine.

175
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,108
You can put me down now.

176
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,846
Hey, this doesn't look good.

177
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,548
Put me down.

178
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,453
I can walk by myself. Put me down.

179
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,056
It's not easy to finally hold on to you,
how can I easily let you go?

180
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,860
Get inside.

181
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,896
-Where are we going?
-Home.

182
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,432
-Whose home?
-My home, Miss.

183
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,100
Why should I go to your home?

184
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,935
Your parents would worry
seeing you this way.

185
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,870
-I don't want to go to your house.
-Do as I say.

186
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,539
-I don't want to.
-Hurry.

187
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,215
Hey, you can let go of me now.

188
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,217
It hurts a bit this way.

189
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,286
Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,761
<i>My body hurts all over,</i>

191
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,232
<i>but why does my heart feel a bit happy?</i>

192
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,103
-Where are they?
-They're inside.

193
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,939
Young Master... What happened?

194
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,140
What happened to this girl?

195
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,742
Prepare a room and a bath for me.

196
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,910
-Hurt.
-Did you hear that? Go.

197
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,147
Help carry her.

198
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,315
Can you walk?

199
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,416
Yes, I can.

200
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,523
Miss, I'll prepare your bath.

201
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,992
-Thank you.
-Miss, I'll help you undress

202
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,460
-and wash your clothes.
-There's no need.

203
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,462
I'll just wash them myself later.
Thank you.

204
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,997
If we don't do these things,

205
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,399
Young Master will scold us.

206
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm really fine, though.

207
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,602
I can do it myself.

208
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,904
Then at least let me dress your wounds.

209
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,840
I can do it later, thanks.

210
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,208
Miss, your bath has been prepared.

211
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,376
Shall I help you bathe?

212
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,811
-Help me bathe? There's no need.
-Yes.

213
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:12,979
-I can bathe myself.
-It's okay.

214
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,181
-Really, I'll help you bathe.
-There's really no need, thanks.

215
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,683
-There's really no need, thanks.
-We also help the Young Master, Miss.

216
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,192
This bathroom is huge.

217
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,965
No wonder Daoming Si said
our house is so small.

218
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,580
<i>Our classmates bullied me badly,</i>

219
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,048
<i>yet I didn't cry.</i>

220
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,085
If you say you didn't do it,

221
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,289
I believe you.

222
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,763
<i>Why can't I stop crying</i>

223
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,298
<i>when he held me?</i>

224
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,868
<i>Why did he come
and risk his life to save me?</i>

225
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,338
<i>At that time, though,</i>

226
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,006
<i>I really felt he can protect me.</i>

227
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,842
<i>And not let anyone harm me.</i>

228
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,812
It's not easy to finally hold on to you,
how can I easily let you go?

229
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,282
<i>What does that mean?</i>

230
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,118
<i>I don't know. I can't figure it out.</i>

231
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,531
Young Master.

232
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:41,968
You can go out first.

233
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,013
By the way, I called your house

234
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,616
and told them you'd spend the night here.

235
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,452
I don't know why your mom
sounded so excited, though?

236
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,288
My mom is hopeless.

237
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,694
Hey, why is your hair different?

238
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,164
I just showered.

239
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,833
My hair looks like this when it's wet.

240
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,035
It'll go back to normal when it dries.

241
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,820
Come here.

242
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,324
Why are you asking me to go there?

243
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,129
I'll dress your wounds.

244
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,507
It hurts.

245
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,142
Stop whining.

246
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,211
-It really hurts.
-Don't move. I told you...

247
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,748
Hey, can you be more gentle?

248
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,418
-Will you take responsibility if it scars?
-I'll take responsibility.

249
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,060
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,965
Actually, you got hurt because of me.

251
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,400
Sorry.

252
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,540
Did you really sleep with that blondie?

253
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,409
Moron, are you stupid?

254
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:33,813
What do you mean?

255
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,248
I'm not stupid enough
to sleep with that foreigner.

256
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,316
What a big, stupid fool.

257
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,622
Don't tell me you're jealous?

258
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,090
I am.

259
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,158
And I'm really jealous.

260
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,994
I want to kill that guy!

261
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,261
What a bastard!

262
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,035
Because I like you.

263
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,905
I really like you.

264
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,508
Don't do this.

265
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,848
Be careful!

266
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,759
Why is your face so red?

267
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,195
How can we continue then?

268
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,764
You're the same.

269
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,766
Your face is as red as a monkey's behind.

270
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,901
I...

271
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,302
I'm going to bed.

272
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,337
Your maid prepared a room for me.

273
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,208
Shancai.

274
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,378
I'm serious.

275
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,713
Think about it.

276
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,247
Okay.

277
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,091
<i>I never thought he'd like me
for what I am.</i>

278
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,860
<i>And I never thought I'd let him kiss me.</i>

279
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,929
<i>What's the matter with me?</i>

280
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,897
<i>What should I do?</i>

281
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,058
How strange. Where's my room?

282
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,261
Which one is it?

283
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,845
Miss Shancai, please have a seat.
Please enjoy your breakfast.

284
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,980
Thank you.

285
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,655
Miss Shancai, these are your clothes.

286
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,557
It's already been washed and ironed.

287
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,459
And we also mended the broken parts.

288
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,795
Originally, we prepared
a new set of clothes for you,

289
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,430
but Young Master said
you'd never accept them.

290
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,766
So we'll just give you back
your old clothes.

291
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,436
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Please enjoy your meal.

292
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,672
After you finish eating,

293
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,307
we'll let you take a look at something.

294
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,581
Do you really need to stand here?

295
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,984
Miss Shancai, may I inform you

296
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,620
that this is how we do it
at the Daoming household.

297
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,008
Miss Shancai, may I inform you

298
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,477
that we really don't know
how to fix your motorbike.

299
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,879
And it's already beyond repair.

300
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,081
So Young Master especially asked us

301
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,251
to buy a new one to compensate you.

302
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,321
Here, this is your key.

303
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:36,956
Thank you.

304
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,725
Where's Daoming Si?

305
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,227
I want to thank him.

306
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,496
May I inform you
that Young Master already left.

307
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,432
-He left so early?
-Yes.

308
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,000
When he went out earlier,

309
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,704
he kept mentioning "revenge."

310
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,973
-What? Revenge?
-Yes.

311
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,014
Help!

312
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,250
We can't do it anymore.

313
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,619
Young Master, stop dragging us around.

314
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,255
-We can't do it anymore.
-It's so funny.

315
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,457
What idiots. Why are they so stupid?

316
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,859
Hey, have you seen Daoming Si?

317
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,561
-He's over there.
-He's over there.

318
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,663
We can't do it anymore! Spare us!

319
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,276
What are you doing?

320
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,044
Why did you tie them behind your car?

321
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,746
Don't you know this is against the law?

322
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,114
I'm avenging you.

323
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,283
They were the ones
who dragged your bike two days ago.

324
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,118
I want them to experience being dragged.

325
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,953
And I didn't tie them up.

326
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,421
They just don't dare to let go.

327
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,357
-Right?
-Yes, you're right.

328
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,562
As for the ones who beat you up yesterday,

329
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,231
I'll hang them upstairs later.

330
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,034
Are you crazy? Let them go.

331
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,269
Hey! I'm avenging you.

332
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,704
There's no need.

333
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,374
Unless you're not mad anymore.

334
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,009
Okay, I'm not mad anymore.

335
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,244
-Really?
-Okay.

336
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,347
Leave!

337
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,016
-Thank you, Young Master Daoming Si.
-Thank you, Young Master Daoming Si.

338
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,352
Hey.

339
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,287
I prepared something for you to see.

340
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,026
She went inside herself.

341
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,562
And she also closed the door herself.
Ask her if you don't believe me.

342
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,998
Shancai, I was the one who came in here,

343
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,500
but I really didn't take those pictures.

344
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,136
And I didn't post them
on the bulletin board.

345
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,806
You have to believe me, okay?

346
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,442
Do you dare to say it's not you?

347
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,677
-Shave her brows.
-Yes, Young Master.

348
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:39,845
Let's see if you'll admit it.

349
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,549
Daoming Si.

350
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,319
Why? You believe her?

351
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,259
Shancai.

352
00:24:58,764 --> 00:24:59,765
I believe her.

353
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,602
All right. Let her go.

354
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,238
Come here. It's all right.

355
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,410
-Shancai, I'm sorry.
-Let's go.

356
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,178
-Shancai, thank you.
-I'm sorry.

357
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
Drive the car away.

358
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:19,885
Are you not mad anymore?

359
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:31,930
All right, I'm fine now.

360
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,265
I'm not mad anymore.

361
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,633
Are you sure?

362
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,808
Why are you two blushing again?

363
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,043
We're not.

364
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,012
-No?
-Did something happen again?

365
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,547
-Tell us! Did you...
-No.

366
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,783
-Did you or not?
-Since we were kids, your face

367
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,317
-always turns red when you lie.
-Tell us.

368
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,385
Don't run away. Tell us.

369
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:55,721
<i>Is he serious with what he said yesterday?</i>

370
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,089
<i>Isn't that a dream?</i>

371
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,591
Because I like you.

372
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,095
I really like you.

373
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,398
<i>However, that was so sudden.</i>

374
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:10,803
<i>I'm completely unprepared
to date Daoming Si.</i>

375
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,638
<i>I don't know if my heart...</i>

376
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm home.

377
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,624
Shancai, congratulations.

378
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,792
Why are you congratulating me?

379
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,727
We're having a party?

380
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,062
Why are we having a party?

381
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,199
-To celebrate.
-Celebrate what? Did Dad get promoted?

382
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,533
How can that happen to your dad?

383
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,869
Your dad has never been promoted
to any position in his life.

384
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,772
I'm even registered
as the head of the family.

385
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,041
What are we celebrating then?

386
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,844
We're celebrating marriage.

387
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,011
Who's getting married?

388
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,948
Come on. Don't be shy, Shancai.

389
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,683
-Shy about what?
-Gosh.

390
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,318
Why is Dad not home yet?

391
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,588
We've long reserved a three-tiered cake.

392
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,823
He's getting it now. He'll be right back.

393
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,526
Who exactly is getting married?

394
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,194
You.

395
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,662
-Me?
-Yes.

396
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,998
Of course, it's you.

397
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,702
Shancai, we're so proud of you.

398
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,637
Here, take a look

399
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,473
at the Cinderella progress chart.

400
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,942
There's only a small part left.

401
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,210
You don't know that your dad

402
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,046
and I were so happy we almost fainted

403
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,083
when Daoming Si called us.

404
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,651
Oh, please.

405
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,020
Nothing happened between us.

406
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,690
You mean, there was nothing done

407
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,992
that cannot be undone?

408
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,295
That's right, nothing was done
that cannot be undone.

409
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,566
Then what did you do all night
at his house?

410
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,568
Shower.

411
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,137
Then he dressed my wound.

412
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,806
Then he...

413
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,808
What did he do?

414
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,846
Then we went back
to our own rooms and slept.

415
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,982
That's it?

416
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,984
What do you think?

417
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,888
You can at least make use
of the time he was dressing your wound.

418
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,256
You can say,

419
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,492
"Oh, Ah Si, be more gentle."

420
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,428
"Ah Si, it hurts."

421
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,163
"Oh, Ah Si, ouch."

422
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,699
You can at least... Shan... Shancai.

423
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,801
Hey, I'm not done talking yet.

424
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,236
Shancai.

425
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,278
Young Master, you were looking for me?

426
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,785
Go and check

427
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,320
where these pictures were developed.

428
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,524
However, Young Master, let me inform you

429
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,627
that there are over 2,000
photography studios in Taiwan.

430
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,630
How many employees do we have
in the Daoming Enterprise?

431
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,098
Around 80,000.

432
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,666
Then ask them all to look for it.

433
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,336
I don't want reasons. Give me answers.

434
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,605
Yes, Young Master.

435
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,582
Shancai.

436
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,285
Qinghe, are you okay?

437
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,454
I'm fine, it's just a few scratches.

438
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,788
Are you okay?

439
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,957
I'm fine, but it still hurts until now.

440
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,025
Then let me rub it for you.

441
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,560
No, ouch.

442
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,462
What's inside the box?

443
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,230
These are materials for my computer class.

444
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,331
I'll help you carry it.

445
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,466
Thank you.

446
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,637
Chen Qinghe.

447
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,139
Try to get closer to her again.

448
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,173
Shancai.

449
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,742
What are you doing?

450
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,447
This is for you.

451
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,815
What's this?

452
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,019
You're so poor. Don't you know
this is a mobile phone?

453
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,121
It's a must-have for students these days.

454
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,756
Of course, I know it's a mobile phone.

455
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,457
I'm asking why you're giving me that.

456
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,526
I prepared this for you.

457
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,429
Come to me whenever I call you.

458
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,131
By the way,

459
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,233
my number is on speed dial one.

460
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,834
Don't forget.

461
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,773
<i>What is this guy doing?</i>

462
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,741
<i>What does he mean I should go
to him when he calls me?</i>

463
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,311
<i>Can't he be nicer in pursuing me?</i>

464
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,546
You big, stupid fool!

465
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,749
Didn't Daoming Si say
he won't talk to you anymore?

466
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,384
Why is he giving you a phone?

467
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,919
How would I know?

468
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,121
-You can check the weather.
-I see.

469
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,524
-Check the stock market news.
-I see.

470
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,093
Wow.

471
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,396
It's true. The refrigerator
has a computer in it.

472
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,998
You can also check recipes

473
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,299
in this computer.

474
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,501
-Yes.
-Stop moving them in.

475
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,904
-It doesn't fit anymore
-Shancai, come and take a look.

476
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,706
This is a flat-screen television.

477
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,809
And this refrigerator has a computer.

478
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,811
Mom, why did you buy all these?

479
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,679
We don't have money,
yet you're so wasteful.

480
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,448
I didn't buy them.

481
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,849
Then why do we have all these?

482
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,018
Daoming Si gave them to us.

483
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,253
-Daoming Si gave them to us?
-It's great, right?

484
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,890
Which high-class appliance
is making that sound?

485
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,459
What is that sound?

486
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,660
Is that the computer?

487
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,162
Mom, it's my phone.

488
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,197
Oh, I see.

489
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,932
Daoming Si, you big stupid fool!

490
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,700
<i>Why is the ringtone of the phone so bad?</i>

491
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,002
And why did you send
so many ridiculous things to my house?

492
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,471
-They won't fit.
-They'll fit.

493
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,739
Oh, please.

494
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,941
I gave you all the latest
electric appliances.

495
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,542
You should thank me, right?

496
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,778
Thank your face!
What exactly are you thinking?

497
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,747
All right, stop talking.
Come to the pub now.

498
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,515
-Hurry.
-You want me to go because you say so?

499
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,550
All right, let's talk
when you get here. Bye.

500
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,187
What a jerk! Mom, stop moving them inside.

501
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,622
I'll go out first. I'll be right back.

502
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,290
Why? Shancai.

503
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,392
I...

504
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,762
That's just how my daughter speaks.
Don't take it seriously.

505
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,197
Come and have a glass
of water inside, okay?

506
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,565
Thank you for your hard work.

507
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,867
Come on in.

508
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,368
Come in.

509
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,675
Why are you so slow?

510
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,577
Are you kidding? You're saying I'm slow.

511
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,112
I took a cab to get here.

512
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,747
I spent over 300 NT dollars.

513
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,215
That's nothing.

514
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,885
-Benny, this is my girlfriend.
-Okay.

515
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,020
-What are you doing?
-No wonder.

516
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,889
I seldom see you hang out at night lately.

517
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:05,991
Turns out you have a girlfriend.

518
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:09,261
-What do you think? She's nice, right?
-Yes, she is.

519
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,062
Sit down. Why are you standing there?

520
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,273
Why is this ice so big?

521
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,876
So that it will melt slower.

522
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,012
And it won't mix with the alcohol.

523
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,380
-I see.
-Here.

524
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,449
Why are you pouring me alcohol?

525
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,850
I didn't say I'm drinking.

526
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,819
And why did you ask me to come here?

527
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,554
Tell me, so I can leave.

528
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,289
Stay for a while.
Do you want to eat something?

529
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,191
-I'll order for you.
-No.

530
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,629
How nice. You're all here.

531
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,031
Lei, why are you back already?

532
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,166
Long time no see. I'm back.

533
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,469
Why are you back so suddenly?

534
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,103
When did you come back?

535
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,538
Last night.

536
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,073
You should have called us.

537
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,741
I wanted to give you a surprise.

538
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,610
Is anyone surprised?

539
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,712
We're not surprised at all.

540
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,284
Shancai.

541
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,819
Long time no see.

542
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,122
Welcome back.

543
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,025
Hey.

544
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,461
Shancai is my girlfriend now.

545
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,430
Wait, that's not the case.

546
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,898
What do you mean?

547
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:21,466
What a shame.

548
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,835
Hey, don't even think about it.

549
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,237
As the saying goes,

550
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,174
"You'd be trampled on by cows
if you destroy a friend's relationship."

551
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,709
It's "kicked by horses."

552
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,277
Don't mind him. Come on, sit down.

553
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,112
-Did you have fun in Paris?
-I did.

554
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,714
-Really?
-What would you like to drink?

555
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,582
-What are you drinking?
-The usual.

556
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,884
Then the same for me.

557
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,753
-Ximen, order for him.
-Give me a glass, please.

558
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,168
I like your type the most.

559
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,703
Do you want to kiss me?

560
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,743
You think you can get away with that peck?

561
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,145
I want a passionate one.

562
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,548
Why did you do that?

563
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,384
What time are you off? I'll wait for you.

564
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,152
Sure, you said that yourself.

565
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,387
Front door or back door?

566
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,489
Just wait for me at the front door.

567
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:20,659
I have to go.

568
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,995
-Why?
-I came here to tell you

569
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,797
to get your appliances back.

570
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,566
Hey, I'll drive you home.

571
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,401
There's no need. I can handle myself.

572
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,504
Why does she always do this?

573
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:33,772
Did she really leave?

574
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,373
Whatever you want.

575
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,775
Okay, you have to wait for me.

576
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,842
Okay.

577
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,186
<i>Why is Huaze Lei suddenly back?</i>

578
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,455
<i>What about Jing?</i>

579
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,290
<i>Is she also back?</i>

580
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,533
I'm home.

581
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:30,662
Hey.

582
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,365
Shancai is my girlfriend now.

583
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,968
<i>Gosh, why does he say it single-handedly?</i>

584
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,637
<i>However, why is my heart</i>

585
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,639
<i>feeling so uneasy?</i>

586
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,357
You think you can get away with that peck?

587
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,660
I want a passionate one.

588
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,929
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

589
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,931
<i>What time are you off? I'll wait for you.</i>

590
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,504
<i>Was that Huaze Lei earlier?</i>

591
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,239
<i>It's so hard to believe.</i>

592
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,241
<i>The Huaze Lei I know</i>

593
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,244
<i>is unconcerned about anything.</i>

594
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,913
<i>How can he easily kiss a girl?</i>

595
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,381
<i>What exactly happened to him?</i>

596
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,870
Hello.

597
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,006
Hi.

598
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,947
<i>Standing here and looking at him,</i>

599
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,849
<i>it seems he's the same as before</i>

600
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,350
<i>and nothing changed.</i>

601
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,658
Why are you staring blankly?

602
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,194
Nothing.

603
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,563
Was it fun in France?

604
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,331
It was okay.

605
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,333
There are dog poop everywhere.

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,836
-Dog poop?
-Yes.

607
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,338
You might step on them
when you go out every day.

608
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,180
<i>Should I ask him about Jing?</i>

609
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,754
Is Jing now...

610
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,056
Are you really dating Ah Si?

611
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,891
What?

612
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,927
I didn't say yes.

613
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,096
He just decided it on his own.

614
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,465
Really? That's great.

615
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,534
I've always wanted to pursue you too.

616
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,403
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

617
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,441
What do you think?

618
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,943
Can't I compare with Ah Si?

619
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,113
Are you really Huaze Lei?

620
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,522
I'm just kidding.

621
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,191
You're kidding?

622
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,194
That's right.

623
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,329
Ah Si is one of my best friends.

624
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,865
It's not good for me to do that.

625
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,038
Don't tell me you're disappointed?

626
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,608
I...

627
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,244
How about...

628
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,548
dating secretly behind his back?

629
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,617
Dating secretly?

630
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,486
What do you think?

631
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,758
Is this also a joke?

632
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,159
It's quite funny.

633
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,994
I'm going to class. I'll go ahead.

634
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,330
Shancai.

635
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,768
You've become prettier than before.

636
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:00,805
Thank you.

637
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,858
<i>My God.</i>

638
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,359
<i>What is happening to me?</i>

639
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,728
<i>Why did he become so frivolous?</i>

640
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,698
<i>He's no different from Ximen and Meizuo.</i>

641
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,600
<i>Gosh.</i>

642
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,401
<i>I took what he said seriously.</i>

643
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,539
You've become prettier than before.

644
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,346
Calm down.

645
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,438
What exactly am I doing?

646
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:31,963
Hello?

647
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,499
Did you find it?

648
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:36,968
Where?

649
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,039
Where did you go?

650
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,909
I... went to submit my report earlier.

651
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,545
I called you last night.

652
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,780
Where did you go?

653
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,114
Why didn't you answer your phone?

654
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:53,217
Nowhere. I slept early.

655
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,686
What were you looking for me?

656
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,422
-What time will you be off of your work?
-Ten o'clock.

657
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,023
I'll pick you up at ten o'clock later.

658
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,625
Where are we going?

659
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,026
You'll know later.

660
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:06,297
Hey, you're deciding on your own again.

661
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,003
Where are you going?

662
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,106
I'm telling you. I can't bear it

663
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,008
when someone wants to harm you
behind your back.

664
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,877
Thinking that you might be in danger,
I feel like I'm on pens and needles.

665
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,779
It's pins and needles.

666
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,449
Whatever. Anyway...

667
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,150
Why do we even have these pictures?

668
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,685
Who took them exactly?

669
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,654
I finally have the address of the person.

670
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,423
Don't you want to know who framed you?

671
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:34,559
I...

672
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,961
Of course, I want to know.

673
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,163
Then, enough talking. Let's go.

674
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:45,503
It's this one.

675
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,890
Coming.

676
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,429
Why are you here?

677
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,264
You're still pretending.

678
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,067
You took these pictures, right?

679
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,038
Daoming Si, you must be mistaken.

680
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,472
How can it be her?

681
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,940
She's Li Zhen.

682
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,009
It's definitely not her.

683
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,911
How can I make a mistake?

684
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,548
Why did you frame Shancai?

685
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,950
Isn't she your best friend?

686
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,954
Was it really you?

687
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,660
How is that possible?

688
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,063
You were drunk that day

689
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,231
and Qinghe took you home.

690
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,834
How is it possible that you
took these pictures?

691
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,670
Actually, I wasn't drunk that day.

692
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,305
Qinghe did take me home.

693
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,907
But then I followed you.

694
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,608
That way, you wouldn't suspect me.

695
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,680
-You did it on purpose?
-Actually, I didn't think too much of it.

696
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,283
When that foreigner took you
to a hotel, though,

697
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,085
it gave me an opportunity.

698
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:10,855
Li Zhen.

699
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,591
I never thought you were
that kind of person.

700
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:14,826
How could you say that?

701
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:20,164
You gave me the dress Daoming Si gave you
so that he would hate me

702
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,667
and make him look down on me.

703
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,769
So, you think you're better than me?

704
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,971
And if you were doing nothing wrong

705
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,073
do you think I could've had
a chance to take those photos?

706
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,877
You did such a shameful thing
and yet you're making excuses?

707
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,712
Why did you do that to me?

708
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,915
Aren't we best friends?

709
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,184
Best friends? Maybe.

710
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,289
If not for him,
I might have become your best friend.

711
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:49,560
In school, we're both commoners.

712
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,163
I even work 1,000 times harder than you.

713
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,564
I'm on a scholarship.

714
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,633
I'm first honor in school,

715
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,702
yet our classmates don't like me

716
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,036
and he hates me.

717
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:02,773
You're so ordinary,
