1
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,459
Shancai, your motorbike broke down again.

2
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,101
When exactly will you replace
that motorbike?

3
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,606
Look what happens to you every morning.

4
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,641
Your hands are so dirty because of it.

5
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,477
Wipe them clean.

6
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,346
Wipe them, go on.

7
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,217
By the way, that tissue holder is Gucci.

8
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,552
Remember to give it back to me.

9
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,921
If not for you,

10
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:04,191
our school has long entered
the Guinness Book of World Records.

11
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,461
That's because all students here
have cars.

12
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,440
STAFF PARKING AREA

13
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,180
Shancai, you're here?

14
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,181
Yes, I am.

15
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,384
What's the matter?
Your motorbike broke down again?

16
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,518
Yes.

17
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,054
It's fine, though.

18
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,891
-I'll just fix it later after my class.
-Okay.

19
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,927
Sir, please take care of my lunch today.

20
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,696
-Come eat it after class.
-Thank you.

21
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:43,964
In this entire school,

22
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,967
I think only you know
what an electric pot looks like.

23
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,554
<i>Prada bag.</i>

24
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,822
<i>So what?</i>

25
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,956
<i>Look at mine.</i>

26
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:46,927
<i>Burberry coat.</i>

27
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,895
<i>As if! Look at mine.</i>

28
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,903
<i>Limited edition diamond necklace.</i>

29
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,171
<i>Then I...</i>

30
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,742
So?

31
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,643
You have nothing else?

32
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,545
You lose.

33
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,683
No.

34
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,452
Come here. Get closer.

35
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,787
Look carefully.

36
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:14,688
What is it?

37
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,125
Look carefully. Come closer.

38
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,693
Look carefully.

39
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,233
Julia Robert's nose.

40
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,270
You didn't ask me
to have our noses fixed together.

41
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,341
This is limited edition.

42
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,376
I got it done in Beverly Hills.

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,479
One for Julia Roberts and one for me.

44
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,814
No wonder.

45
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,815
No wonder what?

46
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,917
I couldn't find you the whole summer.

47
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,286
Where did you look for me?

48
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,954
Paris.

49
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,090
Are you insane?

50
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,603
Hi, Li Zhen. Good morning.

51
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,738
Hi, good morning.

52
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,842
Hey.

53
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,677
Are you reading the original text?

54
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,313
Yes. Don't we need to submit
a report in Economics?

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,316
Didn't the professor say
that we should just read this one?

56
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,287
Well, I just feel that big-time professors
like Franklin must be strict.

57
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,055
He'd surely not let us
off the hook that easily.

58
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,191
So I wanted to refer to his original text

59
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,326
and use it to study
his theories carefully.

60
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,664
Then I'm doomed. I'll surely fail.

61
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,166
No, maybe I just overthought things.

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,502
Yes. You must have overthought things

63
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,637
because the professor
only asked us to read this one.

64
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,375
Actually, I think you're the only one
who really studies in this school.

65
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,945
The others don't study at all.

66
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,913
They just come here to socialize.

67
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,784
They flaunt their cars, their bags,
and their new clothes.

68
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,652
Qianhui is just too much.

69
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,387
Did you see her new nose?

70
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,056
It's worth NTD 500,000.

71
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,458
A nose worth NTD 500,000?

72
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,493
What's so good with that?

73
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,128
People who got their nose done

74
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,763
can't play the piggy nose game.

75
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,865
Why?

76
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,533
Because if they do this,

77
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,934
it will protrude from this side.

78
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,903
You're lying. Is that true?

79
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,272
If you don't believe me, try that on her.

80
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,640
You're kidding, right?

81
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,346
It's just been a week since I saw him.
He looks so haggard.

82
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,382
I heard he dropped out on his own.

83
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,617
He just came to get his things today.

84
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,787
If I were him, I don't ever want
to show my face in school again.

85
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,189
I'll leave without getting my things.

86
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,525
That's right. It's so embarrassing.

87
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,095
He looks like a ghost.

88
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,164
He's so pitiful.

89
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,899
Then go and talk to him.

90
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,769
I don't want to. What if the F4 finds out?

91
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,118
No, Shancai.

92
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,522
If you go and help him now,
who knows what the F4 will do to you.

93
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,593
But...

94
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,528
You have to know,

95
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,797
Ah Shu offended the F4 last week.

96
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,799
That's why he's forced to drop out now.

97
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,568
<i>What's so great about the F4?</i>

98
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,003
You think everyone's afraid of you?

99
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,271
I'm not afraid of you.

100
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,745
Do you know who you're talking to?

101
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,553
He got the red card.

102
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,954
That's right.

103
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,422
He offended the F4.

104
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,357
How can that happen?

105
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,726
-It's his fault.
-Yes.

106
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,395
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Let's go. Never mind.

107
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,574
What are you doing?
Why are you gathering around here?

108
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,744
Ah Shu is dropping out of school.

109
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,679
-Dropping out?
-Yes.

110
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,947
I'm his class adviser.

111
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,648
Did he ask my permission
before he dropped out?

112
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,549
Ah Shu.

113
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,284
Professor.

114
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,854
Ah Shu was forced to drop out
because of the F4.

115
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,358
That's ridiculous.

116
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,594
We can't allow troublemakers
in this school.

117
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,495
Yes.

118
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,462
Ah Shu.

119
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,768
Ah Shu.

120
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,070
Don't be a troublemaker.

121
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,908
You have to be good
after you leave this school. Okay?

122
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,746
Take care.

123
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,785
It's time for class.

124
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,143
Conscience.

125
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,146
It's also what you call
moral righteousness.

126
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,282
It's the foundation of being human.

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,086
In Chinese history,

128
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,621
the most famous righteous man
is Confucius.

129
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,891
Let's talk about
Confucius' thoughts today.

130
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,628
Confucius' central thought is benevolence.

131
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,732
Benevolence is displayed by
behaving as you would like others

132
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,367
to behave towards you.

133
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,403
Don't do unto others...

134
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,808
Shancai, what's the matter?

135
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,276
I want to take a dump.

136
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,481
You want to poop?

137
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,817
Do you have tissue?

138
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,507
What a crappy school and teacher!

139
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,175
A student was already forced to drop out.

140
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,511
He even said he's a troublemaker.

141
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,514
And he's even teaching us
about conscience. It's all bullshit!

142
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:58,558
Yingde University is full of childish,
materialistic, unsympathetic fools,

143
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,493
especially those F4.

144
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,861
They're big idiots!

145
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,897
Pig Head 4!

146
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,833
They bully people using their power.

147
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,868
So what if your family owns the school.

148
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,770
You better not mess with me.

149
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,605
I'll never submit to you.

150
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,073
If I really won't submit to them,

151
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,076
why didn't I help Ah Shu earlier?

152
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,449
I should go back to class.

153
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,933
Shancai, are you going
to Statistics class later?

154
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,502
I didn't enroll in any Statistics class
this semester.

155
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,470
Why?

156
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,505
Because I need to do part-time work.

157
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,642
Then I'll be attending Statistics class
alone from now on.

158
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,212
I...

159
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,855
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,891
I'm sorry. I didn't notice you.

161
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,860
You bumped into me.

162
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,430
If you had bumped into other students,
would you still apologize, Professor?

163
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,398
I will.

164
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,133
I'll wipe it for you. Here.

165
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,434
Professor.

166
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,202
You stepped on my foot.

167
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,471
I'm sorry. I'll wipe it for you.

168
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,942
If apologizing is enough,
what do we need the police for?

169
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,681
I know.

170
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,384
I'm a troublemaker in this school.

171
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,387
You won't see me again from now on.

172
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,555
Whatever. Get far away from me.

173
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,624
Don't hit me.

174
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,744
Young Master Daoming Si
is not in a good mood today.

175
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,814
How can you make a mess
in the school's beautiful corridor?

176
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,115
You shouldn't do that.

177
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,021
<i>I can't believe such an arrogant breed
of people exist in this world.</i>

178
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,375
Lei, what are you doing? Let's go.

179
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,226
<i>Is F4 really that awful?</i>

180
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,228
Yes, I'm telling you.

181
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,762
Especially their leader,

182
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,565
that Daoming Si, he's so despicable.

183
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,768
I really want to let you see
their evil and hateful looks.

184
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,605
I really want to see the F4.

185
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,874
Xiaoyou, what kind
of facial expression is that?

186
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,808
No.

187
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,577
Boys in other universities
are all so lame.

188
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,346
Please, what's wrong with that?

189
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,480
Let me tell you,

190
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,816
our school is no different from hell.

191
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,585
Because that school is owned
by their families,

192
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,288
it seems they want to train them to become
the successors of their families.

193
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,258
That's why they can do
whatever they want in school.

194
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,059
Nobody dares to say anything.

195
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,529
I get mad just thinking about it.
I'm not talking about them anymore.

196
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,797
Tell me about them. I'm interested.

197
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,798
I don't want to.

198
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,699
Tell me.

199
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,535
-No.
-Tell me.

200
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,036
No.

201
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,473
At least tell me why they're called F4.

202
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,844
The reason is hilarious.

203
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,380
F4 means Flower Four.

204
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,714
It's embarrassing, right?

205
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,785
That means they're
as beautiful as flowers.

206
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,187
And super rich.

207
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,589
You're so boy crazy.

208
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:40,459
I'm telling you,
the four of them may look good,

209
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,628
but they're all morons.

210
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,230
And they like bullying people.

211
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,598
They don't have any compassion.

212
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,133
I call them Pig Head 4.

213
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,002
Are they all as bad as you say they are?

214
00:17:55,708 --> 00:18:00,046
Maybe one of them is different.

215
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,416
It seems he's more decent than the others.

216
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,690
Shancai, are you interested
in the one that seems different?

217
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,325
I'm not.

218
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:13,793
I've long made my decision.

219
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,796
I'll stay away from trouble
for four years.

220
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,398
I won't interfere with anything
unrelated to me.

221
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,768
I don't belong in that school anyway.

222
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,704
If not for my mom,

223
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,906
I won't study in that school.

224
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,377
Shancai...

225
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,714
You've changed a lot
after you studied in Yingde.

226
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,483
I remember when we first met
each other in senior high,

227
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,186
a very fat guy in class was bullying me.

228
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,921
I already forgot his name.

229
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:45,024
You stood up for me
and forced him to apologize to me.

230
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,060
In the three years after that,

231
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,331
you were so nice to all of us,
to all our classmates.

232
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,203
I don't know why you've changed a lot now.

233
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,006
You're not the Shancai I know anymore.

234
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,715
<i>Actually, I also hate myself right now.</i>

235
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,785
<i>I'm such a coward.</i>

236
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,022
<i>I put on a mask every day
and pretend to smile.</i>

237
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,358
<i>I couldn't even help Ah Shu.</i>

238
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,795
<i>I'm just going with the flow
and waiting for time to pass by.</i>

239
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,898
<i>I shouldn't be this kind of person.</i>

240
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,526
I'm home.

241
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,762
Shancai, you're home.

242
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,097
Look at me.

243
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,166
Mom, you dyed your hair?

244
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,434
You noticed?

245
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,668
I did it myself.

246
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,037
I only spent NTD 260. I dyed it myself.

247
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,939
You look like a foreigner.

248
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:07,840
That's great.

249
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,242
It's also good if you can get
a foreigner boyfriend.

250
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,379
Did you meet any nice man in school today?

251
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,247
Mom, I go to school to study.

252
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,515
What does it have to do with men?

253
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,285
Study, yes. You have to study too.

254
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,220
However, your books are so expensive.

255
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,623
You have to meet nice men
so that it'll be worth it.

256
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,792
Mom, that's how you are.

257
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,027
You love to keep up appearances.

258
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,228
We don't have much money.

259
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,596
You have to live in such a big house.

260
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,331
You let me study
in such an expensive school.

261
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,100
Dad.

262
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,268
Are you pooping during dinnertime again?

263
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,269
You're right.

264
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,005
I should just study
in an ordinary university.

265
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,908
I'm telling you,
everyone in that school is crazy.

266
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,311
It seems they don't need
to study or make a living.

267
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,815
They just think about Louis Vuitton,
Prada, and Chanel all day.

268
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,551
My monthly allowance is just NTD 50,000.

269
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,320
I really don't belong with them.

270
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,592
Mom, can I not study there anymore?

271
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,161
That way, you don't need to have
such a hard time paying for my tuition.

272
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,863
What are you talking about?

273
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,866
That's called high society.

274
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,302
I'm hoping that you can be Cinderella,

275
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:15,541
and our family can enter the world
of the rich and famous through you.

276
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,979
That's why I spent that much money
and used all my contacts.

277
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,482
I owe people lots of favors
just to get you into that school.

278
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,918
Now you're telling me
you don't want to study there anymore.

279
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,688
Do you want to destroy...

280
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,792
my entire life's hope...

281
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,426
Mom, are you all right?

282
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,728
Hope...

283
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,062
Dad, where's the medicine?

284
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:37,997
In the cabinet.

285
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,732
-I see. Okay.
-Hope...

286
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,433
-Hope...
-Hey.

287
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,803
-Honey. Why...
-Hope...

288
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,005
Hurry. Inhale.

289
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,841
How are you? Feeling better?

290
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,679
...destroy my entire life's hope.

291
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,783
Better?

292
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,118
-Much better.
-Much better, right?

293
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,052
Okay.

294
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,788
It's fine now. Let's eat.

295
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,256
Shancai, let's eat.

296
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,257
Come on.

297
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,393
Don't... Don't eat anymore.

298
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,829
-I only had...
-You've already had four bowls.

299
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,231
There's nothing left
for your daughter anymore.

300
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,033
Well... You're even blaming me for that.

301
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,334
You nearly finished all the dishes.

302
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,869
Who should I blame if not you?

303
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,804
It's all your fault.

304
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,606
You've been working at your company
for 20 years.

305
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,309
You have not been promoted
to a team lead or something.

306
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,743
You're so slow.

307
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,945
Slow? No.

308
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,314
Didn't we have Shancai quickly?

309
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,116
Others don't move as slow as you.

310
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,753
Mr. Wang from next door
got promoted to vice president.

311
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,121
and got demoted twice.

312
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,057
At least he got promoted before.

313
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,526
Unlike you, you're still rank and file.

314
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,629
I'm telling you, there's nothing wrong
with that. Okay?

315
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,465
If you get demoted after being promoted,
the sense of loss would be great.

316
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,701
I've always remained the same
all these years.

317
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,003
I've always been rank and file.
I'm so stable.

318
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,539
There should be ups and downs in life.

319
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,009
Shancai, you're not aware that your dad
wanted to become a TV host

320
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,211
when he was younger.

321
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,214
-That's right.
-He was practicing this spiel daily...

322
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,115
No, you're wrong.

323
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:09,755
The native chicken in Puxin and Zhongli
smells so good and is so tender.

324
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,358
It's so good that it's bad.

325
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,960
That's so funny.

326
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,130
Is that funny?

327
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,899
You think you'd become popular that way?

328
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,236
Your dad is so impractical.

329
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,971
You're just like him.

330
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,706
It's so hard to get into an elite school.

331
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,441
Now you're saying you don't want
to study there.

332
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,244
-Look at Mr. Wang from next door.
-Mr. Wang!

333
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,080
-Yes!
-Why are you talking about Mr. Wang again?

334
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,850
Mr. Wang is more practical than you.

335
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:38,984
How is he more practical?

336
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,754
You're useless at the office.

337
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,056
You're even more useless at home.

338
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:47,159
Mr. Wang always makes his wife happy.

339
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,528
You can't even do it once a month.

340
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,963
You're a mother.

341
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,998
How can you talk about that
in front of your daughter?

342
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,466
That's how you are.

343
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,768
You're so soft and weak.

344
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,002
When am I soft and weak?

345
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,437
Only your head is hard.

346
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,505
All right. My head is hard.

347
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,674
Then let me tell you,
you're small everywhere.

348
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,142
The only thing that's big is your mouth.

349
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,276
You nag all day.

350
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,245
-All you do is--
-Enough! Stop arguing!

351
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,181
I'll continue studying in that school.

352
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,186
All right. That's great.

353
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,221
Actually, you're hard all over.

354
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,158
Yes. Actually, you're shapely
in all the right places. It's true.

355
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,993
You can eat this.

356
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,428
Shancai is on a diet anyway.

357
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,429
Never mind.

358
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,764
I forgot to tell you that your breasts
are bigger than your butt.

359
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,665
Sorry about that.

360
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,781
Why are you looking at me?

361
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,156
I don't want to be this way too.

362
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,912
Why are we in such a strange place?

363
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,050
You finally figured out how to tame
your bushy hair.

364
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,887
Roger worked on it the whole afternoon.

365
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,922
He said my hair was thick and stiff.

366
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,857
I almost threw a fit
while he's working on it.

367
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,661
Since you already changed your hairstyle,
why not choose a nicer one?

368
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,496
Did I ask for your opinion?

369
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,833
Hey, Lei, what do you think?

370
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,675
I can't do anything
even if you don't like it.

371
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,677
Roger said that with my hair texture,

372
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,080
it might return to its original state
after eight hours.

373
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,082
You're satisfied
even for just eight hours?

374
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,705
-Meizuo.
-Yes.

375
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,307
Ask them to serve some food.

376
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,382
One foie gras mousse, please.

377
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,717
What?

378
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,652
Foie gras mousse.

379
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,387
We don't have that here.

380
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,892
Then do you have any vintage red wine?

381
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,795
We don't have red wine.
Do you want to take a look at the menu?

382
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:10,696
Never mind.

383
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,667
Why did we come to this place?

384
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,669
We can't order anything.

385
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:18,804
Because of Ximen.

386
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,140
His new girl wants to meet here.

387
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:35,787
Hey.

388
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,524
Do you really think she'll call
if he waits like that?

389
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,581
Why are you here?

390
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,651
You play quite well.

391
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,924
Be gentle with the lady.

392
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,092
Do you know whose girlfriend she is?

393
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,360
Have you checked?

394
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,666
I did, and I know her boyfriend
is very lame.

395
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,301
So I don't need to play nice.

396
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,569
Do you know who you're talking to?

397
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,836
Do you know who you're talking to?

398
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:30,842
What's up?

399
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,686
Be gentle with ladies next time.

400
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,105
I'll call you tomorrow.

401
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,957
You're the owner?

402
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,028
This NTD 15,000 is for the damages.

403
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,172
Is it heavy?

404
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,507
Do you want me to help you?

405
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,642
No, it's just some old documents
and toner cartridges.

406
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,610
It's quite light.

407
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,611
-Really?
-Yes.

408
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,012
It looks heavy.

409
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,448
Shancai, do you want to watch
a movie after school?

410
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,087
That was close.

411
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,889
Behind you...

412
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:25,657
What's behind me?

413
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,595
What are you screaming about?

414
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,931
So... Sorry.

415
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,302
Why does everyone keep apologizing to me?

416
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,338
Paul Smith?

417
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,376
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

418
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,914
If apologizing is enough,
what do we need the police for?

419
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,916
I'll... wipe it for you.

420
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,184
Get lost!

421
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,363
Stop!

422
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,066
Didn't she already apologize?

423
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,968
Can't you forgive her?

424
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,103
Why?

425
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,406
You want to make a show
of your cheap friendship?

426
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,479
What does parasites like you
know about friendship?

427
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,047
Parasites?

428
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,014
That's right.

429
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,350
You're self-centered
and you think you're so cool.

430
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:29,054
You even formed F4
and gang up on people in school.

431
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,722
You should be called Pig Head 4.

432
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,724
You're parasites living off your fathers.

433
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:33,859
You've never earned any money.

434
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,427
You don't have
any contribution to society.

435
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,496
How dare you speak so arrogantly here?

436
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,802
You've got some nerve.

437
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,711
<i>I'm dead meat now.</i>

438
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,031
Shancai, you're home.

439
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,266
Yes.

440
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,700
What's the matter?

441
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,868
Nothing.

442
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,439
Mom.

443
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,208
If I tell you I can't study there anymore,
what would you do?

444
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,479
Honey.

445
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,181
All right. I'm just saying it.

446
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,782
I'll study there even if I die.

447
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,217
Good.

448
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,252
I knew our daughter

449
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,321
-has strength of character.
-...has strength of character.

450
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,157
-How can she not continue studying there?
-No, that wouldn't happen.

451
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,360
<i>Goodness.</i>

452
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,398
<i>I've been praying to live
a peaceful life more than anyone.</i>

453
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,468
<i>I just want to exist unnoticed.</i>

454
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,803
<i>Now, I'm doomed.</i>

455
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,011
Don't come near me.

456
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:01,279
No.

457
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,582
Don't come near me.

458
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,494
Help!

459
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,712
<i>Please don't have F4's red card.</i>

460
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,080
<i>Please don't.</i>

461
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:37,816
<i>What?</i>

462
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,484
<i>There's really nothing here.</i>

463
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,021
<i>How is that possible?</i>

464
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,605
<i>What's going on? Everybody's avoiding me.</i>

465
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,034
I think she's dead meat this time.

466
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,057
<i>There's really no escaping it.</i>

467
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,031
FIRST ROUND

468
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,441
CLASS EXAMINATION

469
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,410
<i>What are they doing?</i>

470
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,084
<i>What... What does this mean?</i>

471
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,654
Shancai, what are you doing?

472
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,758
You're cheating.

473
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,859
I'm not.

474
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,926
You're not?

475
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,061
This is your cheat sheet.

476
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,763
Here's the proof.
And you're saying you're not?

477
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,798
Professor, I'm really not cheating.
They were framing me.

478
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,299
They threw those at me.

479
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,001
Who's framing you? Point them out to me.

480
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,002
Point them out to me.

481
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:12,971
Nobody did that.

482
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,773
You're cheating and even arguing about it.

483
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,141
You don't need to take the exam.

484
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,442
Pack up and leave the classroom.

485
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,278
Cheating.

486
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,147
Zero points.

487
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,315
You get zero points when you cheat.

488
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,217
How shameful.

489
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,922
Shancai!

490
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,891
You failed this subject.

491
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,826
Don't come to class anymore. Scram!

492
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,035
What a bad student.

493
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,105
Continue your exam.

494
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:52,844
SECOND ROUND

495
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,794
THIRD ROUND

496
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,806
Who are you? What are you doing?

497
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,777
Let me out. Why did you lock me up?

498
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,011
You bastards! Let me out!

499
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,458
I really can't stand you.

500
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,460
You bought another diamond necklace.

501
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,361
It was a gift.

502
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,696
Who gave it to you?

503
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,365
Is it that Wang guy?

504
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,100
Hey.

505
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,403
Is this your so-called cheap friendship?

506
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,474
You offended the F4 because of her.

507
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,277
Now she's not even talking to you.

508
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,112
Is it worth it?

509
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,721
FOURTH ROUND

510
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,893
So typical.

511
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,472
Stop kidding around! This is too much!

512
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,221
Where's Shancai? Did you see her?

513
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,390
Let's take a look on that side.

514
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,992
-Let's see where Shancai is.
-Where is she? Come on.

515
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,632
I'm so tired and hungry.

516
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,004
I think even weeds
cannot survive this way.

517
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,077
Li Zhen.

518
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,715
You should go.

519
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,318
It's not good if F4
and the others see you.

520
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,721
I'm fine. You don't have to worry.

521
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,476
<i>Shancai, I'm sorry.</i>

522
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:51,189
<i>Shancai, I'm sorry.</i>

523
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,597
<i>Shancai, I'm sorry.</i>

524
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,778
Whoever wants to bully me
can just bring it on!

525
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,060
You jerks!

526
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,461
You stupid fools!

527
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,564
I curse you to spend all your money
and go bankrupt!

528
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,234
Get fat and die from high cholesterol!

529
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,269
And go to hell after you die!

530
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,305
Especially Pig Head 4!

531
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,840
Your bodies will be ripped apart
by horses in the end!

532
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,843
And then?

533
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,681
Why are you here?

534
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,018
You can bully me.

535
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,120
However, you have to wait a bit.

536
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,823
I have to rest first.

537
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,297
Wipe yourself clean.

538
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,186
Thank you.

539
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,259
I'm sorry I said those things earlier.

540
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,161
Because I was just...

541
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,529
It doesn't matter.

542
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,166
I'm not interested
in other people's business.

543
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,536
Hey, your handkerchief.

544
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,539
Throw it away.
It's already garbage anyway.

545
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,081
Silly me.

546
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,584
I thought he's different
from the other three.

547
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,285
I'm such an idiot.

548
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,486
I have good news and bad news.

549
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,922
The good news is,

550
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,824
your endurance earned my respect.

551
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,659
The bad news is,

552
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,861
I'll work even harder to bully you.

553
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,517
