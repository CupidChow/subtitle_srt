1
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,424
Good morning, Young Master.

2
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,329
Why did you get up so early?

3
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,397
How can I sleep?

4
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:44,137
I've made my decision
regarding what you said last night.

5
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,608
I'm willing to give it a try.

6
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,979
I will do my best to date you
in the next two months.

7
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,747
I'm looking forward to this.

8
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,053
Hey.

9
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:02,689
Hey.

10
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,228
Did you hear me?

11
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,297
Daoming Si.

12
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,967
I heard you. Why are you yelling at me?

13
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,670
Why are you being shy?

14
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,072
I'm not blushing.

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,508
I'll get dressed for school then.

16
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,574
Really? When did this happen?

17
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,109
It's been two or three days.

18
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,744
I see.

19
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,882
But who would set a trial period
when they are dating someone?

20
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,418
A two-month trial period.

21
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,019
That is ridiculous.

22
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:10,524
Yes, Daoming Si warned me
to keep away from Shancai today.

23
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,426
He said Shancai was his girlfriend,

24
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,795
and if I didn't understand what he meant,

25
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,896
he would do it the hard way.

26
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,031
He was just joking with you.

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,600
You know what?

28
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,970
Everyone is flattering Shancai
at school now.

29
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,307
They treat her nicely, but it's all fake.

30
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,009
She isn't happy at all.

31
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,911
They don't match each other.

32
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,948
If only you could see them eating together
at the student restaurant,

33
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,117
you would know how awkward it is.

34
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,090
I keep encouraging Shancai
to face her love seriously,

35
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,227
but Daoming Si and she
are from two different worlds.

36
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,064
If they failed to overcome it,

37
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,400
things would only get more complicated
in the future.

38
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,401
You're right.

39
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,369
She made a mistake
when she decides to date Daoming Si.

40
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,804
If she were with me,

41
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,340
I would guarantee
that nothing bad would happen to her.

42
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,145
<i>That's because everyone ignores you.</i>

43
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,981
-Xiaoyou.
-Yeah?

44
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,082
How about this?

45
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,317
You can help me with this.

46
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,486
Let's separate them together. Shall we?

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,955
We'll make them break up in two months.

48
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,225
Qinghe, how could you be so mean?

49
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,227
Shancai is our friend.

50
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,130
We should be rooting for her.

51
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,832
I know you love Shancai so much,

52
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,769
but love is all about letting her do
what she wants to do.

53
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,104
"Love is all about letting her do
what she wants to do"?

54
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,405
But I'm so upset.

55
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,841
Hello, Shancai.

56
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:35,842
It's me.

57
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,078
You're with Daoming Si now.

58
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,814
Qinghe told me.

59
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,449
He's at our store.

60
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,052
Don't get upset.

61
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,954
You should try to fight for it.

62
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,291
Besides, haven't we already known
the rules?

63
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,861
You shouldn't completely obey him,

64
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,563
but you should take a step back

65
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,298
so he can adjust to you.

66
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,203
How?

67
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,405
I got an idea.

68
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,874
I'm going on a date
with my boyfriend this Sunday.

69
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,243
You should join us with Daoming Si,

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,612
so it will be a double date.

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,516
This is a super normal date.

72
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,151
Xiaoyou.

73
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,987
-You'll see if he can get along with you.
-Xiaoyou, wait.

74
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,556
-This Sunday.
-Aren't you going to help me?

75
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,757
10 a.m. this Sunday, and...

76
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,825
Okay, hang up already.

77
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,393
-Okay, bye-bye.
-Xiaoyou.

78
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,096
Fine, you win.

79
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,898
I don't care.

80
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,535
<i>Was Shancai nervous?</i>

81
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,237
That's impossible.

82
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,673
I think she was just excited.

83
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,308
You must get the wrong idea.

84
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,977
I could tell at once
she wasn't excited, okay?

85
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,478
Didn't you notice that?

86
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,547
There's often doubt in her eyes.

87
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,050
She is always hesitant
when she's talking to you.

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,551
If you don't try harder,

89
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,920
you'll surely break up after two months.

90
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,523
Maybe you can't even make it
through these two months.

91
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,463
I know.

92
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,831
You must be jealous of me, right?

93
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,967
-Jealous, my ass.
-Jealous, my ass.

94
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,402
The two months will be over very soon.

95
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,004
You're on your own by then.

96
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,574
If you don't try harder,
no one will be able to help you then.

97
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,742
You.

98
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,480
What's the matter?

99
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,250
I have something to tell you.

100
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,588
Go ahead.

101
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,992
It's... Well...

102
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,960
Let's go out on a date, okay?

103
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,469
We'll hang out on Sunday.

104
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,339
Okay, I have nothing to do anyway.

105
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,340
Let's hang out.

106
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,508
Great.

107
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,143
You two are seriously going out on a date.

108
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,578
Shut up.

109
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,380
I have nothing to do, so...

110
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,714
Come on.

111
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,316
Don't hold back your feelings anymore.

112
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,785
You're so happy, so what's the point
of pretending you don't care?

113
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,787
Do you remember my friend Xiaoyou?

114
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:01,955
Xiaoyou.

115
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,090
Yeah.

116
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,193
That cute girl with round eyes.

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,795
Yeah, that's her.

118
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,330
She has a boyfriend.

119
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,833
She hopes the four of us
can go out on a date.

120
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,803
A double date.

121
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,140
Yeah, we'll meet at the amusement park
at 10 a.m. on Sunday.

122
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,075
Isn't it too corny?

123
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,011
This is what a normal date looks like.

124
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,315
I hope you could adapt to my habits
and my ways to do things sometimes.

125
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,516
Shancai.

126
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,385
You're a college student,
not a high school student.

127
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,788
Ximen, it's nothing wrong.

128
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,456
It is a double date,

129
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,526
but it's the first time
Shancai asked for something.

130
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,361
You should do it.

131
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,264
Why should I go out on a date
with someone I don't know?

132
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,067
Why should I adapt to your habits
and your ways to do things?

133
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,202
I shouldn't have been so happy.

134
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,670
Forget it.

135
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,006
Why are you so upset?

136
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,175
Don't you even want to try it?

137
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,610
I already said no.

138
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,081
For him,

139
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,516
I think it's better if he won't be there.

140
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,353
But can't he take a step back for me?

141
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,622
You know, Ah Si isn't a normal person.

142
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,927
He doesn't understand things
like sacrifice or dedication.

143
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,162
I won't ask him out.

144
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,831
He will die
if he takes a step back for me.

145
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,367
What's the meaning
of our relationship? I quit.

146
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,385
Shancai.

147
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,319
Xiaoyou.

148
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,420
Did you just arrive here?

149
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,521
Yes.

150
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,989
This is my boyfriend Zhongze.

151
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,958
Hello, I'm Shancai.

152
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,227
I know you. Xiaoyou talks about you a lot.

153
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,863
<i>What a surprise.</i>

154
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,431
<i>He's pretty handsome.</i>

155
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,468
<i>But doesn't Xiaoyou like
those nice and caring boys?</i>

156
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,605
Shancai, where's your boyfriend?

157
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,673
He is busy right now.

158
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,076
Daoming Si won't be here?

159
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,979
No, I told him about this
but he couldn't make it.

160
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,149
That's okay,
the three of us will have a great time.

161
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,051
That's okay, I'll leave you here.

162
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,986
I just came here to tell you this.

163
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm leaving now, bye-bye.

164
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,955
That's okay, Shancai, come and join us.

165
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:16,990
That's okay, bye-bye.

166
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,024
Shancai.

167
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,627
Daoming Si.

168
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,729
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,931
I'm late
because I was caught in the traffic.

170
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,867
Daoming Si, long time no see.

171
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:29,602
Shancai.

172
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,104
Would you care to introduce us?

173
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,274
She's Xiaoyou. You knew her before.

174
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,242
He is Xiaoyou's boyfriend.

175
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,978
Hello, I'm Zhongze, nice to meet you.

176
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,114
Nice to meet you.

177
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,450
He's Daoming Si.

178
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,018
Is he your boyfriend?

179
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,620
You could say that.

180
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,490
Now everyone is here, let's get inside.

181
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,792
Let's grab something to eat. I'm starving.

182
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,060
Okay.

183
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,703
Didn't you say you won't be here?

184
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,205
I'm so surprised.

185
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,140
Shut up.

186
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,609
I'll only do it one time.
It will happen again when pigs fly.

187
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,710
"When pigs fly."

188
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,345
I didn't know you know idioms.

189
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,948
And you just said, "Nice to meet you."

190
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,416
Keep laughing and I'll hit you.

191
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,851
Fine.

192
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,327
Let's eat this, okay?

193
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,328
Okay.

194
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,929
Daoming Si, do you want some sausages?

195
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,265
Fine, I've never eaten one anyway.

196
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,034
You've never eaten sausages?

197
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,537
Are you kidding me? They're everywhere.

198
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,940
He must be a rich Young Master.

199
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,742
What would you eat at home?

200
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,545
Gold or pearls?

201
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,647
I've eaten pearl powder.

202
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,215
I've eaten gold dishes.

203
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,316
So what?

204
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,618
He's joking.

205
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,919
Let's get some now.

206
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,921
Oh, okay.

207
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,589
Excuse me. Four sausages, please.

208
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,524
Got it.

209
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,859
How about four corns?

210
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,461
How much is it?

211
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,329
It will be 320 NTD.

212
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,632
3... Hey, it's on me.

213
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:09,335
It's my honor to treat you
to your first sausage in your life.

214
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,604
-It's on me. 320 NTD, right?
-Yeah.

215
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,839
-Here you are.
-Okay.

216
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,175
183 centimeters.

217
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,342
183 centimeters.

218
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,710
You must be playing basketball.

219
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,479
I don't.

220
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,314
You don't.

221
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,715
That's okay.

222
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:27,187
A lot of tall guys are not that good
at sports, right?

223
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,289
-Stop it.
-I'm joking.

224
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,591
He's actually pretty good.

225
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,159
He just doesn't want to get sweaty.

226
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,327
Doesn't want to get sweaty?

227
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,163
It's my first time hearing a man
doesn't want to get sweaty.

228
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,333
Today's weather must make you
very uncomfortable, right?

229
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,702
He should bring his air conditioner
with him,

230
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,737
so he won't get sweaty, right?

231
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,105
Let's dig in.

232
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,273
Dig in, okay.

233
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,408
Does everyone have their food?

234
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,576
Let's eat.

235
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,911
Try the sausage. It should be pretty good.

236
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,983
Shaolin Si, how do you like the sausage?

237
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,318
Daoming Si.

238
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
Daoming Si?

239
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,155
I'm sorry but it's so hard
to remember your name.

240
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,825
How do you like the sausage?

241
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,427
Is this made by pork?

242
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,163
Didn't you see the sign?

243
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,232
It says marlin sausage.

244
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,767
Have you never eaten marlin before?

245
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,906
Do I look like someone
who hasn't eaten it before?

246
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,909
Let's go play.

247
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,877
Yeah, let's go play.

248
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,045
I haven't finished it yet.

249
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,314
That's fine, we can eat it while walking.

250
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,415
We stick together, right?

251
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,050
We can go separate ways.

252
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,285
-Go separate ways.
-Yeah.

253
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,520
Then we'll meet here
after two hours, okay?

254
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,989
-Okay.
-Okay.

255
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,423
-Okay, we'll go now, bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

256
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,424
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

257
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,329
Xiaoyou is so close with her boyfriend.

258
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,732
Is this your normal date?

259
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,035
Why are you so angry?

260
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,571
What kind of person is Xiaoyou dating?

261
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,739
What are you doing?

262
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,340
Normally I would have already beat him up.

263
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,576
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,979
I thought Xiaoyou's boyfriend
must be a nice person.

265
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,748
I didn't know
things would turn out like this.

266
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,850
We should go home now.

267
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,321
Never mind.

268
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,323
That's okay.

269
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,126
I'm a man of sense.

270
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,428
I won't make a fuss over someone like him.

271
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,031
If we go now, what should Xiaoyou do?

272
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,799
But...

273
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:20,700
Don't worry.

274
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,368
I won't hit him.

275
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,637
I won't fight with him
no matter how angry I am.

276
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,272
Okay?

277
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,775
Then let's go play, shall we?

278
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,907
Put some smile on your face.

279
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,542
Why the gloomy face?

280
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,911
Come on, put some smile on your face.

281
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,613
This is our first date.

282
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,615
Be happy. Put some smile on your face.

283
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,051
You're so handsome.

284
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,328
Stop it.

285
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,362
It's so much fun.

286
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,563
Why did you come back so early?

287
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,464
Yeah.

288
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,899
-Have you been to all the rides?
-Yeah.

289
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,335
We've just ridden the pirate ship
and that roller coaster.

290
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,437
-It's so terrifying.
-Have you ridden the pirate ship too?

291
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,605
What do you think of it?

292
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,506
Not bad.

293
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,840
Not bad.

294
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,510
-Are you thirsty? Want something to drink?
-Okay.

295
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,345
-I'll buy some from the vending machine.
-I'll go.

296
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,279
A Young Master like you

297
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,615
only has credit cards
and that 1,000 NTD bill.

298
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,050
You need change to buy
from the vending machine, but I got some.

299
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,719
Wait for me. I'll go buy some.

300
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,763
I'm going to the bathroom.

301
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,869
Shancai, I'm sorry.

302
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,906
The atmosphere is kind of weird today.

303
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,375
When we're at school,

304
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,477
Zhongze doesn't behave like that.

305
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:49,749
I find Zhongze
behaving very differently from usual.

306
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,318
But I believe he means no harm.

307
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,957
Maybe he doesn't know how to talk
with rich young masters like Daoming Si.

308
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,194
Perhaps.

309
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,030
<i>"Talk"?</i>

310
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>He's been looking for trouble.</i>

311
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,434
<i>I think Zhongze doesn't deserve Xiaoyou.</i>

312
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,805
Xiaoyou, I want to go to the bathroom.
Would you come with me?

313
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,739
Okay.

314
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,411
I haven't seen you for ages.

315
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,947
-Miss, don't hit me so hard, okay?
-Who is with you?

316
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,715
-I apologize.
-That's fine. We're so close.

317
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,116
-Who is with you? Come on.
-A friend.

318
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,785
-A friend.
-There are three bottles of drinks.

319
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,553
-You're too kind to us!
-Thanks.

320
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,322
-Thanks.
-Give them back, okay?

321
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,358
Fine. Suit yourself, okay?

322
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,667
Daoming Si.

323
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,202
Is he your friend?

324
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,170
He's so cool.

325
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,304
He's so handsome.

326
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,406
He's behaving as usual.

327
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,709
-I'm leaving now. I'll call you tonight.
-Okay, bye-bye.

328
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:50,943
-Okay, bye.
-Remember to call me.

329
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,144
-Okay.
-Okay, bye-bye.

330
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,145
Hey.

331
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,882
What do you think of them? Not bad, huh?

332
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,383
Those two girls.

333
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,352
My friends. I didn't know
I would meet them here.

334
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,687
I'll hang out with them tonight.

335
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,422
Do you want to come and join us?

336
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,726
You're so handsome
so you'll get them in no time.

337
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,730
What are you talking about?

338
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,533
It's nothing wrong for men to have fun.

339
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,439
I won't let the opportunities slip away
just because of Xiaoyou, right?

340
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,276
You're in a relationship with Shancai,

341
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,344
but you get bored sometimes, right?

342
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,446
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

343
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,749
Give me a break.

344
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,518
You don't look like a devoted man.

345
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,555
Besides your girlfriend,
you must have many mistresses, right?

346
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,024
Do you know who you're talking to?

347
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,358
Who?

348
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,360
A naive Daoming Si.

349
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,367
Are you okay?

350
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,803
Daoming Si, why did you hit him?

351
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,471
He has been getting on my nerves
for so long.

352
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,941
If this is your normal date,

353
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,342
I'll never have another date with you.

354
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,877
Xiaoyou.

355
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,512
You should find a more decent boyfriend.

356
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,015
Daoming Si!

357
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,387
What's wrong with him?

358
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,256
I just put my hand on his shoulder,

359
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,591
the next thing I knew he hit me.

360
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,159
What a savage.

361
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,162
I'm being very nice to hang out with you.

362
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,097
And I got hit by him.

363
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,732
What the heck.

364
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,467
He's a lunatic!

365
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,468
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,569
I'm so sorry.

367
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,104
Daoming Si's always been like this.

368
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,339
I don't want to listen to you.

369
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,740
You're his girlfriend.

370
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,508
No matter what, you're on his side, right?

371
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,211
Zhongze, where are you going?

372
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,312
Shut up.

373
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,981
Of course, I'm leaving.

374
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,518
Xiaoyou, I'm sorry.

375
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,953
I know after what happened,

376
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,722
my apology is useless now.

377
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,156
But I'm so sorry.

378
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,192
That's okay.

379
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,228
It was me who brought up
this crappy idea in the first place.

380
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,429
But...

381
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,967
Maybe Zhongze really did something wrong,

382
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,437
or Daoming Si wouldn't hit him
for no good reason.

383
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,840
You don't have to say that. I'm so sorry.

384
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,543
-Xiaoyou, you're here.
-Yeah.

385
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,480
I've checked the number of cake
and the amount of money.

386
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,048
-Check it for me.
-Okay.

387
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,950
-I'm leaving now, bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

388
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:39,011
<i>Your phone will go to the voicemail.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

389
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,813
<i>Hello, I'm Zhongze.</i>

390
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,915
<i>I can't answer the call right now.
Please leave a message.</i>

391
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,116
<i>Thank you, bye-bye.</i>

392
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,818
Hello.

393
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,821
Zhongze, it's me again.

394
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,856
Are you still mad?

395
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,460
I apologize.

396
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,362
Don't ignore me, okay?

397
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,765
Remember to call me back.

398
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,333
Bye-bye.

399
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,843
Daoming Si.

400
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,478
What?

401
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,013
I want you to apologize to him.

402
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,414
To whom?

403
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,283
Zhongze, Xiaoyou's boyfriend.

404
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,852
Why should I apologize to him?

405
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,921
What are you talking about?

406
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,322
You hit him before leaving us there.

407
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,757
Don't you need to apologize?

408
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,759
That scumbag is like a cockroach.

409
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,595
Why do I need to apologize to him?
I'm still mad right now. No way.

410
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,931
Why are you so unreasonable?

411
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,266
You promised me that you wouldn't hit him.

412
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,568
Why did you still hit him?

413
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,635
I...

414
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,338
I don't want to talk about this.

415
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,272
Why?

416
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,576
I hate Zhongze, too.

417
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,778
Actually, I felt kind of good
when you hit him,

418
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,279
but it's not an excuse for what you did.

419
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,714
You shouldn't hit him.

420
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,616
Do you understand
what you did can hurt Xiaoyou?

421
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,553
Did they break up?

422
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,921
That's good.

423
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,492
You just sit there doing nothing
after you dragged her into this.

424
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,826
And you called him a cockroach.

425
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,294
I think you're worse than a cockroach.

426
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,863
You're a maggot in a shit pit!

427
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,364
I'm not in the mood to argue with you.

428
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,600
Whatever, lunatic.

429
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,711
Zhongze didn't come to school today.

430
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,013
Did you call him?

431
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,749
Maybe he turned off his phone.

432
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,653
Don't get upset.

433
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,654
I'm fine.

434
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,523
I thought a lot about it.

435
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,291
Didn't Zhongze say,

436
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,160
because Daoming Si was your boyfriend,

437
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,730
you would turn a blind eye to what he did?

438
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,267
I think I'm the one he described.

439
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,570
Maybe I was blinded by love.

440
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,672
Right? Shancai.

441
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,340
Xiaoyou.

442
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,843
It's all Daoming Si's fault.

443
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,877
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,781
If we broke up
just because of such trivial thing,

445
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,317
I think we'll eventually break up
sooner or later.

446
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,287
So don't blame Daoming Si anymore.

447
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,322
Actually, I have--

448
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,657
You don't have to say that.

449
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,826
Daoming Si is a really nice person.

450
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,329
Didn't he say he wouldn't join us
the last time?

451
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,764
But he showed up eventually.

452
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,332
Don't mention it.

453
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,302
Everything would have been fine
if he didn't show up.

454
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,270
No. You don't have to say it.

455
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,406
It's time to get to work.

456
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,641
I should get back to the cake store now.
What about you?

457
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,877
I will go back
and continue working as a maid.

458
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,378
Let's get going together.

459
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,848
I don't want to go back.

460
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,322
Hurry up. Your place or mine?

461
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,290
Stop it.

462
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,693
I'm telling you. I have tons of fun
at my place. Let's go.

463
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,328
Why are you so playful?

464
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,496
Besides, don't you
already have a girlfriend?

465
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,333
Now that you have a girlfriend,
I won't mess around with you.

466
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,335
I don't care. I broke up with her, okay?

467
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,736
-Did you break up with her?
-Yeah.

468
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,072
That woman is so boring.

469
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:57,042
If she didn't take me to the library,
she would roller skate or ride with me.

470
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,312
It's refreshing in the beginning,
but this is not what I want to do.

471
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,548
She should stop pretending
to be a naive young girl.

472
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,720
Do you know them?

473
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,922
No.

474
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,523
Maybe they're from my school.

475
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,359
I might meet them before at school.

476
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,327
Xiaoyou.

477
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,528
Xiaoyou, wait.

478
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,371
Stop.

479
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,673
What's the matter?

480
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,041
Nothing.

481
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,175
You wait for me there.

482
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,343
I'll be right back.

483
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,314
What are you going to do?

484
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,649
What am I going to do?

485
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,150
What do you mean by that?

486
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,085
What did you think about Xiaoyou?

487
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,587
I think it's none of your business.

488
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,022
Didn't you hear me?

489
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,925
Xiaoyou is so boring.

490
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,826
She just doesn't match me.

491
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,363
Men are all alike.

492
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,533
Right, your boyfriend.

493
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,035
Daoming Si, right?

494
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,369
He's so weird.

495
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,939
I introduced him to girls out of kindness,

496
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,373
and he went crazy and hit me.

497
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,342
Don't you think he's lunatic?

498
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,344
I think you should stay away from him.

499
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,782
I'm better than him.

500
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,418
If you break up and feel bored,

501
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,186
you can always come to me.

502
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,521
You jerk!

503
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,058
Don't think I won't hit you
just because you're a girl.

504
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,526
You scumbag!

505
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,627
Stay away from Xiaoyou!

506
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,341
Xiaoyou.

507
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:13,912
What's the matter?

508
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,725
Xiaoyou!

509
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,194
Xiaoyou!

510
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,344
So?

511
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,546
Could you please tell me
what happened now?

512
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:52,851
I'm sorry.

513
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,953
I feel so irritated and frustrated.

514
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,356
I don't know how to say this.

515
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,224
Is it about your boyfriend?

516
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,728
I heard your double date didn't go well.

517
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,765
I saw him hanging out with another girl.

518
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,201
He said I'm boring.

519
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,870
He said I'm such a boring girl.

520
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,007
When he saw me,

521
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:17,076
he said he didn't know me at all.

522
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,577
Did he say that?

523
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,413
To say this kind of things
to such a cute girl,

524
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,015
this guy sucks.

525
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,985
I've never been in a relationship before.

526
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,255
He's my first boyfriend.

527
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,794
I know I'm not cute at all.

528
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,897
That girl with him was really beautiful.

529
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,966
I can't compete with her.

530
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,836
Don't say this.

531
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,472
You don't have to lower yourself
for this kind of people.

532
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,340
Stop saying,

533
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,342
"I can't compete with her."

534
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,811
You should say, "I will compete
with her and so forth..."

535
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,348
How about this?

536
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,284
You should say, "I won't lose to her."

537
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,353
"I will become more beautiful."

538
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,455
"I will have many potential lovers
pursuing me."

539
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,725
A confident girl is very charming.

540
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,293
Speak up.

541
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,265
You can do it.

542
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:14,366
Speak up.

543
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,437
Go for it.

544
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,107
I will be cute.

545
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,044
I will be more confident.

546
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,616
That's the confidence I'm talking about.

547
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:31,850
Great.

548
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,685
How about a cup of coffee?

549
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,659
Here.

550
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,294
Thank you.

551
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,333
Drink it.

552
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,637
Don't you add sugar to your coffee?

553
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,505
Go ahead and try it without sugar.

554
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,207
Black coffee is amazing.

555
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,782
It's so bitter.

556
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,519
Everyone reacts just like you
when they first drink black coffee.

557
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,788
They think it's not drinkable.

558
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,230
But if you savor every drop of it,

559
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,165
you will be able to taste the sweetness

560
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,001
and smell its rich aroma.

561
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,336
Yeah.

562
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,705
Can you taste this bitterness?

563
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,208
This is just like love.

564
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,742
It brings you pain.

565
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,912
But this bitterness will make you grow up.

566
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,949
And you'll be braver next time.

567
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,350
Do you understand?

568
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,689
Let's go.

569
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,124
No need to drive me home.

570
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,793
I can go home myself.

571
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,561
I'm not driving you home.

572
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,230
I'm taking you to that man.

573
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:52,898
What?

574
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,099
Who are you taking me to?

575
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,970
That guy who irritated
Ah Si, Shancai, and you.

576
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,340
No. I don't want to meet him.

577
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,108
What will you do with him?

578
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,745
I hate this kind
of uncivilized men the most.

579
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,147
He thinks he's a chick magnet.

580
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,650
We can think of a way to deflate his ego.

581
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,985
Follow me.

582
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,053
We will show him
what a decent man looks like.

583
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,088
You don't need to do this.

584
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,155
Let's go.

585
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,156
No, Ximen.

586
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,291
Let's go.

587
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,032
<i>Where's Xiaoyou?</i>

588
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,834
<i>She didn't go to the cake store.</i>

589
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,269
<i>I called her home number,</i>

590
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,638
<i>and her family said
she hasn't come home yet.</i>

591
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,507
<i>I'm so worried about her.</i>

592
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,581
<i>Right, your boyfriend.</i>

593
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:43,882
<i>Daoming Si, right?</i>

594
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,350
He's so weird.

595
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,719
I introduced him to girls out of kindness,

596
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,521
and he went crazy and hit me.

597
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,956
<i>Don't you think he's lunatic?</i>

598
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,906
Hi, Daoming Si, it's me.

599
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,274
<i>Where are you now?</i>

600
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,209
I...

601
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,346
Xiaoyou went missing.

602
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,881
<i>You wait for me there.</i>

603
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,149
<i>Don't run around, did you hear me?</i>

604
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,383
<i>I'll be there right away.</i>

605
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,192
Could we not go?

606
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,028
Where does that guy usually hang around?

607
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,397
VS.

608
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,666
VS?

609
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:38,737
Do you know that place?

610
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,039
I was a frequent visitor half a year ago.

611
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,808
I didn't go there very much recently.

612
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,543
Take us to VS.

613
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,677
Yes, Young Master.

614
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,481
Are we really going there?

615
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,594
Daoming Si.

616
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,529
You stupid woman.

617
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,531
You look like an idiot.

618
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,800
My car is parked up ahead. Let's go.

619
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,001
But Xiaoyou...

620
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,070
Ximen called me.
He said Xiaoyou was with him.

621
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,271
He told me not to worry.

622
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,773
Why is Ximen with Xiaoyou?

623
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,074
They are together right now anyway.

624
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,442
Why are you full of nonsense?

625
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,745
Daoming Si.

626
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,781
You knew Zhongze is a scumbag
all along, right?

627
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,684
Anyway, I've hit him.

628
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,387
I hit him twice just now.

629
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,222
That jerk. He deserves it.

630
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,458
Who said it's wrong to hit someone
regardless of the reason?

631
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:35,961
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,330
-But that's because--
-Because, my ass.

633
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,531
Idiot.

634
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,800
You didn't tell us about it.

635
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,302
-How should I know?
-You blame me for your fault.

636
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,704
Stupid woman.

637
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,272
Daoming Si.

638
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,474
Why are Ximen and Xiaoyou together?

639
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,710
Ximen is a playboy.

640
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,879
Did he plan to get Xiaoyou
when she was at her weakest point?

641
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,580
Ximen isn't interested
in women like Xiaoyou.

642
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:56,548
How do you know that?

643
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:01,253
He is always dating models and hot girls.
How could he like women like Xiaoyou?

644
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,289
But I think Ximen is that kind of guy
who thinks with his lower body.

645
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,292
Don't criticize my friend in front of me.

646
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,028
You only care about others' affairs.
What about our stuff?

647
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,363
Our stuff?

648
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,265
The trial period.

649
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,834
Oh, my ass.

650
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,470
The two months will be over in no time,
do you understand?

651
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,438
I understand.

652
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,840
It's like a grenade with the pin pulled.

653
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,341
There is a countdown timer.

654
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,343
Finally, boom. It will explode.

655
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,547
You're joking in this situation?

656
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,187
Daoming Si, don't you find it funny?

657
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,291
Do you have any idea how worried I am?

658
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,031
Our trial period is shrinking day by day.

659
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,001
Everything is getting weird.

660
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,672
You were trying to adapt to me at school,

661
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,509
and I was trying to adapt to you
on the double date.

662
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,045
Everything is wrong.

663
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,648
I'm even thinking,

664
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,318
is our relationship...

665
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,821
going to an end?

666
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,523
Daoming Si.

667
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,759
Never mind.

668
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,462
It's so embarrassing to say this.

669
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,370
Daoming Si.

670
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,405
I've always wanted to say this to you.

671
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,641
Thank you.

672
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,037
Ximen.

673
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,907
I don't want to do this.

674
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,076
We should go back.

675
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,312
I'm really scared.

676
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,813
I really don't want to meet him.

677
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,882
That's it for you?

678
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,817
This is your first relationship.

679
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,352
You don't have a proper breakup.

680
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,888
This man is a two-timer,

681
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,823
he humiliated you,

682
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,825
and even pretended not to know you.

683
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,761
Can you just forget all this?

684
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,030
I can't.

685
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:31,069
I can't forget I wasted my love
on someone like him.

686
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,170
That's the spirit.

687
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,305
Let's go.

688
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,308
Or you will be haunted
by this feeling all your life.

689
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,177
We'll teach that man a lesson,

690
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,146
you'll forget him completely,

691
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,883
and you will move on
to your next relationship, okay?

692
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,024
Get a bigger butt...

693
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,069
Did you see them?

694
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,110
Over there.

695
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,387
-Isn't that Ximen?
-Ximen.

696
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,189
-Hello, Ximen.
-Long time no see, Ximen.

697
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,657
-Long time no see.
-How are you?

698
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,059
-Good.
-We've been here every day recently.

699
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,894
We were wondering
if we could meet you here.

700
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,230
I've been busy these days.

701
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,199
-I see.
-So I didn't visit here much.

702
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,867
Do you still remember Linda?

703
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,936
Yeah.

704
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,639
The three of them are over there.
Let's join them later, okay?

705
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,308
Join them... Okay.

706
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,477
But you have to wait a moment.

707
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,379
Okay, deal.

708
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,014
-I'll get back to you later.
-Okay.

709
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:50,815
Do you want some more wine?

710
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,886
Isn't that Ximen?

711
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,856
Who is he? Do you know him?

712
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,157
Don't you know him?

713
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,725
He's famous in nightclubs.

714
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,328
He's handsome and rich.

715
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,296
Every girl loves him.

716
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:06,665
Nonsense.

717
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,068
He's a member of F4 in Yingde University.

718
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,436
Besides Ximen,

719
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,806
-there are Daoming Si and Huaze Lei.
-Wait.

720
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,908
Did you say Daoming Si is one of F4?

721
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,077
Yeah, but I haven't seen him in person.

722
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,612
He doesn't go to nightclubs much.

723
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,846
Hello.

724
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,381
Hi, nice to meet you.

725
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,849
You're so pretty.

726
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,351
Thank you.

727
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,187
Is this guy your boyfriend?

728
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,423
Not really.

729
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,590
Meijia.

730
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,225
I think so.

731
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,061
I don't think he deserves you.

732
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,229
What do you mean by that?

733
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,698
Your name is Meijia.

734
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,598
Yeah.

735
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,002
If you had a chance to choose,

736
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,971
would you choose him
or me to be your boyfriend?

737
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,373
Of course, I would choose you.

738
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,075
Are you kidding me?

739
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,076
Meijia, let's go.

740
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,812
What are you doing?
Let go of me. What's wrong with you?

741
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,880
I'm just hanging out with you.

742
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,482
Why do I have to follow you?

743
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,851
You can go find your ex-girlfriend.

744
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,686
Even this kind of person
could have a girlfriend?

745
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:02,587
No way.

746
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,856
What are you up to?

747
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,825
Do you want to fight?

748
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,661
Don't say I haven't warned you.

749
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,434
Never mind.

750
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,536
I don't want this kind of girl.

751
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,305
If you want her, she's all yours.

752
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,207
I don't care.

753
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,576
I will go find my ex-girlfriend.

754
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,512
She is purer and much better than you.

755
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,048
You'd better go find your devoted girl.

756
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,785
Ximen, I have nothing to do with him.

757
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,186
From now on,

758
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,721
I can be your girlfriend.

759
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,591
What girlfriend?

760
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,359
Didn't you just say...

761
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,161
I just said,

762
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,729
"If you had a chance to choose,

763
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,865
would you choose him or me?"

764
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,167
But I didn't say
you could be my girlfriend.

765
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,270
Besides, I'm in love with someone.

766
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,408
Xiaoyou?

767
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,077
I love her so much,

768
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,979
but she refused to be with me.

769
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,013
Ximen.

770
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,148
Where are you here?

771
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,249
Xiaoyou.

772
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,184
Do you know this man?

773
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,853
No.

774
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,322
He's from my school.

775
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,159
But I've only met him a few times.

776
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,493
I don't know him.

777
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:23,802
I get it now.

778
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,804
You're here to mess with me, right?

779
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,972
Of course not.

780
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,774
We're here for serious business.

781
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,116
You listen to me.

782
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,052
If you make my beloved woman cry again,

783
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,887
I'll gouge your heart out.

784
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,889
But, with your stupidity,

785
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,391
I'm afraid you can't remember my words.

786
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,795
You should remember them now.

787
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,401
Let's go.

788
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,003
Let's go, okay?

789
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:09,447
How was it?

790
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,082
Does it feel good?

791
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,218
I feel much better now.

792
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,054
I don't know
how could I fall in love with him.

793
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,255
Thank you.

794
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,890
Put your hands like this.

795
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:20,658
High five.

796
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,730
This thing will be
our little secret, okay?

797
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,673
Thank you for coming.

798
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,076
Ximen.

799
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,077
What brings you here?

800
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,646
I was passing by,
so I decided to visit you.

801
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,182
How was it? It took us the whole night.

802
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:45,183
Did you sleep well?

803
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,085
Good, thank you.

804
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,954
Do you want some cake? It's on me.

805
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,556
-Really?
-Yeah.

806
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,091
Whatever you want.

807
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,162
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

808
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,099
I had a terrible boyfriend,

809
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,301
so everyone was worried about me.

810
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:06,237
I should say thank you to Daoming Si.

811
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,940
If he didn't realize
how terrible Zhongze was,

812
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,909
he wouldn't hit him.

813
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,444
I made the tension
between Shancai and him so high.

814
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,381
Have they made peace with each other?

815
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,283
There's no peace between them.

816
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,984
They're like this all year round.

817
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,053
Could I have this one?

818
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,388
Sure.

819
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,094
Do you know about their trial period?

820
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,663
Yeah.

821
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,697
In two months,

822
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,732
if they can't adapt to each other,

823
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,534
they will break up?

824
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,270
That's why I brought up
the idea of a double date.

825
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,572
I didn't know I would make things worse.

826
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,874
Yeah.

827
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,776
We, bystanders, are worried like crazy.

828
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,145
The two months will be over in no time.

829
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,980
But those two idiots,

830
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,182
they don't even know
what lovers should do.

831
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:58,957
Xiaoyou.

832
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,825
Could you do me a favor?

833
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,060
Yeah.

834
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,161
Go on a date with me.

835
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,297
10 a.m. tomorrow.

836
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,037
Where's Ximen?

837
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,105
Did you see him?

838
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,007
I don't know.
He said he got something to do.

839
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,075
He won't be here.

840
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,876
He seems to go on a date
with his new target.

841
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,345
New target?

842
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,180
He mustn't do that.

843
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,084
Daoming Si, no matter what
you have to help me this time.

844
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,287
We didn't know
you've made peace with each other.

845
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,254
Lei.

846
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,390
We must miss some critical plot points.

847
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,063
What favor are you talking about?

848
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,532
Right.

849
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,534
Ximen. That playboy.

850
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,403
He is going on a date with Xiaoyou.

851
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,005
Xiaoyou just broke up.

852
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,973
If she is hurt again by Ximen,

853
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,074
she will be so sad.

854
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,576
You have to help me with this.

855
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,779
Why did Ximen suddenly change his taste?

856
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,982
Shancai, you could think of it this way.

857
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,284
Xiaoyou will grow up one day.

858
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,054
Ximen could be the one popping her cherry.

859
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,155
He mustn't do that.

860
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,056
Daoming Si, please.

861
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,724
You have to stop Ximen.

862
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,926
Shancai, don't listen
to Meizuo's nonsense.

863
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,528
Ximen has a good moral compass.

864
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:11,462
No.

865
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,465
I can't sit here and watch Xiaoyou
staying around the big bad wolf Ximen.

866
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,633
I care about her well-being.

867
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,469
Daoming Si, please.
You have to stop Ximen.

868
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,605
Well...

869
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,806
This is nonsense.

870
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,374
Shancai, we are F4,

871
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,076
but each of us has his personal freedom.

872
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,245
Ah Si, you won't stop them, will you?

873
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:28,579
I...

874
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,215
I can't do this.

875
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,053
How about this?
I send someone to follow them.

876
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,421
So Xiaoyou won't be in any danger.

877
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,422
This will do, right?

878
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,856
Xiaoyou can't be in danger.

879
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,058
What are you implying?

880
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,493
Do you mean
Ximen is a venomous snake or a beast?

881
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,096
I'll just send someone to follow them.
I won't meddle with their date.

882
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,131
Lei, what do you think?

883
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:20,932
Did you have any trouble
finding this place?

884
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,169
This is owned
by an Italian friend of mine.

885
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,638
It's a pretty interesting family cafe.

886
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,774
Their coffee is legit.

887
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,175
Do you want a cup of coffee?

888
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,810
Okay.

889
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:33,978
What would you like to drink?

890
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:37,115
Anything is fine.
I know nothing about this anyway.

891
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,683
-Then let me order for you.
-Okay.

892
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,918
Excuse me.

893
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,186
Espresso.

894
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,058
If we go on a date like this,

895
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,127
Shancai and Daoming Si won't see us.

896
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,394
Will it work?

897
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,230
I've told them our date.

898
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,532
Shancai is always making a fuss
about everything.

899
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,534
She'll do everything she can
to find out our location.

900
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,404
To make her more paranoid,

901
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,507
you should call her right now.

902
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,346
But I don't know
if I will act well enough.

903
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,515
I'm afraid I'll blow our cover.

904
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,250
Just tell her what I taught you.

905
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,784
With Shancai's personality,

906
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,221
she won't be able to think straight
when she's nervous.

907
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,452
