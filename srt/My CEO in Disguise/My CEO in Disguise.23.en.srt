1
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,519
What's going on here?

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,720
What did you say to Grandpa?

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,559
Nothing much. The old man sees right through everything.

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,359
Are you really putting justice above family?

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,039
I may be getting old,

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,640
but I'm not senile yet.

7
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,960
Qingyan has worked so hard,

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,920
doing her best to grow the company.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,519
But what about you?

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,399
You teamed up with outsiders to scheme against your own niece.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,359
All for a bit of personal gain.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
Not only did you try to take over Qingmu,

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
you even sold out Qingyan's future.

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,520
Have you lost all conscience?

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,159
Dad, I did all this for our Su family.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,960
For the Su family, Zhengchun?

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,119
How did I teach you back then?

18
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,240
Have you forgotten?

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,000
If a family wants to be strong,

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,359
it's not about scheming against each other.

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,520
It's about everyone in the family working together.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,399
United as one.

23
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,239
Otherwise, if you rely on underhanded tricks,

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,040
and betray your own family for benefits,

25
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,040
even if the family becomes powerful,

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,640
by that time,

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,439
will our Su family still be the Su family?

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,359
Back then,

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,359
you brothers were very close.

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,760
Qingyan's parents only wrote this will before they passed away.

31
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,159
He entrusted his daughter and the company

32
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,959
to your uncles and aunts to take care of.

33
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,159
But the things you have done

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,959
are you worthy of their spirits in heaven?

35
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,319
Ask yourselves honestly.

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,760
Do you truly have a clear conscience?

37
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,480
Dad,

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,760
I was wrong.

39
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,879
Dad,

40
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,560
I was wrong too.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,599
Dad, I was wrong as well.

42
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,319
It's good to admit your mistakes and change.

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,920
It's not too late.

44
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,439
I announce that from today on,

45
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,120
you are temporarily relieved of all your positions in the Su Group.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
Stay at home and reflect on your actions.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,159
The position of head of the Su family will be taken over by Qingyan.

48
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,560
What?

49
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,759
Since you have already registered your marriage,

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,319
then set a date for the wedding.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,400
I, Su Changqing, want the whole Yun City to know

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,719
about this distinguished...

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,719
Gaoxing is the rightful son-in-law of the Su family.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,599
Wait.

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
What do you mean?

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
Su Qingyan is clearly my wife.

57
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,319
Su Changqing, are you getting senile?

58
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,360
Aren't you afraid of offending our Song Group by doing this?

59
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,199
Who do you think you are?

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
How dare you threaten the Su family!

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,639
When I, Su Changqing, started building my empire,

62
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,439
your Song Group didn't even exist.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,599
Someone!

64
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,919
Drag him out!

65
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,159
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,319
Let go of me!

67
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,560
Let go of me!

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
Take care, Young Master Song.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Let go of me!

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,800
Gaoxing, am I dreaming?

71
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,800
Young Gao, you're still so young,

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,879
and so handsome.

73
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,439
You and our Qingyan are a perfect match.

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,639
Qingyan, finding such a good husband

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,919
is like finding a treasure.

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,400
Don't leave tonight.

77
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,520
Stay here for the night.

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Grandpa will go arrange a room for you right now.

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,879
Ah!

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,759
Wait, Grandpa!

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
That's strange.

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,120
Grandpa is usually so strict and serious.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,719
Why is he so enthusiastic today?

84
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,159
Did you pretend to be Gao Feng again?

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,439
No, I didn't! I'm innocent.

86
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Grandpa has always been good to me.

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,599
If he finds out we lied to him,

88
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,159
he'll definitely be heartbroken.

89
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,719
No, I have to go explain everything to him.

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,680
Grandpa

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,759
Qingyan is here.

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,639
Grandpa has already arranged for someone to tidy up your room.

93
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,000
I guarantee it will be clean.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
No one will disturb you tonight.

95
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,560
Grandpa, that's not what I wanted to ask.

96
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
I want to tell you

97
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,959
Actually, Gaoxing is not Gaofeng.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,120
He was pretending to be the president of Junsheng Group.

99
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Ah.

100
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,319
Oh.

101
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,519
Oh, I know.

102
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,480
You know?

103
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,839
Then why did you still agree to let me be with him?

104
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,399
Grandpa doesn't judge people by their status or family background.

105
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,560
I look at their character.

106
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,319
Even if Xiao Gao is just an ordinary person,

107
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,759
so what?

108
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,399
As long as he's dependable and treats you well,

109
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,920
that's enough.

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,519
The main thing is, do you actually like him?

111
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,319
I do.

112
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,639
Even if he's not Gaofeng,

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,519
even if he's not Gaofeng,

114
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,000
the one I like has always been Gaoxing.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,439
Oh, then that's great.

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Everyone's happy.

117
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,160
Just be with him without worry.

118
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,240
Later, Grandpa will personally host your wedding.

119
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,720
But I haven't told him myself yet.

120
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,199
I don't even know if he actually likes me.

121
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,720
Then go tell him.

122
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,959
Just go ask.

123
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,319
Women of our Su family aren't wishy-washy.

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,639
Or timid and hesitant.

125
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,319
When you meet someone you like, you have to hold on tight.

126
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
Otherwise, if you miss your chance,

127
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,920
will you really be content?

128
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,360
No, I won't.

129
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,399
Qingyan,

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
happiness

131
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
is something you have to fight for.

132
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,319
Grandpa supports you.

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
Mm.

134
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
Th-this is...

135
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,560
My grandpa arranged all of this.

136
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,519
I didn't know either.

137
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,519
There's only one bed.

138
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,560
The two of us can't really sleep together.

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
Maybe I should go talk to Grandpa.

140
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,720
I'll sleep in another room.

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,600
Grandpa means well.

142
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,040
If you say something,

143
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,319
he'll be hurt.

144
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,199
Let's just forget it.

145
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,360
Let's just make do for tonight.

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Anyway, it's normal for a married couple to share a room, right?

147
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,360
It is, it is.

148
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,519
How about we have a drink?

149
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
Sure.

150
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,319
Happy

151
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,040
This first glass

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,959
is for you.

153
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,680
You recovered Qingmu's debts and investments.

154
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,839
The secret medical formula,

155
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,839
and the support from two international award-winning actresses,

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,519
were all thanks to your connections.

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,519
Now Qingmu can make a great leap forward

158
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
all because of your efforts. Thank you.

159
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
It's nothing.

160
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,160
It was just luck.

161
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,439
Mainly, it's because President Su knows how to use people's strengths.

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,639
And gives great guidance.

163
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,000
This second glass is also for you.

164
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,160
You helped me teach Song Haoyang a lesson.

165
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,759
And stood by me against my family.

166
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,399
You made them reap what they sowed.

167
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,519
And return in defeat.

168
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,040
We fought these battles beautifully.

169
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,120
And won decisively. Thank you.

170
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
Just lending a hand when I see injustice.

171
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,519
That Song guy,

172
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,720
and your uncle and the others,

173
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
I've never liked them.

174
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
I've wanted to teach them a lesson for a long time.

175
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,159
This third glass

176
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,320
I still want to toast to you

177
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,759
There are some things

178
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
I said last time when I was drunk

179
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,240
But I want to say them again now

180
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,360
No matter how hard or difficult things got before

181
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,759
I would grit my teeth and get through it

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,120
I always thought that after my parents passed away

183
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,759
I could only rely on myself

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
But then I met you

185
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,519
All this time, you've been by my side

186
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,440
Helping me

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,039
Supporting me and giving me warmth

188
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
After meeting you

189
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,960
I realized

190
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,440
That I’m not alone on this road

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,559
Because you’re with me

192
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,440
Thank you

193
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,960
You flatter me

194
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,919
This is all what I should do

195
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,159
Don’t we have a contract?

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,399
We’re contract spouses, after all

197
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,799
During the contract period, I have to play the role of your husband well

198
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,440
Otherwise, I’ll get a pay deduction

199
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,639
What if what I want is more than just being contract spouses?

200
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,759
Huh?

201
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,519
Happy

202
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,519
I like you

203
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
At first, it was because you looked like my idol, Gao Feng

204
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,039
So I hired you to be my husband

205
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,440
At first, I thought the one I liked was him

206
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,919
That’s why I had feelings for you

207
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,919
But later I realized

208
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,200
These feelings don’t seem to have anything to do with Gao Feng

209
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,600
The person I like is you

210
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,159
Even if I’m just an ordinary person

211
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,559
Just a food delivery guy

212
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,159
No matter what you’re like

213
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
As long as it’s you

214
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,600
I like you all the same

215
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,879
I've said everything I wanted to say.

216
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,000
What about you?

217
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,519
According to our three rules,

218
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,919
kissing me means you have to pay a fine.

219
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,159
Fine me, then.

220
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
I have plenty of money anyway.

221
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
Then help me pay mine while you're at it.
