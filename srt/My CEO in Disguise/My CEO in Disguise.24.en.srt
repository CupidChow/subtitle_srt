1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,280
You're awake.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,120
Who are you? Why are you in my bed?

3
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,480
Hey.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,320
Why does this scene feel so familiar?

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm just kidding, teasing you.

6
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,320
I thought you were going to kick me out of bed again.

7
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,159
And then call the police on me.

8
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,880
This time, I really couldn't clear my name.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,200
Don't worry, you don't have to clear your name this time.

10
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,159
We're really married now.

11
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,759
It's reasonable for a married couple to share a bed, right?

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,359
Reasonable, very reasonable.

13
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,760
But could it be a little more reasonable?

14
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,760
You're lying on my hair.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,480
Be gentle.

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,719
The revenue report is out.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,719
Our product sales are leading.

18
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,719
We're way ahead of the competition.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,200
Now Qingmu's reputation has finally taken off.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,159
Of course, it's all thanks to President Su's excellent leadership.

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,280
Impressive.

22
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,280
It doesn't have much to do with me.

23
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,280
It's really thanks to your two close friends.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,519
Why don't you thank them on behalf of the company?

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
No need.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,879
The company can handle this kind of thing.

27
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,359
I'm a married man.

28
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,280
I absolutely can't have any ambiguous relationships with other women.

29
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,280
Hmph, you'd better mean it.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,840
Hey, those two—

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,280
One is a miracle doctor.

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,640
The other is a movie queen.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,719
They have money if they want it.

34
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,719
And fame if they want it.

35
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,280
If you could live off them,

36
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,479
you'd never have to worry for the rest of your life.

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,520
Miracle doctor, movie queen—so what?

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,599
My wife is way better than them.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,800
Besides, I'm very picky.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,400
I can't get used to living off someone else.

41
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,759
You'd better mean it.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,319
Remember, you're mine.

43
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,680
If you want to live off someone, it can only be me.

44
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,479
Or do you want to start now?

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,719
Qingyan, here are some documents.

46
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,919
Y-you, you two...

47
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,000
I-in the office...

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
You just started kissing...

49
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,479
What's wrong? We're married.

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
It's reasonable for us to kiss, right?

51
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,840
R-right, reasonable.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,560
Reasonable.

53
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,199
But weren't you two a fake couple?

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,159
It's official now.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,960
Now we're legally and rightfully together.

56
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,520
We're a real married couple.

57
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,479
It's official, we've become a real couple.

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,319
Yeah.

59
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
That's great!

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,919
This is a huge happy event.

61
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,759
I knew it.

62
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,479
You two should've been together long ago.

63
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,000
It's not too late now.

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,199
You two, tone it down a bit.

65
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,159
There are still people here.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,319
I'll leave the documents here.

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,639
Remember to sign after you're done kissing.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,759
Mrs. Su

69
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,520
Mrs. Su

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,919
Dr. Su, Dr. Su

71
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,400
Hold on

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,719
I'll take you to the hospital

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
It's too late

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,280
The genetic technology data

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,000
is with my daughter

76
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,480
You have to help me

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Take good care of her

78
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,000
Dr. Su

79
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,000
Dr. Su

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
Boss, we've found out

81
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,360
It was done by the Blackstone organization

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,879
Blackstone

83
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,480
Yes

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Dr. and Mrs. Su

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,480
have been dedicated to genetic technology research for many years

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,399
and recently made a breakthrough in their research

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,319
Unfortunately, the Blackstone organization found out

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,480
They sent people to steal the results

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,879
but failed to get what they wanted

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,120
So they tortured Dr. and Mrs. Su

91
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,000
and brutally killed them

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,519
Alright

93
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,720
Blackstone, how ruthless

94
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,079
From now on

95
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,720
use all of Junsheng's resources

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
to thoroughly investigate Blackstone's whereabouts

97
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,279
I want them to pay for what they've done

98
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,480
Yes, boss

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
Then I'll take you back to headquarters right away

100
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,879
No need

101
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
Take me to Yuncheng

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,319
From now on, I'll take care of you

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,360
Qingyan

104
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,879
I have something to say to you.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
What is it? Why so serious?

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,399
Because this is a serious matter.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:12,959
Kneel.

108
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,199
Boss Yan, Boss Yan.

109
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,399
Please spare me, Boss Yan!

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
Our Blackstone organization

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
has given your Song family so many resources.

112
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,319
There is only one goal.

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,319
To have you find a way into the Su family.

114
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,920
To get close to Su Qingyan.

115
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,480
It's been months.

116
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,279
And you still can't handle such a small task.

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,680
What use do I have for you then?

118
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,480
Boss Yan.

119
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,519
I've really tried my best.

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,399
It's all because of that Gao Xing.

121
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
If it weren't for him,

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,800
I would have already married Su Qingyan and moved into the Su family.

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
It's all Gao Xing's fault.

124
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,720
How about this, give me one more chance.

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,279
I promise I'll tear him to pieces.

126
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,000
And then win over Su Qingyan.

127
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I'll bring you what you want, okay?

128
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,639
Tear him to pieces?

129
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,560
With just you?

130
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,519
You think you're worthy?

131
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,560
Boss Yan, please spare me! Boss Yan!

132
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,480
Don't be afraid.

133
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,319
It's not your fault this time.

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,079
After all, the dignified president of Junsheng Group

135
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,519
is just pretending to be weak to outsmart others.

136
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,360
He can personally protect Su Qingyan by her side.

137
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,759
It's not shameful to lose to him.

138
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,319
The president of Junsheng Group...

139
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,759
Not President Yan?

140
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,560
Is he really Gao Feng from Junsheng Group?

141
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,720
If it's not him, who else could be so capable?

142
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,800
President Yan...

143
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
Gao Xing, he really is Gao Feng.

144
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,120
W-what should we do now?

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,959
What to do?

146
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
It's simple.

147
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,519
Your method doesn't work.

148
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,399
Then let's use my method next.

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,079
I'll handle some work first.

150
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,120
We'll go out to eat later.

151
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,639
Okay, then I'll go buy some water.

152
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,120
Mm, thank you.

153
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,120
The ring will keep you company.

154
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,120
In case you miss me.

155
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Do you know Gao Xing's true identity?

156
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,919
Hello?

157
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,480
Miss Su, you've read all the documents, right?

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,279
You sent them?

159
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,279
Who are you?

160
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,720
Who I am isn't important.

161
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,919
What's important is who the person beside you really is.

162
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,799
If you want to know the truth,

163
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,679
I'm waiting for you at your home.
