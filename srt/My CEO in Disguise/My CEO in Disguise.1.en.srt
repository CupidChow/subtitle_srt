1
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,600
The world-leading conglomerate Junsheng Group has donated to Yun City

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,960
a huge sum of one billion yuan for public welfare.

3
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,320
Junsheng's president, Gao Feng, is young and capable,

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,879
and is considered a business prodigy.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,559
But he has always kept a low profile,

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,640
and no one has ever seen his true face.

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,719
Hello, boss.

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,560
Why are you here?

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,000
Boss, you've been away from the company for a month.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
Junsheng can't do without you.

11
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,599
We're here to ask you to come back.

12
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,680
Didn't I already say it?

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm tired of my old life.

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,400
Now I want to live a more interesting life.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,599
But with your status,

16
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,519
even if you want a change, you shouldn't be delivering food.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,799
What's wrong with delivering food?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,439
I think delivering food is quite interesting.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,239
I'm in a hurry to deliver my next order.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Don't block my way.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,480
Move aside.

22
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,920
Don't worry, I'll contact you if I need anything.

23
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,159
Let go of me! Who are you?

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,319
Song Haoyang, what do you want?

25
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,680
What do I want?

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,079
Su Qingyan.

27
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,000
Haven't you heard?

28
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,040
Any woman I, Song Haoyang, set my sights on

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,599
has never gotten away.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
This is kidnapping—it's a crime!

31
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,680
Here in Yuncheng,

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
let alone kidnapping you,

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,439
even if I forced myself on you,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
what could you do about it?

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,199
Still trying to run?

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,560
Don't think you can escape from me again.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,159
This is a special drug I got from abroad.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,680
Drink it—let's see if you can still pretend to be innocent.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,120
Grab her!

40
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,800
Yes!

41
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,680
Stop!

42
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,520
Don't run!

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,560
Catch her, quick!

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,599
Help me

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
Miss, what's wrong?

46
00:02:59,439 --> 00:02:59,960
Hurry

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,599
Go quickly

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,080
Take me away from here

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,039
Don't run

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,439
So hot

51
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,560
So hot

52
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,439
So hot

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
So hot

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,159
So hot.

55
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,039
So hot.

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,079
You—who are you?

57
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,199
Why are you in my bed?

58
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,319
I actually wanted to go home and sleep.

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
You didn't give me a chance.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,879
What did you do to me?

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
I didn't do anything.

62
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,879
You were the one doing things to me.

63
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,399
Shameless! Get off me, get off!

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,879
You—

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
I can't believe you actually—

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
took my first time.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,639
Isn't it possible that—

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,399
your period just started?

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,480
I said I didn't do it on purpose. Do you believe me?

70
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,040
Get lost.

71
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,240
See? It really is my period.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,279
You remember now, right?

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Last night, I tried my best to resist.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
But you still took advantage of me.

75
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,279
I almost lost my virginity.

76
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,439
Shut up. Don't say another word.

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,879
The phone.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,720
Hello?

79
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,839
Su Qingyan, are you out of your mind?

80
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,639
It's an honor for our family that Young Master Song is willing to marry you.

81
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,439
Not only are you not cooperating,

82
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,800
you even dared to injure Young Master Song.

83
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,319
You must kneel and apologize to him.

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Apologize?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,160
Uncle, do you even know what he did to me?

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,240
He drugged me.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,639
So what if he drugged you?

88
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,639
You're going to marry him sooner or later anyway.

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,759
Whether you sleep with him sooner or later,

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
what difference does it make?

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,959
I really think you're out of your mind.

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,439
Then I'm leaving.

93
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,319
Go ahead.

94
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,680
Wait a minute.

95
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,199
So alike. It's uncanny.

96
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Alike in what way?

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,079
Let's get married.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,040
What?

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,800
So what you mean is

100
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,680
you want me to pretend to be Gao Feng

101
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,600
and marry you?

102
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,560
That's right.

103
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,800
But having me impersonate him

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
feels a bit strange to me.

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,600
I understand your concerns.

106
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,839
Although you two do look somewhat alike,

107
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,439
Gao Feng is still a man of great status.

108
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,639
A real big shot.

109
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,079
You're just a food delivery guy.

110
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,279
It's definitely a challenge for you to impersonate him.

111
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,040
But don't worry.

112
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
Gao Feng has always been very mysterious.

113
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,000
Very few people have seen what he really looks like.

114
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,720
As long as you do as I say,

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,079
I guarantee you won't be exposed.

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,879
This is a temporary marriage agreement.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,920
It will last for six months.

118
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,199
After you sign it,

119
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,000
we'll appear to be husband and wife.

120
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,879
But in reality, you'll just be my employee.

121
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,439
You must follow all my arrangements.

122
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,720
Play the role of Gao Feng well.

123
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,439
Any problems?

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,839
No problem.

125
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,639
It's a good job.

126
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,720
How's the pay?

127
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,399
Fifty thousand a month.

128
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,480
If you do a good job,

129
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,279
there will be extra bonuses.

130
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm playing such an important person,

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,319
and you only give me fifty thousand a month?

132
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,639
Isn't that a bit stingy?

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
You only make five thousand a month delivering food.

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
And you think fifty thousand is too little?

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,519
Five thousand is just for my performance.

136
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,399
Selling myself is extra.

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
So how much do you want?

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
One hundred thousand a month.

139
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,759
Non-negotiable.

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,199
Alright.

141
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,360
One hundred thousand it is.

142
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,600
But—

143
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,439
I have three conditions.

144
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,519
First, you must be available whenever I call.

145
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,680
No skipping work without a valid reason.

146
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,399
Second,

147
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,439
You must follow my instructions in everything you say and do.

148
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,399
To avoid messing up the act.

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Third,

150
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,600
Even though we're married and technically a couple,

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,279
but—

152
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,920
No touching me.

153
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,399
And no inappropriate thoughts.

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,319
If you do have inappropriate thoughts about me,

155
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,959
you'll have to pay extra.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,839
Don't worry.

157
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,600
If that day really comes,

158
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll write my name, Su Qingyan, backwards.

159
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,960
Come on.

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,799
Hey, look at the camera.

161
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,039
Okay.

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,600
Get a little closer.

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,320
Miss,

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
you're out of the frame.

165
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,759
Miss, move a bit closer.

166
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,919
You're taking wedding photos here.

167
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,039
Can you smile?

168
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,080
You're about to get married.

169
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,919
Why are you being so shy?

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,120
Come on.

171
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,759
We agreed not to get handsy.

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,240
It's a wedding photo shoot.

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,639
If you're not a bit intimate, who will believe it?

174
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,159
Will your family believe it?

175
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,919
Come on, relax.

176
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:06,840
That's right.

177
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,679
That's better.

178
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,840
Come on, give a smile.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,080
Okay.

180
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,600
Change your pose, come on.

181
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
Let's take a sweet kissing photo.

182
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
No way.

183
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,879
It's a wedding photo shoot.

184
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,440
If you don't take a kissing photo, who will believe it?

185
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,200
Don't think I want to do this.

186
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,279
It's all for the act.

187
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,759
At least kiss the cheek.

188
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll make another sacrifice.

189
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Come on.

190
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,840
Get ready.

191
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,480
Okay.

192
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,519
Look at the camera.

193
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,519
Three.

194
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,480
Two.

195
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,600
One.

196
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,279
Honey

197
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,240
Look

198
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,559
We look pretty good together in the photos

199
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,200
Don't call me "honey" when no one's around

200
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,440
We're only in a fake marriage

201
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,399
I'm your boss

202
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,399
You're my employee

203
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,559
If you take advantage of me again like you did during the wedding photos

204
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,960
Be careful or you won't get a single cent

205
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,799
It's not like this is our first kiss

206
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,600
Aren't you—Shut up

207
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Qingyan

208
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,320
These flowers are for you.

209
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,639
Song Haoyang

210
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,000
You still have the nerve to show up?

211
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,480
What happened yesterday was my fault.

212
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,960
But it's only because I love you too much.

213
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
I just got a little impatient.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,639
How about this—

215
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Just tell me what you want as compensation.

216
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,399
I promise I'll do it.

217
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,759
Fine.

218
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Then I want you to disappear from my sight right now.

219
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,519
Just looking at you makes me sick.

220
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,480
Su Qingyan

221
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,840
Don't push your luck.

222
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,519
You'll have to marry me sooner or later.

223
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,720
Whether I sleep with you a day earlier

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,759
or a day later,

225
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
what difference does it make?

226
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,720
You're truly an animal.

227
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,559
Where do you think you're going?

228
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,600
Let go of me!

229
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,279
I'm telling you,

230
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,440
if I don't get you today,

231
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,639
I'll take your last name.

232
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,559
Song Haoyang, let go of me!

233
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,600
You dare hit me?

234
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,240
Do you know who I am, kid?

235
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
I know.

236
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,320
Song Haoyang, the young master.

237
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,519
You're exactly who I'm hitting.

238
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,559
You two,

239
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,799
beat him to a pulp for me!

240
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,720
Let me tell you something.

241
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
Our Song family is wealthy and powerful.

242
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,320
We’re not to be messed with.

243
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,720
Not to be messed with.

244
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,120
Not to be messed with, huh?

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,679
Stop!

246
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,639
If you dare touch me,

247
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,879
our Song family will definitely make you

248
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,919
regret it for the rest of your life.

249
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,840
Regret it for the rest of your life.

250
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,120
Regret it for the rest of your life, huh?

251
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,000
Stop!

252
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,440
If you back off now,

253
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,279
it’s still not too late.

254
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,600
Not too late.

255
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
Not too late, huh?

256
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,799
Big brother, big brother!

257
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,480
Stop hitting me!

258
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:39,960
I...

259
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,039
I won’t dare anymore.

260
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,159
Let me tell you,

261
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,039
Su Qingyan is already married to me.

262
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,799
If you dare bother her again,

263
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,759
I’ll beat you so badly your own mother won’t recognize you.

264
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,399
I won’t dare anymore.

265
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,879
Get lost!

266
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Kid!

267
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,600
If you’ve got guts, tell me your name.

268
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,759
I guarantee you won’t even have a grave to be buried in.

269
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
Someone like you

270
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,679
isn’t worthy of knowing my name.

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
But I’m in a good mood today.

272
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,399
Honey, come here.

273
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,720
Tell him

274
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,759
what my name is.

275
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,279
My husband is

276
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.

277
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,639
What?

278
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,559
Gao... Gao Feng?

279
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,679
He... he's Gao Feng from Junsheng Group?

280
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,519
Good, as long as you know to be afraid.

281
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,120
He and I are already legally married.

282
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,200
Don't bother me again.

283
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,639
Let's go.

284
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,840
How was that?

285
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,799
I acted pretty well, right?

286
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,919
It was just okay.

287
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,919
But...

288
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,360
Do you know the Song family is very powerful in Yuncheng?

289
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,279
If he comes to take revenge on you,

290
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,360
you'll be in real danger.

291
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,480
You shouldn't have hit him like that.

292
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm the dignified president of Junsheng Group.

293
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Why would I be afraid of him?

294
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,200
You're not really Gao Feng.

295
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,039
You're just pretending.

296
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,279
You're just a delivery guy.

297
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
Remember this.

298
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,320
If something like this happens again,

299
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,279
you can't be so impulsive.

300
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,519
From now on, you'll sleep here.

301
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,559
We've got the marriage certificate.

302
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,559
So is the next step the wedding night?

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,679
Rule number three of our agreement:

304
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,360
No inappropriate thoughts about me.

305
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
Fine, I won't.

306
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,879
Anyway, last night was pretty much like a wedding night.

307
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,399
Shut up.

308
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,559
Don't mention last night.

309
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
So many photos of Gao Feng.

310
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,279
Don't tell me you like Gao Feng.

311
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,279
Don't talk nonsense.

312
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,000
Gao Feng is a business tycoon.

313
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,080
And he's compassionate.

314
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,679
I just admire people like him.

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,919
Actually, Gao Feng is just a person.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,919
There's nothing special about him.

317
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:45,960
Hmph.

318
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,200
That's quite an attitude.

319
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,320
Gao Feng is a business genius.

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,279
What about you?

321
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,120
Just focus on delivering your food.

322
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,879
I'm being kept by a rich woman now.

323
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,679
I make a hundred thousand a month.

324
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,919
Do I still need to deliver food?

325
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,559
You really have no ambition.

326
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,840
Back in the day, Gao Feng

327
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
also worked his way up from the bottom.

328
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,679
Unlike you.

329
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,799
You just want an easy life and have no drive.

330
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,559
You're too kind, you're too kind.

331
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm praising Gao Feng,

332
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,679
not you.

333
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Don't get into character when you shouldn't.

334
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,559
If you want to play Gao Feng well,

335
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,360
looks alone aren't enough.

336
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,120
This contains his background information.

337
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
Memorize all of it tonight.

338
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,120
My acting is really good.

339
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,559
I can just improvise.

340
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,519
I don't need to memorize anything.

341
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,279
Rule number two:

342
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,159
You must follow my instructions in everything you do and say.

343
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,120
Memorize it.

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
Okay.

345
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,639
Memorize it.

346
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,720
Recite

347
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,919
Reciting texts is also part of your job.

348
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,200
I brought you here to work.

349
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,519
Not to sleep.

350
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,679
Happy

351
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,399
Just like a pig.
