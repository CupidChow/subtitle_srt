1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,480
Gaoxing, once we go, there's no turning back.

2
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,039
If you still have any secrets,

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,879
it's not too late to tell us now.

4
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,320
You're overthinking it.

5
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm just an ordinary person.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,320
What secrets could I possibly have?

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,520
So calm.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,759
Doesn't seem like he's lying to us.

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,000
No rush. You'll know once we get there.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,119
Hello, Mom.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,520
We're already on our way.

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,159
Make a nice dinner tonight.

13
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,119
Okay, son.

14
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,640
I'll have dinner ready and wait for you.

15
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,159
This is today's new script.

16
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,480
Everyone, memorize your lines quickly.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
Do your best later.

18
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,840
Once we're done,

19
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,439
everyone will get paid.

20
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,560
Okay.

21
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,680
Nightingale, you've worked hard lately.

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,680
This task,

23
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,239
let me handle it.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
You?

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,159
Yeah, since the boss is so interested,

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,920
I'll join in and play along too.

27
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,840
Then you'd better hold back a little.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
Don't mess things up for the boss.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,359
Don't worry.

30
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,920
Leave it to me.

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,079
We're here. This is my hometown.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,079
This is Qingshui Village.

33
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,079
It's the countryside, so it's a bit rundown.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,439
Can't compare to the big city.

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,280
If you're not used to it,

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
It's still not too late to go back now.

37
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,319
No need, since we're already here.

38
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,879
There's no reason to turn back halfway.

39
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,240
Let's go, let's take a look.

40
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,879
This kid, Xiao Gao,

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,120
has been sensible since he was little.

42
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,639
As soon as he learned to walk,

43
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,840
bare-bottomed,

44
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,439
he already knew to come help out at home.

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Having such a considerate and responsible kid as a husband

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,080
is really your good fortune, girl.

47
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,319
Xiao Gao has been smart since he was young.

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,280
He studies hard and is exceptionally talented.

49
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,919
Back then, I already thought

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,879
this boy would definitely make something of himself.

51
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,919
He's truly extraordinary.

52
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,560
Whoever marries him

53
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,080
is sure to have a good life.

54
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,560
Xiao Gao, this kid

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,280
Ah

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,360
No, I mean Brother Gaoxing

57
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,639
He's always been especially nice to us since we were little

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,840
He was the leader of the kids in our area

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,639
All the girls in our village used to say

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,479
They wanted to marry him when they grew up

61
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,319
Brother Gaoxing

62
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,919
Which of these two sisters is your wife?

63
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,080
Silly, only kids make choices

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,240
Of course Brother Gaoxing wants them all

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,919
Don't talk nonsense

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Go play, you two

67
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,879
Kids say the darndest things

68
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,159
Kids say the darndest things

69
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,759
I didn't expect that

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
People in your village think highly of you

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,439
Can't help it, our village is just simple and honest

72
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,960
Everyone likes to speak the truth

73
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,439
It's getting late

74
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,599
There's food made at home

75
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Let's go back and see my parents

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,879
Okay, lead the way

77
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,400
Dad

78
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,719
Mom

79
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm back!

80
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
Gaoxing is back!

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,000
You're back!

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,199
Come in quickly.

83
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,280
Which one of these two is it?

84
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,840
Su Qingyan, your daughter-in-law.

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Oh, okay.

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,719
This is her best friend.

87
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,159
A bonus, buy one get one free.

88
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,719
Who's the "buy one get one free"?

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,879
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
Why call us Uncle and Auntie?

91
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,479
Just like Gaoxing.

92
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,199
Just call us Mom and Dad.

93
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,759
Mom, Dad.

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,879
Yes, yes, good.

95
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
Such a beautiful girl

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,719
is actually our family's daughter-in-law.

97
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,520
Gaoxing,

98
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,120
you're really lucky.

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,080
Well,

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,159
everyone must be hungry.

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,039
Your mom and I will go bring out the food.

102
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,399
Go on, go on, go on.

103
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:16,959
Let's go, let's go.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,639
Let's go, let's go.

105
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,480
Your parents are really warm and welcoming.

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,519
Of course they are.

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,639
When they heard you were coming,

108
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,279
they got up early to start cooking.

109
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,959
You're really from Qingshui Village?

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,879
Everything in the documents is true.

111
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,639
What else would it be?

112
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,240
Are you doubting me?

113
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,279
Sorry about that.

114
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,040
Actually, we originally came here to...

115
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,839
Honey.

116
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,600
Honey

117
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,360
Honey

118
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,079
Honey

119
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,439
Honey, you're finally back.

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,240
You were working in the city,

121
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,279
leaving me all alone at home.

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,040
I missed you so much.

123
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,639
Happy

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,480
Explain to me clearly who she is.

125
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,439
Her?

126
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,639
I'm his wife. Who are you two?

127
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
What a joke.

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
If you're his wife, then what does that make our Qingyan?

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,480
What does she have to do with me?

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Honey

131
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,079
How did you go out and come back with two women?

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
If you keep this up, I'll get jealous.

133
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,519
Alright, happy.

134
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,639
I was about to say I misunderstood you.

135
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,839
I didn't expect you to have a wife here.

136
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
No wonder you kept making excuses not to bring us back.

137
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,639
So you were hiding a woman here all along.

138
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,839
Mr. Gao, do you have anything else to say?

139
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,879
It's all a misunderstanding.

140
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,240
You two wait for me a moment.

141
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,680
I asked Nightingale to find someone to put on an act.

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
Why are you making things more complicated?

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,439
I just thought this was a rare opportunity.

144
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,240
So I wanted to have some fun too. How was my performance?

145
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,839
You’re something else, Gao.

146
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,519
Right in front of Qingyan,

147
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,720
you’re still flirting with another woman.

148
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,879
Have you no shame?

149
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,040
An’an, let’s go.

150
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,480
Honey,

151
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,399
you’ve misunderstood.

152
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,240
She’s my sister.

153
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,639
She was just joking with you.

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,120
Sister.

155
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,240
She’s the real deal.

156
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,160
Absolutely genuine.

157
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,560
My biological sister.

158
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,000
Why are you just standing there?

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
Hurry up and help me wrap this up.

160
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,399
I can help.

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,759
But I want a raise.

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,759
Fifty percent.

163
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,639
Taking advantage of the situation, huh?

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,800
Thirty percent at most.

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,319
Forget it, then.

166
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,600
I’ll just keep pretending to be your wife.

167
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,920
Qingyan, look!

168
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,279
Those two shameless people

169
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,279
are still flirting and getting handsy.

170
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,120
They’re really treating us like fools.

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,639
Let’s go.

172
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,879
Honey!

173
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,560
You drive a hard bargain.

174
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
Fifty percent it is.

175
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,560
You're generous, boss.

176
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,959
Deal.

177
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,959
Sister-in-law, I was just joking with you.

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
My name is Gao Qing.

179
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,079
My brother is right.

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,279
I really am his sister.

181
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,759
You two

182
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,439
are really siblings?

183
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,759
Of course.

184
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,680
Really.

185
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,959
Truer than gold.

186
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
The food is here!

187
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,040
Qingqing, you're back.

188
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,199
Hurry, hurry, set the table, it's time to eat.

189
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,240
Sister-in-law, come eat.

190
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,319
Come on.

191
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,079
Qingyan, try this.

192
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,639
Eat more.

193
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,399
Thank you, Mom.

194
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,399
We're all family.

195
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,680
No need to thank me.

196
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
Our Gao Xing has a simple nature.

197
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,199
He's very honest.

198
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,399
In the future, as you live together,

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,800
please be more understanding.

200
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,279
Simple-minded

201
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,000
Very honest

202
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,000
Are you talking about him?

203
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,000
My brother is quietly talented.

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,439
Don’t be fooled by his ordinary appearance.

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
In fact,

206
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,600
his abilities are beyond what you can imagine.

207
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,199
Sister-in-law,

208
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,000
you’ll be really lucky after marrying my brother.

209
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,800
It’s unimaginable.

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,079
This delivery guy

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,800
probably makes several thousand a month.

212
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Unlike our Qingyan,

213
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,959
who started a company at such a young age.

214
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,879
As for her net worth,

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,879
it’s just

216
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,160
a few hundred million.

217
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,680
A few hundred million—is that a lot?

218
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,600
Not much, but it’s better than delivering food.

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,959
Oh, you probably don’t know.

220
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,560
Someone like our Qingyan,

221
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,160
in all of Yuncheng,

222
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,839
all the outstanding young men

223
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,600
are waiting for her to choose them.

224
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,079
Marrying your brother so early

225
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,000
is really marrying beneath her.

226
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,560
Oh, then you probably don’t know either.

227
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,600
My brother’s admirers

228
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
line up from here all the way to England.

229
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,800
Even the British princess

230
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
cries and begs to marry my brother.

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
She’d have to change her nationality first

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
and then line up at the counter for a number.

233
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,440
A female CEO marrying my brother

234
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,480
is really marrying up.

235
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Who are you saying is marrying up?

236
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,679
Who are you saying is marrying beneath themselves?

237
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,159
Alright, alright, stop arguing.

238
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,480
Let’s eat, let’s eat.

239
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,240
How about we open a bottle of wine?

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,519
Let's all have a drink.

241
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,440
Oh, no, no.

242
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,799
I don't drink alcohol.

243
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm driving, so I can't drink.

244
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,039
If they won't drink, we will.

245
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,559
Meeting Qingqing today,

246
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,960
it feels like we've known each other forever.

247
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,399
We have to have a drink.

248
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,879
Qingqing, you're not scared, are you?

249
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,639
An'an, you're joking.

250
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,399
It's rare for me to be in such a good mood.

251
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,480
As your big sister, I'll keep you company to the end.

252
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,840
How's it going downstairs?

253
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,799
An'an and your sister are having a drinking contest.

254
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,200
The two of them are really getting into it.

255
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,159
My sister is spoiled.

256
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,120
Please don't mind her.

257
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,679
Of course not.

258
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,600
Actually, we were the ones being presumptuous.

259
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,799
We came over without letting them know first.

260
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,440
But your uncle and aunt are really nice.

261
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,879
Of course, they're professionals.

262
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,399
Ah.

263
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,600
What do you mean?

264
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,399
It's nothing.

265
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,759
I just meant the environment here is pretty simple.

266
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,960
As long as you don't mind.

267
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,240
Not at all, I actually like it here.

268
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,879
It's warm and peaceful.

269
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,080
The people are honest and kind.

270
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,480
It's not like our Yun City.

271
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,440
Every day is just work and scheming against others.

272
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,399
By the way, about the skincare products last time—

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
I haven't properly thanked you yet.

274
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,480
Just another verbal thank you?

275
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,559
Can't you give me a real reward for once?

276
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,480
Who says I don't have one?
