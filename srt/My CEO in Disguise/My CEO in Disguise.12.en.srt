1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,240
Why don't you let me have Brother Gao?

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,000
Let him be my husband.

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,000
How about it?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,679
What?

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,120
Actually, Gao Xing and I are in a fake marriage.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,839
We have three rules.

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,320
We don't interfere in each other's relationships.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,359
If Miss Cheng likes him,

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,320
and he likes you too,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,960
I certainly don't mind.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,879
That's great, a fake marriage!

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,719
Don't worry, Brother Gao really likes me.

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,439
Hey.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,840
Su Yi, don't mess around.

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,600
Who's messing around?

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,320
Anyway, you and President Su are just in a fake marriage.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
She won't get jealous.

18
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,479
Right, President Su?

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,159
Of course.

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,000
What right do I have to be jealous?

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,439
Then I won't bother you two.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
Qingyan, wait for me!

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,799
Wife.

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,840
Qingyan.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,399
Brother Gao, you still have to take me back to the hotel.

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,479
Alright, you go back by yourself first.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,320
I have something to do, so I'll leave first.

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Where are you going?

29
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,039
My wife is angry.

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,079
I need to keep her company first.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,680
I came all this way just to see you.

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,760
You should at least take me back to the hotel.

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,920
Alright.

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,400
The task is done.

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,799
Then I'll head back first.

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Brother Gao, since you're already here,

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,519
you should at least keep me company.

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,239
If I don't go back soon,

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,439
I might not be able to go back at all.

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,519
It's all just an act anyway.

41
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,120
It's not like I'm your real sister-in-law.

42
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,159
How about this—

43
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,959
I'll pay you too,

44
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,799
and you can pretend to be my husband.

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm your brother.

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,879
Brothers and sisters can't pretend to be a married couple.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,079
Wouldn't that be mixing up the roles?

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,959
I don't want to be siblings with you.

49
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,319
Brother Gao, we've known each other since we were young.

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,400
I've seen with my own eyes

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,920
how you never lost your ambition in hard times,

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,439
and how you help others when you're successful.

53
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,319
A man as outstanding as you—

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
what woman wouldn't want to be your wife?

55
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,239
Even if you flatter me endlessly,

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,120
I still only see you as a sister.

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,239
I'm leaving.

58
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,680
Ouch.

59
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,000
What's wrong?

60
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,280
I twisted my ankle.

61
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,400
Did you really twist it, or are you faking?

62
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,080
Let me take a look.

63
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,560
Does it still hurt?

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,879
It hurts—a lot.

65
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,400
Qing Yan

66
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,240
Gao Xing took Cheng Suyi back to the hotel.

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,479
He still hasn't come back yet.

68
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,840
What does it matter to me whether he comes back or not?

69
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,319
Aren't you going to do something about it?

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
What right do I have to interfere?

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,840
He and I are contractually married.

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,879
He can go wherever he wants.

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,919
He can do whatever he wants.

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,039
It's none of my business.

75
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,840
Are you sure about that?

76
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,000
I just saw the way Cheng Suyi was acting.

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,199
She looked like she was going to eat Gao Xing alive.

78
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,240
The two of them alone in a hotel, man and woman, sparks could fly.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,639
If something really happens between them,

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,199
it'll be too late for you to regret it.

81
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,479
Then what should I do?

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
My relationship with him is fake.

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,719
What right do I have to control him?

84
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,080
Even if it's a fake marriage,

85
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
we still have a marriage certificate.

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Besides, the contract hasn't expired yet.

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,719
If he fools around outside,

88
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,879
and your family or Song Haoyang finds out,

89
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,520
won't your relationship be exposed?

90
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,680
That's true.

91
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,000
So according to the contract,

92
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,439
not only do I have the right to interfere,

93
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,800
I actually have to interfere.

94
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,879
That makes sense, right?

95
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,400
It makes perfect sense.

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,280
Let's go.

97
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,879
Let's go.

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,719
Hang in there.

99
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,599
It's this room.

100
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,639
Don't rush.

101
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,639
Shh, wait.

102
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,439
Listen a bit more.

103
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,199
Brother Gao,

104
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,800
You’re still so skilled after all this time.

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,280
I'm going to press harder now.

106
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,920
Stop!

107
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,399
Qingyan, don’t be impulsive.

108
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,920
What are you doing?

109
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,399
She twisted her ankle.

110
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm giving her a massage.

111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,399
President Su, don’t you have something to do?

112
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,399
Why are you here?

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,199
I twisted my ankle too.

114
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,279
I came to have him massage it.

115
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,000
President Su, your timing with this twisted ankle is quite something.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,439
Miss Cheng’s ankle,

117
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,160
was twisted at just the right moment too.

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,480
Alright, I’ll massage yours too.

119
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,480
Brother Gao, my ankle isn’t better yet.

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,839
Aren’t you going to keep massaging mine?

121
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,720
Alright, I’ll do both at the same time.

122
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,160
Ouch!

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,399
That feels so good.

124
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,120
Brother Gao, your left hand massages way better than your right.

125
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,639
Really?

126
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,120
As far as I know, Gao Xing isn’t left-handed.

127
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,399
Anyone with common sense knows

128
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,079
the right hand massages better than the left.

129
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,879
Brother Gao, I want your right hand too.

130
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,319
Alright, I’ll switch hands.

131
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,480
Aren’t you two in a fake marriage?

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,839
I heard you even set three ground rules.

133
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,240
Brother Gao has to pay a fine just for touching you.

134
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,800
So why are you letting him massage you?

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,839
It’s fine.

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,399
I have money.

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,000
I’ll pay the fine for him.

138
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,240
Looks like I’m not needed here.

139
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,240
Sorry to bother you.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,199
You're jealous.

141
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Who's jealous?

142
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
We're just a fake couple anyway.

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
I can't control who you're with.

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,879
Really?

145
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,560
Then I can go back to her, right?

146
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,839
You—

147
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,560
Don't be mad.

148
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,439
I've actually known Suyi for a long time.

149
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,680
I only see her as a little sister.

150
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,639
There's nothing else between us.

151
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,279
She's now the head of the ancient medical family.

152
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,360
She's really busy with a lot of affairs.

153
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,199
Besides,

154
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
she came here this time just to help me.

155
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,399
She'll be leaving tomorrow.

156
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,879
She twisted her ankle right in front of me.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Whether it was real or not,

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,240
how could I not take care of her?

159
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,879
Why are you explaining all this to me?

160
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,439
We're not a real couple anyway.

161
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,279
Hey—

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,639
Who says we're not a real couple?

163
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,879
We have a marriage certificate.

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,639
A husband has to report things like this to his wife.

165
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,600
Whatever you want.

166
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

167
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,720
Brother Gao, are you really not coming with me?

168
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,319
I still have things to do.

169
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,199
You go back first.

170
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,000
Is it because of that fake wife?

171
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,160
I really don't get how she's better than me.

172
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,199
What are you thinking about all day, you little rascal?

173
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,399
I'm not a kid anymore.

174
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,399
I'm already twenty.

175
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,199
I can get married now.

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,399
No matter how old you are,

177
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,800
you're still a little kid in my eyes.

178
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,639
I'm not talking to you anymore.

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,439
Don't worry, I'll come back again.

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,759
Next time, I'll have a proper match with you.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No problem, I'm always ready.

182
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,279
Cheng Suyi has left.

183
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,000
Ah.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
She left.

185
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,839
Then let's get down to business.

186
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
Zhao Daqiang hit it off with him right away.

187
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,800
Liu Xin and Liu Shanhe were lucky to run into the inspector.

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,519
And there's also Zhou Pengfei, the boss of Tiange Group.

189
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,000
They all treat him with great respect.

190
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,720
Even the head of the ancient medical family

191
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,279
has become like a sibling to him.

192
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,160
Once could be a coincidence.

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
Twice could be luck.

194
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,399
But three or four times in a row is not normal.

195
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,920
There must be something going on here.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
This Gao Xing

197
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,879
must have secrets we don't know about.

198
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
But we've checked the records over and over again

199
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,279
and haven't found anything unusual.

200
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
Records can be faked.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,199
But background can't be.

202
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,000
Doesn't the record say he's from Qingshui Village?

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,279
Then let's go to Qingshui Village and see for ourselves.

204
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,240
Okay.

205
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,399
You two

206
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,639
want to go to my home?

207
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
That's right.

208
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,919
Aren't we already married?

209
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
A wife visiting her in-laws

210
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,600
isn't a problem, is it?

211
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,679
Normally, there's no problem.

212
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,480
But, honey...

213
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,720
President Su

214
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Did you forget

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,399
that we are a contract couple?

216
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
I signed the contract.

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm just here to play along with you.

218
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,840
There's no need for you to meet my parents, right?

219
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,840
Of course there is.

220
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,720
If we're acting, we have to do the whole act.

221
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Since we're married, we're a couple.

222
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
Visiting your parents

223
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
will help me understand you better.

224
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,600
That way, our act will be more convincing.

225
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:20,679
Isn't that right?

226
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,440
You're right.

227
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,159
What is it?

228
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,600
Our Qingyan is going home with you,

229
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,039
are you worried she's not presentable?

230
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,120
That she'll embarrass you?

231
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,879
How could that be?

232
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
My wife is a dignified and beautiful CEO,

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,039
talented and beautiful.

234
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,799
Her coming to my home

235
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,279
is an honor for my family.

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
That's good, then.

237
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,639
The information says you're from Qingshui Village.

238
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's head out now.

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Is that okay?

240
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,799
Or is it

241
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,799
that you have some secret you can't tell?

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,039
Is it inconvenient?

243
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,080
No, of course it's convenient.

244
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,440
You're more than welcome.
