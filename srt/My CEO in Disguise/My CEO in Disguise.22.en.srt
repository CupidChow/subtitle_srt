1
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,760
Su Zhengchun, what exactly do you mean by this?

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,440
Watch your manners! Is that how you speak to your elders?

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,239
Elders?

4
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,039
Are there elders like you?

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:23,760
You—

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,239
When Qingmu was in trouble, you just stood by and did nothing.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,079
Now that the company is doing better,

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,559
you come running to fight me for it.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,839
And you’re even forcing me to get married.

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,960
What kind of elders are you?

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,439
How can you speak so harshly, child?

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,079
Qingmu’s growth and success

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,719
is partly thanks to us, isn’t it?

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,479
Besides, with such great wealth,

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,560
how could a young woman like you handle it?

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,320
We’re kindly offering to help you take over.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,880
Why are you so ungrateful?

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,880
A woman like you—

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,240
What’s the use of just knowing business?

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,079
Once you marry into the Song family,

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,479
you should observe a woman’s proper conduct,

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,840
and just focus on being a good young mistress.

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,240
Don’t let people say the Su family has lost its good name.

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,240
Third Uncle is right.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,840
Qingyan, don’t worry.

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,359
Once you marry in,

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,920
you won’t have to run around busy every day.

28
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,079
Just relax and enjoy a good life.

29
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,879
Let me say something.

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,040
Isn’t this a Su family meeting?

31
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,840
How did this thing get in here?

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,959
Kid, watch your mouth and stop making veiled threats.

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,280
Let me tell you something.

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,040
From today on,

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,680
I, Song Haoyang, am Qingyan's husband now.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
The official son-in-law of the Su family.

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,480
And you

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,879
can only stand here and watch helplessly.

39
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,519
There's nothing you can do.

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,439
Is that so?

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,480
Then let me try.

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
That's enough.

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,280
Su Qingyan, the family has already decided

44
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,840
that starting today,

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,040
you will immediately divorce Gao Xing.

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,680
And the handover procedures for Qingmu Company

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,719
must be fully cooperated with.

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,959
Qingmu Company was left to me by my parents.

49
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280
The family has no right to interfere.

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,519
Right?

51
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,879
Is this enough?

52
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,719
Th-this is...

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,519
That's right.

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,080
This is the will your late parents left you.

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,319
It's written very clearly on here.

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,360
Your uncle has authority over you and Qingmu.

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,479
He has guardianship and the final say.

58
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,840
With this document,

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,919
even if you go to court and plead your case, it won't help.

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,479
You really are shameless.

61
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:22,960
Honey,

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,520
don't be angry.

63
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,280
Let me handle this.

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,479
So your dirty tricks didn't work,

65
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,080
and now you're resorting to force?

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Let me tell you all,

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,039
Qingmu belongs to my wife.

68
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
No one can take her away.

69
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,560
If anyone dares to try,

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,680
they'll bear the consequences.

71
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,879
Bear the consequences.

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,840
Well, we're trying anyway.

73
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,680
What can you do about it?

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,159
Fine.

75
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Then from now on,

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,639
the Su and Song families are officially banished from Yuncheng.

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,759
Oh?

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,039
How impressive.

79
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Acting like you're on top again.

80
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,039
Look at you, raging helplessly.

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,599
You really look like a clown.

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,039
Exactly.

83
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,520
All talk, no substance.

84
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,479
You don't know what's good for you.

85
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,439
Guards!

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,439
Throw this guy out!

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Wait!

88
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,080
So noisy and chaotic.

89
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
What kind of behavior is this?

90
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,280
Dad, why are you here?

91
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,240
Dad.

92
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,879
Grandpa.

93
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,360
Dad, why are you here?

94
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,840
Please, sit down and rest.

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,919
I'm not so old that I can't walk.

96
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,919
Eldest son.

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,719
Tell me, what's going on here?

98
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,439
Dad, here's what happened.

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,039
This is the young master of the Song Group.

100
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,599
He is talented and handsome.

101
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,599
He has always liked Qingyan.

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
So, for the sake of our family,

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,639
and for Qingyan's happiness,

104
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,240
I kindly arranged a marriage between the two families.

105
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,280
But who would have thought Qingyan would run away from the wedding in public,

106
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,560
and even found a food delivery guy to be her husband.

107
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
She turned against our family because of him.

108
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,039
As her uncle, I couldn't persuade her at all.

109
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,280
That's right, Dad.

110
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,439
This guy named Gaoxing

111
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,839
not only pretended to be Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng,

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,319
but also used Su Qingyan's connections to sneak into our company.

113
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,360
He goes around showing off and deceiving people all day.

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,759
He has no respect for rules.

115
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,240
He has completely disgraced our Su family.

116
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,759
Grandpa, it's not like that.

117
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,560
Gaoxing just joined Qingmu.

118
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,079
He helped us resolve our foreign debt and investment issues.

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,639
He obtained the secret recipe of the medical sage.

120
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,639
He even got two international award-winning actresses to endorse us.

121
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,879
Qingmu's revival is all thanks to him.

122
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,959
Grandpa, Gao Xing is a great benefactor to Qingmu.

123
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,879
We owe him a lot.

124
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,839
Owe him? Nonsense.

125
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,199
He's just a delivery guy.

126
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,560
He doesn't have any real skills.

127
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
It was all just luck.

128
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Yeah, that's right.

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,279
And he pretended to be Gao Feng.

130
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,279
You all admitted it just now, didn't you?

131
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,279
Don't try to deny it.

132
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,240
You say he pretended to be Gao Feng.

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,879
That's right, Mr. Su.

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,279
Someone useless like him

135
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,120
is not worthy of being the Su family's son-in-law.

136
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,279
If you ask me,

137
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,560
his presence here is an insult to your eyes.

138
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,920
You should kick him out right away.

139
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,279
Young man, is what they said true?

140
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,639
Does it really matter if it's true or not?

141
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,319
I don't care about being the Su family's son-in-law.

142
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,839
But no one except me can be Su Qingyan's husband.

143
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,680
How dare you!

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,319
Dad.

145
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,759
Wait.

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,920
Young man.

147
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,240
Where did you get that ring?

148
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,879
The ring?

149
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,839
Of course, it's always been mine.

150
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
You...

151
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
Yours?

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
What's wrong, Grandpa?

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,920
What's so special about a lousy ring?

154
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,959
Who knows which trash heap he picked it up from.

155
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,879
Shut up!

156
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,040
Young man, come with me for a moment.

157
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,480
Wait for me.

158
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,959
Su Changqing from the Su family greets Mr. Gao.

159
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,759
Sir,

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
You know me?

161
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,680
I have a friend at Junsheng.

162
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,079
According to him,

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,240
the president of Junsheng Group, Gao Feng, is known to be mysterious and low-key.

164
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,879
He never appears in public.

165
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,040
But on his hand,

166
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,279
he always wears a distinctive dragon-head ring.

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,839
It's exactly the same as the one you're wearing.

168
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,839
So that's how it is.

169
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,439
I have long admired you, Mr. Gao.

170
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,639
You built your business from scratch,

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
creating an impressive enterprise.

172
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,519
You are known for your generosity,

173
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,879
and your dedication to public welfare.

174
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,839
To meet you today

175
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,959
is truly my honor.

176
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,240
You flatter me, sir.

177
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,040
No,

178
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,839
it's much more than that.

179
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Many years ago,

180
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,920
my Su Group

181
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,720
was targeted by a foreign financial giant.

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,040
The situation was dire.

183
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,079
If they had succeeded,

184
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,360
not only would my family have been ruined,

185
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,240
but hundreds, even thousands of Su Group employees

186
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
would have lost their livelihoods.

187
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,879
At that critical moment,

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
someone reached out to help.

189
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,639
That was how we defeated the foreign threat.

190
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,639
Afterwards, I made many inquiries

191
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,319
and learned it was Junsheng who helped us.

192
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,040
In fact,

193
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,040
you are the savior of my family and the entire Su Group.

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,519
You are too kind.

195
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,279
As compatriots,

196
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,720
we should help each other

197
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
and stand together against outside threats.

198
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
That's only right.

199
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,680
Yes,

200
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,839
but as the president of Junsheng,

201
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,839
why would you come to my family,

202
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
and how did you end up with my granddaughter?

203
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,040
Today, there is no Gao Feng,

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
only happiness.

205
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,480
There is no president of Junsheng,

206
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,120
only your grandson-in-law.

207
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,879
Okay.

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,439
Alright.

209
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,680
My granddaughter,

210
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,480
really has good taste.

211
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,039
I'm happy.

212
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,279
Are you alright?

213
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
I'm fine, sit down.

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Dad, you know everything now.

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,759
Yes, I know everything.

216
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,080
That's great, Dad.

217
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
Hurry up and arrange their divorce.

218
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,240
I'll kick this guy out right away.

219
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,120
Dad, why are you hitting me?

220
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
What divorce?

221
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,399
Who told you about a divorce?

222
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,240
If you mention those two words again,

223
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll break your mouth.

224
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,759
Zhengchun.

225
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,480
Come here.

226
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,840
Dad, why are you hitting me?

227
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,039
I'm hitting you because you're unfilial.

228
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,440
Kneel down.

229
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,639
Dad, this guy—

230
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,720
He's lying to you.

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
He's been lying all along.

232
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,559
Shut up.

233
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,919
You two kneel down as well.

234
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,360
What's going on?

235
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
What did you say to Grandpa?

236
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,759
Nothing.

237
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,519
The old man is sharp-eyed and puts justice above family.
