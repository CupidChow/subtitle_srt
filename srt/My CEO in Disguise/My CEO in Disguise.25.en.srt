1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm back.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,960
Honey.

3
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,199
Qingyan.

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,920
Honey, where are you?

5
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,119
I can explain to you.

6
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,039
Gao Feng.

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,439
Long time no see.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,719
Yan Qiang, I'm telling you,

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,079
if you dare touch her,

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll make you regret ever being born.

11
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,879
Threatening me?

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,400
What I, Yan Qiang, fear least is threats.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,599
You want to see her?

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,239
Go home now.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
We won't leave until we meet.

16
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,000
What did you do to her?

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Relax.

18
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,480
She's not dead.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,200
She was just knocked out.

20
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,280
Happy?

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,799
Didn't expect you'd actually dare come back.

22
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,239
No, that's not right.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,959
I should call you Gao Feng, right?

24
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,280
Trash like you isn't qualified to talk to me.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,799
Tell your boss to come out.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,840
You—

27
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,599
Alright.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,519
As expected of the president of Junsheng Group.

29
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,079
You truly have an extraordinary presence.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,480
I, Yan, admire you.

31
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,280
Let Qingyan go.

32
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,599
If you have a problem, come at me.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,959
I didn't expect this.

34
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,000
Gao, you really are someone who cherishes women.

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,479
I can let her go.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,639
But first, hand over Su Zhengxia and his wife's genetic research results.

37
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,159
Give them to me.

38
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,120
What you want isn't with me.

39
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,000
Still pretending?

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,919
Let me give you a piece of advice.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,039
That woman's life

42
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,840
is in my hands now.

43
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,840
If you still care about her safety,

44
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,120
then hand over the research honestly.

45
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,759
What if I refuse?

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
If you won't take the easy way, you'll get the hard way.

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,439
Gao Feng.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you really crazy?

49
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,199
I could shoot her dead at any moment.

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,319
Why don't you try shooting her?

51
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,560
What do you mean?

52
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,520
Impossible.

53
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,719
You're not Su Qingyan.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,439
How could Su Qingyan have such skills?

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,719
Who are you really?

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,960
Suzaku, Security Division, Junsheng Group.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,199
Junsheng Suzaku.

58
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:16,840
Ah!

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,800
We've been tricked.

60
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,840
Men!

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Boss Yan.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
What do we do now?

63
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,199
Go, go!

64
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,800
Go!

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,599
Don't move!

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,039
You two act recklessly.

67
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,879
You commit every imaginable crime.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,199
What awaits you is the punishment of the law.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,879
All of this was planned by you in advance.

70
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,319
I already reported everything to the authorities.

71
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Maybe you could do whatever you wanted overseas,

72
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,280
but here at home,

73
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,680
every evil deed will come at a price.

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,240
Take them away.

75
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,199
Nightingale, Bluebird

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,159
Now there's also a Vermilion Bird

77
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,479
You really have a lot of beautiful women around you

78
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,719
They're all just my subordinates

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,240
They'll be your subordinates too in the future

80
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,879
I really didn't expect this

81
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,360
My husband is actually Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group

82
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,399
Actually, I am Gao Feng

83
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,879
You really are Gao Feng?

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,639
Impossible

85
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,120
How could it be such a coincidence?

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,959
This isn't a coincidence

87
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,600
I was entrusted by your parents

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,120
I came specifically to protect you

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,240
My parents?

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
How could you possibly know my parents?

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,839
They were two remarkable scientists

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,199
They spent many years overseas

93
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,439
Researching genetic technology

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,120
Just as they were about to achieve results

95
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,879
They were targeted by the overseas Blackstone organization

96
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,600
And were brutally murdered

97
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,480
I had known your parents for a long time

98
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,399
When I arrived at the time

99
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,560
It was already too late

100
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
Before your father died, he told me

101
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,279
The genetic technology data is in your hands

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,240
And asked me to protect you no matter what

103
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,759
Blackstone

104
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,480
You're saying it was Blackstone who killed my parents?

105
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,639
Song Haoyang is trying every possible way to marry you

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
That's also Blackstone's order

107
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,079
They want your genetic data

108
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,160
But don't worry

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,439
I will definitely bring them to justice

110
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,279
And avenge you

111
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,240
Thank you

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Just because of my parents' words

113
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,319
You've helped me so much

114
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,839
Actually, we've known each other for a long time.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,279
When I was eight years old,

116
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,199
my family went through a big upheaval.

117
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,600
I was so hungry I couldn't stand it anymore.

118
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,920
I went to your house to steal some food.

119
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,040
I got caught.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,879
You were the one who helped me out.

121
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,879
You comforted and encouraged me.

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
So from that moment on,

123
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,879
I remembered you deeply.

124
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,800
So you were that little boy.

125
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,319
You helped me back then.

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Now it's my turn to protect you.

127
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,560
So, you protect me

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,560
just to repay a kindness?

129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,560
To repay you,

130
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,319
and also for you.

131
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,800
Happiness and success.

132
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,920
Which one do you choose?

133
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,399
Only children make choices.

134
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,480
Of course, I want them all.

135
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,560
Now for an important news report.

136
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,959
Today,

137
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,279
the new head of the Su family, Su Qingyan,

138
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,319
will hold a grand wedding with Junsheng's president, Gao Feng.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,199
The bride and groom

140
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,639
are truly a perfect match, both talented and beautiful.

141
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,839
The groom is Junsheng's president, Gao Feng!

142
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,279
That's way better than that Song Haoyang guy.

143
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,319
He's at least a hundred times better.

144
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,480
Only someone that important

145
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,120
deserves to marry a beauty like Su Qingyan.

146
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,959
No need to envy him.

147
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,279
As long as you work hard,

148
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,879
one day you'll be like him too.

149
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,439
Oh, come on.

150
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,160
You're daydreaming again.

151
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,199
Wake up already.

152
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,000
Exactly.

153
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,319
You, like Gao Feng?

154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
Why not just say you are Gao Feng?

155
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,199
Su... Su Qingyan?

156
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,319
Why is the bride coming out?

157
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,920
Are you free?

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,439
I want to marry you.

159
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,199
Sure.

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,079
Wait, what?

161
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,519
Am I seeing this right?

162
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,680
President Su is marrying Gaoxing?

163
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,639
President Su...

164
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,759
Are you sure you’re not mistaken?

165
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,199
This guy is just a delivery boy.

166
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,600
Your husband is supposed to be Gao Feng.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,959
No mistake.

168
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,600
I am Gao Feng.
