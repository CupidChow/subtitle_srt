1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,359
As close as family

2
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,600
A bond stronger than gold

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,280
I'll make you feel as close as family

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,600
I'll make your bond stronger than gold

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,879
Forget it, forget it, forget it

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm not angry

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
We're just a fake couple anyway

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,800
What's there to be angry about

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
It's so late and still not back

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,399
He's really having so much fun he doesn't want to come back

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,920
When are you coming back

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,920
Forget it

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,079
If you don't come back, then so be it

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
Anyway, it's nice and quiet with just me at home

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,959
You'd better think it through

16
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,519
Those two actresses just now looked so happy

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,879
Like they were eyeing their prey

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,760
You sent him out

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,760
That's really like a lamb entering a tiger's den

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,719
Once he goes, he won't come back

21
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,159
You're back.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
It's so late already.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,319
Where else would I go if not home?

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,719
Oh.

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,159
I thought you were going to stay there tonight.

26
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,959
To keep them company.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,760
Of course, I think being with my wife is more important.

28
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,640
Wife.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,599
You're eating dumplings?

30
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,920
Don't talk nonsense.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,959
What wife?

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,640
My wife's cooking is really good.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
Much better than outside food.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
Here, dip it in some vinegar.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,799
Well then.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,959
She's an international film queen, you know.

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,759
Don't you think it's a pity to come back and keep me company?

38
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,360
Not at all.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,080
I still have you, don't I?

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,280
I...

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
But we're just a fake couple.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,599
But my feelings are real.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,199
Feelings?

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,039
Yeah.

45
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,159
One should have a sense of contract.

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,159
I've always been sincere about contracts in my life.

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,280
I've never watered down my sincerity.

48
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,039
Contract? What contract?

49
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,240
Did you forget?

50
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,520
Aren't we a contract couple?

51
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,599
We signed a contract.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,759
I have to be professional as your fake husband.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,879
Otherwise, I wouldn't deserve the salary you pay me.

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,840
Right?

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,599
Stop eating.

56
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Why are you angry?

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm not full yet.

58
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
Stay hungry, serves you right.

59
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,159
You didn't put salt in the dumplings.

60
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,919
Men are all pigs.

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
Come join us!

62
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,759
I'm coming, I'm coming.

63
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,520
Ah, this feels so good.

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
Move a little closer this way.

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,719
You're so far from me.

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Brother-in-law, have a drink.

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
I can't hold my liquor well.

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,680
Everyone has worked hard lately.

69
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,919
We've all put in a lot for the company's project.

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,879
Fortunately, our efforts have paid off.

71
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,120
Our product launched successfully.

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,240
It's selling really well.

73
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,159
Today is our celebration banquet.

74
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,639
I'll cover all the expenses tonight.

75
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,840
That's great!

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Any other questions?

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,159
I have one.

78
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,159
Go ahead.

79
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,719
At the company celebration,

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,199
she

81
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,680
and he—what are they here for?

82
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,840
To drink juice.

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,800
Let me answer.

84
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,199
My brother

85
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,800
is a die-hard fan of Liu Bingxin.

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Recently, Liu, the movie queen, became Qingmu's spokesperson.

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
He got up early today to get ready.

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,759
He came here just to meet his idol.

89
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
Ms. Liu...

90
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,120
I—I'm your idol.

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,919
No, that's not right.

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
You're my fan.

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,120
Um...

94
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,960
Could you give me an autograph?

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,120
Sure!

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
As for me,

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm your fan, brother-in-law.

98
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,759
My fan?

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah.

100
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,199
Brother-in-law.

101
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,040
Exactly.

102
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
I've heard all about your recent heroic deeds.

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,920
You're really amazing.

104
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,399
Before, I just didn't recognize your worth.

105
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,439
But from now on,

106
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,279
you're definitely my only idol.

107
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,160
Sis,

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,040
I'll be getting closer to my brother-in-law from now on.

109
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,079
You don't mind, do you?

110
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,920
Whatever.

111
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,360
Do whatever you want.

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
It's got nothing to do with me.

113
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,040
How was last night?

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
Did Gaoxing go home?

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,759
Yeah.

116
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,319
I knew it.

117
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,560
Gaoxing really only has you in his heart.

118
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Only me?

119
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,000
I think he only cares about the contract.

120
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,399
Why are you everywhere?

121
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,639
Because I want to.

122
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,839
Gaoxing, do you think I look good in this photo?

123
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,519
Look.

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,360
I look good in the photo.

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah, you look pretty good.

126
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,199
Come here.

127
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,240
That's too much.

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,920
In broad daylight,

129
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,680
even if you're a female celebrity,

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,519
you can't just openly steal someone's husband like this.

131
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,560
Qingyan, you can't just let this slide.

132
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,600
You need to assert your claim.

133
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,639
I'm obviously the better-looking one.

134
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,680
Assert what claim?

135
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,720
He and I are just a fake couple anyway.

136
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
He can do whatever he wants.

137
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:16,959
Fine.

138
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,759
What kind of person is that?

139
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,959
Miss Liu, have a taste.

140
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,319
I grilled this for you myself.

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,959
Thank you.

142
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,360
You're welcome.

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,519
Happy.

144
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,399
It's freshly grilled, try it.

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,839
No, thank you.

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,920
I, um...

147
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,519
He...

148
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,720
The lamb taste is too strong.

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
Happy doesn't like it.

150
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,959
Here, Happy.

151
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,120
Have some vegetables.

152
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,399
Thank you.

153
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,120
You should eat it yourself.

154
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,759
Happy, is there anything else you want to eat?

155
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll grill it for you.

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm not hungry.

157
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,240
Two international award-winning actresses are fighting to help grill skewers.

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,519
As expected of my idol.

159
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
That's some serious charm.

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,519
Oh, I'm hungry.

161
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
Happy, grill two skewers for me.

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,439
Sure!

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Come and have a taste.

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,879
Just put it there.

165
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,680
Oh wow.

166
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,399
No wonder you two are newlyweds.

167
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,000
Your relationship is really great.

168
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,439
Even at a barbecue, you two are showing off your love.

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,759
What?

170
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,519
Married couple?

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,000
Gaoxing, you really got married?

172
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,639
Miss Su is your wife?

173
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,959
That's right.

174
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,160
As for Gaoxing,

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,519
he's the vice president of Qingmu.

176
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,360
So our relationship has to be kept a bit secret at work.

177
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,199
But we really have registered our marriage.

178
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,279
And we've been living together for a while.

179
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,279
Our relationship has always been very stable.

180
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Right, honey?

181
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,160
Stable. Very stable.

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,480
Sorry about that.

183
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Sorry for making you two laugh.

184
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,519
Hey, don't just stand there.

185
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,839
Sit down, let's have a drink.

186
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,079
Come on, since there are so many of us,

187
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,480
let's play a game today.

188
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,240
Truth or Dare.

189
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
So, the mouth of this bottle

190
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,680
will point to someone, and that person has to answer a question

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,199
or do a dare.

192
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,879
But if you can't do it,

193
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,759
then you have to drink as a penalty.

194
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,240
The game begins!

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Let me ask first.

196
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,319
Miss Liu,

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,279
as an international award-winning actress,

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,920
and a top-tier superstar,

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,879
how did you come to like Gao Xing?

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,519
What do you see in him?

201
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,160
Yes, yes, good question!

202
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,040
Someone as distinguished as Miss Liu,

203
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,519
is like a phoenix among mortals.

204
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,519
How could you possibly be interested in

205
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,519
someone like Gao Xing?

206
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,920
I like him

207
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,319
not only because he is outstanding,

208
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
but more importantly, because he is kind-hearted.

209
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,839
He has helped countless people.

210
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,560
A man like this—

211
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,879
what woman wouldn't like him?

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,920
It's not just me.

213
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,480
You can ask Ye Zhixi.

214
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,839
She definitely feels the same as I do.

215
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
That's right.

216
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,839
There are many capable men in this world,

217
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,120
but men who are both capable and righteous

218
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,399
are very rare.

219
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,800
If you meet one, you should hold on tight.

220
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
You can't let him slip away.

221
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,679
Go on.

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,919
Let me ask a question.

223
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,919
Miss Ye, as an international superstar,

224
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,080
with countless fans,

225
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,519
making your relationship public because of a man—

226
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,639
won't this affect your career prospects?

227
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,639
Only if you don't truly like someone would you weigh the pros and cons.

228
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
If you truly like someone,

229
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,919
you should have the courage to take risks for your loved one.

230
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,320
As long as you're happy and willing to be with me,

231
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,039
don't talk about your career.

232
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,159
I'd willingly leave the entertainment industry for you.

233
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,960
Miss Su,

234
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,559
haven't you ever

235
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,080
been brave for someone you like?

236
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
Go on.

237
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:22,919
Oh!

238
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,759
It's my turn.

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,519
Let me ask.

240
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,200
Brother-in-law, if you were single right now,

241
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,320
and hadn't married my sister,

242
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,919
and you could choose someone from us

243
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,000
to be with,

244
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,080
who would you pick?

245
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,600
Gaoxing, don't feel pressured.

246
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
Just say what's in your heart.

247
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,679
Well...

248
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,000
I choose...

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,759
Of course I'd choose my wife.

250
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,559
Otherwise, I wouldn't have married her.

251
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
Oh, come on.

252
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
That's so boring.

253
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,360
Keep going.

254
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Next is a dare.

255
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,279
Whoever the bottle points to has to do what they're told.

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,519
Otherwise, you have to drink as a penalty.

257
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,039
The game begins.

258
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,679
Then, Miss Shen, please show us a bunny hop.

259
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm not doing it.

260
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,759
Bunny hop!

261
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,679
Come on, just do one.

262
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,679
Bunny hop!

263
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,919
Alright, alright, I'll do one.

264
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,840
Bunny hop!

265
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,559
Finished dancing.

266
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
Okay, okay, okay.

267
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,919
Continue.

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,799
My turn.

269
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:45,840
Yay!

270
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,440
Miss Liu.

271
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,120
Usually,

272
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,480
when we see you on TV,

273
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,519
you always look so elegant and dignified.

274
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,399
We really want to know what you're like when you let your guard down.

275
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,279
Can you make a funny face for everyone?

276
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,720
Do one!

277
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,399
Alright, I'll do it.

278
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Satisfied now?

279
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,679
Satisfied.

280
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,360
That's good.

281
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,399
Very satisfied, that's great!

282
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,159
Next.

283
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,799
Let me think.

284
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,519
Oh, got it!

285
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,480
I want Qingyan to give her husband a kiss.

286
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,039
Su Qingyan.

287
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,200
Come on.

288
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,039
She can't do this kind of thing.

289
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,559
Just make her drink as a penalty.

290
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,519
Or let me do it for her.

291
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,639
I want to as well.

292
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,519
No need, no need.

293
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,279
That's not necessary.

294
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll do it myself.
