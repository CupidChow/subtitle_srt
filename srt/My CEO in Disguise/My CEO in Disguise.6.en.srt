1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,679
What?

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,519
Not drinking?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,759
Then just wait to collect his body.

4
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,719
Honey, you don't need to drink this.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,359
Stop making a scene.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,320
Don't worry.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,840
Leave the rest to me.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,560
Leave it to you?

9
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,039
Who do you think you are?

10
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,439
Let me tell you,

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,240
If she doesn't make me happy today,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,679
none of you are leaving through this door.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,520
Drink up!

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,799
You like drinking, right?

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,920
You—

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,719
Let me pour you a drink.

17
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,319
No—

18
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,359
Don't!

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Are you crazy?

20
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,439
I'll kill you!

21
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,760
How dare you hit Liu Shao!

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,920
You're finished!

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,359
Didn't I tell you before,

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,239
the next time I see you,

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,400
I'd beat you so badly your own mother wouldn't recognize you?

26
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,799
I always keep my word.

27
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,760
Wait a second, Gaoxing.

28
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,280
Liu Shao.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,439
I apologize to you on his behalf.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,519
Liu Shao, Liu Shao!

31
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,560
Don't listen to her.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,239
This person must be killed.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
Fine, fine, fine.

34
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,719
Since the day I was born,

35
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,519
I've never suffered such humiliation.

36
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,039
I've changed my mind now.

37
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,240
Every single one of you,

38
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,400
none of you are leaving.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,439
Someone, come!

40
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,400
Liu Xin

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,319
Do you think

42
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,960
you can do whatever you want in Yun City?

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,360
That's right.

44
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,280
If you mess with my Liu family,

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,599
you won't be able to take a single step in Yun City.

46
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,439
Is that so?

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
So, no one can control you now?

48
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,759
I'd like to see

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,800
if your father, Liu Shanhe, were here in front of me,

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,439
would you dare to say that?

51
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,240
Liu Shanhe of Yuncheng failed to raise his son properly.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
His son owes money and refuses to pay it back.

53
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,800
Have him appear before me within ten minutes.

54
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,879
Gao, are you still pretending?

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
You’re not seriously saying

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,479
that just now, with that phone call,

57
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,800
you could actually get Old Master Liu Shanhe to come here?

58
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,439
Do you know who he is?

59
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,960
Do you know his status?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
You think you could summon him?

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,479
At a time like this, you’re still playing tricks?

62
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,960
Liu Shanhe isn’t a fool.

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,919
How could he fall for your kind of scam?

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,240
Gao Xing,

65
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,960
this time you’re really in big trouble.

66
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,960
Don’t worry.

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,639
When Liu Shanhe arrives,

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,560
you’ll see who’s really in trouble.

69
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,560
Young Master Liu, Young Master Liu,

70
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,199
this guy is crazy.

71
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,719
He’s lied so much he believes it himself.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
He even said ten minutes.

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,439
I think he’s just stalling for time.

74
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,319
Don’t fall for his tricks.

75
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,000
It’s fine.

76
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,759
If he wants to stall, I’ll let him.

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,000
I love watching people struggle in vain.

78
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,680
Ten minutes, right?

79
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,719
How about this:

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,520
If within ten minutes

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,759
my dad shows up,

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,240
I’ll kneel and apologize to you.

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,919
But if my dad doesn’t come,

84
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,240
today,

85
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,960
don’t blame me for showing no mercy.

86
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,319
There are nine minutes left.

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Ah.

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,920
Get the car ready, quickly!

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,519
Yes, sir!

90
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,879
You have three minutes left.

91
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,879
You have one minute left.

92
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,319
What should we do?

93
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,319
Five.

94
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,519
Four.

95
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,120
Three.

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,639
Two.

97
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
One.

98
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,839
Time's up.

99
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
Where is Old Master Liu?

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,759
Keep bragging.

101
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,600
Arrest all of them.

102
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,759
Bastard! Stop!

103
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,480
Dad, why are you here?

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Look at the mess you've made, you beast.

105
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000
You blind fool.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,519
Dad.

107
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,439
Why are you hitting me for no reason?

108
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,040
You caused such a huge disaster and still have the nerve to ask me?

109
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,000
Old Master Liu.

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,759
Is there some kind of misunderstanding here?

111
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,639
Young Master Liu has been discussing business with me the whole time.

112
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,680
Get out.

113
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,639
This is none of your business.

114
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,879
Mr. Gao...

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,439
I am Liu Shanhe.

116
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,079
This fool has greatly offended you.

117
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,319
I apologize to you on his behalf.

118
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,319
Dad

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
He's the man Su Qingyan found.

120
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,079
Why are you being so polite to him?

121
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Shut up.

122
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,759
Kneel down, now.

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,560
Apologize to Mr. Gao.

124
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,040
I should apologize to him?

125
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,319
He's the one who doesn't know his place.

126
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,319
He dares to mess with me.

127
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,639
Did you hear me?

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,160
I told you to apologize.

129
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,240
Are you going to apologize or not?

130
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,240
Do you understand?

131
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,759
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

132
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,680
Mr. Gao

133
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,399
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,639
What did you do wrong?

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,000
I...

136
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,759
Liu Xin

137
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,600
There’s always someone better out there.

138
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Those who bully others will be bullied in return.

139
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
Don’t be too arrogant.

140
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,199
Yes.

141
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,279
Yes.

142
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,360
It's all my fault for not raising my son properly.

143
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,439
Mr. Gao, please forgive us.

144
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,519
I’ll make sure to discipline him strictly when we get home.

145
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,600
About what happened today,

146
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,920
please don’t take it to heart.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,959
Sigh.

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,839
That’s not up to me.

149
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
It depends on my wife.

150
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,720
Yes, yes, of course.

151
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,560
I didn’t think it through.

152
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,319
Miss Su

153
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,639
Please be magnanimous.

154
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,519
Please calm down.

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,839
I heard my son owes your company fifteen million.

156
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,519
Here’s twenty million.

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,319
Please accept it.

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
Twenty million

159
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,079
Honey

160
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
It's only right to pay interest on your debts.

161
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,079
Just take it.

162
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll let it go this time for my wife's sake.

163
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
But I don't want there to be a next time.

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,199
Do you understand?

165
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,480
Yes, yes, yes.

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,639
Don't worry, Mr. Gao.

167
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,639
I promise there won't be a next time.

168
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,959
Honey

169
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,079
Let's go.

170
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,279
Dad

171
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,519
Dad

172
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,040
Who exactly is that Mr. Gao?

173
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
Don't ask about things you shouldn't.

174
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,720
Our Liu family also has quite a few

175
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,040
wealthy and powerful friends.

176
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,319
Why are you so afraid of him?

177
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,120
Shut up.

178
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,839
Do you think having money and power means you can do whatever you want?

179
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,439
Let me tell you,

180
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,639
this man is very wealthy,

181
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,959
but people respect him not because of his money,

182
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,040
but because he has made great contributions

183
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,160
to many places and many people.

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Countless important people hold him in high regard.

185
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,279
If you mess with him, you'll anger a lot of people.

186
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,240
No one will be able to help you.

187
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
Is he really that powerful?

188
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,120
Could he really be Gao Feng?

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,279
It's none of your business.

190
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,039
Go home and stay grounded for a month.

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,840
You're not allowed any contact with the outside world.

192
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,799
Qingyan

193
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,840
Pinch me, quick.

194
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm not dreaming, am I?

195
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,679
We actually got the money owed by Jin Zun Group back just like that.

196
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,799
It's not just the debt.

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,320
There's even five million in interest.

198
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
It's not just you,

199
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,159
even I feel like I'm dreaming.

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,919
Oh my god.

201
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
This is Jin Zun Group we're talking about.

202
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,799
The money owed by Liu Xin, the young master.

203
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,679
Who would dare to ask for it?

204
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,080
Our Qingmu is the only one in Yuncheng who could do this.

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,519
It's not just Liu Xin.

206
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,320
Did you see Old Master Liu?

207
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,720
Even he was nodding and bowing nervously to Gao Xing.

208
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,919
It's simply unbelievable.

209
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,000
The Sanhe incident,

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,799
you could chalk it up to luck.

211
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,639
But even Liu Shanhe from Jin Zun Group

212
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,960
has to show him respect.

213
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,240
There's just no way to explain this.

214
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,960
Who exactly is this Gao Xing?

215
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,000
Qingyan

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
Didn't you say he was a food delivery guy?

217
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
He is a delivery guy.

218
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,960
The first time I met him,

219
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,799
he was delivering food.

220
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,840
You saw it too.

221
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,840
And Song Haoyang even looked into his background.

222
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,600
He really is just a delivery guy.

223
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
If he really is just a delivery guy,

224
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,879
how could he possibly keep Zhao Daqiang in check?

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,320
And Liu Shanhe treats him with such respect.

226
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,639
This Gao Xing

227
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,159
must be hiding some huge secret.

228
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,879
No way.

229
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,879
I have to investigate him thoroughly.

230
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,919
Come here.

231
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,919
Stand here.

232
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,759
What's wrong, honey? Is something up?

233
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,159
At home, you can only call me President Su.

234
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,399
Stand up straight, I have something to ask you.

235
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah?

236
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
Even if you're the boss,

237
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,120
I'm still your capable vice president, right?

238
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,480
I just recovered over twenty million for the company.

239
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,879
Why are you interrogating me like a criminal?

240
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,759
That's exactly what I want to ask about.

241
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,159
Tell me the truth.

242
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,679
How exactly did you get those two payments back?

243
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,320
Didn't you see everything?

244
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,639
Those guys from Sanhe Company,

245
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,879
they may look like a bunch of thugs on the surface,

246
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,720
but they're actually pretty decent people.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,639
I just reasoned with them using my fists,

248
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,120
appealed to their emotions,

249
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,240
and persuaded them with logic.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,759
They were moved and convinced by me.

251
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,559
Let's not talk about Sanhe Company for now.

252
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,279
What about JinZun Group?

253
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,559
Liu Shanhe has connections on both sides of the law.

254
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,840
His background is very deep.

255
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,120
Even he treats you with fear and respect.

256
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
What,

257
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,320
was he also moved by you?

258
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,200
Of course.

259
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,320
Think about it,

260
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,639
even a thug like Zhao Daqiang listens to reason.

261
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,919
Someone as important as Liu Shanhe

262
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,519
would definitely understand the bigger picture even more.

263
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,120
When he saw his own son doing bad things,

264
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,519
he immediately put justice before family.

265
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,320
How touching.

266
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Enough.

267
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,360
Happy now?

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,039
Do you think I would believe

269
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,120
what you just said?

270
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,559
I'm going to ask you one last time.

271
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,799
What really happened?

272
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,960
You really want to know?

273
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,559
Of course.

274
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,480
Alright.

275
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,200
Since you really want to know,

276
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,440
That's right.

277
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,879
I'm not just an ordinary delivery guy.

278
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,279
My true identity

279
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,600
is actually Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.
