1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
The company wants me to sign an endorsement deal with Qingmu.

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,640
Qingmu is just a second-rate, small company.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,519
What right do they have to work with me?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,519
President Zhang, is this about the endorsement fee?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,879
No matter how much they offer,

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,879
I won't sign it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What endorsement fee?

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,559
It's your honor to work with Qingmu.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,800
It's also an honor for our Miracle Media.

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,439
We'll sign this contract right away.

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,560
As for the endorsement fee,

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,359
we don't want a single cent.

13
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,280
It must be free.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,600
Free? President Zhang, are you crazy?

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,520
I don't agree.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,119
This will affect my reputation as Best Actress.

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,119
Shut up.

18
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,960
This is the company's decision.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,640
It's not your place to comment.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,840
Let me remind you,

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,960
you're a popular star because the company made you one.

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
The contract is also in the company's hands.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,679
Miracle Media can make you famous,

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,640
but we can also make you disappear overnight.

25
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,479
But why is this happening?

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,640
I need an explanation.

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,039
You're not qualified to know.

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,320
All you need to know

29
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,799
is that if you don't sign this contract,

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,519
not only will the company blacklist you,

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
but you'll have no place in the entertainment industry from now on.

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,239
Sign it now.

33
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,120
Hurry up.

34
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,480
President Su.

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,439
Please keep this contract safe.

36
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,280
You can order Xiao Yaqi around however you like.

37
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,879
If you have any other requests, just let us know.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,680
Miracle Media will absolutely,

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,840
fully cooperate with you unconditionally.

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,959
Thank you, President Zhang.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,280
So, who's the clown now?

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,239
You.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,840
We didn't spend a single cent.

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
We actually managed to sign Xiao Yaqi.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,959
Is this just another coincidence?

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
No.

47
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,200
I don't believe it.

48
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,840
This can't be a coincidence.

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,079
It can't be luck either.

50
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,280
And it definitely isn't because Chu Jiangchao is just a nice guy.

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
Tell me, what's really going on?

52
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,599
Do you want the truth or a lie?

53
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
Of course I want the truth.

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,039
You wouldn't believe the truth anyway.

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,599
Then tell me a lie, let's hear it.

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
The lie is, I have a friend who's good at voice imitation.

57
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,960
I asked him to imitate Chu Jiangchao's voice.

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
He called the boss of Miracle.

59
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,560
And fooled him just like that.

60
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,719
That boss has been in business for decades.

61
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,400
How could he be fooled so easily by you?

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
If you walk by the river often,

63
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,400
how can you not get your shoes wet?

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
It wasn't just the boss of Miracle.

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,599
Even Zhou Pengfei from Tiange Group

66
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,680
was fooled by me the same way.

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
Enough, tell the truth.

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,919
The truth is, Chu Jiangchao is my underling.

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,919
I just make a call,

70
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,479
tell him to do something,

71
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,280
and he does it.

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
That "truth" of yours

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
is even less believable than the lie.

74
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,080
See, I told you.

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
You'd never believe the truth.

76
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,280
You know,

77
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,319
if you'd told me this before,

78
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,199
I definitely would've thought you were joking.

79
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,319
But now...

80
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,639
What's going on now?

81
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,759
Do you believe it now?

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,240
I don't know.

83
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,360
I just feel like I understand you less and less.

84
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,759
I always feel like you have a lot of secrets.

85
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,680
You're just an ordinary delivery guy.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,159
But you can do so many incredible things.

87
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,080
You're like a bottomless pit.

88
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,800
The more people want to figure you out,

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,280
the deeper they fall in.

90
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,240
There's nothing I can do.

91
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,800
Maybe that's a man's charm.

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,960
Honey, don't tell me...

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,240
you've really fallen for me?

94
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,479
Who—who likes you?

95
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
We're just contract spouses.

96
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,639
I don't have any feelings for you.

97
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,240
Then just now, you...

98
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,439
I didn't do anything just now!

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,919
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,080
You're going to sleep again?

101
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,439
Don't overthink it. You're just contract spouses.

102
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Right.

103
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,319
Contract spouses.

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,040
Just a second-tier celebrity,

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,680
actually caught Mr. Gao's attention.

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,879
He even specifically asked her to be the spokesperson.

107
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,279
Could it be...

108
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,519
that Mr. Gao is interested in her?

109
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,439
Have Director Zhang Yimu start preparing an international blockbuster immediately.

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
Xiao Yaqi must play the female lead.

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,439
I want, in the shortest time possible,

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,279
to make her an international superstar.

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,759
Also, spread the word.

114
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,560
Tell those who have bad intentions toward Xiao Yaqi

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,399
to stay far away.

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Anyone who dares touch a hair on her head

117
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,279
will be going against me, Chu Jiangchao.

118
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,439
They'll bear the consequences themselves.

119
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,920
Bastard.

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,720
Why should I be a spokesperson for Su Qingyan's lousy company?

121
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,879
Do I, Xiao Yaqi, not care about my reputation?

122
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,800
Well said.

123
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,800
Who are you?

124
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,959
This is a private club.

125
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,040
Get out.

126
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
Miss Xiao, there's no need to be afraid.

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,480
We're all in the same boat.

128
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,199
Let me introduce myself.

129
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,399
I'm Song Haoyang.

130
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,079
I came here today specifically to discuss a collaboration with Miss Xiao.

131
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,279
So you're the young master of the Song family from Yun City.

132
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,720
What did Young Master Song mean by what he just said?

133
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,879
My meaning is very simple.

134
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,959
Miss Xiao, don't you dislike Qingmu Group?

135
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,160
That's perfect.

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,720
I also have a grudge against Qingmu.

137
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,519
Why don't we join forces to teach Qingmu a lesson?

138
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,879
A lesson? How?

139
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,680
I heard that

140
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,279
Qingmu Group signed an endorsement contract with you, Miss Xiao.

141
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,199
They're about to hold a press conference.

142
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,000
As long as you publicly break the contract at the press conference,

143
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,279
and turn against them,

144
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,519
then with the media my Song family has arranged to spread the news,

145
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,720
I guarantee

146
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,120
Qingmu Group will be utterly ruined.

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,879
You think I don't want to?

148
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,240
My contract is in Miracle's hands.

149
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,879
If I dare to break the contract,

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,000
the company will immediately blacklist me.

151
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,920
Who will take responsibility for the consequences?

152
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,319
Will it be your Song family?

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
Miss Xiao, you're overthinking it.

154
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,079
My Song family can't do it,

155
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,720
but someone else can.

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Who?

157
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,439
Chu Jiangchao, the head of Zhongyu Entertainment.

158
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,560
President Chu.

159
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,399
He's the godfather of the entertainment industry.

160
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
He has abundant resources.

161
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,279
He can make someone famous with ease.

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm just a second-tier minor celebrity.

163
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,759
How could I possibly be connected to such a big shot?

164
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,079
Maybe others can't,

165
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,279
but you definitely can, Miss Xiao.

166
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,639
What do you mean by that?

167
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,240
Miss Xiao, you probably don't know yet.

168
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,439
President Chu personally made a statement.

169
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,279
He warned the entire entertainment industry.

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
No matter who it is,

171
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,079
no one is allowed to lay a finger on you.

172
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,639
Otherwise, they're going against Chu Jiangchao.

173
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,000
Think carefully about what that means.

174
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
This shows that

175
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,079
President Chu has taken a liking to you.

176
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,959
And he considers you his forbidden treasure.

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,759
President Chu likes me?

178
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,199
Is that true?

179
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,480
Could there be a mistake?

180
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
Of course it's true.

181
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,199
And I've even heard some rumors.

182
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,079
President Chu has arranged for a famous director

183
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,680
to create an international blockbuster tailored just for you.

184
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,920
As the female lead.

185
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,680
It has to be you.

186
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,240
There's actually such a good thing?

187
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Hello?

188
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,319
Miss Xiao, this is Zhang Yimu.

189
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,319
I'm about to start preparing for an international blockbuster.

190
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,399
I'd like to invite you to be the leading actress.

191
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,600
I wonder if you have time in your schedule?

192
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,959
Yes, yes, I do.

193
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,879
Of course I do.

194
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,000
It just so happens I'm filming in Yuncheng.

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
Let's set up a time to meet later.

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,199
We can discuss the script.

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
Great, thank you, Director.

198
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,240
Thank you, Director.

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,480
Zhang Yimu is an internationally renowned director.

200
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,160
All the leading actresses he's promoted have become international award winners.

201
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
That's wonderful!

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,120
I finally don't have to worry about the company's attitude anymore.

203
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Of course.

204
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Not just the company,

205
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,120
Don't forget,

206
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,600
you're now Chu Jiangchao's woman.

207
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,320
You can walk anywhere in the entertainment industry with confidence.

208
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
How does that feel?

209
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,799
Feeling more confident now?

210
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,039
Of course.

211
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,600
I promise at tomorrow's press conference,

212
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,559
I'll definitely give Su Qingyan and Gao Xing

213
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,200
a big surprise.

214
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,440
Then let's have a great collaboration.

215
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,320
Looking forward to working together.

216
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,600
How's the scene?

217
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,559
Is everything ready?

218
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,039
Don't worry, Mr. Su.

219
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,679
Almost all the news media in Yuncheng are here.

220
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
Miss Xiao is backstage.

221
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,480
She'll make the announcement herself soon.

222
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,159
She'll officially sign with our Qingmu.

223
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,639
Alright, keep a close eye on things.

224
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,279
Make sure there are absolutely no mistakes.

225
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:21,840
Yes.

226
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
That's great.

227
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,960
As long as Xiao Yaqi announces the signing,

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,879
our product can be launched smoothly.

229
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,840
It'll be a big hit.

230
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,279
I'm still a little worried.

231
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,039
Don't overthink it.

232
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,240
The only trouble now is Xiao Yaqi.

233
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,320
Her contract is still in Miracle's hands.

234
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,600
As long as she doesn't dare offend her agency,

235
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,519
and doesn't want to be blacklisted,

236
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,240
she'll definitely have to do as we say.

237
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,600
Next, let's welcome the popular star Xiao Yaqi.

238
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
Miss Xiao, please come to the stage.

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,639
It's really her!

240
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,399
She looks amazing.

241
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,559
Wow, Xiao Yaqi is so beautiful.

242
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,360
Yeah.

243
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Take pictures, quick!

244
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,799
Hurry up!

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,159
Wow, she's stunning.

246
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,960
Yeah.

247
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,919
Hurry, take a picture!

248
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,399
So beautiful, so lovely.

249
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,080
Here she comes, she's about to make an announcement.

250
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,639
Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Yaqi.

251
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,960
I have an announcement.

252
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,879
Because the new product from Qingmu Group

253
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,679
has serious quality issues,

254
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,080
effective immediately,

255
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,240
I, Xiao Yaqi, am officially terminating my contract with Qingmu Group

256
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,600
and will no longer serve as their spokesperson.
