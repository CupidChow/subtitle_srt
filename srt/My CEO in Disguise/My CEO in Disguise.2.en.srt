1
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,760
Close the door for me.

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,600
Okay.

3
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,960
I told you to go out.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,760
Close the door.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,440
I didn't mean for you to lock yourself inside.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,920
Then could you be a bit clearer next time?

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,799
Come on, isn't that obvious?

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,960
Hurry up and get out.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,759
Qingyan.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,159
Qingyan, are you home?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,520
Wait.

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,039
Qingyan.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
First you tell me to go out,

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,159
then you tell me not to.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,359
So am I supposed to go out or not?

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,240
Shh.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,439
Qingyan.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,479
Qingyan, are you inside?

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,759
Qingyan.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,679
Oh.

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,240
Right.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm taking a shower.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
I'll be out soon.

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,359
Aren't I supposed to go out?

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,039
Shut up, don't say anything.

26
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,319
Qingyan

27
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,079
What was that noise?

28
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:10,599
Are you okay?

29
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,359
I'm fine.

30
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,799
Go, go, go.

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,319
Hide over there.

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,920
Hurry, hurry up!

33
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,519
Wait, this...

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,840
Don't come out.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,560
An'an

36
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,200
Why are you here?

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,959
I missed you.

38
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm sleeping with you tonight.

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
But what are you doing in there?

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,280
There was a strange noise inside.

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,879
No, no.

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,239
I'm taking a shower.

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,560
There's nothing in there.

44
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,799
Then are you done showering?

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
Yes, I'm done, I'm done.

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,359
Great, then I'll go in and use the bathroom.

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,239
No, no, no!

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,239
Um...

49
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,879
There's a lot of water on the floor inside.

50
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,560
Why don't you use the one upstairs?

51
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,359
It's the same wherever I go.

52
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,439
I really can't hold it anymore.

53
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,480
Hey, um...

54
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,319
Let me go in, please.

55
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,159
You really can't use the bathroom in there.

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,719
Ah!

57
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,560
There's a pervert!

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Ah!

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,960
Qingyan!

60
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,120
Qingyan, call the police!

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,039
Th-there's a peeping pervert in here!

62
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,680
Miss,

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,639
you were the one who started undressing in my house.

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,000
You can't turn the tables on me.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
Your house?

66
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
This is Qingyan's house!

67
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,719
She's my wife.

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Her home is my home.

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,240
Right, honey?

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,599
Honey!

71
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,840
Looks like

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,520
It really does look alike

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,479
Especially with the mask on

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
It's almost identical

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,719
But aren't you two a fake couple?

76
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
You two weren't wearing clothes

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
What were you doing in the bathroom?

78
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,000
Helping each other scrub your backs

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
I just forgot

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
There was suddenly someone else at home

82
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,080
I didn't lock the door while showering

83
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,680
Then he suddenly barged in

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,319
He barged in

85
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,000
Then he's a pervert

86
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,400
Hey, not really

87
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,159
He just wanted to use the bathroom

88
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,400
This guy

89
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
Usually seems pretty unreliable

90
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,520
But he's not that bad

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,520
What do you mean, not that bad?

92
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,199
I'm actually a really good person

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,120
Otherwise, last night

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
When we slept together

95
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,319
It would've ended differently

96
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,120
What?

97
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,960
You two even slept together last night?

98
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,000
If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute

99
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,800
He does look quite similar.

100
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,120
But Gaofeng

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,919
is a top elite, a business prodigy.

102
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,840
You found a food delivery guy

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,919
to impersonate him.

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Can this really work?

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,360
I know it's difficult too.

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,479
But this is the only way for now.

107
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,919
If you get exposed,

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
just move to another city.

109
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,520
Take the money I gave you.

110
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,639
You shouldn't have to worry for the rest of your life.

111
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,319
Don't worry.

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm a great actor.

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,800
Even if Gaofeng himself showed up,

114
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,520
he'd have to admit I'm awesome.

115
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,800
So dramatic.

116
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,400
Hello?

117
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,080
Okay, got it.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,319
My family wants to meet you.

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Let them.

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,680
With such a great husband like me,

121
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,719
of course you should show me off to your family.

122
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,719
You should really brag about it.

123
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,120
You make it sound so easy.

124
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,600
My uncle is domineering and overbearing.

125
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,360
My third uncle and aunt are snobbish and mean.

126
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,759
They're all very experienced.

127
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,319
Do you really think you can fool them?

128
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,720
When the time comes,

129
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,040
just follow my lead.

130
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,040
Did you hear me?

131
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,319
Honey,

132
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,279
don't worry.

133
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,319
No matter what happens, I'll handle it for you.

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,800
You? Handle it?

135
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,120
With what, exactly?

136
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,639
Don't sleep tonight.

137
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,279
Memorize all of Gaofeng's information.

138
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,480
Let's do it this way.

139
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
Will it work tomorrow?

140
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,839
Whatever.

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Let's just try whatever we can.

142
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,720
Hurry up.

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Are you done yet?

144
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,519
Done, done, almost there.

145
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
Qingyan.

146
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,519
They say clothes make the man.

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,199
But this guy is just a deliveryman.

148
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,279
You can't change his temperament.

149
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,120
Even if you dress him in fancy clothes,

150
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
he still can't have Gaofeng's presence.

151
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,079
If you try to draw a tiger and fail, it just looks like a dog.

152
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,319
It's even easier to give yourself away.

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,519
Let's just try and see.

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,160
How do I look?

155
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,680
I just changed my clothes.

156
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,879
How did you get so handsome?

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,480
Alright.

158
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,360
I'll wear this.

159
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,160
Young Master Song,

160
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,959
We found out that guy's information.

161
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,000
He's not Gao Feng at all.

162
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,439
His name is Gao Xing.

163
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,680
He only has a junior high school education.

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
He's registered as a rural resident.

165
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,759
After coming to our Yun City,

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,079
he hasn't had any proper jobs.

167
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,399
He's just been delivering food.

168
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,879
Well, well.

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
So he's just a delivery guy.

170
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,480
And he dares to pretend to be someone important.

171
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,160
Su Qingyan,

172
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,600
do you really think I'm that easy to fool?

173
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,480
Let's go.

174
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,519
Young Master Song, where are we going?

175
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,160
Of course, to the Su family.

176
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,720
Su Qingyan found herself such a good husband.

177
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,319
I definitely have to go

178
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,439
and congratulate her.

179
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,920
Did you remember what I just told you?

180
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,199
When you see my family later,

181
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,040
don't say anything.

182
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,279
I'll handle it.

183
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,319
Got it.

184
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,120
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

185
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,240
Uncle.

186
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,160
Third Uncle, Third Aunt.

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,120
Qingyan,

188
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,040
is this the pretty boy you found behind Song Shao's back?

189
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
You'd run away from your wedding for someone like this?

190
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,079
I really don't know what you're thinking.

191
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,279
Is your head full of mush?

192
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,160
There's nothing between me and Song Haoyang.

193
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,519
I won't marry him.

194
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,439
Su Qingyan,

195
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
your marriage to Song Shao

196
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,000
was arranged by both families long ago.

197
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,079
Stop messing around outside.

198
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,920
Whoever arranged it can marry him.

199
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,399
I don't want to marry him.

200
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,839
I'll decide my own marriage.

201
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,000
The Su family has raised you for so many years.

202
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,399
When you enjoyed the benefits of being a Su,

203
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,399
you never complained.

204
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,959
Now that you need to give something back to the family,

205
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,199
you suddenly want to make your own decisions.

206
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,399
Uncle,

207
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,399
my parents passed away early,

208
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
but they left me an inheritance.

209
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,639
I haven't spent a single cent of yours.

210
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,959
These past few years,

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
I've also earned quite a bit for the Su family, haven't I?

212
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
The little money you made

213
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,920
can't compare to the Song family's wealth.

214
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,399
Marrying into the Song family

215
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,399
is the only way to bring real benefits to our Su family.

216
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,600
Uncle,

217
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,160
why don't you just put a price tag on me

218
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,959
and sell me off?

219
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,639
I...

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Enough, Qingyan.

221
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,679
Your marriage is the Su family's top priority.

222
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,759
There's no room for discussion.

223
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,679
You must marry Song Haoyang.

224
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,840
It's too late.

225
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,720
I've already registered my marriage with him.

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,200
What?

227
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,080
You—

228
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,320
You’re completely out of line!

229
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,759
Dad.

230
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,480
It’s gone up! It’s gone up!

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,559
What’s gone up?

232
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,200
The stock that Young Master Song told us about.

233
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,039
It’s skyrocketed!

234
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,559
The twenty million we invested with Third Uncle—

235
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,879
It’s already increased by half!

236
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,080
We really made that much money?

237
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,200
Really, Mom!

238
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:04,960
Look, quick!

239
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,000
It’s still going up!

240
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,279
Good!

241
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,480
He’s truly the God of Wealth reincarnated.

242
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,360
It’s great that it’s gone up!

243
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,600
Qingyan, look at this.

244
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,120
Young Master Song casually shares a bit of information,

245
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
and we can make so much money from it.

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
If you marry him,

247
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,759
that’s your good fortune.

248
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,919
It’s your destiny.

249
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,200
By the way,

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
your Qingmu company—

251
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,840
doesn’t it still need sixty million

252
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,320
to develop new products?

253
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,120
Young Master Song said

254
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,840
as soon as you two get married,

255
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,559
he’ll immediately invest in the Su family.

256
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
And this guy—

257
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,679
what benefits can he bring you?

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,919
How can he possibly compare to Young Master Song?

259
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,919
Apple Technology, right?

260
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,000
Apple Technology.

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This stock isn't good.

262
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,559
It's going to drop.

263
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
You think you know about stocks?

264
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,840
What a joke.

265
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,919
Hmph.

266
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,759
With my abilities, I don't need to understand.

267
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,759
Any stock I want to rise will rise.

268
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,440
Any stock I want to fall will fall.

269
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,480
What are you talking about, Su Qingyan?

270
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
I really don't get you.

271
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
You found yourself a pretty boy.

272
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,759
It's bad enough he has no ability.

273
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,080
But he's also out of his mind.

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
Saying he can make any stock rise.

275
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,240
Or make any stock fall.

276
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,720
Even Warren Buffett wouldn't dare say something like that.

277
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
Didn't I tell you not to talk nonsense?

278
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,600
You're bragging way too much.

279
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,720
Honey.

280
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,879
Aren't I the president of Junsheng Group?

281
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
This should be easy for me, right?

282
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,159
You're a fake.

283
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,000
Others might not know,

284
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
but don't you know yourself?

285
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,519
What are you mumbling about?

286
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,039
If you really have the ability,

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,879
make Apple Technology drop and show us.

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,159
Yeah.

289
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,679
Alright.

290
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,200
If it drops,

291
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,320
don't blame me.

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,960
Drop.

293
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,360
Drop hard.

294
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,559
If it really drops, I'll call you grandpa.

295
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,639
Him? As if.

296
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,840
What a disgrace.

297
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,440
Yeah, it's really embarrassing.

298
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,720
Hello, boss. What's up?

299
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,519
Transfer two billion in funds for me.

300
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,679
Within one minute.

301
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,200
Bring down the stock price of Apple Technology.

302
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,519
Make it plunge.

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,320
Understood.

304
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,799
What nonsense are you talking about?

305
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,240
What are you trying to do?

306
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,360
A star company like Apple Technology—

307
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,120
You want to make it plunge in one minute?

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
You might as well just jump off a building.

309
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,840
Su Qingyan.

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,919
You married an idiot like him.

311
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,799
You're disgracing our Su family.

312
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,759
You're making us lose face.

313
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,200
You're bragging to this extent.

314
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,679
How are you going to end this?

315
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
Don't worry.

316
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,279
Let the bullets fly for a while.

317
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,440
Five.

318
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,200
Four.

319
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,320
That's about enough.

320
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
Something's wrong, honey!

321
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,559
Apple Technology really dropped!

322
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,720
What?
