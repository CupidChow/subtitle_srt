1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Your marriage with Miss Su is fake, isn't it?

2
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,399
How did you figure that out?

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,600
A prominent business tycoon,

4
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,920
the famous president of Junsheng Group,

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,880
worth billions,

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,799
pursued by women from prestigious families,

7
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,799
yet you came to Yuncheng to deliver food.

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,200
And even had a flash marriage with a small company's female CEO.

9
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,880
Anyone with sense

10
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,600
can tell something's off.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,280
But I actually envy Miss Su.

12
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,600
What do you envy about her?

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,679
Come on, cheers.

14
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,359
I envy that even though she's unaware,

15
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,159
some people end up making the fake real.

16
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,000
Unexpectedly, someone caught real feelings, right?

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,680
You're overthinking it.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,840
We're just contract spouses.

19
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,159
It's just an act.

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,760
An act?

21
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,760
Well, I'm a professional at that.

22
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,359
That's why I know some things can be faked,

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,560
but some things can't.

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,879
Of course.

25
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,000
If you really don't have feelings for Miss Su,

26
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,359
here's my business card.

27
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,400
Once your contract ends,

28
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,599
feel free to contact me anytime.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,159
I'll be waiting for you, Ye Zhixi.

30
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, right, right.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
So that's how it is.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,879
Brother-in-law, what are you doing?

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Come have a drink.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Hey.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,479
Coming.

36
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,439
It's getting late.

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Go to bed early.

38
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,240
Hey.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,280
What?

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,479
About what happened tonight—

41
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,719
Don't take it seriously.

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,439
It's just that I—

43
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,000
tend to follow the rules.

44
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,599
That's why I kissed you.

45
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,039
Makes sense, right?

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,639
It does.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Of course it does.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,479
Good, then.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,319
It's nothing.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,479
Get some rest.

51
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,960
I wanted Qingyan to kiss her brother-in-law.

52
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,879
Some things can be faked.

53
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,280
But some things

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
can't be faked.

55
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,400
Young Master Song,

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
it's not that our Su family doesn't want to help.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,159
That Gao Xing has too many tricks up his sleeve.

58
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,159
Like that "Little Medical Fairy" thing,

59
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
President Zhou and even two Best Actresses

60
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,719
all show him respect.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,919
If he really is Gao Feng,

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
or has some other powerful background,

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
our Su family can't afford to offend him.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,879
Nonsense!

65
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,759
If he really is Gao Feng—

66
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,959
He really has a powerful background.

67
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,240
Would someone like that really deliver food just out of boredom?

68
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,120
When it comes down to it,

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
he's just lucky, that's all.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
Even if it's just luck,

71
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,319
Qingmu still built everything up with real effort.

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,680
The secret recipe is hitting the market,

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,519
and with two Best Actress endorsers, it's about to take off.

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
If Qingmu really makes a fortune,

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,800
wouldn't our Su family benefit from it too?

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,759
Benefit from it?

77
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,360
Everyone,

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
have you all lost your minds?

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,600
You’ve already seriously offended Su Qingyan.

80
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,639
No matter how much money Qingmu makes,

81
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,439
how

82
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,600
could any of it possibly go to you?

83
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,519
Once Qingmu becomes big,

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,519
Su Qingyan’s status in your Su Group

85
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,879
will rise with the tide.

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,399
By then, not just you two,

87
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,079
even you,

88
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,560
your position as chairman

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,079
might not be safe anymore.

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
What should we do then?

91
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,199
Big brother,

92
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,600
Young Master Song,

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,399
tell us, how do you want our Su family to help you?

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,879
It’s not just helping me,

95
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,160
it’s helping you too.

96
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,160
There’s only one way now.

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,399
Ever since I kissed him yesterday,

98
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,120
I can’t stop thinking about what happened.

99
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,639
Now, whenever I get home,

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,199
it’s so awkward when we’re face to face.

101
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,560
I don’t even know how to face him.

102
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,160
Please help me think of something.

103
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:52,920
Let me ask you,

104
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,480
do you like Gaoxing?

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,839
Like

106
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,279
If you like him, go after him.

107
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,519
You have to be bold and make a move.

108
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,800
When a woman pursues a man, it's as easy as breaking through a thin layer of paper.

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,519
Ah

110
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,639
But I don't know how.

111
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,240
Just do what you did yesterday.

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,399
What you did yesterday was pretty good.

113
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,000
But I can't just kiss him as soon as I see him, right?

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm not telling you to kiss him aggressively.

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,839
What I mean is,

116
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,879
you can express your feelings to him.

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,399
Tell him you like him.

118
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,639
Then what should I do?

119
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,480
Pretend I'm Gaoxing.

120
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,279
Try it once.

121
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,399
You're Gaoxing.

122
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,680
Gaoxing

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,000
I

124
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,600
I

125
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
I li—

126
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,600
No, no, no.

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,600
You're the dignified female CEO of Qingmu.

128
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,879
Why are you so shy?

129
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,000
You have no presence at all.

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,680
Let me show you how.

131
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,560
Watch carefully.

132
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,199
Oh

133
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,399
Gaoxing, right?

134
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,879
I want to talk to you about a relationship.

135
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,560
Do you have any objections?

136
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,079
Oh no, no, no.

137
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,279
This doesn't suit me.

138
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,079
Forget it, just forget it.

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,399
Do whatever you want.

140
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,439
Anyway, all those little doctors and big movie stars

141
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,879
are all eyeing Gaoxing like wolves.

142
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,879
If one of them gets to him first,

143
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,839
you'll regret it.

144
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,160
Shen An'an, you—

145
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,959
Happy

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
I like

147
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,120
Happy

148
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,639
I like you

149
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,000
No, no, no

150
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,639
Happy

151
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,879
Sis has a relationship to discuss with you

152
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,439
Do you have any objections?

153
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
What are you doing?

154
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,279
I'm not doing anything

155
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
Why are you here?

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,839
I was passing by and came in to see you

157
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,480
Then I'll go

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,360
Hey, wait

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Close the door

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,160
I have something to tell you

161
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay

162
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,000
What's wrong?

163
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,759
Actually, it's nothing, it's just that I...

164
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,919
You

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,799
I

166
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,080
I

167
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
Happy, I...

168
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,480
Qingyan, something's wrong

169
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,639
Your uncle wants to bring Qingmu Company back into the family

170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
He also wants to marry you off to Song Haoyang

171
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,080
What?
