1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,079
Alright, alright.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,719
The drug is working.

3
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,320
Looks like that guy is overwhelmed with desire.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,920
The people you arranged are working hard too.

5
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,280
Of course.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,920
I paid a lot, so they have to be professional.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,479
I hired two.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,880
There's one more.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,399
Qingyan.

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,479
Qingyan, are you okay?

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:38,920
You guys...

12
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,079
Gao Xing, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,640
Shh, there's surveillance.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,520
Surveillance?

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,320
Look.

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,759
The second one is here too.

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,799
That guy Gao is really lucky with women.

18
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,719
Too bad this lousy surveillance has no sound.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,640
Let him enjoy himself for now.

20
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,399
Tomorrow, I'll ruin his reputation.

21
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,759
President Su, you're brilliant.

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
No wonder he's the man I have my eye on.

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,120
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Cheers.

25
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,439
So it was Su Zhengdong who set you up.

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,200
You played along and came on purpose.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,239
Of course.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,359
Otherwise, do you think I'd fall for his honey trap?

29
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,920
Yeah, even Qingyan got jealous because of you.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Who got jealous?

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,239
I didn't.

33
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,040
I was just worried he might go astray.

34
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,120
That's why I came to check on him.

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,799
I wasn't jealous.

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,719
I can handle this little thing by myself.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,799
Telling you guys

38
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,640
was just to avoid any mistakes.

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,040
So what do we do now?

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
We can't keep pretending like this forever, can we?

41
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,879
Don't worry.

42
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,280
The people next door should be falling for it about now.

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,280
Another drink.

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,439
Another drink.

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,919
Mr. Su.

46
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,319
My whole body

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,879
feels so hot.

48
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,759
Honestly, I'm hot too.

49
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,479
Mr. Su, I want...

50
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,319
Okay.

52
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,919
There really is a camera here.

53
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,800
Su Zhengdong's methods are so despicable.

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,360
What are you planning to do next?

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,039
Nothing.

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,840
Just wait and watch the show tomorrow.

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,719
What happened last night?

58
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,680
Why did that drink hit so hard?

59
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,560
Who knows?

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
It was all a blur.

61
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,080
Just don't let it affect the important stuff.

62
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,240
The important stuff.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
The important stuff.

64
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,520
Where is he? Why did he leave?

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,319
If he left, he left.

66
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,759
As long as we have the video, it's fine.

67
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,120
It's here, it's here.

68
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,439
The video, the video.

69
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,599
The video.

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,319
With this in hand,

71
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,520
let's see how happy he is.

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,479
How can he compete with me now?

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Hurry up and get ready to go to the company.

74
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,879
Business comes first.

75
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,319
Everyone is here.

76
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,199
I have an announcement to make.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,439
Deputy General Manager Su Zhengdong,

78
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,000
has acted unethically and embezzled company assets.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,120
He has betrayed the company's interests.

80
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,800
He is dismissed effective today.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
From now on,

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,199
the position of Deputy General Manager will be taken over by Gao Xing.

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,319
Wait a minute.

84
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,240
I don't agree.

85
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,680
I've been at Qingmu for so many years.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,319
I've always been loyal to the company.

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,399
I've worked diligently.

88
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,759
Even if I haven't made great achievements, I've at least worked hard.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why should I be fired?

90
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,160
Su Zhengdong.

91
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,560
Qingyan is only giving you face because you're her fourth uncle.

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
That's the only reason she's being polite.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,959
You've failed your performance reviews every year.

94
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,800
You even colluded with the Song family for your own benefit.

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
You sold the company's secret formula.

96
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,639
What's wrong with firing you?

97
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,319
That's nonsense!

98
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,680
What secret formula?

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,839
There's no evidence for any of that.

100
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,959
But this guy Gao,

101
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
relies on being the CEO's husband

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
to do whatever he wants in the company.

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
He's morally corrupt.

104
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,000
Someone like him isn't qualified to be the company's vice president.

105
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,879
President Su, I want to report something.

106
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,879
Gao Xing has harassed and flirted with me at work.

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,319
He even tried to force me to go to a hotel with him.

108
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,560
He said he's the CEO's husband.

109
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,199
He claims his word is law in the company.

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
If I don't agree,

111
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,120
he'll kick me out of the company.

112
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,759
Oh no!

113
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,279
So that's the kind of person he is.

114
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,879
How could something like this happen?

115
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,800
You really can't tell just by looking.

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,959
Did everyone hear that?

117
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,120
It's not just Secretary Xu.

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,120
As the president's husband,

119
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,759
he actually went out looking for other women.

120
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,040
Booking hotel rooms.

121
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,519
Partying every night.

122
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
This is simply disgraceful.

123
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,879
A beast in human clothing.

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,839
Amazing, just amazing.

125
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,959
You're really good at turning the tables.

126
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,639
But you say I party every night,

127
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,639
and that I'm immoral.

128
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,199
Do you have any proof?

129
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,240
Happy, aren't you?

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,079
Still hoping for luck when you're at the end of the road.

131
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,720
Of course I have proof.

132
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,600
It's right here on my computer's hard drive.

133
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,360
As soon as I hit enter to send it,

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,240
everyone in the company will get it.

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,399
Happy?

136
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm giving you one last chance.

137
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800
If you want to save any face at all,

138
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,600
resign on your own.

139
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,519
And get out of here quietly.

140
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,680
Otherwise,

141
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,879
don't blame me for being ruthless.

142
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,720
Is that so?

143
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,759
Then go ahead and send it.

144
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,480
Let everyone see for themselves.

145
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't hold back on my account.

146
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:18,720
You—

147
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,639
Qingyan

148
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,040
Don’t blame your fourth uncle for not warning you.

149
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,959
If this video gets released,

150
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,000
you’ll lose all your dignity as a wife.

151
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,480
You can still cut your losses now.

152
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,759
Fire him immediately.

153
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,920
Never hire him again.

154
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,079
Hey, no rush.

155
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,920
Fourth uncle, I think

156
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Gao Xing is right.

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,279
I want to see the video too.

158
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,199
How about

159
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,240
just release it?

160
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,639
Wait, you—

161
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,120
Do you all realize

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,680
if I release this video,

163
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
it’ll be a huge bombshell.

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,560
The consequences—

165
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,000
can you handle them?

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Stop dawdling.

167
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,600
We told you to post it, so do it.

168
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,319
You—

169
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,199
Are you going to post it or not?

170
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,600
I—

171
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,839
If you have it, hurry up and post it.

172
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,000
Everyone’s waiting to see.

173
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,879
Fine, fine, fine.

174
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,199
Alright, alright, alright.

175
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,120
Okay.

176
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
You want to embarrass yourselves, right?

177
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,600
Then I’ll help you with that.

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,000
Secretary Xu

179
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Send it for me.

180
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,079
Happy

181
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
Did you see that?

182
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
This is what happens when you go against me, Su Zhengdong.

183
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,680
Regret it now, don't you?

184
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,319
It's too late.

185
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,519
What you wanted me to see

186
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,920
Isn't this it?

187
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,319
What?

188
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,079
How...

189
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,000
How could this be?

190
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,079
Stop watching.

191
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,160
All of you, stop watching.

192
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,079
Stop watching.

193
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
How... how...

194
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
I clearly recorded your video.

195
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,360
How is it mine?

196
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360
Alright, Gao.

197
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,560
You set me up.

198
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,360
That's right.

199
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,720
I did set you up.

200
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,800
So who is it now

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,439
who's humiliating themselves?

202
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,519
I'm going to fight you!

203
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,040
Disgraceful, shameless!

204
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,160
Guards!

205
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Drag this shameless couple out!

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,639
Done.

207
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,799
All done.

208
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,519
That was satisfying, really satisfying.

209
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,639
Did you see their faces just now?

210
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,320
It was so cathartic.

211
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,320
Exactly.

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,279
They totally deserved it, brought it on themselves.

213
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,879
Yeah.

214
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,039
But I'm really curious.

215
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,519
How exactly did you manage

216
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,960
to swap the video without my fourth uncle noticing?

217
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,279
Yeah, they were the ones who tried to drug you.

218
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,080
How did it end up backfiring on them?

219
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,919
Come on, tell us how you did it.

220
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,360
That's a secret.

221
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,879
I can't reveal it.

222
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm here.

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Got it.

224
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Bluebird is in position.

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
Sir.

226
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,000
The wine you ordered has arrived.

227
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,360
Just leave it here.

228
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,759
I've already served the guest.

229
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,519
Ladies, you can clock out now.

230
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,600
Piece of cake.

231
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,200
Young master.

232
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,120
I've got news about Qingmu.

233
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Their product is already finished.

234
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,759
It's about to hit the market.

235
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,679
Bastard.

236
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,600
All my cosmetics companies are barely surviving.

237
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,240
But they're thriving.

238
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,240
No way.

239
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,840
If I'm struggling,

240
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,120
they shouldn't have it easy either.

241
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,639
Pass down my orders.

242
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,799
Tell all media partners working with the Song family to completely block them.

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
I want to make sure not a single pill of his rejuvenation product sells.

244
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:38,879
Yes, sir.
