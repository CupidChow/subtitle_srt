1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
Alright, I understand.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,399
The first batch of Huichundan has been completed.

3
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,239
It has passed inspection.

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,440
It can be launched at any time.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,839
Now our Qingmu is really going to make a fortune.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,559
This time, it's truly thanks to the efforts of all our staff.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,399
I will definitely reward everyone according to their contributions.

8
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,519
Everyone will be well rewarded.

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,359
Absolutely.

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,039
We've really been exhausted lately.

11
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,280
Once the product is launched,

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,039
we should really take some time to relax.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,920
No problem.

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,159
This is bad.

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,840
The Song family has gathered several media outlets to smear our product.

16
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:50,759
What?

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,880
Look, over a dozen media outlets in Yun City

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
plus a huge number of online trolls

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,039
are all slandering our Qingmu brand.

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,479
They're spreading rumors about our Huichundan.

21
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,119
That Song Haoyang is truly despicable.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
If public opinion is controlled by the Song family,

23
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,679
then no matter how good our Huichundan is,

24
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,560
we still won't be able to sell it.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,760
So what do we do now?

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,159
Should we hold a press conference to clarify things?

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,040
It won't work.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,319
The Song family is powerful and influential in Yun City.

29
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,680
We can't win a public opinion battle against them.

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,359
The only way now

31
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,079
is to quickly find a spokesperson

32
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,959
to speak up for Qingmu.

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,799
To restore our reputation.

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
But this happened so suddenly.

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,319
Where can we find a popular celebrity on such short notice?

36
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,120
In Yun City,

37
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,959
the only suitable candidate right now

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,799
is my college classmate, Xiao Yaqi.

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,280
We studied together for four years.

40
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,000
After graduation, she entered the entertainment industry.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,400
She's gained some fame in the past two years.

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,799
Now she's a second-tier actress.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,400
If we can get her,

44
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,480
maybe we can turn things around.

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,359
But Xiao Yaqi is very arrogant.

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,439
She's conceited and self-important.

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
You didn't get along with her before.

48
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,920
If you really ask her for help,

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,760
she definitely won't be nice to you.

50
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:47,879
It doesn't matter.

51
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,599
For the company's reputation,

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
I have to give it a try.

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,200
You want me to be your spokesperson.

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,040
With just your company, Qingmu?

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,519
Are you even worthy?

56
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,439
You—

57
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
Yaqi.

58
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,280
I know you had issues with me back in school.

59
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,000
But right now, Qingmu is really in trouble.

60
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,199
Look,

61
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,439
could you help me out for the sake of our old classmate relationship?

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
Do me this favor.

63
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,479
We can discuss the endorsement fee and everything.

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,039
Qingmu's problems have nothing to do with me.

65
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,199
Besides,

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm really popular right now.

67
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,240
My endorsement fees start at tens of millions.

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
Can Qingmu even afford that?

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
Tens of millions?

70
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,599
Only top celebrities charge that much.

71
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,840
Why don't you just go rob someone?

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,719
You think it's too expensive?

73
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,120
If it's too expensive, you don't have to ask me for help.

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm not forcing you.

75
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,120
Tens of millions is a bit much, honestly.

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,719
How about we negotiate a bit more?

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,960
Of course, since we were classmates after all.

78
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,759
I'm not that heartless, you know.

79
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,000
As for this favor,

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
it's not like I can't help.

81
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,759
But it depends on your sincerity.

82
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,759
As long as you can help me,

83
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,479
Just tell me, I'll do my best.

84
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm thirsty. Get me a glass of water.

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
Okay.

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,319
Are you trying to burn me?

87
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,960
Get me something cooler.

88
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,240
Alright.

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,439
It's not hot anymore.

90
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,240
Try it again.

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,360
It's too cold.

92
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,400
I won't drink it if it's cold.

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,439
Xiao Yaqi, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

94
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,159
After all, you were classmates before.

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,479
Aren't you going too far?

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
Classmates.

97
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,479
Back in school, she was always stealing my spotlight.

98
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,520
Now the tables have turned.

99
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,520
If you don't want to, you can leave anytime.

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
It's fine, I'll pour it for you.

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,599
The temperature is just right this time, try it.

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,160
You...

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,759
Oh!

104
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,759
I'm really sorry.

105
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,519
I accidentally got my shoe wet.

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,839
Why don't you wipe it for me?

107
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,480
Xiao Yaqi, don't go too far.

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,519
I am going too far.

109
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
What can you do about it?

110
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,959
Not convinced?

111
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,399
If you don't like it, you don't have to ask me for help.

112
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,560
A third-rate little celebrity, and you still get to act all high and mighty.

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
What level are you, anyway?

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,959
You think you're worthy of having my wife serve you tea?

115
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,759
Gao Xing

116
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,319
Why are you here?

117
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,040
I was just worried you might be wronged.

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,199
You're my wife.

119
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,120
Just a third-rate minor celebrity like this

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,680
There's no need for you to lower yourself like this.

121
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,000
Who do you want as your spokesperson?

122
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,959
With just one call from me,

123
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,480
you can pick any superstar you want.

124
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,879
As if you could really pick anyone.

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,800
In the whole entertainment industry, the only one who can do that

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,759
is the so-called godfather of entertainment,

127
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,120
Chu Jiangchao, the CEO of Zhongyu.

128
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,480
Who do you think you are?

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,399
Don't make things worse.

130
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,319
Su Qingyan

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,439
Is this the man you found?

132
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,120
He isn't an idiot, is he?

133
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,399
Gao Xing, stop making a scene.

134
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,800
It's fine, leave it to me.

135
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,639
Sit.

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,399
You're Xiao Yaqi, right?

137
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,519
Let me give you a piece of advice.

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,000
It's an honor for you to be the spokesperson for Qingmu.

139
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,839
You'd better not be ungrateful.

140
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,639
Are you trying to make me laugh to death?

141
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm Xiao Yaqi, a top celebrity.

142
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
My popularity is off the charts.

143
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,360
Companies wanting me as their spokesperson

144
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
could line up from Yuncheng all the way to Beijing.

145
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,800
Any one of them

146
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,839
is ten or a hundred times better than your Qingmu.

147
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,519
And you actually say

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,560
that it's my honor to represent Qingmu?

149
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,959
You think that's funny, huh?

150
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,160
Use your brain and think it over.

151
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,600
You guys

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
are you even worthy?

153
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,240
Gao Xing, let's go.

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,319
We're not signing this contract.

155
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,720
Honey,

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,120
don't worry, I'm here.

157
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,000
Today, she'll sign this contract whether she wants to or not.

158
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,319
She has to sign it, no matter what.

159
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,680
Chu Jiangchao

160
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,959
I want to sign Xiao Yaqi as our spokesperson.

161
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,120
Now, at your fastest speed,

162
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
deliver the contract to her.

163
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,319
Have her sign it for me.

164
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,240
Yes.

165
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,600
Mr. Gao, please rest assured.

166
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,839
I'll take care of it right away.

167
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,560
President Chu, is this Mr. Gao very influential?

168
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,319
Even someone of your status treats him with such respect.

169
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,560
There are plenty of influential people out there.

170
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
My respect for Mr. Gao

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
is not just because of his status,

172
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,519
or his power,

173
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,079
but because he has extraordinary abilities

174
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,680
and is still willing to humble himself

175
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,560
to help those in need.

176
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,639
He has done countless good deeds over the years.

177
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,600
Even I have benefited greatly from his kindness.

178
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,120
By the way,

179
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,120
which superstar is this Xiao Yaqi?

180
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,759
How come I've never heard of her?

181
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,319
President Chu, Xiao Yaqi isn't a superstar.

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
She's gained a bit of fame in the past two years.

183
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,800
At best, she's a second-tier celebrity.

184
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,920
Second-tier?

185
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,639
With Mr. Gao personally making the request,

186
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,000
even top superstars

187
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,920
would be scrambling to help.

188
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,720
But for just a second-tier celebrity,

189
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
he actually has to step in himself.

190
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,399
Forget it.

191
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Contact Xiao Yaqi's agency.

192
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,759
Have their boss answer the phone.

193
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
Yes, I'll take care of it right away.

194
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,360
You were even pretending to call Mr. Chu.

195
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
You acted so convincingly.

196
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,800
Do you want me to help you join a film crew

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,439
and get a bit part as an extra?

198
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,560
Su Qingyan.

199
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,120
Weren't you always so proud back in school?

200
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,240
How come you ended up with a clown now?

201
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,399
Don't worry.

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
You'll soon find out who the real clown is.

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,720
Gaoxing, stop messing around.

204
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,680
Xiao Yaqi is really popular right now.

205
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,480
She has a high status in the entertainment industry.

206
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,199
Other than her agency,

207
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,759
the boss of Miracle Media

208
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,199
no one can force her to sign a contract.

209
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,920
Gaoxing, that's enough.

210
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
Stop acting.

211
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,199
You really can't help with this.

212
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,399
Hey, not necessarily.

213
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,040
Didn't your husband just call Chu Jiangchao,

214
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,360
Mr. Chu?

215
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,879
Maybe,

216
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,799
Mr. Chu will actually put pressure on my agency.

217
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,320
My boss might already be on the way with the contract.

218
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,919
He could be on his way right now.

219
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,279
Do you hear footsteps?

220
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,840
Maybe my boss is already here.

221
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,720
Xiao Yaqi.

222
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,799
Mr. Zhang.

223
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,919
Why are you here?

224
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,799
Who is this?

225
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,440
Zhang Qishan, the boss of Miracle Media.

226
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,080
Your endorsement contract with Qingmu.

227
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,679
What?

228
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
The company wants me to sign an endorsement deal with Qingmu.
