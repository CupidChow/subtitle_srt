1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,279
My true identity

2
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,320
is actually Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,440
You thought you were asking me to pretend to be him,

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,640
but you were actually looking for me all along.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,800
Not only do I possess immense wealth,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,320
but I am also a retired special forces king.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,960
Those people from Sanhe Company

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,239
were defeated by me alone.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,920
They had no choice but to pay back the money.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,759
As for Jin Zun Group's so-called social connections,

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,439
they are nothing in front of me.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,679
It really is you.

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,759
As if it’s really you.

14
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,759
If I hadn’t seen you delivering food with my own eyes,

15
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,719
I would’ve actually been fooled by your lies.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,439
Why don’t you believe me?

17
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,920
If you were nicer to me,

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,799
maybe I’d even give you an autograph.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,000
Shut up.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Fine, I won’t say anything.

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,000
Don’t joke about my idol, Gao Feng.

22
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,039
Why won’t you believe me?

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,200
I really am Gao Feng.

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,159
If you really are Gao Feng,

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,640
then I’m a fairy.

26
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,599
With how beautiful my wife is,

27
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,040
calling her a fairy isn’t an exaggeration.

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,799
Stop being so glib.

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,799
Are you going to say it or not?

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,000
You don’t believe the truth,

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,079
and you don’t believe lies either.

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,280
So what do you want me to say?

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,599
Forget it, I won’t say anything.

34
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,599
I’m going to sleep.

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,239
Shouldn’t a boss reward and punish fairly?

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,879
I just recovered over twenty million for the company.

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,359
Shouldn’t you at least give me a token reward?

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
What more reward do you want?

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,760
The bed in the guest room is too hard.

40
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,000
I can’t sleep well.

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
How about tonight,

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,840
I squeeze into your room?

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,560
A man and a woman alone in one room—

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,239
if you can’t control yourself,

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,159
should I be understanding about it?

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,760
If you can’t control yourself,

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,120
I won’t even charge extra.

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,719
Keep dreaming.

49
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,199
Are you trying to murder your own husband?

50
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,039
My true identity

51
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,400
is actually Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,840
You thought you hired me to play a role,

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,439
but you were actually looking for the real me.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
If you really are Gao Feng,

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,639
then I must be a fairy.

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
With how beautiful my wife is,

57
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,960
calling her a fairy wouldn't be an exaggeration.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,599
What on earth is going on?

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,919
Why is even Old Master Liu

60
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,520
showing so much respect to that delivery guy?

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,520
Could it be

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,599
that he really is Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group?

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,479
Impossible.

64
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,759
Absolutely impossible.

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,719
The information here is very clear.

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,479
He’s obviously just a delivery guy.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,280
This doesn’t make any sense.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Old Master Liu isn’t even that respectful to his own father.

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,439
How could he be so respectful to a delivery guy?

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,759
What is really going on here?

71
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,960
Young Master Song,

72
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,520
Young Master Song,

73
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,319
how did he even pay off Jinzhun Group’s debt?

74
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,759
What’s happening here?

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,199
My position as vice president

76
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,400
is probably not safe anymore.

77
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,240
Why are you panicking?

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,439
Look at yourself, what do you look like right now?

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
Ugh.

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,479
How can I not panic?

81
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,319
Young Master Song,

82
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,520
you have to help me think of a solution.

83
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,199
Young Master Song,

84
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,120
it’s been investigated.

85
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,439
There’s reliable information that

86
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,199
a supervisory team has recently arrived in our Yun City.

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
Their goal is to find out

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
who is protecting Liu Shanhe behind the scenes.

89
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,160
That’s why Liu Shanhe has been keeping a low profile lately.

90
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
I knew it.

91
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,480
So that's how it is.

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
The person backing them was investigated.

93
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,720
All the dirty deeds they've done can't be covered up now.

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
At a time like this,

95
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
of course Liu Shanhe wants to keep things quiet.

96
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,920
I was wondering why he'd go to such lengths for some random guy.

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,279
Why he'd be so willing to compromise.

98
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
Turns out, he's just afraid things will get out of hand.

99
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,519
And cause an even bigger scandal.

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,519
Well played, Gao Xing.

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,279
You almost fooled me with your borrowed authority.

102
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,160
But Young Master Song,

103
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,120
that Gao Xing is just a delivery guy.

104
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,160
These kinds of secrets among the upper class

105
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
not even I know about them.

106
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,720
How could he possibly know?

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,839
Are you stupid?

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,560
Delivery guys are running around everywhere every day.

109
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,319
If there's any gossip,

110
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,879
he knows it best.

111
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,399
Good thing I'm smart.

112
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,360
I wasn't fooled by him.

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
Yeah, that's true.

114
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:16,959
Yeah, right.

115
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,480
So what should we do next?

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
One word:

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,639
Wait.

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,439
Wait.

119
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Oh man.

120
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,839
If we keep waiting,

121
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,800
what if I really lose my position as deputy general manager?

122
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,680
Idiot.

123
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,439
Didn't Su Zhengchun make a deal with him?

124
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,160
He has to get sixty million in two days.

125
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Even if he collects all the debts,

126
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,759
it's only twenty million.

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,079
As for the rest of the money,

128
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,279
if he can't fulfill tomorrow's bet,

129
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,920
he'll have to divorce Su Qingyan.

130
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,480
He'll be kicked out of the Su family.

131
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,519
And out of Qingmu.

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
By then,

133
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,199
won't the deputy general manager position still be yours?

134
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,600
That's right.

135
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,000
Young Master Song, Young Master Song!

136
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,879
Young Master Song!

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,639
You're the clever one.

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,079
Forty million a day—

139
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,600
even if it kills him,

140
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,920
he still can't pull it off.

141
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,959
Hello, An'an.

142
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,040
How did the investigation go?

143
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,079
Yesterday, I talked to three different groups of people.

144
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,079
I thoroughly looked into Gao Xing.

145
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,439
You were right.

146
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
He really is just a food delivery guy.

147
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,480
His family is poor.

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,399
But he's not bad-looking.

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
He only finished middle school and has a rural household registration.

150
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,600
He hasn't had any proper jobs.

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,000
After he came to Yuncheng,

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
he's been making a living delivering food.

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Then why does Liu Shanhe treat him so respectfully

154
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,319
and pay him back without any trouble?

155
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,560
That's simple.

156
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,959
I heard there's an inspection team around lately.

157
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,639
They're investigating Liu Shanhe's backers.

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,879
He doesn't dare cause any trouble right now.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
That's why he let Gao Xing intimidate him.

160
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,040
Oh.

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,360
So that's how it is.

162
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,879
Alright, I got it.

163
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,360
You can cook, too?

164
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
It smells pretty good.

165
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,319
Are you hungry?

166
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you want to eat together?

167
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,720
There's some for me, too?

168
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,720
Is this to thank me

169
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,439
and you made it just for me?

170
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,839
Don't flatter yourself.

171
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,319
I made it for myself.

172
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,480
I just made too much and didn't want to waste it.

173
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,279
Really?

174
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,759
Why do I feel like someone is

175
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,759
saying one thing but meaning another?

176
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,759
Come on, are you eating or not?

177
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,560
If not, forget it.

178
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
I'll eat.

179
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,519
Why wouldn't I eat?

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,759
It'd be a waste not to.

181
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,040
Honey, let's go.

182
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,160
Where are you going?

183
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm going to work at Qingmu.

184
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm the deputy general manager at Qingmu now.

185
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,560
I have to set an example.

186
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,399
I can't be late or leave early.

187
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,319
Stop messing around.

188
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,800
I have something important to do today.

189
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,279
What's so important?

190
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,920
We're husband and wife, we're in this together.

191
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,759
Tell me.

192
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,600
I'll help you solve it.

193
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,960
Even though you helped me with over twenty million,

194
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,840
And An'an,

195
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
also invested another ten million in Qingmu.

196
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,919
But we're still short by over twenty million.

197
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Today is the last day.

198
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,320
So I plan to try my luck at Tiange Group.

199
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,080
Tiange?

200
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,759
Yeah.

201
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,960
Tiange Group is the top conglomerate in our province.

202
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,399
They have strong financial power.

203
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,799
Their market value exceeds ten billion.

204
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,759
If they

205
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,399
are interested in our Qingmu project,

206
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,799
then our funding gap will be solved.

207
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,679
That's easy.

208
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,840
Just take me with you.

209
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,720
With me, Gao Feng, taking the lead,

210
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,840
no matter who it is,

211
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,120
they'll have to show your husband some respect.

212
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,159
I had you pretend to be Gao Feng

213
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,200
to fool my family and Song Haoyang.

214
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,080
If you claim to be Gao Feng outside as well,

215
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
that would be fraud.

216
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,759
So I have to handle it myself today.

217
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,159
But according to the bet,

218
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,200
the funding issue for Qingmu will probably fall on me to solve.

219
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,399
If you go by yourself,

220
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,759
what if your family refuses to acknowledge it?

221
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,639
Just take me with you.

222
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,960
Maybe I can help solve something.

223
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,279
Alright.

224
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,399
Then come with me.

225
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,279
But remember,

226
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,320
you must follow my instructions in everything you say and do.

227
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,399
Don't speak carelessly.

228
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,759
And absolutely do not mention that you are Gao Feng.

229
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,720
Do you understand?

230
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,279
Don't worry, I'll handle it properly.

231
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,559
Hello?

232
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,720
Hello, Zhou Pengfei.

233
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,480
The boss has personally come to your Tiange Group.

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Hurry up and go greet him.

235
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:46,919
What?

236
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
The boss is here in person?

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,480
I'll go right away.

238
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,279
Hey, wait.

239
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,840
This time, the boss is coming incognito.

240
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,679
You need to be smart about it.

241
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,480
Did you hear me?

242
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,840
Got it, got it.

243
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
I've been waiting for a long time too.

244
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,240
We've all been waiting a long time.

245
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

246
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,799
These are all the heads of major groups in Yuncheng.

247
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,360
They're all here to collaborate with Tiange Group.

248
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,759
But President Zhou of Tiange Group is extremely busy.

249
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,360
Not just anyone can meet him.

250
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,799
Whatever, let's just line up first.

251
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,639
Okay.

252
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,960
Mr. Zhou has important matters to attend to today.

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,879
He is not available to meet guests.

254
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,840
Everyone, please leave.

255
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,679
Let's go, let's head back.

256
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,919
It's over.

257
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,960
Do you know

258
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,679
the strength of these company bosses

259
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,960
is even greater than ours at Qingmu.

260
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,039
Even they were turned away.

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,919
We probably have even less of a chance.

262
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,120
Isn't this the one from the engagement party

263
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
who ran away from the wedding in public, President Su?

264
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,440
What,

265
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,919
now that you don't have the Song family's help,

266
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
you're here to try to get in with Tiange again?

267
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,519
Even we can't get in.

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,039
You should stop daydreaming.

269
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,639
Hey,

270
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,679
my wife is different from you all.

271
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,679
You all come to Tiange

272
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,360
to beg Tiange for a chance to make a living.

273
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,360
But my wife comes to Tiange

274
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,759
as a favor to Tiange.

275
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,159
If Zhou Pengfei knew about this,

276
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,759
he would come down to greet her himself.

277
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
What a big mouth.

278
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,399
Where did this clown come from?

279
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,440
Talking so big,

280
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,519
aren't you afraid you'll bite your tongue?

281
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,240
Zhou himself would come greet you?

282
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,840
Who do you think you are?

283
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,759
Can you stop bragging?

284
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm not bragging.

285
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,080
You're not bragging?

286
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
Then where is Mr. Zhou?

287
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,039
Why hasn't he come down to greet you?

288
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,320
This guy is just talking big.

289
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,759
He’s even convinced himself.

290
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,440
Mr. Zhou is here!
