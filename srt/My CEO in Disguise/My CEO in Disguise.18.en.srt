1
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,599
Effective immediately

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,480
I, Xiao Yaqi, am officially terminating my contract with Qingmu Group

3
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,679
I will no longer be the spokesperson for Qingmu Group

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,920
No

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,519
What? Xiao Yaqi canceled her endorsement?

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,640
How could this happen?

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,679
Everyone, don't listen to her nonsense

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,280
Our Qingmu Group's products

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,559
have no quality issues whatsoever

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,440
Su Qingyan, stop wasting your time

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,920
They won't believe you

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,880
This is the influence I have as a top celebrity

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,159
Understand?

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,759
That's right

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,640
Miss Xiao is a top celebrity

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,359
If your products weren't problematic

17
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,640
why would she suddenly break the contract and risk her reputation?

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,640
You put faulty products on the market

19
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,479
that's being irresponsible to consumers

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,039
Crooked merchants, I spit on you

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,039
Exactly

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,039
Crooks, liars

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,960
Get lost

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,759
Liars, crooks

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:00,960
What are you doing?

26
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,640
You are journalists,

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,040
spreading rumors without evidence,

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,239
only listening to one side of the story.

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,760
Do you have any professional ethics?

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
And you, as a famous celebrity,

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,359
broke the contract on the spot and made false accusations.

32
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,280
Looks like you don't want to be a star anymore.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Threatening me?

34
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,079
Oh, I'm so scared.

35
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,359
Let me tell you,

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,640
this is the price you pay for humiliating me yesterday.

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,239
So, how about it?

38
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,239
Do you like the big gift I gave you?

39
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,439
Xiao Yaqi, you signed a contract with our Qingmu company.

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,359
This counts as breaching the contract.

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,319
Aren't you afraid of being blacklisted by the agency?

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,640
I was forced to sign the contract because the agency threatened me.

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,640
But now?

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,879
I have even more powerful backing now.

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
I've even received an invitation from the famous international director Zhang Yimu.

46
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,560
I'll soon become an international superstar.

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,519
By then,

48
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,359
even the agency will have to listen to me.

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
So what if I break the contract?

50
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,359
What can you do to me?

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
Well said.

52
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,640
Well said.

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Young Master Song is here.

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,120
Young Master Song is here—it's him!

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,639
What kind of status does Miss Xiao have?

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,039
How could she possibly lower herself to sign with your Qingmu?

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,039
Happy to have gotten the Immortal Doctor's secret recipe.

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,879
Weren't you acting all arrogant and cocky before?

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,599
Why aren't you showing off now?

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,319
You two planned this together, didn't you?

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,479
But who gave you the confidence

62
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,919
to think you've already won?

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,680
Gao Xing, you're still being stubborn now?

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,520
Miss Xiao has already canceled her partnership with you.

65
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,159
All the reporters here were invited by me to watch you make a fool of yourselves.

66
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,639
After such a scene,

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,120
your product will be completely ruined.

68
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,039
You won't be able to sell a single item then.

69
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,520
Let's see how you recover from this.

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,280
Su Qingyan, I'll give you one last chance.

71
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,479
As long as you divorce this Gao right now,

72
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,840
and marry into our Song family,

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,960
I can let Qingmu off the hook.

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,520
But you need to think carefully.

75
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,479
This promise I'm making

76
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,080
is only valid right now.

77
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
After all, if you miss this opportunity,

78
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,919
you won't get another one.

79
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,840
Keep dreaming.

80
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,280
Fine.

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,919
Since you're asking for trouble,

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,919
don't blame me for being ruthless.

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,240
Everyone,

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,479
Qingmu Group's products are counterfeit.

85
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,840
Their quality is poor.

86
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,159
Miss Xiao spoke out bravely.

87
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,879
She canceled the contract in public.

88
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,479
This is big news.

89
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,479
What are you waiting for?

90
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,919
Hurry up and take pictures.

91
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,199
Quick, get it all on camera.

92
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,159
Take the pictures, hurry!

93
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,479
Stop taking pictures.

94
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,560
This really is big news.

95
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,840
Qingyan, something bad happened.

96
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
The news about Xiao Yaqi terminating her contract is trending.

97
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,639
What?

98
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,719
And it's getting even more attention.

99
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,159
Hey, look, look!

100
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,479
Xiao Yaqi announced she's ending her contract with Qingmu Group.

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,919
Is this true?

102
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,719
What does this mean?

103
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,439
Really?

104
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
Product fraud.

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
Qingmu Group has gone too far.

106
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,639
A shady company like this deserves to go bankrupt.

107
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
Wow.

108
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,479
Zhixi, sis.

109
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,400
You look absolutely stunning today.

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,080
The judges will vote live tonight.

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,719
You'll definitely beat Liu Bingxin.

112
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,800
Best Actress is definitely yours.

113
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Of course. Whatever I, Ye Zhixi, want,

114
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,480
Liu Bingxin isn't even worthy to compete with me.

115
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,040
I heard Xiao Yaqi terminated her contract.

116
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,120
What are they talking about?

117
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,279
I heard it's a company in Yuncheng.

118
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,279
They're holding a press conference for a new spokesperson.

119
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,839
Xiao Yaqi announced the contract termination in public at the event.

120
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,199
It's all over the trending searches.

121
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,879
Let me take a look.

122
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
It's him.

123
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,959
Why is he here too?

124
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
Zhixi, you know him?

125
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,240
Know him? It's more than that.

126
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,560
I've had such a hard time looking for this heartless man.

127
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,000
Quick, get the car ready.

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,319
Take me to the press conference venue.

129
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,759
To the press conference venue?

130
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,439
What about the awards ceremony?

131
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,879
If you leave now,

132
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
the Golden Dragon Best Actress award will go to Liu Bingxin.

133
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,279
If she wants it, let her have it.

134
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,800
But this man—I'm definitely taking him.

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,480
Bingxin,

136
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,480
Bingxin,

137
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,879
Good news!

138
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,120
Ye Zhixi just announced she's dropping out of the ceremony.

139
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
She left in a car right away.

140
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,079
The Golden Dragon Best Actress award is definitely yours now.

141
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
What? She left?

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,480
Where did she go?

143
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,560
They say she saw some news report.

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,319
She went next door to attend some press conference.

145
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,240
Press conference news?

146
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,560
Show me.

147
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,920
Qingmu Group's Xiao Yaqi.

148
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
What does she have to do with Ye Zhixi?

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Wait.

150
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,240
It's him.

151
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,199
He's here too.

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,519
Who is that? Do you know him?

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,079
I know him very well.

154
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,879
Well, well, Ye Zhixi.

155
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,639
No wonder you don't even care about the Best Actress award.

156
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,759
Get the car ready. Take me there right now.

157
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,480
Ah!

158
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
But the award ceremony is about to start.

159
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,519
If you go now,

160
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,319
won't you miss the Best Actress award for nothing?

161
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,639
Who cares about the Best Actress award?

162
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,480
Whoever wants it can have it.

163
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,279
If I don't go now, someone will steal my man.

164
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,040
Get the car ready.

165
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,639
Gao Xing, did you see that?

166
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,480
This is what happens when you go against me, Song Haoyang.

167
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,040
In the face of our Song family's power,

168
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,959
you, just a delivery guy,

169
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,959
are nothing at all.

170
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,519
You call this power?

171
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,639
Then you really have no idea what power means.

172
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,240
Keep pretending.

173
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,519
Go on, keep pretending.

174
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
Looking at you from head to toe,

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,560
your mouth is the only tough thing about you.

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,079
Su Qingyan, it's not too late to regret now.

177
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,319
As long as you kick this Gao guy away right now,

178
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,120
and marry me,

179
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,720
I can put in a good word for you with Miss Xiao.

180
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,319
Of course, I, Xiao Yaqi, will give Young Master Song some respect.

181
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,639
Let Su Qingyan remarry on the spot.

182
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,160
And have the two of them kneel and apologize to me right here.

183
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,920
If I'm in a good mood,

184
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,480
I won't pursue today's matter any further.

185
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,439
No way.

186
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
Even if it costs me all of Qingmu,

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
I still won't agree to any of your demands.

188
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,839
Well said, honey.

189
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,240
But don't worry.

190
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,519
If they want to mess with Qingmu,

191
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,879
just the two of them,

192
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,959
they don't have what it takes.

193
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,160
Gao Xing, you sure talk big.

194
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,920
What else can you do?

195
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,199
Show us if you have any skills.

196
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,639
Oh, right.

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,879
Didn't you say you know Chu Jiangchao, President Chu?

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,839
Why don't you call him right now and see?

199
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,879
Who knows,

200
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,240
maybe he'll send you a new spokesperson.

201
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,639
And stop calling me President Chu.

202
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,879
Perfect timing.

203
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,319
Isn't the Golden Dragon Festival awards ceremony being held right here in our Yun City?

204
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,639
Ye Zhixi and Liu Bingxin, both international award-winning actresses,

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
aren't far from here either.

206
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,839
Gao Xing, with your abilities,

207
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,639
making a call to invite both actresses over

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,839
shouldn't be too hard, right?

209
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,480
That way, everyone here can bask in their glory too.

210
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,040
Boss, your two old flames

211
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,920
have seen the news.

212
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,279
They're on their way to you right now.

213
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,120
They'll be here soon.

214
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,639
They're on the way, almost here.

215
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
What? Who's almost here?

216
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
Did I hear that right?

217
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Young Master Song, did you hear that?

218
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
It sounds like Gao Xing is saying

219
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,040
both international actresses are on their way here.

220
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,720
Hey, Gao,

221
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,080
there's a limit to how much you can brag.

222
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,879
Ye and Liu are coming to Yun City

223
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,960
to attend the Golden Dragon Festival.

224
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,120
They're waiting for the awards ceremony right now.

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,759
They're competing for Best Actress.

226
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Who do you think you are?

227
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,440
You think they'd skip the awards just to come see you?

228
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
Do you take us all for fools?

229
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
Exactly, that's impossible.

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,080
Gao Xing,

231
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,039
let me teach you something.

232
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,080
If someone is truly capable,

233
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,279
it's not because of bragging or sweet talk.

234
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,039
No matter how much you say,

235
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,120
you're still just a clown.

236
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,039
I told you,

237
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,879
don't be in such a hurry.

238
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,759
Soon you'll see who the real clown is.

239
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,320
Everyone,

240
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,480
Gao Xing just said

241
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,240
that their Qingmu Group

242
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,840
will soon have a new spokesperson.

243
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,960
And,

244
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,879
it's an international superstar even more famous than Miss Xiao.

245
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,840
Young Master Song is right.

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,639
What are you all waiting for?

247
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,480
Turn your cameras to the entrance.

248
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,679
Maybe,

249
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,960
the new spokesperson is about to arrive.

250
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,039
Gao Xing, you brought this on yourself.

251
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
In front of so many media reporters,

252
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,279
you made such outrageous claims.

253
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,919
I guarantee

254
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,240
from today on,

255
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,200
you'll be the biggest joke in Yun City.

256
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,120
International film queen Ye Zhixi

257
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,480
Miss Ye has arrived.

258
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,799
Now I want to see who dares to laugh at him.
