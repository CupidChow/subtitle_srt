1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
International film queen Ye Zhixi

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,199
Miss Ye has arrived

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,239
I want to see who dares to laugh at him

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
Queen Ye

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,079
Oh my god

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,839
How is that possible

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,800
Isn't she supposed to be attending the Golden Dragon Awards

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,960
Why would she come to a place like this

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,640
She really came

10
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,159
I know

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,039
Miss Ye is so beautiful

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,039
There must be some mistake

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,719
Hurry, hurry, hurry

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,439
Take more photos from every angle

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,159
It was written in the news

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,920
He’s now using the alias Gao Xing

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,119
I must not expose him

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,200
Miss Ye

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,439
Are you here to attend the award ceremony?

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,240
You must have come to the wrong place.

21
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,560
I'm Song Haoyang.

22
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,479
I'm the young master of the Song family in Yun City.

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,439
If you don't mind,

24
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,359
I can arrange a car to personally take you there.

25
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,799
Song Haoyang?

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,399
Never heard of you.

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,799
Are we close or something?

28
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,159
Move aside.

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,519
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,719
I'm Ye Zhixi.

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
I announce that from today on,

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,719
I am officially the spokesperson for Qingmu Group.

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,519
What?

34
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,359
Ye, the movie queen, is going to be Qingmu's spokesperson?

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,400
Take pictures, hurry!

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Qingyan, did I hear that right?

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,400
The movie queen Ye is really going to be our spokesperson!

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm so happy!

39
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,879
She really came here for you.

40
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,319
Yeah.

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Impossible.

42
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
I don't believe it.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,599
This must be another one of your tricks.

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,239
An international superstar like her

45
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
would never be a spokesperson for a small company like yours.

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,040
International movie queen Liu Bingxin

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,920
Miss Liu has arrived.

48
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,400
Miss Liu is here too.

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,120
Oh my god.

50
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,400
Wait a minute.

51
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,239
That spokesperson position is mine!

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,159
What on earth is going on?

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
Take pictures, hurry!

54
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,840
So beautiful!

55
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,959
Take a few more shots.

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,519
Liu Bingxin.

57
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,000
Both major international actresses actually showed up.

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,519
Our press conference is simply

59
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,120
even grander than the Golden Dragon Festival awards next door.

60
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,319
I, Liu Bingxin, hereby announce

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,719
from this moment on,

62
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,680
the position of spokesperson for Qingmu Group

63
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,479
will be held by me.

64
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,639
What?

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,759
What?

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,879
Even Liu, the award-winning actress, is going to endorse Qingmu?

67
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
These are all international award-winning actresses.

68
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,919
Top-tier superstars.

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,319
They're all lining up to endorse Qingmu.

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,560
What kind of company is Qingmu Group, anyway?

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,919
Liu Bingxin.

72
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,360
Do you even know what "first come, first served" means?

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
I've already said

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,120
the Qingmu endorsement is mine.

75
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,639
This must be

76
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,680
Miss Su, the president of Qingmu Group, right?

77
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,280
If it's convenient,

78
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,800
shall we go somewhere else to discuss the contract?

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
What a joke.

80
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,520
Just because you say it's yours, doesn't make it so.

81
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Let me tell you, Ye Zhixi,

82
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,759
I'm definitely going to be the spokesperson.

83
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,879
Miss Su,

84
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,599
I don't need to go anywhere else.

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
You bring the contract, I'll bring the pen.

86
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,879
Let's sign it right now.

87
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,560
Wait, sorry, you two.

88
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,560
You're both internationally renowned stars.

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
Having you represent Qingmu

90
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
makes me truly happy.

91
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,800
And it's an honor.

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,919
But Qingmu is currently short on funds.

93
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,919
Your endorsement fees...

94
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,520
Yes, both of you are award-winning actresses.

95
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,520
You're both international superstars.

96
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,840
Your usual endorsement fees

97
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
start at tens of millions.

98
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
With Qingmu's current assets,

99
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,719
we couldn't afford you even if we sold the company.

100
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Don't let her fool you.

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
Miss Su, you're overthinking it.

102
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,360
Mr. Gao Xing, your company's vice president, and I

103
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,719
are old friends.

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,439
I'm willing to do it for free.

105
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,639
I'll endorse for free.

106
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,520
What? For free?

107
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,400
Free is nothing.

108
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,319
Miss Su, my relationship with Gao Xing

109
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,439
is much deeper than hers with Ye Zhixi.

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,759
So not only will I waive my endorsement fee,

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm also willing to sponsor Qingmu Group with an extra five million.

112
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,439
Sponsor?

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,439
Self-sponsored

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,039
Gao Xing and I have had a candlelight dinner together.

115
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,560
I'll put up ten million for the sponsorship.

116
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,960
I even held hands with him and went to a private cinema together.

117
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,920
Have you ever done that?

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Twenty million.

119
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,600
I spent Valentine's Day with him.

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,920
Thirty million.

121
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,639
I went to a hot spring with him.

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Forty million.

123
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,439
Fifty million.

124
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,319
Sixty million.

125
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,920
Crazy.

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,879
They're all crazy.

127
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,720
Two international award-winning actresses are actually fighting to win over Qing Mu.

128
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,439
They're about to start fighting.

129
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,240
What endorsement?

130
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,959
This is clearly a fight over a man.

131
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,399
This is big news.

132
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,199
Everyone, take pictures quickly.

133
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,439
Hurry, take pictures.

134
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,800
Impossible.

135
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,759
No way.

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,160
How could Gao Xing possibly have such strong connections?

137
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,199
I don't believe it.

138
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
I don't believe it.

139
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,120
Look how pitiful you are.

140
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,920
You even offered your face to be slapped.

141
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,480
You...

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,399
And you, breaking your contract in public.

143
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,319
Spreading rumors and slander.

144
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
It's time to settle this score too.

145
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,120
Gao,

146
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,839
Don't think I'll be afraid of you just because you have some connections.

147
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,040
Let me tell you,

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
I've already received an invitation to Director Zhang Yimu's new film.

149
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,319
Soon, I'll be starring in a top blockbuster.

150
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,759
And become an international award-winning actress.

151
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,759
If you want to settle scores with me,

152
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
you're not capable enough yet.

153
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,680
Congratulations.

154
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,680
Remove Xiao Yaqi from Zhang Yimu's film.

155
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,759
And blacklist her while you're at it.

156
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,519
You want to take me out of the film?

157
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,120
Do you even know

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,319
that I'm the lead actress in this blockbuster?

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,319
Director Zhang personally chose me.

160
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,560
Director Zhang even called me yesterday.

161
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,399
He wanted to set up a time to discuss the script.

162
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,639
You think just making a call

163
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,959
can influence Director Zhang's decision?

164
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,920
Who do you think you are?

165
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,839
Well said.

166
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,920
Zhang Yimu is an internationally renowned director.

167
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,920
He's not some nobody.

168
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,839
You can't control him with just a phone call.

169
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,480
When Miss Xiao becomes an international film queen thanks to Director Zhang,

170
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,199
your Qingmu Group will be in trouble.

171
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,360
See that?

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
Director Zhang is calling me right now.

173
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,199
Quick, record this.

174
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Post it on Twitter.

175
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
Hello, Director Zhang.

176
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,519
When can we meet to discuss the script?

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,439
I can't wait

178
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,759
to be the lead actress in your new film.

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
Lead actress? You think you deserve that?

180
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,759
Someone like you

181
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,560
who can't tell right from wrong,

182
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,519
breaks contracts in public,

183
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
and slanders your partners,

184
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,240
has no professional ethics

185
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,199
or personal integrity,

186
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,000
is not qualified to be my lead actress.

187
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,519
I'm informing you now:

188
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,120
the lead actress for this project is officially being replaced.

189
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
You can get lost.

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Director Zhang!

191
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
Director Zhang!

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Director Zhang!

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,399
What do we do now?

194
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,480
They just terminated the contract, just like that.

195
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,040
It's fine, it's fine.

196
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,040
Don't forget,

197
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,319
you're with Chu Jiangchao.

198
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,560
You're the woman Mr. Chu has his eye on.

199
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
Losing Zhang Yimu is nothing.

200
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,399
With Mr. Chu backing you,

201
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,680
there are plenty of famous directors lining up to cast you.

202
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,480
That's right.

203
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,920
Chu Jiangchao.

204
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,079
She actually caught the eye of the godfather of the entertainment industry.

205
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,800
Yes, that's right.

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm with Mr. Chu now.

207
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,720
Gao,

208
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,959
my backer now is the true godfather of the entertainment industry.

209
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,439
Forget about you, Qingmu,

210
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,519
and you too, Ye Zhixi and Liu Bingxin.

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,759
Once I tell Mr. Chu about this,

212
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,839
none of you will be spared.

213
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,920
None of you will have it easy.

214
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,439
Shh.

215
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,879
Let the dust settle for a bit.

216
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,399
Look, Zhongyu Group just released a statement.

217
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,319
What statement?

218
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,560
Mr. Chu posted something.

219
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
On behalf of Zhongyu Group,

220
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,240
he announced a complete ban on Xiao Yaqi.

221
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,279
What?

222
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
How is that possible?

223
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,879
How could that be?

224
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,720
It's really a statement from Zhongyu Group.

225
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,399
You, you actually...

226
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,920
You really know Chu Jiangchao.

227
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,879
It's over.

228
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:56,800
Take a few more photos.

229
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,160
It's all over.

230
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,680
Let me give you a friendly piece of advice.

231
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,279
The happiness will be mine.

232
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,160
It's not too late if you admit defeat now.

233
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,240
Let me give you some advice too.

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,399
Go back now and take your Golden Dragon Best Actress award.

235
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,560
At least it can be some consolation.

236
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,519
Otherwise, when you can't beat me,

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,800
you'll lose the award too.

238
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,920
Don't regret it then.

239
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Gao Xing,

240
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,360
the contract will be ready soon.

241
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,759
Thank you for your hard work.

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,759
With our relationship,

243
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,440
there's no need to be so polite.

244
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,360
If you really want to thank me,

245
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,399
you know what I want.

246
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,559
Don't do this, if your fans see it—

247
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,639
it'll be such a huge scandal.

248
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,039
I'm not afraid of scandals.

249
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,399
As long as

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,799
you're willing to be with me,

251
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
I'm willing to leave the entertainment industry for you right now.

252
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,399
Stop joking around.

253
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,679
I'm a married man now.

254
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,120
If she sees this, she won't be happy.

255
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,559
You have a wife?

256
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,759
Who do you think would believe that?

257
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Yeah, you don't even like any of us,

258
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,559
how could you like any other woman?

259
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,759
Am I interrupting you?

260
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,559
No, not at all.

261
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,679
Then let's sign the contract later.

262
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,480
No need.

263
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,399
We can sign it right now.

264
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,559
Alright, starting today

265
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Ms. Liu and Ms. Ye

266
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,120
are officially becoming our Qingmu brand ambassadors.

267
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,159
Both of you stepped in today to represent Qingmu for us

268
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,720
and didn't even charge an endorsement fee.

269
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,919
We are truly grateful for your kindness.

270
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,279
Miss Su, you're too polite.

271
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
Qingmu has obtained the secret recipe from the medical sage.

272
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,320
Even without us,

273
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,559
your product would definitely be a big hit when it launches.

274
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,320
Maybe we're the ones benefiting from your company's success.

275
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,600
Besides, Gao Xing and I are as close as family.

276
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,120
With our relationship,

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,559
this little favor is nothing at all.

278
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,759
She's just joking.

279
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,120
We're just ordinary friends.

280
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,159
Very ordinary.

281
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,799
Exactly.

282
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,200
Some so-called ordinary friends

283
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,559
shouldn't get any funny ideas.

284
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,120
The bond between Gao Xing and me is truly unbreakable.

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
It's not like that at all.

286
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,399
She's a film queen, after all.

287
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,519
Her acting is especially natural.

288
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,320
But I don't know why some people are so dramatic.

289
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,919
Miss Su, don't mind her.

290
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,120
Weren't you trying to express your gratitude?

291
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,120
I have a request.

292
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,120
Go ahead.

293
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,440
Can I borrow Gaoxing for a day?

294
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
Why should I?

295
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,639
If anyone's borrowing him, it should be me first.

296
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,120
No, no, no.

297
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,879
Since both of you are so interested in Gaoxing,

298
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,840
how could I not help you out?

299
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,759
You can borrow him.

300
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Miss Su, you really are generous.

301
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,039
Then we'll take our leave.

302
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,159
Let's go.

303
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,759
Come on, let's go.

304
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,799
Hey!

305
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,679
Hey!

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Let go of me.

307
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,120
Gaoxing is mine.

308
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,960
Why are you everywhere?

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,399
Both top actresses are fighting to throw themselves at Gaoxing.

310
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,600
Who exactly is this guy?

311
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,080
I just don't get it.

312
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,519
But you're just letting your husband go like that,

313
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
and you're not worried at all?

314
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,559
What's there to worry about?

315
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
Didn't you see how happy Gao Xing was just now?

316
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
You'd better think this through.

317
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,559
Did you see the way those two actresses looked at Gao Xing?

318
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,039
It was like they were looking at prey.

319
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,639
You sent him out there.

320
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,759
That's really like sending a lamb into a tiger's den.

321
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,720
He might never come back.

322
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,519
If he doesn't come back, so be it.

323
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,919
Besides, I never had the right to control him anyway.

324
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,639
Did you see the way he was just now?

325
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm just letting him have what he wants.

326
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,799
Really? Are you sure?

327
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,960
You're not jealous at all?

328
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,000
Jealous?

329
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,559
Me?

330
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,519
Me, Su Qingyan?

331
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,639
Would I be jealous over him?

332
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,799
What a joke.
