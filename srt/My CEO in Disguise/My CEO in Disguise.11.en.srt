1
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,400
Other people's secret recipes are just worthless paper.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
What about yours?

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,000
Your secret recipe is also worthless in my eyes.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,960
Gaoxing.

5
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,839
Why are you here?

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,960
Don't worry, honey.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,480
Isn't it just a beauty recipe?

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,800
You can have as many as you want.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,199
Gaoxing.

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,880
Other than cheating, deceiving, and faking things,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,240
what else can you do?

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,399
Let me tell you,

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,640
the person I invited today

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,079
is a registered disciple of the Gu Medical Family.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,240
And the president of the Southern Province Pharmacists Association.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,679
In front of President Zhao,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
I want to see

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,119
what tricks you can still pull.

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,640
President of the Pharmacists Association—

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:50,920
is that impressive?

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,280
I actually have a good relationship with the Gu Medical Family.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,679
Their current head even has to call me "brother."

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,439
By seniority,

24
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,439
it's not too much for me to call you "nephew," right?

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,799
How dare you!

26
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,439
You ignorant brat!

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,719
How dare you insult the reputation of the Gu Medical Family!

28
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,719
Who gave you the courage?

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,319
Gaoxing, stop messing around.

30
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,400
This is the Medical Association.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,000
If you offend them,

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,239
how will I work with them in the future?

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,359
Gaoxing,

34
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,879
can you at least think before you brag?

35
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,599
The current head of the Gu Medical Family, Cheng Suyi,

36
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,599
is a woman,

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,480
but at a young age, her medical skills are unmatched.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
People call her the "Little Medical Immortal."

39
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,200
She's like a legendary figure.

40
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,519
How could someone like you ever reach her level?

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,599
Hey, wait a minute.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
I almost forgot.

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,200
This person in front of us

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,640
claims to be Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,680
If he really is such a big shot,

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,239
then maybe he really does have a connection with this little Medical Immortal.

47
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,239
But I’m saying,

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
if you two really know each other,

49
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,599
it shouldn’t be hard to get a couple of secret recipes from her, right?

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,239
Right.

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,239
Young Master Song is right.

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,439
If you really have the skills,

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,120
then bring out some Medical Immortal recipes

54
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,120
and let us see for ourselves.

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,800
That’s right.

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,840
I actually do have Medical Immortal recipes.

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
These are Medical Immortal recipes.

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,000
You, Gao,

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,639
if you're going to fake something,

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,000
at least make it look convincing.

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,479
The Immortal Doctor's secret recipe is incredibly valuable.

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
It's worth a fortune.

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,439
And you use a torn napkin to pass it off?

64
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,400
What,

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
do you take us for fools?

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,919
No, Gao Xing,

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,520
you might be able to fool others,

68
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,039
but don't fool yourself.

69
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,919
A real secret recipe depends on genuine skill and knowledge.

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,439
In front of Chairman Zhao,

71
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,080
you don't really think that with a scrap of paper

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,199
and a few scribbles you can get away with it, do you?

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Gao Xing, stop making a scene.

74
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,039
You can't joke about something as serious as a secret recipe.

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,960
Just go back.

76
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,639
Honey,

77
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,080
the secret recipe presented by the president of Junsheng Group

78
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,879
—do you really think it's fake?

79
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
Still putting on an act?

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,479
I'm telling you, you're just fooling yourself.

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,919
You've completely lost it.

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,439
Su Qingyan,

83
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,039
look at the man you chose.

84
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,560
Isn't he just a total clown?

85
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,120
Wait a moment.

86
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,840
This secret recipe is actually real.

87
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,479
What?

88
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,080
Ah!

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,159
What?

90
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,680
It's real.

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,120
Really.

92
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,080
How is that possible?

93
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,039
Yeah.

94
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,400
Old Zhao, are your eyes getting blurry with age?

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,840
How could this torn piece of tissue be an immortal doctor's secret recipe?

96
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,560
I don't know if it's an immortal doctor's secret recipe.

97
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,680
But this recipe uses Bigen grass as its base.

98
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,000
With marigold and red pigweed as supplements.

99
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,639
The ingredients balance yin and yang, complementing each other.

100
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,840
The blending approach is simply imaginative and unrestrained.

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
It's ingenious down to the finest detail.

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
This is definitely the work of a grandmaster.

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
If used long-term,

104
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,919
its anti-aging effect far surpasses the beauty cream.

105
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,520
It can even restore the skin's radiance.

106
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,439
It has miraculous rejuvenating effects.

107
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,439
This secret recipe

108
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,919
is far stronger than President Zhao's beauty cream.

109
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,199
It's ten, even a hundred times more effective.

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,480
Nonsense!

111
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,800
This beauty cream

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,240
is the proud result of all my life's learning.

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
How could there be a recipe even better than this?

114
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,600
What would an amateur like you know?

115
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,279
Let me see.

116
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,959
This... this is actually the recipe for the Rejuvenation Pill!

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,399
It comes from an ancient family of doctors.

118
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,920
And it's the secret that Master Cheng Suyi never passed on!

119
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,839
Congratulations, President Su.

120
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,519
With the recipe for the Rejuvenation Pill,

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,600
Qingmu is saved.

122
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,079
No, not just saved.

123
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
It's about to soar to new heights!

124
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
This secret recipe is actually real.

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,319
Hey.

126
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,839
Where did you get it from?

127
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,920
Little Medical Fairy gave it to me.

128
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,879
Impossible.

129
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
Absolutely impossible.

130
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Even in the ancient medical families, this Medical Fairy's secret recipe

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
is a treasured secret that is never shared.

132
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,680
Even as an outer disciple,

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,720
I could only listen to the sect leader explain it from afar.

134
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,800
I never had a chance to even touch it.

135
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,399
How could it possibly be given to you?

136
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,800
President Zhao is right.

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,839
Little Medical Fairy's status is extremely noble.

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,800
You're just a delivery guy.

139
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,800
You're not even qualified to know her.

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Let alone

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
someone giving you such a precious thing.

142
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,920
In my opinion, there's only one explanation.

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,199
This secret recipe

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,800
was stolen by you.

145
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,600
Alright, you with the surname Gao.

146
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
It's one thing for you to cheat and swindle as usual,

147
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,800
but now you even dare to steal.

148
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,480
You've got some nerve.

149
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,279
Gao Xing, tell me the truth.

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
How did you really get this secret recipe?

151
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Wife, didn't I already explain?

152
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,519
Xiao Su Yi and I have known each other for a long time.

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,839
We're like real siblings.

154
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,439
So as a sister, she insisted on giving her brother a gift.

155
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,480
I accepted the secret recipe.

156
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,199
That's perfectly reasonable.

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
Reasonable, my foot!

158
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
Who do you think you are?

159
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,279
You think you're worthy of calling yourself siblings with Master Cheng?

160
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,439
Pah!

161
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,639
Outrageous.

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,399
This Gao is unbelievably bold.

163
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,959
Not only did he steal the secret recipe,

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,839
he even calls Master Cheng by name.

165
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,959
If you ask me,

166
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,360
this is a sign of disrespect to you and your sect.

167
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,399
People like him are simply unforgivable.

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,759
President Zhao, there must be some misunderstanding here.

169
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,279
I believe Gao Xing didn't mean to offend you.

170
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,920
If he has offended you,

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,199
I apologize to you on his behalf.

172
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,800
Su Qingyan.

173
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,360
I think you've really lost your mind.

174
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Someone who talks so wildly and doesn't know his place,

175
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,639
and you're still defending him?

176
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,480
Fine.

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
President Zhao, in my opinion,

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
this matter of stealing the secret recipe

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,720
is also connected to her Qingmu Group.

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,439
Ignorant brat

181
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,720
How dare you offend Master Cheng

182
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,279
And even commit theft

183
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,839
This is utterly outrageous

184
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,839
And you

185
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,399
Qingmu Group is also to blame for sheltering and indulging this behavior

186
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,680
Today, on behalf of the Southern Province Pharmacists Association

187
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,000
I officially announce

188
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,120
the complete ban of Qingmu Group

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,839
Effective immediately

190
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,360
Elder Zhou, Southern Province Pharmacists Association

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,720
Elder Zhou

192
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,839
All cooperation with Qingmu Group

193
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,360
is completely terminated

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,759
It's over

195
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,399
Qingmu is banned

196
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,639
From now on, they won't be able to take a single step in the Southern Province

197
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,839
Gao Xing, did you hear that?

198
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,319
This is what happens when you go against me

199
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Qingmu is finished

200
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,879
Su Qingyan is finished

201
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,439
You're finished too

202
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,680
I advise you not to celebrate too soon.

203
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,319
Popping champagne at halftime rarely ends well.

204
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,079
Still talking tough even at death's door.

205
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,279
Someone, throw him out for me!

206
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,680
I'd like to see who dares.

207
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,399
Th-this is the Little Medical Fairy.

208
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,959
The Little Medical Fairy, Cheng Suyi.

209
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,879
Why did she come in person?

210
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,000
Registered disciple Zhao Xinglin.

211
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,319
Greets the sect leader.

212
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Gao, did you see that?

213
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Sect Leader Cheng has come herself.

214
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,160
It means your theft of the secret recipe has already been exposed.

215
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,360
Weren't you acting arrogant just now?

216
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
Go on, then.

217
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,560
Right in front of Sect Leader Cheng,

218
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,879
repeat what you just said.

219
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,319
Fine.

220
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,079
Suyi.

221
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,680
Someone claims I stole your secret recipe.

222
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,160
How do you plan to deal with me?

223
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,199
You brat!

224
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,080
How dare you call the sect leader by name!

225
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,679
Looks like you're asking for trouble.

226
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,279
Shut up.

227
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Brother Gao, please stop teasing me.

228
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,759
You've helped our Ancient Medicine family so much.

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let alone a single secret recipe,

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,679
as long as you want it,

231
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,480
as long as I have it,

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
it's all yours.

233
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
Am I seeing this right?

234
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Someone as extraordinary as Little Medical Fairy

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,039
is actually so close with Gao Xing.

236
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,120
She even calls him brother.

237
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,279
What's going on here?

238
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,519
What Gao said is actually true.

239
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,240
Master Cheng.

240
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,240
This guy is impersonating Gao Feng and scamming people everywhere.

241
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,799
Have you been fooled by him too?

242
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,600
I, Song Haoyang, on behalf of Song Group, assure you

243
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,639
this guy is just a food delivery man.

244
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,000
He has absolutely nothing to do with the president of Junsheng.

245
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,039
Song Haoyang, right?

246
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,120
Come here.

247
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
You're too polite.

248
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,639
Just call me Haoyang.

249
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,240
My hand!

250
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Who do you think you are?

251
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,519
You have no right to meddle in my relationship with Brother Gao.

252
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,919
Song Group, is it?

253
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,240
I, Cheng Suyi, as the head of the Ancient Medicine family, hereby announce

254
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
from this day forward,

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,840
all cooperation with Song Group is terminated.

256
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Your Song Group will never get another secret recipe again.

257
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,840
And you, just an outer sect registered disciple,

258
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,240
disrespecting Brother Gao is disrespecting me.

259
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,480
You don't know your place and have overstepped your bounds.

260
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
From today on,

261
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,600
you are officially expelled from the Ancient Medicine family.

262
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,879
Master, please show mercy!

263
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,919
Master, please have mercy!

264
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,639
Master, please have mercy, Master!

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,840
Brother Gao, where are you taking me to have fun later?

266
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,159
Brother Gao, you’ve lost weight since I last saw you.

267
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,919
I’ve missed you so much.

268
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,399
You’re a grown-up now.

269
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,039
You’re already the sect leader, and you’re still acting cute.

270
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
In front of others, I’m the sect leader.

271
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,399
But in front of you, I’m still your Su Yi.

272
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,639
I want to act spoiled.

273
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,080
Stop it, Su Yi.

274
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
I’m already married.

275
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,559
I’m taken now.

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,480
It’s not appropriate for us to be so close anymore.

277
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,039
What? You’re married?

278
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,120
Who did you marry?

279
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,200
How come I didn’t know?

280
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
This is Su Qingyan, President Su.

281
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,679
She’s my wife now.

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,480
Wife?

283
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Miss Cheng.

284
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you for helping out just now.

285
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,799
You should take the secret recipe back.

286
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,679
I gave the secret recipe to Brother Gao.

287
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,639
Since he gave it to you,

288
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,559
it’s yours now.

289
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,720
This gift is too valuable.

290
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,240
I don’t know how to thank you.

291
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,679
How about this—

292
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,639
If President Su wants to thank me,

293
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,600
why not let Brother Gao be with me?

294
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,440
Let him be my husband.

295
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,360
How about that?

296
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
What?
