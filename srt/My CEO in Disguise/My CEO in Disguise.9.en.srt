1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,479
Dad

2
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,159
Mom

3
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,920
Don't go.

4
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,560
Don't go.

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,439
Don't go.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
Don't go.

7
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,879
Morning.

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,480
Morning.

9
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,319
Oh!

10
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,359
Looks like for breakfast today,

11
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,480
you accidentally made too much again.

12
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,680
Are you going to eat or not?

13
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,079
If not, forget it.

14
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,480
Of course I'll eat.

15
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,719
My wife made it herself.

16
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,599
How could I not eat it?

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,799
I drank too much last night.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
Whatever I said or did,

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,040
none of it counts.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
Then does our three rules agreement count?

21
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,599
One kiss, a thousand yuan.

22
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,400
Thank you for your patronage.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,719
A thousand it is.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm warning you,

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,239
after taking the money,

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,359
what happened last night,

27
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,439
no one is allowed to mention it.

28
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,959
I'll treat you as a regular customer.

29
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,959
Bulk discount, I'll give you two hundred back.

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Hurry up and eat.

31
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,719
After eating, go see my uncle.

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
Hey.

33
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,719
You're not eating anymore?

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
You actually dared to come back.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,919
You've got some nerve.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,159
What is it?

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,439
Did you manage to gather the sixty million?

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,599
Big brother, stop teasing him.

39
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,800
Young Master Song already looked into this guy's background

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
and found out everything about him.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,840
He's just a food delivery guy.

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
How could he possibly get sixty million?

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,759
I think he came here today

44
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,280
just to make excuses.

45
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,800
Here are the detailed transaction records for our Qingmu account.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,199
Everything is clear and transparent.

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,120
If you don't believe it,

48
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
I also have my company's account on my phone.

49
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,919
You can log in and check for yourselves.

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,919
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands...

51
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,120
Big brother.

52
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,879
What's wrong?

53
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,199
This isn't sixty million.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
This is one hundred and twenty-six million.

55
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,319
You, you, you...

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
Look at this!

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,960
Oh my god, it really is.

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,599
In just two short days,

59
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,840
he actually managed to get such a huge sum of cash.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,159
It's simply unbelievable.

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,919
Isn't he just a delivery guy?

62
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,439
Have you ever seen a delivery guy

63
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,199
with this kind of capability?

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,919
After all, this is over one hundred and twenty million in cash.

65
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,199
Even for the Song family,

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,439
gathering this amount in just two days

67
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,360
wouldn't be easy.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,439
Is he really Gao Feng?

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
The facts are right here.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,080
What is there left to doubt?

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,680
How foolish.

72
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,479
Mr. Gao, I'm really sorry.

73
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,800
Actually,

74
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,479
I've always trusted you.

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,159
It's just that Song Haoyang...

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,840
He's the one stirring up trouble here.

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,719
Yes, yes, yes.

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,639
Mr. Gao,

79
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,520
you and Qingyan are husband and wife.

80
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,280
That makes us family.

81
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,240
Please be magnanimous and don't hold our mistakes against us.

82
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,560
Since that's the case,

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,520
then you don't object to my marriage with Qingyan anymore?

84
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,919
Not only do we not object,

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,319
we fully support it.

86
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,319
We support it a thousand percent.

87
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,879
That's right.

88
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,720
Qingyan being able to marry you

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,519
is our honor.

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Yes, yes, exactly.

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,040
We won't force Qingyan to marry Song Haoyang anymore.

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
We won't, we won't.

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,279
You two are already married.

94
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,720
How could she marry someone else?

95
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,600
That's right.

96
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
Qingyan never liked that Song Haoyang anyway.

97
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,240
It's all that Song kid's fault.

98
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,319
He just won't give up.

99
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,680
We'll go to the Song family right away and make things clear.

100
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,959
We guarantee a clean break, once and for all.

101
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,439
Yes, yes, yes.

102
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,279
Really?

103
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,680
If it really gets cut off,

104
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,759
don’t cry too loudly later.

105
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,600
Song Haoyang,

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,319
what do you mean by that?

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
My meaning is simple.

108
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,600
This Gao Feng,

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,319
he’s a fake.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
You all think you’ve found a treasure,

111
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,839
but you don’t realize

112
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,600
this is just one of his traps.

113
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,639
You’ve all fallen for it.

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,839
Fallen for it?

115
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,160
One hundred and twenty-six million,

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
that’s real money,

117
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
transferred directly to Qingmu Company’s account.

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,879
What makes you say it’s fake?

119
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,680
Besides Mr. Gao Feng,

120
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,720
who else could make Jin Zun pay back the money

121
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,680
and get Tiange Investment involved?

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,199
My friend already investigated everything.

123
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
The only reason Jin Zun Group agreed to pay back

124
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,920
is because the inspection team came to Yuncheng.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
The Liu family ran into big trouble.

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,399
Old Master Liu Shanhe wanted to handle all conflicts

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,319
as discreetly as possible.

128
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,519
That’s why they obediently paid the money back.

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,519
Am I right?

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
What about Tiange Group?

131
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,959
That's a full hundred million investment.

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,759
Speaking of Tiange Group,

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,759
that matter is even bigger.

134
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,639
According to my contacts inside Tiange Group,

135
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,040
who have reliable information,

136
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,279
this guy

137
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,079
not only pretended to be Gao Feng in front of us,

138
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,279
but also outside,

139
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,399
he's been using Gao Feng's name to scam people everywhere.

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
Zhou Pengfei, the boss of Tiange Group,

141
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,920
was fooled by him for a moment.

142
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,560
He mistakenly thought he was the real Gao Feng.

143
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,560
That's why he invested.

144
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,480
A whole hundred million!

145
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,759
Kid,

146
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,680
do you know how serious this crime is?

147
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,800
Your friends don't sound very reliable.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,439
None of the information they gave you is accurate.

149
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,680
Keep pretending.

150
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,839
Go on, keep pretending.

151
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,399
Let me tell you,

152
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
I've already told Mr. Zhou

153
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,199
that you're a fake Gao Feng.

154
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,120
You,

155
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,800
just wait for your arrest warrant.

156
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,000
Young Master Song,

157
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,639
he really did swindle all this money.

158
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Of course.

159
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
I already told you all about his background.

160
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,800
He's not Gao Feng at all.

161
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,519
He's just a food delivery guy.

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,279
If you don't cut ties with him now,

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,279
in the Tiange Group fraud case,

164
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,639
you'll all be considered accomplices.

165
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,639
Ah.

166
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,040
Well, Su Qingyan, look at you.

167
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,240
Look at the trouble you've brought to our Su family.

168
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,879
I knew it.

169
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,240
That guy looks so shifty and unreliable.

170
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,279
He doesn't look important at all.

171
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,120
Turns out he's a scammer.

172
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Su Qingyan,

173
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,759
you brought him here.

174
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,199
You caused this mess.

175
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,920
It has nothing to do

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,319
with anyone else in the Su family.

177
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,639
If the Su family suffers any financial loss,

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,160
you'll be fully responsible.

179
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,720
Oh dear.

180
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Young Master Song,

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
thank goodness you arrived in time.

182
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,399
We were all deceived by him.

183
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,920
As for Tiange Group,

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,319
we'll need you, Young Master Song, to help explain things to them.

185
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,040
That's right.

186
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,759
Tiange Group and our Song family

187
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,360
do have some connections.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,639
If Su Qingyan marries me,

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
then of course it's my responsibility.

190
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,120
But right now...

191
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,800
Marry? Of course she should marry.

192
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,399
We have always supported

193
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,879
the marriage between Young Master Song and Qingyan.

194
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,439
It's just that Qingyan was definitely

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,439
deceived by this impostor.

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,279
That's why Qingyan was confused for a moment.

197
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,519
So, is the engagement between our two families

198
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,959
still valid now?

199
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,839
It's valid.

200
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,160
Of course it's still valid.

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,160
Qingyan,

202
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,079
hurry and show your stance to Young Master Song.

203
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,759
Hurry up.

204
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,759
I will not marry him.

205
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,199
You ungrateful thing!

206
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,319
Still so stubborn even now.

207
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,399
Do you know

208
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,480
how much trouble he has caused our Su family?

209
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
No matter how much trouble,

210
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,439
I will take all the responsibility myself.

211
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,560
You...

212
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,319
Wife,

213
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
don't worry.

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,319
Don't listen to their nonsense.

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,879
We won't have any trouble.

216
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,120
You, Gao,

217
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,360
you're still being stubborn.

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,839
You don't accept this, do you?

219
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,920
Fine.

220
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,959
Then let's go to Mr. Zhou

221
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,839
and confront each other face to face.

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,519
Mr. Zhou

223
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,200
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou

224
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
Why did you come out to greet us yourself?

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,039
Gao

226
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,159
Mr. Gao, Ms. Su

227
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,679
Welcome to both of you again, sorry for not greeting you sooner.

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,799
Sorry for not greeting you sooner.

229
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,080
Mr. Zhou

230
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
Actually, I came here today

231
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,159
to return your investment.

232
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,759
Return it?

233
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,039
Ms. Su

234
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,320
If there's anything we did wrong,

235
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,080
please feel free to let us know.

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,799
But the money can't be returned.

237
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,879
Mr. Zhou

238
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,519
Did you hear

239
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
that my husband is Gao Feng?

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,919
Well, um...

241
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,440
I suppose so.

242
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,240
I've heard about it.

243
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm very sorry.

244
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
Actually, my husband is not Gao Feng.

245
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,000
Not Gao Feng?

246
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,799
Mr. Zhou, I'm truly sorry.

247
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,679
I regret having misled you.

248
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,519
So,

249
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,559
today I'll return all the investment funds

250
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,879
to your account.

251
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,799
Also,

252
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,080
for any losses this caused you,

253
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,279
I will do my best to compensate.

254
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,159
Then...

255
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,600
This...

256
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,679
So, this...

257
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,480
Is it true or not, then?

258
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,240
Honey,

259
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,279
You misunderstood.

260
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,919
The investment from Mr. Zhou

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,279
has nothing to do with whether or not I'm Gao Feng.

262
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,279
He simply believes in you.

263
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,360
Mr. Zhou,

264
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,360
am I right?

265
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,200
Yes, yes, that's right.

266
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,080
Mr. Gao and I hit it off right away.

267
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,919
Mr. Gao and I hit it off right away.

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,159
I wish we'd met sooner—it's truly my good fortune.

269
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,960
Mr. Su,

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,799
you don't need to return a single cent of the investment.

271
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,720
If necessary,

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
our company Tiange can even invest more.

273
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,320
No,

274
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,000
Mr. Zhou,

275
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,159
aren't you mistaken?

276
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,679
This person isn't Gao Feng at all.

277
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,879
He's a fraud.

278
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,240
He's just a food delivery guy.

279
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,600
Screw you!

280
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
Who do you think you are?

281
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,639
Matters of Tiange

282
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,240
are none of your business.

283
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,000
Let me tell you,

284
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,960
no matter who Mr. Gao really is,

285
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
Tiange is investing, no matter what.

286
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,639
What?
