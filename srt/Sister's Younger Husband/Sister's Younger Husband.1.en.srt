00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,230
Chicken House

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,530
Spicy Grilled Chicken

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,780
Karaoke

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,300
Your order is ready

5
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:26,673
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,230
Mi-yeon.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,800
How long have you been
living with that guy?

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,870
Don't call him 'that guy'

9
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,728
He's my big sister's husband.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,290
I know, but...

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,510
Isn’t it uncomfortable
living with your brother-in-law?

12
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:44,125
Not at all.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,708
He sometimes feels like my
younger brother.

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,770
You know that rents are
expensive these days.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,560
But still...

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,770
Isn't it awkward
to live with your brother-in-law?

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,120
What's awkward?

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,500
He's such a good person
and is really nice to me.

19
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,643
And also, he's really fit

20
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,948
Oh my god, what are you saying?

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,050
My sister said
he turns into a beast in bed.

22
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,906
- Really?
- Yeah

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,830
Did you say that
he's is younger than you?

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah, he's two years younger than me.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,460
You're sister is such a lucky person.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,140
That's what I mean.

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,420
I’m in my thirties and
still don’t have a boyfriend.

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,070
Maybe it’s time
I just move out of that house.

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,100
You really should move out
and begin meeting guys.

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,960
That's what I hope too.

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,470
With that in mind, shall we cheers?

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,260
Sure!

33
00:01:51,510 --> 00:02:00,320
My Sassy Brother

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,610
Why is she so late?

35
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,110
Mi-yeon!

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,790
What time is it right now?

37
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:22,663
Don't you know that
it's dangerous at late night?

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,200
Si-yeon, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,200
I was drinking with my colleague.

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,510
I'm not mad that you drank.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,750
Why didn't you answer my call?

42
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,740
Why use a phone
if you won’t answer calls?

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,440
Si-yeon, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,050
Alright, shower and go sleep.

45
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,120
Did Ms. Mi-yeon return?

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,890
Yes, Tae-min

47
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,725
She’s your sister-in-law,
just call her by her name.

48
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,860
I'm not used to it yet.

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,810
Mi-yeon and Tae-min.

50
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,630
I'll go to my room now.

51
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,750
Okay, Ms. Mi-yeon.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,380
Oh, come on.

53
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,770
Alright, I get it.

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,020
When are you going to fix the doorknob?

55
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:12,085
It's been ages since I asked.

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,220
I'll fix it tomorrow.

57
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,450
It's not as easy as you think.

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,720
But I bought a new doorknob already.

59
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,510
Let's go take a shower.

60
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,900
It feels so good.

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

62
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,273
- Babe.
- Yeah?

63
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,873
It feels so good.

64
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:31,013
- Does it feel that good?
- Yes.

65
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,223
Here we go again.

66
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,373
Tae-min.

67
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,553
Tae-min!

68
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,873
It feels so good.

69
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,792
- Really?
- Yes.

70
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,893
You're making me lose control.

71
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,974
You're so amazing.

72
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:22,358
Am I?

73
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,513
Boss, I'm sorry.

74
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:24,392
There were a lot of...

75
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm sorry, boss.

76
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,890
I'm almost there.

77
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,700
Yes, boss...

78
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,423
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

79
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,000
Ms. Mi-yeon?

80
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,930
Tae-min!

81
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,165
Is your office around here?

82
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,560
Yes, what about you?

83
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,940
I have a meeting with a client nearby.

84
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,990
I see.

85
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,680
I’m sorry, but I’m in a hurry right now.

86
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,170
Thank you.

87
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,910
See you later at home.

88
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,170
Ms. Mi-yeon.

89
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,936
Yes?

90
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,910
Since it's almost time
to leave from work.

91
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,192
Why don't we have dinner together?

92
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,449
Si-yeon is meeting her friends tonight.

93
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,910
Sure.

94
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,130
Then I'll call you after work.

95
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,290
Alright, then I'll be waiting nearby.

96
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,345
Okay.

97
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,350
Are you sure this is enough for dinner?

98
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,430
I wanted to grab a drink
because my day was really stressful.

99
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,689
Alright.

100
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,460
It's so refreshing.

101
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,770
Do you drink often?

102
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,660
Well, don't you know?

103
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,350
I actually do know.

104
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,030
By the way,

105
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,430
why do you keep calling me?
'Ms. Mi-yeon'?

106
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,890
Because you're older than me.

107
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,570
I knew it.

108
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,586
You must be uncomfortable with me
because I'm older.

109
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,550
- Isn't that right?
- No.

110
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,450
That's not what I meant.

111
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,290
But still...

112
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,700
I want you to talk casually with me.

113
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,940
I'll do so later in the future.

114
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,165
'In the future'?

115
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
But it's been two years already.

116
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:38,392
Two years?

117
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,512
That's right, two years.

118
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,590
Tae-min.

119
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,470
- Yes?
- Sleep with me.

120
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:09,795
I'm sorry?

121
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,290
I want to sleep with you.

122
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,399
We can't do this, this isn't right.

123
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,480
Ms. Mi-yeon.

124
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,410
Ms. Mi-yeon?

125
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,886
Yes?

126
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
Are you alright?

127
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,990
You're sweating a lot.

128
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,490
Oh, I know that.

129
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,010
I'm fine.

130
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,170
I guess I'm not feeling well.

131
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,960
Then let's leave.

132
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,820
You should take some rest at home.

133
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,090
I'm sorry, Tae-min.

134
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,290
It's fine.

135
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,780
Let's go home now.

136
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll use the restroom before leaving.

137
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,530
Sure, I'll wait for you outside.

138
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,616
Okay.

139
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,620
What am I thinking?

140
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,010
What's wrong with me?

141
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,190
What should I do?

142
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,210
I'll do it myself.

143
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,540
But I really don't have a fever.

144
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,510
I'm just worried.

145
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,160
Let's just have a quick check.

146
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,450
You do have a slight fever.

147
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,514
But it's not that serious.

148
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,970
What about Si-yeon?

149
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,970
She's not home yet.

150
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,990
I think she'll be back soon.

151
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,470
I'll leave now, take some rest.

152
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,010
Tae-min.

153
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,745
Yes?

154
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,050
Should I get you water?

155
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,610
No.

156
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,300
I'm just...

157
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,890
Sorry for making you uncomfortable.

158
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,550
Because I'm older than you

159
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,350
and also is living in the same house.

160
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,060
Don't say that.

161
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,310
You're just Si-yeon's sister.

162
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,290
But I'm not her real sister.

163
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,730
Don't say that.

164
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,510
Si-yeon and I never think like that.

165
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,000
Get some sleep now.

166
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,650
Sorry for bothering.

167
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,370
And also, thank you.

168
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,026
Alright.

169
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,930
Good night.

170
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,190
Mi-yeon.

171
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,989
Did you just call me 'Mi-yeon'?

172
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,010
This is embarrassing.

173
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,030
You should really sleep now.

174
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,566
- Should I turn the lights off?
- No, you don't have to.

175
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,140
Just leave it on.

176
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,080
Alright, then.

177
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,540
Go to the gym!

178
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,690
Workout at the gym.

179
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,640
What if the neighbor complains?

180
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,660
That's not as easy as you think.

181
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,030
I work overtime almost everyday.

182
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,290
Going to the gym is
just a waste of money.

183
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,830
Am I not right, Mi-yeon?

184
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,143
What?

185
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,740
Oh, that's right.

186
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,900
Fine, I give up.

187
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,540
Wait a minute.

188
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,390
'Mi-yeon'?

189
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,363
When did you start calling her
by her name?

190
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,575
- Since today.
- Oh, I see.

191
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,029
'Since today'?

192
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:50,189
You're silly.

193
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,750
So, have you decided
to call me by my name?

194
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,495
Only when Si-yeon is around.

195
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,310
It's time to eat breakfast.

196
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,130
Why don't we go for a drive
since it's the weekend?

197
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,340
- Sounds good.
- What about me?

198
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,270
You should take a shower.

199
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,850
You're going nowhere like that.

200
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,965
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,690
Today's main dish is the special soup.

202
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,273
Wow!

203
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,100
I haven't had a weekend off in ages.

204
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:29,903
Were you that busy?

205
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,035
Yes.

206
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,777
I always worked even in the weekends.

207
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:36,482
I'm glad that I brought you with us.

208
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,210
By the way, where are we going?

209
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,586
It's a place where Si-yeon and I
went occasionally before we got married.

210
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,920
It's a perfect place for relaxing.

211
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm really excited for it.

212
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:49,315
Si-yeon.

213
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,713
She sleeps so much
that she always sits in the back.

214
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,632
Is that why she's energetic at night?

215
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,890
What do you mean by that?

216
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,290
Tae-min, don't pretend you don't know.

217
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,730
- Tae-min.
- Mi-yeon.

218
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Go ahead.

219
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,250
It's okay, you can talk first.

220
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,980
How's your job been lately?

221
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,110
I'm considering a job change these days.

222
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,280
Good thinking.

223
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,290
What about working with me?

224
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,200
What in particular?

225
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,870
My client offered me to go quit
my current job and work independently.

226
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,730
The client's company isn't small.

227
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,300
They also promised me a steady support.

228
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,880
But I think it’d be tough
to handle everything alone.

229
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,730
That's good for you.

230
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,310
Does Si-yeon know about this?

231
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,830
Not yet.

232
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,900
I will tell her later today.

233
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,240
What do you think?

234
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,860
Could you give me a hand?

235
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,760
Well...

236
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,760
Sure, when should I start?

237
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,360
Yoorim Island Resort.

238
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,790
- It's really nice.
- Is it?

239
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,980
Yeah.

240
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,420
It's a nice place.

241
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,260
They also have private spas.

242
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,610
Really?

243
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,330
But I guess it's for the two of you.

244
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,770
I'm good.

245
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,210
You two can use it together.

246
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,850
That's right, Mi-yeon.

247
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,000
It’s nice to be back after a while.

248
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,450
Si-yeon, let's unpack our stuff first.

249
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:03,505
Alright.

250
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,510
I'll use the first floor,
you two can use the second floor.

251
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,580
Don't you two have to stay together?

252
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,130
No, it's fine.

253
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,730
Since we're on a holiday.

254
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,550
you two should spend time together.

255
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
That's right.

256
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,630
Let's catch up and have a drink together.

257
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,790
That sounds good.

258
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,330
Anyways, after getting some rest.

259
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,830
Let's meet up at the first floor.

260
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,530
Alright, Tae-min!

261
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,340
That's why my face was
so swollen that day.

262
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,050
Oh my god.

263
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,080
What a shame.

264
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,310
- Have some barbecue pork.
- Okay.

265
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,090
I wonder what made me
act like that back then.

266
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,190
It's so good.

267
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,920
My husband is the
best at grilling barbecues.

268
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,860
Stop bragging about your husband.

269
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,210
"My husband is the best!"

270
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,160
Babe, come here and have a drink.

271
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,310
Should I?

272
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,730
You should give the toast.

273
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,010
Cheers to our first trip together.

274
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:13,435
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

275
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,030
It's so refreshing.

276
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,060
I was wondering all of a sudden...

277
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:28,435
Mi-yeon, didn't you also
want to study abroad like Si-yeon?

278
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,590
Why ask such thing and ruin the vibe?

279
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:34,063
Si-yeon, I'm fine.

280
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,630
Honestly speaking, I
wanted to study abroad.

281
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,470
But my parents were a bit against it.

282
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,660
They couldn't afford
to send both of us to study abroad.

283
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm always sorry about that yo Mi-yeon.

284
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't be sorry.

285
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,266
Of course,
the biological child comes first.

286
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,240
I told you to not say that.

287
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,930
Did you?

288
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,000
I shouldn’t have asked that.

289
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,430
If you know that,
stop saying useless stuff

290
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,130
and go grill some more barbecue.

291
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,170
Yes ma'am!

292
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,210
There's plenty, so have a lot.

293
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,480
It's so good to eat outside.

294
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,990
It feels so nice.

295
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,820
- Si-yeon.
- Yes?

296
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,280
Now I get why Tae-min likes you a lot.

297
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,890
What do you mean?

298
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,540
Because you're breasts are really firm.

299
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,770
Stop embarrassing me.

300
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,540
Is it that good every night?

301
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,650
Did you hear everything?

302
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,900
How could I not when we
live in the same house?

303
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,360
You should also get yourself a boyfriend.

304
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,050
I know that.

305
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,440
Anyways...

306
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,580
What makes you moan
that loudly every night?

307
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,950
Do you really want to know?

308
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,810
He's so good at this.

309
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,580
That's it?

310
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,570
Of course not,
then he becomes really gently.

311
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,360
He slowly strokes my body.

312
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,370
Then he suddenly bursts in!

313
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,920
Wait.

314
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,220
Are you aroused right now?

315
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,030
What are you talking about?

316
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,870
Then why are your nipples like this?

317
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,010
What do you mean?

318
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,250
Look how stiff they are!

319
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,210
What about Si-yeon?

320
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,200
She's sleeping from tiredness.

321
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,700
She's already tired?

322
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,450
We had some fun together.

323
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,130
Do you want some coffee?

324
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,200
Sure.

325
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,720
It's really good.

326
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,610
Ms. Mi-yeon,
why don't you date anyone?

327
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm not sure.

328
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,420
I think I forgot how to date someone.

329
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,730
I feel like I don't know guys anymore.

330
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,250
You're a better person than you think.

331
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,750
- You're cool.
- I'm sorry?

332
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,730
You heard me, Tae-min.

333
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,960
I know that.

334
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,670
I'm just kidding.

335
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,610
I really mean it, Tae-min.

336
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,250
But...

337
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,520
This isn't right.

338
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,770
I'm sorry.

339
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,100
I couldn't help it.

340
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,500
I'll leave first.

341
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Mi-yeon, you're here.

342
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,430
Hi, Tae-min.

343
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,580
When did you leave home for work?

344
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,480
It's only 8:30 in the morning.

345
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,930
I had some papers to sort.

346
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,800
Also, I came early to start
working with you exactly at 9 o'clock.

347
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,330
No wonder you're the CEO.

348
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,350
What about some morning coffee
since we have some time left?

349
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,380
Sounds good.

350
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,050
Here you go.

351
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,090
It’s an instant coffee that tastes
just like an iced americano.

352
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,730
Tae-min, you seem really happy today.

353
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,510
Of course I am.

354
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,600
Today is the start of
chapter two of my life.

355
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,370
How did Si-yeon react
to you quitting your previous job?

356
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,840
She went silent after I
showed her the deposit of the contract.

357
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,240
I knew it.

358
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,730
Mi-yeon.

359
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,440
Would it make you
uncomfortable to work with me?

360
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,190
Not at all.

361
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,380
Don't worry.

362
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,170
It's tough from the first day.

363
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,570
I think I should get paid more.

364
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,290
Don't worry about that.

365
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,840
Let's wrap up and leave.

366
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,470
Dinner's on me today.

367
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,290
This feels strange.

368
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,380
It feels like I'm being
treated by my little brother.

369
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,850
Your 'little brother'?

370
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,950
Fine.

371
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,590
I'll treat you like my bigger sister today.

372
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,360
Let's go, I'm in a good mood.

373
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,780
What about Si-yeon?

374
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,600
She's busy these days.

375
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,670
She said she's learning
pilates or something.

376
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,290
Si-yeon's always doing something new.

377
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,060
Sis, let's go now.

378
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,880
Yes, sir.

379
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,530
Lift up your right leg

380
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,350
You are really flexible.

381
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,570
Oh, really?

382
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,620
How old are you?

383
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:37,783
That’s an inappropriate
question to ask a woman.

384
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,460
I'm 32 years old.

385
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,300
I thought you were younger than me.

386
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,950
Stop being sarcastic.

387
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,850
I really mean it.

388
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,440
Do you?

389
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,910
- Can I trust you?
- Yes, of course!

390
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,480
Now, let's change your posture.

391
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,480
- Please do the 'Cat Cow Pose'
- The 'Cat Cow Pose'?

392
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,310
How about you?

393
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,300
How old are you?

394
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,800
I'm 28 years old.

395
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,896
Really?

396
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,080
You're the same age as my husband.

397
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,070
You're married?

398
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,620
To a guy younger than you?

399
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,630
Wow.

400
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,410
That's impressive, sis.

401
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,970
Younger men are more my type.

402
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,270
Older women are my type as well.

403
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,170
What are you doing?

404
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,440
Didn’t I mention that I’m married?

405
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,130
That is what...

406
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,700
Makes you more attractive.

407
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,130
This doesn't seem right at all.

408
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,450
Si-yeon.

409
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,450
If you don't mind...

410
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,560
I would like to apologize.

411
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,010
You were just so captivating.

412
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,790
I'm sorry.

413
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,570
There’s still plenty of time left.

414
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,800
So let’s finish what we were doing.

415
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,760
Alright.

416
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,999
Please look forward.

417
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,620
Lift your arms.

418
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,780
Raise your left leg.

419
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:06,025
Hey.

420
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,058
You taste amazing.

421
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:13,315
Mr. Min-hyeok.

422
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:17,705
How many more days
do we have left in our class?

423
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:21,305
We still have...

424
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:24,693
Five more days left.

425
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:29,425
I'll work harder.

426
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,738
Alright.

427
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:50,875
Yes, honey.

428
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:52,295
Who?

429
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:54,405
Hye-jin?

430
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:56,915
Of course, isn't she your college friend?

431
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:00,415
Is this something spontaneous?

432
00:46:02,265 --> 00:46:03,865
It is what is is.

433
00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:06,855
You can't even cancel it, right?

434
00:46:09,195 --> 00:46:12,565
Alright, then have fun
and enjoy your time.

435
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:17,628
I'll perhaps spend time
with Mi-yeon in the weekend.

436
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:21,165
Don't worry about us.

437
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,084
Enjoy your time.

438
00:46:23,185 --> 00:46:24,585
Call me before coming.

439
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:27,225
Alright, bye.

440
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,585
What did Si-yeon say?

441
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:35,725
She's going to Jeju Island
with her friends.

442
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:36,995
But when?

443
00:46:37,385 --> 00:46:39,585
- Today.
- Right today?

444
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:42,922
- Suddenly?
- I know

445
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:44,715
For how long?

446
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:46,985
Five days.

447
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:48,915
That's pretty long.

448
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:54,505
Tae-min, I'll go to the print shop
to check the proofs.

449
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:58,655
After finish checking them,
I'll go home right away.

450
00:46:58,725 --> 00:46:59,825
Alright.

451
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:01,755
See you at home then.

452
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:03,945
Alright, see you later.

453
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,235
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:17,105
Tae-min.

455
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,305
I'm back.

456
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,925
- Was everything alright?
- Yeah.

457
00:47:25,255 --> 00:47:27,215
I checked the proof and placed the order.

458
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:30,375
It should be delivered by Tuesday.

459
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:33,195
Seems like you’re a professional now.

460
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:36,835
But I think I’ve got more
experience than you.

461
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,505
So we’re bringing up age again?

462
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:41,825
I'm just kidding.

463
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,625
I'll go take a shower first.

464
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:48,025
Since it’s already late,
how about we order dinner?

465
00:47:48,105 --> 00:47:49,145
Sounds good.

466
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:51,405
Chicken or Braised Pork?

467
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:53,255
Or maybe Ja-jang-myeon?

468
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:55,015
Anything is fine.

469
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,985
Then let's have fried chicken with beer.

470
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:58,871
Sounds good.

471
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:19,325
Has Si-yeon ever acted like this before?

472
00:48:19,865 --> 00:48:22,195
I don't think so.

473
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:26,765
Isn't five days too long
for a trip to Jeju Island?

474
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:29,485
I guess she's visiting Mara Island as well.

475
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:32,575
Stop joking, I'm serious right now.

476
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:35,545
What’s there to doubt?

477
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,785
It would be kind of strange
if I called Hye-jin and check.

478
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,015
That's right.

479
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,605
But there's something fishy about Si-yeon.

480
00:48:46,265 --> 00:48:49,615
Women have what’s called 'instincts'.

481
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:52,425
Then why doesn’t Si-yeon know?

482
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,605
Know what?

483
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,605
About us.

484
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:12,485
I'm sorry.

485
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:15,085
I shouldn't have said that.

486
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,655
It's fine, what you said is true.

487
00:49:17,995 --> 00:49:19,785
But I still shouldn't have said that.

488
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:21,455
I'm sorry.

489
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:25,355
I'm really full now.

490
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:27,665
- I'll need some rest.
- Mi-yeon.

491
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:29,145
Mi-yeon!

492
00:50:04,945 --> 00:50:06,555
I'm scared.

493
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:08,705
Scared of what?

494
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:13,875
Of what we're doing right now.

495
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:19,485
But staying with you like this
feels so comforting.

496
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:35,515
Tae-min.

497
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,795
Please put it inside me.

498
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:06,138
Can I finish inside?

499
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:07,959
No, you can't.

500
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:11,609
It's coming.

501
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:13,949
Please, can I finish inside?

502
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:18,109
Alright.

503
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,289
Go ahead.

504
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,009
Express Print Shop

505
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,630
Tae-min.

506
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:41,805
There was an issue with the colors.

507
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,610
The color correction is done,
and the order has been placed.

508
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,874
So don't worry.

509
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:47,504
Okay.

510
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,167
I'll see you back in the office.

511
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,890
Bene Hotel

512
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,060
Mi-yeon.

513
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,290
What's the matter?

514
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,030
Why didn't you return to the office?

515
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,320
I have something to talk about.

516
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,070
What is it?

517
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,580
I think we should stop now.

518
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,720
But why suddenly?

519
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,660
I can't do this to my sister.

520
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,860
- But that's...
- Si-yeon...

521
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,900
Si-yeon has another guy.

522
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,120
When I saw Si-yeon with another guy.

523
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,900
I felt like I’m just as bad as the guy.

524
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,250
I can't do this anymore.

525
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,290
Si-yeon didn't go to Jeju Island.

526
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,590
What?

527
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,190
I called her friend the next day to ask.

528
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,100
She said that
they never went to Jeju Island.

529
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,130
Then you knew everything
from the beginning?

530
00:58:21,155 --> 00:58:22,155
Yeah.

531
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,460
Then why didn't you tell me?

532
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,220
Because I'm happier now.

533
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,150
I'm happier when I'm with you.

534
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:41,840
But we're still doing
something that isn't right.

535
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,420
I heard something from Si-yeon.

536
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,050
Did you know that
Si-yeon was also adopted like you?

537
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,276
What?

538
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,940
No way.

539
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,610
Your mother was infertile.

540
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,860
So she adopted
both you and your sister.

541
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,030
Since when did Si-Yeon know that?

542
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:14,700
She knew it from the beginning.

543
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,390
But why was I the only one
treated as an adopted child?

544
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,800
She didn't want anyone to know
that she was an adopted child.

545
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,030
Not even you.

546
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,750
You know that she has a lot of ambition.

547
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,820
That's why she probably wanted everything.

548
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,750
College, studying abroad,

549
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,600
and even all the love from her parents.

550
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,600
That's why I think you were the one
who ended up all alone.

551
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,500
This is too harsh for me.

552
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,160
I know.

553
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,330
That's why you should
live for yourself now.

554
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,180
Starting from now.

555
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,350
What about you?

556
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:33,200
I will part ways with Si-yeon.

557
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:37,370
I'm yours now.

558
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:53,770
Alright.

559
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:56,260
Thank you.

560
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,520
See you later at home.

561
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,550
I'll get going first.

562
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,680
Tae-min, wait a minute.

563
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,920
Did you say that Si-yeon is
going to a workshop tomorrow?

564
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,520
That's right, but why?

565
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,710
It's nothing.

566
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,500
I'll see you later at home.

567
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,830
Alright.

568
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:28,930
See you later.

569
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,290
I should arrive tomorrow
around dinner time.

570
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,250
Let's go out to eat once I’m back.

571
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,820
Don't worry about
that and go have fun.

572
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:49,150
Are you preparing for a Pilates
competition or something?

573
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,400
Bingo!

574
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,260
You're not ready yet.

575
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,770
Safe travel.

576
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,830
I'll find a place for tomorrow's dinner.

577
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,510
Thank you.

578
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:00,050
But tomorrow's dinner is on me.

579
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:02,660
You'll be late, just go already.

580
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,460
- Alright, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

581
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,220
Tae-min.

582
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,290
You're such a great actor.

583
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,180
Was I?

584
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,560
What do you want to eat?

585
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,200
You.

586
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,170
Why did you want to do it here
and not in your room?

587
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,950
Because I wanted to.

588
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:05,090
I wanted to do it in the room
where you slept with Si-yeon.

589
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,840
Who's better?

590
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,810
Me, or my sister?

591
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,370
You're much better.

592
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,666
Like this?

593
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,370
I'm already feeling it.

594
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,180
Slow down.

595
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,510
Do you want to change?

596
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,590
Yeah.

597
01:04:39,282 --> 01:04:40,412
Do you like it?

598
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:47,011
I love you.

599
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:48,392
I love you too.

600
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:19,697
Oh, yes.

601
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:30,316
I guess you have to leave this house soon.

602
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:33,309
I think so too.

603
01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:39,469
That would be the best for
both my sister and us.

604
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:44,529
Actually, I got a new house already.

605
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,649
I'm planning to move out in two days.

606
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,755
That was quick.

607
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:54,409
Isn't it too sudden?

608
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:59,802
I was going to bring it up
during dinner tomorrow.

609
01:07:14,455 --> 01:07:19,039
That way, we can be a bit more free.

610
01:07:20,349 --> 01:07:22,789
But I still think it's too sudden.

611
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:33,979
I love you.

612
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:36,459
I love you too.

613
01:08:51,972 --> 01:08:53,402
It’s your greed...

614
01:08:56,059 --> 01:08:57,819
That made me like this.

615
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:25,189
Mi-yeon.

616
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:28,719
Si-yeon, come back home right now!

617
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:32,249
I think Tae-min is really sick.

618
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,529
It's urgent!

619
01:10:22,373 --> 01:10:23,733
Finally...

620
01:10:25,349 --> 01:10:26,809
It's all over.
