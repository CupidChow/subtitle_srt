1
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
AN UNRESTRAINED SOUL
IS FREE WHEREVER IT GOES. FREEDOM

2
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,560
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,280
Are you the famous sculptor?

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,600
FIRST COMBINED ESPORTS ARENA
AND ESCAPE ROOM OPENS

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,440
This is where I lost sight
of Shanwen and Tingting the other day.

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,560
A weird man was following me that day.

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,760
He's the owner of the internet cafe.

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,440
He seems to have a sinister motive.

9
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,080
He looks very suspicious.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,240
What if Shanwen gets harmed like Sera?

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,800
Let's call the police.

12
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,280
Why do you always assume
the worst-case scenario?

13
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
It may not be what you think.

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Aren't you worried at all?

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,759
This man is the last person Shanwen saw!

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,600
Can you not be so rash?
Let's try looking for him first.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,640
That's the whole point
of calling the police!

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,440
- Ruoyun. Ruoyun.
- I don't care!

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm calling the police.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
Shanwen has been missing
for more than 12 hours now.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,440
I can't let anything happen
to my only child.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,280
- I'll go with you.
- It's fine.

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
This is a family matter. We'll handle it.
I appreciate your help.

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
In that case,

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,320
I'll inform you immediately
if I hear from Tingting.

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Thank you.

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,720
Officer.

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,920
We've filed a case for you.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
Go home and wait for updates.

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,320
Don't look for us anymore.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,760
I suspect that my son is in danger.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Who else am I supposed to look for?

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Young people often run away from home.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,720
It's unlikely that anything bad
would happen to them.

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,000
How are you so sure about that?

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,960
Can I only look for you
if I find a dismembered body?

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,800
Before your son left home,
did anything happen?

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,000
- Allan.
- What?

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm sorry. What did you say?

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,960
I asked if anything had happened
before your son left home.

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,240
Nothing significant happened.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,080
I arrived home late last night.
I thought that he was in bed.

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,800
I only realized later
that he wasn't in his room.

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,240
The owner of the internet cafe
is the serial killer!

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,440
Do you have any evidence?

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,840
It's my instinct. A mother's instinct!

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm sorry,

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Mrs. Shaw,

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
we can't do our job
based on instinct alone.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,320
We'll investigate the internet cafe.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,880
Please go home and wait for our updates.

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,560
I'll go with you!

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
That's enough.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,320
I can't go home without finding our son!

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You won't be of much help anyway
if you tag along.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
Thank you.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
Let's go. Come on.

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,240
Please inform us immediately
if there are any updates.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,520
Please have faith in us.

60
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
Thank you. Come on.

61
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,120
Mr. Sun seems to be hiding something.

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,560
It's yet another tightly guarded secret.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
I want to go home for a while.

64
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
I just want to search for any clues
in Shanwen's room.

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,680
I won't stay for long.

66
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,120
It's still your home after all.

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,920
You can come back anytime you wish.

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
‪Hey.

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,200
Why is the frame broken?

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,440
Is that so?

71
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Didn't you go to his room?

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
There are glass shards all over the floor.

73
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,000
Didn't you notice?

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,880
I was probably too tired
and didn't notice it.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll get him a new one.

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,880
I'll leave now.

77
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,760
If you wish to stay and wait
for Shanwen to come home,

78
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
I have no objections.

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,560
I think I'll head back first.

80
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,600
Inform me immediately
if there's any news of him.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
DID YOU RECEIVE MY LETTER?

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,760
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE VIDEO?

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040
DO YOU STILL THINK
YOUR DAUGHTER IS A GOOD GIRL?

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,480
It's hard to get a cab on a Saturday.

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
Do you need a lift?

86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
What video is this?

87
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,640
What is this letter talking about?

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,360
How is this related to Sera?

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,000
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,800
What do you mean you don't know?

91
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
What video is this?

92
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,840
"Do you still think
your daughter is a good girl?"

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,280
- What is it talking about?
- I already told you I don't know.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,080
Sun Allan, you always say
not to trust two types of people.

95
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,280
The first type is people you know,

96
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
and the second is people you don't know.

97
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,000
I know you all too well.

98
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,640
I can't communicate with you.

99
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
We've been married for more than 20 years.
I know you too well!

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,560
Go home!

101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,240
Does Shanwen's disappearance
have anything to do with this video?

102
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,840
Tell me now!

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
Don't shut the door!

104
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Sun Allan!

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,080
That year, I asked you
why Sera scolded you!

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,480
You didn't tell me or explain yourself!

107
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,280
Why are you still treating me
this way after all these years?

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Open the door!

109
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Come out, you coward!

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,160
Sun Allan! Open the door!

111
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
Our son ordered your favorite laksa.

112
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
You like eating this too.

114
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,520
You never let me bring you
to a restaurant.

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,080
Dad, Mom, here's your coffee.

116
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
It doesn't matter where we eat
as long as you're eating with us.

117
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,880
That's the most important thing.

118
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,080
Why spend money at a restaurant?

119
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
We used to cook for our customers
at the hawker center.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,360
We're the customers now.

121
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,640
It's our way of supporting them.

122
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,640
It's only right to do so.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,080
Guoguang, has work been tough?

124
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
You lost so much weight.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Son,

126
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
what's the matter?

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm fine.

128
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,480
Dad,

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,960
why did you name me Guoguang?

130
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,400
I wanted you to do our country proud.

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
If I don't do that, am I a disappointment?

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,520
There's no need for that.

133
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,720
We don't need you to be so capable.

134
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,840
We'll be happy
as long as you are healthy and happy.

135
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

136
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,080
The most important thing
is to have a conscience.

137
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,039
Don't harm anyone or anything.

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,920
As for things like wealth and status,
they're not important.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,160
Do you understand?

140
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,720
Why are you talking like
he's a very useless person?

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
He's a policeman.

142
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,080
What policeman?

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,880
He's a police officer!

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't pretend to be moody.

145
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
Why did you ask to meet me?

146
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,880
It's such a hot day. What is it?

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,800
Hurry up!

148
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,280
That night,

149
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
you asked me
what the most important thing to me was.

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm not interested.

151
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,080
I once had a dream.

152
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,840
I wanted to become a basketball player
and represent the country.

153
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,200
I was the best player in school.

154
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,960
However, I had an adversary.

155
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
His father was
a well-known police superintendent.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,040
He was wealthy…

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
and powerful.

158
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,680
But he wasn't as skilled as me.

159
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,200
However, he was chosen by the school
for the national team.

160
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,720
From that day onward, I was determined…

161
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,760
to become a police superintendent
at least.

162
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,920
I wanted to have money…

163
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
and power.

164
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,680
I wanted to become a big tree…

165
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,280
to provide shelter for my parents…

166
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,600
and my future children.

167
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
You're out of your mind.

168
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,320
You'll get struck by lightning
if you hide under a tree on a rainy day!

169
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,920
You should be providing shade
and bearing fruits!

170
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
You're right.

171
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,200
It turns out I've always been wrong.

172
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
I've been wrong from the start.

173
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
Sir…

174
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
I want to tell you the truth.

175
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,040
<i>I remember that day.</i>

176
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
<i>It was the eve of my graduation</i>
<i>from the police academy.</i>

177
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,920
<i>My father called me.</i>

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,080
<i>My mother had a stroke</i>
<i>and fainted at the stall.</i>

179
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,200
<i>I was speeding toward the hospital.</i>

180
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,520
<i>Around a month later,</i>

181
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
<i>I ran into her again.</i>

182
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,560
Hey. I'm not going tonight.
They're too strict.

183
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
I have an idea.

184
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Hey.

185
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,720
Remember me?

186
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
If you keep me company all night,

187
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll delete this video.

188
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,920
Ladies, I need your help.

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
My little sister there
didn't bring her identification card.

190
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,240
Can you help her?

191
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
Is she your sister?

192
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,280
Does she look like my mother?

193
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,240
You're a funny guy.

194
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,880
Sure. She can go in.

195
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
- Really?
- Of course.

196
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,080
Do I look like someone who tells lies?

197
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,240
Remember to treat me
to some drinks after returning my card.

198
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
It's a done deal.

199
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,160
You'll have to keep me company all night.

200
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,400
Go faster!

201
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,600
I've exceeded the speed limit.

202
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,800
You were speeding last month too.
Why are you scared this time?

203
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm free!

204
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,600
Don't worry. There's no CCTV here.
Come on!

205
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Climb over the gate.

206
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,440
What did you say?

207
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,080
- Isn't this your house?
- Climb over the gate.

208
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,520
Miss, I can go to jail for that.

209
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,000
What about being involved
in a hit-and-run, Mr. Policeman?

210
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,040
I found out that…

211
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,400
their CCTV and security systems
are both down.

212
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,600
You'll be free
once you complete the last mission.

213
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,400
Thank you for keeping me company
all night.

214
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey.

215
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,640
What's your name?

216
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,600
Can I…

217
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
see you again?

218
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
<i>I tried looking for her after that night.</i>

219
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,360
However, I never found her,
no matter how hard I tried.

220
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,520
When I saw her again,

221
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,600
all that was left
was a severely decomposed head.

222
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
You've done many stupid things,
you stupid man!

223
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Are you the father of Sera's unborn child?

224
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,360
Did you kill her
because of her underage pregnancy?

225
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,880
No! No way!

226
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,760
There's no way I would've done that!

227
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,480
I only found out she was pregnant
after she died!

228
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,840
You're a law enforcement officer!

229
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,480
Yet you committed a crime
and concealed information!

230
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
You had sex with a minor!

231
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,800
I didn't know she was barely 16 years old!

232
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,440
She told me she was turning 18
in a few months!

233
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,320
Go jump into the sea!

234
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,120
Sir!

235
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,440
I want to do a DNA test!

236
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,440
I want to know if the child is mine!

237
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
Master…

238
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,920
is the child mine?

239
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
Who…

240
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,440
is the child's father?

241
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,440
Will you forgive me?

242
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,840
Show us the internet cafe.

243
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,640
Sun Shanwen has gone missing.

244
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,160
The last people he interacted with
were you and your boss.

245
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,360
What did your boss say to you that day

246
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,000
that made you leave in such a hurry?

247
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,120
He didn't say anything.

248
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,280
It was the first time
he asked me to leave before him.

249
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,840
He offered to stay back and close up.

250
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,040
You said that your boss went overseas.
Where did he go?

251
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,240
He's the boss.
He wouldn't tell me these things.

252
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,080
Hey, Ruby. There's a package for you.

253
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
Hello, Sis Hua.

254
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
- The delivery is early today.
- That's right.

255
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,120
All right. Please sign here.

256
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,720
Master, I'll take a bathroom break.

257
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,160
Thank you.

258
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll take this, Ruby.

259
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,000
Why doesn't society give Paul
another chance?

260
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,840
He only stole supplements
for his grandfather,

261
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,400
and he even apologized in person later on.

262
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,400
He was sentenced to prison nonetheless.

263
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,320
It's really unfair.

264
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,400
I didn't expect the owner
to call the police either.

265
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,680
I also didn't expect that…

266
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
Paul would lie to me.

267
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,240
It wasn't his first time stealing.
He's a repeat offender.

268
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,920
Why did you insist
that he turn himself in?

269
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,760
Didn't you say that love conquers all?

270
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,320
Is this considered love conquering all?

271
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,440
This is a stipulated rule.

272
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,920
When I find out that the person
whom I'm counseling has committed a crime,

273
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm obliged to report it to the police.

274
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,960
If you knew
that he had stolen things before,

275
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,800
would you still have asked him
to turn himself in?

276
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,840
Sometimes,

277
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,120
we can only stay true
to what we think is the right thing to do.

278
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Do you think that I did something wrong?

279
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
I know.

280
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,480
You've been in a bad mood these past few
days because you're worried about Shanwen.

281
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,240
Is there still no news on him?

282
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,680
He'll be all right
because all of us will pray for him.

283
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,560
It's from Auntie Ruoyun.

284
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,000
She said that
she injured her leg while outside.

285
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll check on her.

286
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,120
She might have news about Shanwen.

287
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,160
Have your dinner.

288
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,240
SUN SHANWEN, SON OF SUN ALLAN
AND SHAW MAY, FOUND MISSING

289
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,760
GOH LESLIE:
RETRIBUTION FOR THEIR EVIL DEEDS

290
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,240
KOH EMILIA:
SHE LOVES BEING IN THE HEADLINES

291
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,800
SIM ALINA:
SHE'LL HOOK UP WITH ANOTHER SCION SOON

292
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
Hey, Ruoyun.

293
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,640
Are you all right?

294
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,600
I'm so sorry for troubling you again.

295
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,760
Don't worry about it.

296
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,960
Did you injure yourself?

297
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,520
Oh, your ankle?

298
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,840
It must hurt a lot.

299
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,080
How did you end up here?

300
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,760
How did you injure yourself?

301
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,280
I was waiting for DD to show up,

302
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,840
but I got the wrong person.

303
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,520
He pushed me, and I injured myself.

304
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,440
How long have you been waiting here?

305
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,440
I was still worried
after calling the police yesterday,

306
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,680
so I came here by myself.

307
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,880
Besides coming here,

308
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,800
I didn't know what else I could do.

309
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,520
Never mind.
Let's take you to the doctor's first.

310
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,080
What if I leave and DD shows up?

311
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,680
You're injured.

312
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,240
What could you do even if he showed up?

313
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,240
Have faith in the police.

314
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,560
Let's go. Let me help you.

315
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,000
Give me your bag.

316
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
There's one more thing.

317
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,520
I feel like someone has been following me
these past few days.

318
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,880
It's probably your imagination
since you're worried about Shanwen.

319
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,000
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine.

320
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,760
Be careful.

321
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,480
Thank you, James.

322
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,080
Also, there's anti-inflammatory medicine.

323
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,480
These are gastric pills.
You have to take them together.

324
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,040
I wasted your time tonight.

325
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,760
I can't believe it.
Are you chasing me away?

326
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,440
I brought you all the way home.

327
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,640
My legs are tired.
Let me sit down for a while.

328
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,600
They say people will get
their comeuppance, right?

329
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,880
Is Shanwen's disappearance…
a punishment from God?

330
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,200
What are you talking about?

331
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,360
Don't worry too much about Shanwen.

332
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,040
All the members of our church
have been praying for him.

333
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,400
He'll surely return home safely.

334
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,160
Have faith in him.

335
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,040
Is that your kitchen?

336
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,240
I haven't had dinner yet.
I can whip something up for the two of us.

337
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,120
It'll be ready soon.

338
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
I COOKED CONGEE.

339
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,840
HEAT IT UP BEFORE YOU EAT IT.

340
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,400
Sir, the hospital confirmed that

341
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
DD had an accident on February 28
and was hospitalized for five days.

342
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,400
He was discharged on March 3.

343
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,920
That could explain why the Leap Day Killer
wasn't active this year.

344
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,920
Sir, the report is out.

345
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,600
The blood stain in the internet cafe
matches Sun Shanwen's DNA.

346
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,080
Also, the supplier
sells Ukiyo-e stockings.

347
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,640
They're the same ones found on Cindy.

348
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,040
Check Xie Liping's file.

349
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,600
Okay.

350
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,240
DD is Xie Liping's regular customer.
No wonder he looked so familiar.

351
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,520
DD must be the Leap Day Killer.

352
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,560
First, he killed Xie Liping,
and he killed Sera four years later.

353
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,520
Sera's brother must have found out
something,

354
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,080
and he was killed for it.

355
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,920
Sir, aren't you going to say
your catchphrase?

356
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,560
What catchphrase?

357
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,800
"We need evidence!"

358
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,040
That's not funny.

359
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,800
He said that's not funny.

360
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,920
Hello.

361
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,040
Okay.

362
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,160
DD has returned.

363
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,520
He just arrived at the airport.
Get ready to set off.

364
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,000
You're pulling this stunt now?

365
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,760
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

366
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
These are the famous
almond biscuits from Macau.

367
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Consider yourselves blessed
because of my lucky hand in gambling.

368
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
Thank you, Boss!

369
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,680
The police were here.

370
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,960
What did they want?

371
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,960
Sun Shanwen has gone missing.

372
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,360
They said that you were
the last person who saw him.

373
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Are they nuts?

374
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,040
What are they suspecting me of? Murder?

375
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
- That's right.
- What's happening?

376
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,800
- We have an arrest warrant.
- What?

377
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,440
We suspect that you're involved
in Sun Shanwen's disappearance.

378
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,080
Please come with us
to assist in our investigation.

379
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,400
Take him away.

380
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,920
Stop. I'm innocent!

381
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
Get me my lawyer!

382
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,040
We've cordoned off the shop.

383
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,160
Does this mean that we've lost our jobs?

384
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,720
Go home.

385
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,600
We'll call you up for questioning.

386
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,480
Remember this, don't leave the country.

387
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,320
All right, Ruby. Let's go home.

388
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,840
Guoguang, I found this box of stockings.

389
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,600
They seem to be the same kind
as those found on Cindy and Apple.

390
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,400
Sir, we found something.

391
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,520
We found some blood stains here.

392
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,680
The pattern doesn't appear to be messy.

393
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,200
It indicates that the victims weren't
randomly stabbed with a sharp weapon.

394
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,160
Instead, they were precisely cut
into pieces by a powerful tool.

395
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,880
I knew Boss was hiding something.

396
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,120
It would be scary
if he really killed someone.

397
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,920
Our jobs are gone now.

398
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,720
We'll have
to start looking for other jobs.

399
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm exhausted.

400
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm leaving first, Ruby.

401
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,080
How are you?

402
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,280
Another four years have passed.

403
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,760
Ever since you went over there,
have you learned to ask me,

404
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,960
"How are you?"

405
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,520
Honestly speaking,

406
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,640
even after you left,

407
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,400
my life is still a mess.

408
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,560
Mom…

409
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,520
when will you leave me alone?

410
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,080
- <i>Get in.</i>
- <i>Mommy, don't lock me inside!</i>

411
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
My client is coming soon. I have to work.

412
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
What will you eat if I don't earn money?
Trash?

413
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,640
Get in! Hurry up!

414
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,360
You're early today, handsome.

415
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,800
Lili.

416
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
You're in such a hurry!

417
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,640
Wait a minute!

418
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,280
Let me close the door first.

419
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,680
Mommy!

420
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,520
Hey!

421
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,400
Darn it.

422
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,560
Don't let me see
this little rascal next time.

423
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,680
You never once asked me,

424
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,640
"How are you?"

425
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,360
That's because you're a special mother.

426
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,320
You're special indeed.

427
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,200
You were born on a leap day…

428
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,040
and you died on a leap day.

429
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,400
ZHUO LILI

430
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,720
Do you feel lonely?

431
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,640
Don't worry.

432
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,800
Every four years,

433
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,160
I'll send someone down there
to accompany you.
