ZHUO LILI

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,520
Mom.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
Do you feel lonely?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,360
Don't worry.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
Every four years…

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,480
ZHUO LILI

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,720
I'll send someone down there
to accompany you.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,960
Mothers like you are aplenty.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,759
When they die,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,440
their children…

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,920
are left with the pain
from their childhood.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
I know that killing someone is wrong.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,520
I wanted to stop initially.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,800
Cindy's killer forced me to continue.

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,040
WE CAN'T CREATE ANOTHER MONSTER
IN ORDER TO ARREST ONE. - FU DASHU

16
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,680
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

17
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,400
Sera's baby…

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,360
Was it yours?

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Kill me.

20
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,960
Here.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Kill me.

22
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,240
Kill me right now.

23
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,960
Please kill me.

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,920
Do it.

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,560
We've been married for so long.

26
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,440
How could you think that I would do
something like that to our daughter?

27
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,080
It's always my fault.

28
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,320
You're the perfect wife and mother.

29
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
You're gone for a few months
whenever you go on a retreat

30
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,040
and abandon us!

31
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,240
You want to control everything
the second you're back!

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
Do you know how suffocated we feel?

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,160
Do you know what Shanwen said?

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,200
He would rather you go on a retreat.

35
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,280
Do you know what
nickname Sera gave herself?

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you know how much
she yearns to be free?

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
You don't have the slightest idea!

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
Here.

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,959
Do it. Kill me.

40
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
Hurry up.

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
Come on.

42
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,680
LEAP DAY KILLER STRIKES AGAIN

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,840
THIRD UKIYO-E MURDER CASE IN SINGAPORE

44
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,440
UKIYO-E MURDER CASE
BODY FOUND FLOATING ON THE SEA

45
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,160
Sir, we found these drugs in his room.

46
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
Take them back.

47
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Sir, we found something.

48
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,000
Hey.

49
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
What's your name?

50
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,480
Master…

51
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
This earring…

52
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,480
belongs to Sera.

53
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm leaving for school.

54
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,520
Why are you still in bed?

55
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
UNCLE JAMES

56
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,800
Uncle James.

57
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
It's raining cats and dogs out there.

58
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,760
Where's your mother?

59
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,200
She's awake, but I can't find
the medicine for her fever.

60
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
I bought some already.

61
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,240
Shanwen,

62
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,160
why did you call Uncle James?

63
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,760
He's a busy man.

64
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,160
I thought something bad happened to you.

65
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm fine.

66
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,760
I couldn't sleep,
so I took some sleeping pills.

67
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
Go to school.

68
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,919
- I'll head off first then.
- Be careful.

69
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,120
- Take an umbrella with you.
- I have one in my bag.

70
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
Have some fruits.

71
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
It's nothing serious.

72
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,440
It's just a mild fever.

73
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
A mild fever is still a fever.

74
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,520
I don't have any medicine
that can heal the pain in your heart.

75
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
However,

76
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
I have a pair of listening ears.

77
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,440
If you're willing to share,
I'm happy to hear you out.

78
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,520
After Sera died,

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,920
I realized that
I didn't know her at all.

80
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,840
What exactly happened to her
before she was killed?

81
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
I thought I was protecting her,

82
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
but it seems that…

83
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,640
I pushed her so much
that she felt suffocated.

84
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,840
She desired to escape
from my clutches and be free,

85
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,120
so much so that she got
a tattoo of a butterfly on her thigh.

86
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,240
She hadn't even turned 16 yet.

87
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,680
How did she even get pregnant?

88
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,800
Was she sexually assaulted?

89
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm such a lousy mother.

90
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
I came here from Hong Kong all by myself.

91
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,120
My family is everything to me.

92
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,680
I only realize now…

93
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,360
that…

94
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,040
I don't know my own family at all.

95
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I believed in the wrong people.

96
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,320
It turns out that…

97
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,880
I loved them in the wrong way.

98
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,680
I have good news!

99
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,520
Of the things we found in DD's home,

100
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,280
make a guess who this ring belongs to.

101
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,680
- Is it Apple's?
- Wrong!

102
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,240
It belongs to Xie Liping.

103
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,520
What about this nose ring?

104
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,320
- Is it Sera's?
- Wrong again!

105
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
It belongs to Apple.

106
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,440
It's the earring that belongs to Sera.

107
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,520
These serial killers
really like to show off.

108
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,720
You're no different from them.

109
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,040
It's a good thing though,
since we're able to get some evidence.

110
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,880
Sir, when are we going to hold
a press conference?

111
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,880
Hey! We cracked the case already.

112
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,840
Why do all of you look so glum?

113
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
What are you reading?

114
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,040
Sir.

115
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,760
These are DD's hospitalization records.

116
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,960
Nine years ago, he injured his hand.

117
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
He recovered only
after two years of physiotherapy.

118
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,360
Considering the time
of Xie Liping's attack,

119
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,160
he wouldn't have been able
to dispose of the bodies,

120
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
even if there's no evidence
to tie him to the crime scene.

121
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Also, he had an accident recently.

122
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,760
His old injury flared up again.

123
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Here's the catch.

124
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,960
A few days after he was discharged,

125
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,560
Apple's body was found.

126
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,000
What? What does that mean?

127
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
He might have an accomplice.

128
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,800
Investigate those around him
one more time.

129
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
What does it have to do with me?

130
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
SUN ALLAN: FREE TO MEET, OFFICER LIN?

131
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

132
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,680
<i>I'll strip for you!</i>

133
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,920
<i>Don't!</i>

134
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,920
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,920
What did you do to Sera?

136
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,760
I visited a pornographic website.

137
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,560
I really didn't know
that it was her at the time.

138
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,840
I believe this video was taken
by the murderer.

139
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,880
This letter was sent by the murderer
as well.

140
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,720
Arrest the murderer soon, please.

141
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,680
GOT THE LETTER? ANY THOUGHTS ON THE VIDEO?
IS YOUR DAUGHTER WELL-BEHAVED?

142
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

143
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,960
Four years ago,

144
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,360
you didn't mention a word of this.

145
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,520
Now, you're telling me
you're willing to do whatever it takes?

146
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,760
I admit that I was too selfish.

147
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,760
I hid the truth…

148
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,640
to protect my reputation.

149
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
Did her child…

150
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,040
belong to you?

151
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,440
I won't allow anyone
to insult my daughter.

152
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,560
I'll sue you for defamation
if you spout such nonsense again!

153
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,080
Focus on doing your job!

154
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,840
CINDY AND TINGTING

155
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,040
TINGTING

156
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,400
Write down the name
of the person you wish to forgive.

157
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,680
You may write down the harsh words
that you often say to them.

158
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,360
Are you all done?

159
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,800
Now, hold up the piece of paper

160
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,360
and tell God that you wish
to forgive this person.

161
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,760
Now, tear up the paper.

162
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,400
This signifies that
it's all in the past now.

163
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,000
Here.

164
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
MAY!

165
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,480
It's not bad.

166
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,880
Not bad.

167
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,040
Cheers.

168
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,760
Listen up!

169
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
Let's welcome our dashing,
capable and clever team leader

170
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,960
to say a few words!

171
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,120
All right. There's nothing much to say.

172
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
I want to talk about you instead.

173
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,000
When I'm gone, make sure you work hard

174
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,040
and don't stare at women's bosoms.

175
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,360
- Yes, sir!
- Sir.

176
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,880
Say a few words.

177
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,880
Tell us your thoughts about retirement.

178
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
It's just a retirement.
There's nothing much to say.

179
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
It's just like saying my last words.

180
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,160
That's not true.

181
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
Everyone,

182
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,600
our team leader will live
a long life, won't he?

183
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,160
- That's right!
- May you live a long life!

184
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,560
All right.

185
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,760
As you wish, I shall say a few words.

186
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,960
If you want to live a long life,

187
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,760
don't become a criminal investigator.

188
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,920
It's a very dangerous job.

189
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,920
The risks are high.

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You never know what'll happen next.

191
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,560
We work ungodly hours
to investigate a case

192
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,400
and face pressure
from various parties to solve a case.

193
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,920
One sentence sums it all up.

194
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,520
It's a thankless job.

195
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
I once asked myself,

196
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,320
"Would I still become
a criminal investigator in my next life?"

197
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,040
I will.

198
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,040
That's because I can speak for the dead.

199
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,160
I can do something for them.

200
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
It's my honor to do so,

201
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
and I'm happy to do it.

202
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,440
All right. That's all from me.

203
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,560
Please continue to work hard.

204
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,480
All the best!

205
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,160
Let's drink to that!

206
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

207
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,360
Come. Cheers!

208
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,920
Cheers.

209
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,440
Sir.

210
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,440
I placed my resignation letter
on your desk.

211
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Mm-hmm.

212
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Why didn't you sign off on it?

213
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,840
What time was that?

214
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,960
A little after 6:00 p.m.

215
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,120
I officially stepped down at 6:00 p.m.

216
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,480
I was no longer in charge of you
after 6:00 p.m.

217
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,520
Let the next team leader handle it.

218
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,080
Master.

219
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
We are…

220
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,440
Listen up.

221
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,640
When I'm gone, don't let up.

222
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,480
You must bring the murderer to justice.

223
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,440
Is that understood?

224
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
Master…

225
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,080
thank you for giving me this opportunity.

226
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll definitely…

227
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,440
find the person
who killed the four victims.

228
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,280
I'll seek justice for them.

229
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
When the case has been closed,

230
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll face the music for what I've done.

231
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,960
Let me help you.

232
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,200
Thank you, Disciple.

233
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,760
MAY!

234
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,240
MAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY

235
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,720
MY BESTIE, I LOVE YOU

236
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,480
SO WHAT IF YOU'RE RICH?
I HATE YOU, SHAW MAY

237
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,400
Thanks, Dad.

238
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
You don't look well.
Is something bothering you?

239
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
- Dad.
- Hmm.

240
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
Can I ask you something?

241
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,000
How is it that you always know
when I'm telling lies?

242
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,160
Why are you asking me this?

243
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,040
Are you planning to tell lies?

244
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
I wouldn't dare.

245
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,040
When people tell lies,

246
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,760
they have a guilty expression.

247
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,280
When you tell a lie, you have
to tell another lie to support it.

248
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,080
It's easy to slip up
the longer you try to maintain the lie.

249
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,280
What's wrong? Who's telling lies?

250
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,960
No one.

251
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,200
We were discussing the topic of lies
during our cell group meeting this week.

252
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,560
That's the guilty expression.

253
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Pastor Zhang, you're too good at this.

254
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,240
Isn't your cell group going
to the theme park next week?

255
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,040
Remember what I told you.

256
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
You cannot go on
any thrilling rides like roller coasters.

257
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,000
Just let me try it once, Dad. Please.
Just once.

258
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,160
You have a heart condition.

259
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,280
I've told you this many times.

260
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,160
My heart is fine.

261
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
No.

262
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,280
It's very dangerous to drop
from such a high height.

263
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,160
You're not allowed to ride those.
Is that understood?

264
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm not the one with a fear of heights.

265
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,040
What did I say?

266
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,760
I said no.

267
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Oh…

268
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Eat your breakfast.

269
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,760
- You too, Dad.
- Hmm.

270
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,720
YOU KILLED CINDY, RIGHT? I HAVE PROOF!

271
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
WANT TO IMITATE MY MURDER?
NEED ANOTHER DEMO?

272
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,720
SHAW MAY

273
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,400
SUN SERA
DECEASED FEBRUARY 29, 2020

274
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,360
HOW ARE YOU?

275
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,880
SHAW MAY

276
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,080
Let me check the mailbox.

277
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,280
Shanwen, I have something to show you.

278
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,640
What is it?

279
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,400
Take a look.

280
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,240
SO WHAT IF YOU'RE RICH?
I HATE YOU, SHAW MAY

281
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,840
Who wrote this?

282
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,480
Cindy wrote this
for a cell group activity.

283
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,680
She said that the person
she wanted to forgive was Auntie Ruoyun.

284
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,600
They didn't even know each other.

285
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,240
Could you have made a mistake?

286
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,440
I cross-referenced it
with her handwriting.

287
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,240
She wrote this.

288
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,600
I can't think of a reason
why she would write this though.

289
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,520
Could it have something to do with you?

290
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,720
I just saw your mother
enter a hotel room with an older man.

291
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,520
What did you say? I don't believe you.

292
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Come see for yourself
if you don't believe me.

293
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,800
I'll be waiting for you
in the alley in front of the hotel.

294
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,960
I'll send you the address.

295
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,160
Why would it have something to do with me?

296
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,120
I wasn't close to her,
and we had only met once.

297
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,880
Previously,

298
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,560
I found a bracelet similar to the one
that Cindy wore in Auntie Ruoyun's car.

299
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,520
She said that it was hers.

300
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
However, didn't she tell us that

301
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,360
she has sensitive skin
and doesn't wear any bracelets?

302
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,560
Am I reading too much into this?

303
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,360
You're definitely thinking too much.

304
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,880
Come. Let's head inside.

305
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
Why did you hit me?

306
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,520
Auntie Ruoyun!

307
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,120
Tingting.

308
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,360
Are you feeling better?

309
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
I'm feeling even better after seeing you.

310
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,560
My dad cooked dinner
and made some soup for you.

311
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,400
He told me to give it to you
first thing this morning.

312
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,920
Please thank your father for me.

313
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,200
You should thank him yourself.

314
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,640
Let me pour it out for you.

315
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,000
Your letters. I'll go help Tingting.

316
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,040
Thank you.

317
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,080
SHAW MAY

318
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,920
YOU KILLED CINDY, RIGHT? I HAVE PROOF!

319
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,080
WANT TO IMITATE MY MURDER?

320
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,400
Auntie Ruoyun,

321
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,160
lunch is ready.

322
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,800
Shanwen.

323
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,080
Did you see who put
this letter in the mailbox?

324
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,960
No.

325
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,400
The two of you go ahead.

326
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
I'll come later.

327
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,840
Sera!

328
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,800
I received a letter from the murderer!

329
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,360
It's a handwritten letter this time.

330
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,040
Mom will definitely avenge you!

331
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
I'll make sure
the police arrest the person.

332
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,040
- Mommy.
- Sera.

333
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,480
Are you willing to be sentenced to death
together with my murderer?

334
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,360
What do you mean?

335
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,760
The murderer said
they have proof of you killing me.

336
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,160
In order to find my murderer,
are you willing to be implicated?

337
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,680
Shanwen…

338
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,360
I promised Shanwen
that I'd be a good mother.

339
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,560
No.

340
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,920
How different are you from Dad?

341
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,160
You're equally hypocritical.

342
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
How different are you
from the person who killed me?

343
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,080
- You're equally cruel!
- I…

344
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,280
I'm not the same as them!

345
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,160
It's all right.

346
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,160
My mother will kill
someone else's daughter, like you.

347
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,280
That girl's mother will then
kill someone else's daughter.

348
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,440
Then, more people will join us!

349
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,280
I really…

350
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,240
I didn't kill anyone!

351
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm sorry.

352
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,640
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

353
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,880
I'm sorry, Cindy.

354
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm sorry…

355
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
Shanwen.

356
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
You finally came home.

357
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,920
Don't touch me.

358
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,760
I want to ask you about something.

359
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
I know.

360
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,080
It's about the thumb drive.

361
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,440
- I've been wanting to explain it to you.
- Let me ask you.

362
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,360
On the night that Cindy was killed,

363
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,840
you said that Mom was home all night.

364
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,000
Is that the truth?

365
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,639
So…

366
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,159
did she kill Cindy?

367
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,719
You knew about this all along?

368
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,600
I hope you won't lie to me again.

369
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,040
If you do,

370
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
I'll hate you,

371
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
and I'll hate this family forever.

372
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,240
- Shanwen.
- Why?

373
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,120
Why do all of you have secrets?
Why must all of you lie to me?

374
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,880
Sera, Dad and you are all the same!

375
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,760
What are you talking about
so early in the morning?

376
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,080
What secrets?

377
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,480
Drop the act already.

378
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,680
I already know
that the person who killed Cindy…

379
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,240
is you!

380
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,440
You killed a person!
It's not an ant or a cockroach!

381
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,720
Did your father tell you?

382
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,400
Does it matter how I found out?

383
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,400
Why? Tell me why you had to kill her!

384
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
She threatened me.

385
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,840
She said that she had proof
of you taking drugs,

386
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,200
and I panicked.

387
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,760
I wanted to protect you,

388
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,720
so I panicked and hit her with a brick,

389
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
but I didn't expect
that she would die from that.

390
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,560
So, it's true
that you slept with another man.

391
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,520
Your… your father refused to help me.

392
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,440
I needed the money.

393
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,920
I needed a big name
to launch the exhibition.

394
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,280
It's all excuses!

395
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,040
- I needed to launch Sera's exhibition!
- Stop talking!

396
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,880
I had to do it for your sister!

397
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,360
You even put stockings on Cindy.

398
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,040
You made it look like she died like Sis.
You're sick.

399
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,280
You're a murderer!

400
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,560
Yes!

401
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,960
I am!

402
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,440
I'm miserable every day.

403
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,480
I had to do it for your sister.

404
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,080
Don't blame it on Sis and me!

405
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,760
You're a hypocrite! You should just die!

406
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,760
- Shanwen.
- Don't touch me!

407
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,720
I don't want to see you ever again!

408
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,760
Shanwen!

409
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,760
I know you don't want to see me.

410
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,840
I'll leave.

411
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,160
I beg you not to leave.
Don't run away from home.

412
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,840
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

413
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
I'll leave now.

414
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,440
Dad.

415
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,600
How many days' worth of food
are you packing?

416
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,240
I'm worried you'll get hungry.

417
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,920
Here.

418
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,800
You're being so dramatic.

419
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,240
For worrying that you'll get hungry?

420
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,120
Be careful when you're outside, okay?

421
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,360
Also,

422
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,240
do you remember what you promised me?

423
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,080
What was it?

424
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,680
- I cannot go on any roller coasters.
- Right.

425
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,440
You cannot go
on any other thrilling rides either.

426
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,240
Is that understood?

427
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,960
- Yes, Dad.
- Hmm.

428
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,240
Dad, you're such a nag these days.

429
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,560
Bye-bye!

430
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,560
Promise me you won't go on those rides.

431
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,440
I heard you the first time.

432
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,960
Without the boss here shouting at me,

433
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,480
- I don't feel motivated to do anything.
- You're right.

434
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,360
Even the peanuts taste bland now.

435
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,680
Are you feeling bored?

436
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,680
Do you want to sweep the floor?

437
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,960
Wipe the windows while you're at it too.

438
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,760
Sir! Not at all. I'm very busy!

439
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,280
Black coffee with no sugar, sir?

440
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,480
Cut that out.

441
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,000
Chase up the IT Department
to see if they've made any progress.

442
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,000
All of the CCTV footage
from DD's shop was erased.

443
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,280
It'll take some time
to recover everything.

444
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,440
What are you waiting for then?

445
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,560
Go chase them now.

446
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,480
Yes, sir.

447
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,440
That includes you.

448
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE

449
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,160
<i>We're all saddened</i>
<i>by Cindy's sudden departure.</i>

450
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,640
<i>We wonder why the murderer was so cruel.</i>

451
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
<i>The rage and sense of injustice we have</i>

452
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,360
<i>toward her murderer</i>

453
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
<i>is completely understandable.</i>

454
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,840
<i>However, God wants us to be forgiving.</i>

455
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,960
We must learn to be forgiving.

456
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,600
We're the victims,
but we also become our own perpetrators.

457
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,960
<i>You even put stockings on Cindy.</i>

458
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,440
<i>You made it look like she died like Sis.</i>

459
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,960
<i>You're sick.</i>

460
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,880
You're a murderer!

461
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,040
<i>Officer Lin.</i>

462
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
<i>I would like to meet with you.</i>

463
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,680
Mrs. Shaw.

464
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,280
What's the matter?

465
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,320
Let me answer this call first.

466
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,200
I'll call you back later.

467
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,960
Something urgent came up.
I'll make a move first.

468
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,840
Mrs. Shaw!
