1
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,160
DON'T SAY THAT YOU KNOW ME.
IT ONLY SHOWS THAT YOU DON'T.

2
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,080
SUN SHANWEN

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,640
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

4
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,680
Are you Sun Shanwen?

5
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,640
Your good friend
wants to get your opinion.

6
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Does Tingting look pretty
in these high heels?

7
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
They look pretty on you.

8
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
Sexy.

9
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
Mature.

10
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,440
Feminine.

11
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,040
Isn't that right?

12
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,000
I told you so.

13
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Men will definitely like them.

14
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
Let's get a pair each.
They're a gift from me.

15
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
I can't. They're too expensive.

16
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
I have money.

17
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,880
Miss!

18
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,480
I'll get this.

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
What's the matter?

20
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,880
You're acting weird today.

21
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't you like this side of me?

22
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,120
You usually say I'm too quiet.

23
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,279
Isn't it at 4:00 p.m.?

24
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,959
I'll be there right away.

25
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
Cindy, I got the time
of the meeting wrong.

26
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,920
I'll go first.

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,840
What about your shoes?

28
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
I'll get them from you some other time!

29
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Hey.

30
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Have dinner with me.

31
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
My friend's car is pretty cool, right?

32
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,920
Sooner or later,
I'll buy one for myself too.

33
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,080
Aren't you still studying?

34
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
Where will you get the money?

35
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,160
I'll get it by working.

36
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm not lucky enough to live
in a mansion like you.

37
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,760
My house is so cramped.

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
For how long have you had
a crush on Tingting?

39
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,440
What are you doing?

40
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
Have you learnt it already?

41
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm in a good mood today.

42
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,280
I'll teach it to you for free.

43
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,880
Remember to use this on Tingting.

44
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
Are you crazy?

45
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,440
- See you tomorrow!
- See you tomorrow!

46
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,280
You're Cindy, right?

47
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,560
Aren't you that sculptor, Shaw…

48
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,360
I'm also Sun Shanwen's mother.

49
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,360
I only have one objective here.

50
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,760
Please leave my son alone.

51
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
That little goody two shoes?

52
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,840
He's still a kid.
Please don't lead him astray.

53
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,480
A kid?

54
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
You're such a typical mother.

55
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
You have no idea what your child is up to.

56
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
I know my children well.

57
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
I won't allow you to harm my son.

58
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,800
I understand women like you all too well.

59
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,680
How much money is enough
for you to leave him alone?

60
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,120
I don't want any of your money.

61
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Keep your son at home
and admire him like an antique.

62
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,080
I'll go buy something first.

63
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
Shaw May!

64
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,040
Sun Shanwen's mother!

65
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,960
You slept with another man.

66
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Who are you to look down on me?

67
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,920
The room number is 1321.

68
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
I took a photo, and I have evidence.

69
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,400
I wonder how Shanwen will feel
when he finds out that

70
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,640
his mother slept with another man.

71
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,360
I apologize for what I said the other day.

72
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,360
I happen to have
something interesting to show you.

73
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,720
Your precious son has been taking drugs.

74
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,720
Tell me.

75
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,520
What should a woman like me do?

76
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,280
Should I show this to the police or…

77
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,960
Are you threatening me?

78
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,360
It's too late for that,

79
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
Cindy.

80
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Cindy.

81
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Cindy.

82
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,360
I DROPPED IT BY ACCIDENT.
KEEP IT FOR ME FOR NOW.

83
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
I'M ALREADY AT HOME.

84
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,840
Shanwen.

85
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Why are you back so late?

86
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Have you eaten?
I'll cook some noodles for you.

87
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,920
What are you doing?

88
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,960
What are you doing?
Why are you going through my things?

89
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,560
Your room is so messy.

90
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,320
You should tidy up.

91
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,720
Don't touch my things in the future.

92
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,000
Where were you all night?

93
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,040
Why did you only come back
in the afternoon?

94
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,240
How did you know that?

95
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I've been at home.

96
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,720
Why wouldn't I know that?

97
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,240
It's none of your business.

98
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
Get out. Get out!

99
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Shanwen.

100
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
- Have you been taking…
- Leave me alone. Get out!

101
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Shanwen!

102
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,240
Hey!

103
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,400
What?

104
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,040
How's it going, Starplayer?

105
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,200
You haven't looked for me in a long time.

106
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,880
Are you still looking to "escape"?

107
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,800
My mother found out already.
I can't "escape" anymore.

108
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Don't worry.

109
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,880
She doesn't know of this place.

110
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,119
You better be careful.

111
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,880
Come look for me if you need some.

112
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,720
You're having a good time, aren't you?

113
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,840
Those inside have to pay to play games,

114
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
but I have to pay when you play games!

115
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,480
It's a slow day anyway.

116
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,680
How many bookings are there
for the escape room today?

117
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
There's one booking for tomorrow though.

118
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
My goodness.

119
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
You should close down
the escape room since it's not doing well.

120
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
You could expand
the internet cafe instead.

121
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,160
Do you think getting equipment is free?

122
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,400
I'll have money if I fire you!

123
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,600
Please don't!

124
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,920
I'll go clean up the escape room at once

125
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
and prepare it for tomorrow's booking.

126
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,640
Who else?

127
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,080
SHOCKING SCENE IN SERIAL MURDER CASE:
NEW DISMEMBERED BODY DISCOVERED

128
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,880
Is she your younger sister?

129
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,040
I knew things would end badly for her.

130
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,120
She has a nine-year-old daughter

131
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,760
who's currently with a foster family.

132
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,320
My sister always hits her
whenever she gets drunk.

133
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
It's a good thing she's dead now.

134
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,880
It doesn't make any difference to us
whether she's dead or alive anyway.

135
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,120
Our latest victim is 28-year-old Apple
who worked as a call girl.

136
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,680
Her neighbors often reported her
for abusing her daughter.

137
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,840
She died in a similar manner
as Sera and Xie Liping.

138
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,560
They had stockings put on them,
and their bodies were dismembered.

139
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,880
The only difference is that she died
on March 11 and not on a leap day.

140
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,360
For Cindy,

141
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,680
she was murdered on March 5.

142
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,520
She had stockings put on her,
but her body wasn't dismembered.

143
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
There are two main differences
between Cindy and the other victims.

144
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,840
Firstly,

145
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
she died from a blunt force
to the back of her head by a heavy object.

146
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The other three victims died
from an overdose of sleeping pills.

147
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,000
Secondly, she doesn't have any children.

148
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,680
Xie Liping and Apple have a daughter each,

149
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,240
whereas Sera was pregnant.

150
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,720
What do all of you think?

151
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,360
Xie Liping was a prostitute.

152
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,160
Sera had a teenage pregnancy.

153
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,400
Cindy was suspected of prostitution.

154
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Apple worked as a call girl.

155
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,600
The only similarity they share is
that they were all promiscuous women.

156
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
The murderer might have been hurt
by a promiscuous woman before.

157
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,520
They're not necessarily
all promiscuous women.

158
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,400
I believe Cindy wasn't murdered
by the Leap Day Killer.

159
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,160
It was likely an imitator.

160
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,200
We'll need evidence.

161
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Did you find any connections between Sera

162
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
and the user named "Freedom"
on the pornographic website?

163
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,760
I didn't.

164
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
‪XIE LIPING, SERA SUN,
‪CINDY LIU, APPLE HUANG

165
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
However, I found this
from the CCTV footage

166
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,360
of the hotel where Cindy was attacked.

167
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,600
The boy in the corner is Sun Shanwen.

168
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,840
He's Sera's younger brother.

169
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,680
On the night of the incident,
Cindy asked Zhang Tingting for his number,

170
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
and she called him.

171
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,120
It's estimated that Cindy died
sometime between 1:00 am and 5:00 a.m.

172
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,440
Sun Shanwen sat here from 1:38 a.m.

173
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,400
all the way until 1:42 p.m.
in the afternoon when he left.

174
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,360
However, based on the records
of his taxi ride,

175
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,480
he was in transit to the hotel
from 1:08 a.m. to 1:28 a.m.

176
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,920
The driver couldn't have stood there

177
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
to watch him kill someone
and dump the body.

178
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,680
The timing doesn't match.

179
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,600
Get to the point.

180
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,920
Get to the point.

181
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,560
My point is why was
Sun Shanwen at the hotel,

182
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,080
and why did he sit there the entire night?

183
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
He was waiting for someone.

184
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,280
You've become smart.

185
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,160
Cindy and Professor Huang
arrived at the hotel together.

186
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,080
They happened to cross paths
with a woman wearing a sun hat.

187
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,720
This woman exited the hotel from here.

188
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,840
Cindy followed closely behind her
and exited the hotel as well.

189
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,600
This is the CCTV footage
of the hotel corridor.

190
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,880
This woman entered this man's room.

191
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,760
This was taken at the opening

192
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,360
of Shaw May's sculpture exhibition
the following day.

193
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,960
The man in the photo
is magnate Deng Wanhao.

194
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,360
The man in the hotel room was him.

195
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
I theorize that

196
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,280
Cindy saw Shaw May
and informed Sun Shanwen,

197
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,040
and the person he was waiting
for all night was his mother, Shaw May.

198
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
This woman in the sun hat
is likely to be Shaw May.

199
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,640
This photo is too blurry
to be used as concrete evidence.

200
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
This is just a logical theory I have.

201
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm working hard to find more evidence.

202
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,640
Auntie Ruoyun.

203
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,640
Our apologies for being late.

204
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,320
This is Cindy's mother.

205
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
I believe you've met before.

206
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,120
Mrs. Shaw, thank you
for taking the time to meet me.

207
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,480
Call me Ruoyun.

208
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,440
Please sit down.

209
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,920
Auntie Ruoyun,

210
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,480
your hands are trembling.
Are you feeling cold?

211
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,520
I'm fine.

212
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,920
Excuse me.
Could you turn up the air conditioner?

213
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
Sure thing.

214
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,800
We'll have some warm water to start.

215
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,720
We'll order our food later.

216
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Let's warm up with some warm water
and then we'll begin.

217
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,520
What do you want to eat?

218
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Actually, at nighttime,

219
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
I feel really stressed.

220
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,280
The more stressed I am,

221
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,680
the harder it is for me to fall asleep.

222
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll stare at the ceiling all night.

223
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,400
My heart aches for Cindy.

224
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm really suffering.

225
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,760
How did you do it?

226
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,800
How did you cope with the pain?

227
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,200
I tried my best.

228
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,800
I dare not say that
I'm completely over it.

229
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,200
What must I do…

230
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,280
to stop my heart from aching?

231
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,800
It'll stay with you…

232
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
for life.

233
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,760
Pastor.

234
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,640
Why did something
like this happen to Cindy?

235
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,920
I've been…

236
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
Many things in life have no answer.

237
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
However, God wants
us to let go of the pain,

238
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
so that we can continue living.

239
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,040
Pastor,

240
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,240
you can't understand the pain when it
didn't happen to your own flesh and blood.

241
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,400
You can't understand how painful it is.

242
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm the only one who understands.

243
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,640
I only have one wish now.

244
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I hope Cindy will visit me in my dreams…

245
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,160
when I fall asleep at night.

246
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,840
I want her to show me her murderer's face.

247
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,720
Then…

248
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,080
I can look for her murderer.

249
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
When I find them,

250
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
I'll stab them to death!

251
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,440
Tell me. Would you do the same
if it were you?

252
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,080
- Tell me!
- Don't be like this, Yuxin.

253
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,000
You're scaring Ruoyun.

254
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,360
Auntie.

255
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm sorry.

256
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm really sorry.

257
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,760
I don't know what came over me.

258
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm sorry.

259
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,320
Please excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

260
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,480
I'm sorry.

261
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,000
What's wrong with me?

262
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm sorry.

263
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,040
I'm sorry.

264
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,840
Auntie Ruoyun.

265
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,320
Are you all right?

266
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm fine.

267
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,440
Auntie Yuxin said she'll leave first
as she's not feeling well.

268
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm sorry, Tingting.

269
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,440
I think I made things worse.

270
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
That's not true.

271
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,680
My dad said it's a good thing
to express your emotions.

272
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
The car I called for has arrived.

273
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,920
I'll take Auntie Yuxin home.

274
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,120
My dad's waiting for you.

275
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,920
We agreed that it would be my treat.

276
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,200
It doesn't matter who pays.

277
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,720
You barely ate anything anyway.

278
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,640
I bought their famous cake.

279
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,840
Take it home with you.

280
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm not hungry.

281
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,840
If you're not hungry,

282
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,560
you can have it for breakfast tomorrow.

283
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,080
I bought three pieces since there are
three people in your family.

284
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,280
You're very thoughtful. Thank you.

285
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,520
Then…

286
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,680
I'll give you a lift home.

287
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,240
I drove today.

288
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,760
I'll drive your car
to give you a lift home then.

289
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,520
I have a driving license,

290
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,640
but I don't have a car. Humor me.

291
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,920
I guess it's my compensation
for being scared silly.

292
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,520
I apologize.

293
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I shouldn't have asked you
to console Yuxin.

294
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,480
It probably reminded you of Sera, right?

295
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,240
I'm fine.

296
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,040
I should be the one apologizing instead.

297
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,600
I wasn't any help at all.

298
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,160
Please don't say that.

299
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,520
Having empathy for her is
the biggest consolation already.

300
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Every word she said…

301
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,560
felt like needles…

302
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,000
piercing through my heart.

303
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,520
All these years,

304
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,440
one of the things that has kept me going…

305
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,600
was the hope that…

306
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,360
I could kill the murderer
with my bare hands.

307
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,760
I can understand…

308
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,680
how you feel.

309
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,880
Can you?

310
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,440
Don't you always preach forgiveness?

311
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,640
Not forgiving someone
is like ingesting poison.

312
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,600
You just hope for someone to die.

313
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Harboring hatred is a slow suicide.

314
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,840
The sense of injustice
and rage in your heart

315
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,520
will eat away at your soul.

316
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,360
It'll manifest
into physical illnesses over time.

317
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,800
Hey there, handsome.

318
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Are you free for a chat?

319
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
Save me some face.

320
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,760
Why were you at the hotel
on the night that Cindy was attacked?

321
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,760
Did she arrange to meet with you,
or were you waiting for someone?

322
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,760
Look for my lawyer if you want to chat.

323
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Leave me alone.

324
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Are you down to play a game with me?

325
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,280
Tell me why you were
at the hotel if you lose.

326
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,000
Sun Shanwen! Are you not game enough?

327
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
I'm not surprised.

328
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,960
It's to be expected that you're scared
of a skilled player like me.

329
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,880
Bye.

330
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,520
Who says I'm scared?

331
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,640
Over here!

332
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
Over there!

333
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,480
Run! In front of you!

334
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,960
It's his first kill!

335
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,720
Wow.

336
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,880
There's someone else!

337
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,920
- On the right!
- One, two, three!

338
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,040
Get him.

339
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
There are 45 seconds left!

340
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,600
Hang in there!

341
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,640
- Be careful!
- Here they come!

342
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
‪-Hey!
‪-There!

343
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,360
He's the legendary Knife Slayer.

344
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,080
He hasn't played for four years already!

345
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,880
Behind you!

346
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,560
You can't defeat him.

347
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,720
Look!

348
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,240
Here he comes again!

349
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,720
Here he comes!

350
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah!

351
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,720
I told you he would win.

352
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,200
I didn't think you'd still remember me
after a four-year absence.

353
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,080
Can I take a photo with you?

354
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,520
Thank you.

355
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Hey!

356
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,640
Hey!

357
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,840
Are you still a kid?

358
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,000
You ran away the moment you lost the game.

359
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,360
It doesn't change a thing
if you run any faster.

360
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,320
You lost fair and square.

361
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,040
It's an undeniable fact.

362
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,840
You lost to me
because you were too eager to win.

363
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,680
You lost to yourself.

364
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,520
That's enough. You lost fair and square.

365
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,720
Tell me why you were at the hotel.

366
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,080
Who were you waiting for?

367
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
If you have anything to hide,

368
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,480
it'll only make
your mother seem more suspicious.

369
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,680
Also,

370
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,160
withholding information is considered
obstruction of a police investigation.

371
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Cindy told me that she saw my mother

372
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,680
enter a hotel room with a man.

373
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,080
She told me to see it for myself,

374
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,560
so I went to the hotel.

375
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,240
However, she sent me a text message
saying that she was home already.

376
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,520
I waited all night.

377
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,040
I didn't see my mother,
even after check-out time.

378
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,040
She was never at the hotel at all.

379
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,680
Why are you so sure of that?

380
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,400
She was already at home when I got home.

381
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,360
She asked me why I wasn't home all night.

382
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,520
So, the reason
you've been keeping quiet about this…

383
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,880
is to protect your mother's reputation?

384
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,240
It's none of your business.

385
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,400
What else do you know
regarding Cindy that I should know?

386
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,240
I didn't see her at all that night.

387
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,920
Thank you for your cooperation.

388
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,360
you should really
work on your marksmanship.

389
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,640
FREE TO MEET, SON?

390
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
It's rare to see you so hardworking.

391
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Sir,

392
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,880
Guoguang told me to find out more
about the pornographic website.

393
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,120
This website is like an ocean.

394
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,720
The number of girls is like
the number of fishes in the ocean.

395
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,200
Pull up the account
of a user called "Freedom".

396
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,440
Get me a cup of black coffee
without sugar.

397
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,440
Do you want it right now?

398
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,800
No, I want it next year.

399
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,320
Get me some steamed buns too.

400
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,440
Are you calling me?

401
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
I meant actual steamed buns to eat.

402
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,880
Steamed buns.

403
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,240
Master,

404
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
I looked for Sun Shanwen,
and he came clean.

405
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Cindy reached out to him because she saw
his mother enter a hotel room with a man.

406
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,400
He kept quiet about it
because he wanted to protect his mother.

407
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,280
We can conclude that…

408
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,040
the woman who went to Deng Wanhao's room
is likely to be Shaw May.

409
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,240
Whenever we keep secrets,

410
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,360
we're either protecting ourselves,

411
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,280
or we're protecting someone else.

412
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,400
What about you?

413
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,040
Who are you protecting?

414
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,240
What secrets are you hiding?

415
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,640
I don't have any secrets.

416
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,640
That's good to know.

417
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,880
I'm retiring soon.

418
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
I've been a detective for so many years.

419
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,720
I finally realized something.

420
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,600
What is it?

421
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,080
The dead can speak to us.

422
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,240
They may be dead,

423
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,120
but they leave behind many clues
that can tell us something.

424
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,880
I think that Sera is trying
to tell us something.

425
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,680
Is that so?

426
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,480
Dig in.

427
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,800
It's your favorite sandwich
and an iced latte.

428
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,800
I spoke with Dad already.

429
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,360
If you wish to get a divorce,

430
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,240
I'm going with him.

431
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,120
What exactly did you say to Shanwen?

432
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,640
What did you use to threaten him?

433
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Speak up!

434
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,720
It's my own decision.

435
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,840
Why?

436
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,760
I can live like a normal human being…

437
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,000
if I go with him.

438
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,160
Have I not treated you well?

439
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,920
I've done so much for you.

440
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
I only have one child left,
and you want to snatch him from me?

441
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,400
Shanwen.

442
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,360
Listen to me, Shanwen.

443
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,000
Hurry up and get a divorce already

444
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,240
or I'll run away from home soon like Sera.

445
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,560
Why do you hate me so much?

446
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,440
I don't understand.

447
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,360
Why are you here again?

448
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Mrs. Shaw,

449
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,080
we suspect that you were involved
in Lau Cindy's murder.

450
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,320
Come with us to the station
to assist in our investigation.
