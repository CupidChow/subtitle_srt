00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,440
Hello, Grandpa.

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,600
It's fine. You're not feeling well.

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,200
That's why I told you not to come.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,400
Anyway, I'll go home a little later.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,320
I have something important to do.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,160
TINGTING, PASTOR'S DAUGHTER

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,800
WHEN RAGE COMES KNOCKING,
DON'T OPEN THE DOOR.

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,560
LET IT BE. OTHERWISE, YOU MIGHT REGRET IT.
ZHANG JAMES, ZHANG TINGTING

9
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,680
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

10
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,200
Dad.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,360
Why did you come home so late?

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,400
I'll cook something for you.

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,880
It's all right. I'm not hungry.

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
- Have you eaten?
- No.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
We rode the roller coaster earlier.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
We even went for a few rounds…

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,520
Did you join in too?

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,520
Just once.

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,440
Stop right there! I'm talking to you.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,040
Didn't you promise me that
you wouldn't ride the roller coaster?

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,920
I didn't promise you anything.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
You forced me to agree to it!

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,440
What attitude is that?
What do you mean by I forced you?

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
What did I do wrong?

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
I'm an adult already!

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,000
I merely rode a roller coaster.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,160
How can you say that?

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,640
Didn't I tell you that you have a
congenital heart disease like your mother?

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,600
I've told you that you could not go
on such rides since you were young!

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,720
What's the matter with you, Dad?

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,760
The doctor said I'm fine.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,200
You're holding me back
because you're scared.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,680
Is that fair to me?

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,640
Am I wrong to worry about you?

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,240
Right, you're not to blame.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,680
It's all my fault!

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,480
You're always so kind
to the church members,

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,880
but you're always judging me!

39
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,880
That's because you have
no sense of propriety or principles!

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Do you have any principles?

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,120
Do you have any sense of propriety,
Pastor Zhang?

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,200
You didn't hesitate to beat up someone.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,320
You're no different from Grandpa!

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,320
You say one thing and do another!

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
Are you forcing me to hit you now?

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,840
Do it! Hit me like you hit Paul!

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,440
INCOMING CALL
DAD

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,880
I'M SLEEPING AT A FRIEND'S PLACE TONIGHT.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,680
STOP CALLING ME.

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Are you out of prison already?

51
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,280
Sir.

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,560
Is there someone around here
who sells ice cream from a pushcart?

53
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,640
He retired about two years ago.

54
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,640
You sound like you know him well.

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
Where can I find him?

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,200
He usually drinks coffee at the café
down the street at 3:00 p.m.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,720
You might still catch him
if you head there now.

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,840
All right. Thank you.

59
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,520
DIM SUM

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
Is there anyone here who sells ice cream?

61
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,680
Do you sell ice cream?

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm a police officer.

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
Uncle.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
Do you know anyone who sells ice cream?

65
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,480
You don't?

66
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
How should I address you?

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm Ah Hua.

68
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm a good person.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,160
I've never broken the law.

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Don't worry, Uncle Hua.

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,480
I just need your help.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,040
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,440
<i>I'll strip for you!</i>

74
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,280
<i>Don't!</i>

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This…

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
happened a long time ago.

77
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
Do you still remember what happened?

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
Alas.

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,440
That girl took off her clothes.

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,160
That doesn't happen every day.

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
I remember it, of course.

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,960
Don't touch me!

83
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,000
Was there anyone else… besides you?

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
I wouldn't know.

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Let's keep it between us.

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,200
If you see a girl taking off her clothes,

87
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
you wouldn't be looking around
at the surroundings.

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm not lecherous.

89
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,920
Any man would do the same.

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
That's right.

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,320
If it were me,

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,000
I would definitely
take photos or record a video.

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,080
It doesn't happen every day,
like you said.

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
So, Uncle Hua,

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,920
did you take photos or record a video?

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,480
I didn't.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,560
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

98
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
If you want to see it,

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,040
I'll strip for you!

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,400
- Don't do that, Sera!
- I'll strip for you!

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
Don't touch me!

102
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
That girl…

103
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
was murdered four years ago.

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Her body was dismembered
and thrown into the sea.

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,280
The murderer has yet to be found.

106
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Uncle Hua.

107
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,960
This is a very important lead to me…

108
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,000
because it involves many lives.

109
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,440
Do you want to reconsider your answer?

110
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,200
Did you take any photos or record a video?

111
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,080
Fine, I did.

112
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,160
However, my friend helped me
change to a new phone last year.

113
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't know if the video
has been deleted.

114
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
It's you.

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,280
Come in.

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,440
What's wrong?

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
Are you all right?

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
Not really.

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,480
I fought with Tingting…

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
over something trivial.

121
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
She…

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,040
She promised me that she wouldn't go
on a roller coaster at the theme park…

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,640
because she has a weak heart.

124
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
She did it anyway, and I scolded her.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,880
She texted me to say that
she wouldn't be coming home tonight.

126
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
She then turned her phone off.

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
She hasn't picked up my calls since then.

128
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,800
Have a seat.

129
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm sorry. Have a seat.

130
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,840
Have a seat.

131
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,560
I wanted to ask you too.

132
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,120
Is Tingting with Shanwen?

133
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,000
I was a little busy today.

134
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
I haven't seen Shanwen yet.

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
Did you scold her badly?

136
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,160
Yes.

137
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,400
I almost hit her.

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Sometimes, I feel that
the devil lives inside me.

139
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,640
When my temper flares,
the devil will emerge.

140
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,160
She'll be fine.

141
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,880
Give her some time to cool down.

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,520
Our children have grown up.

143
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
They need their own space.

144
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,440
Am I too harsh on her?

145
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Everything we do

146
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
comes from a place of love.

147
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,560
We become afraid

148
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
because of love.

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,280
We then project our fears

150
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
onto our children.

151
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,880
That makes them feel stressed.

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,360
I feel like I'm a joke.

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,600
I always tell you… to unclench your fist.

154
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,880
In the end,
I didn't practice what I preach.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,880
Can I ask you…

156
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
to help me take care of Shanwen?

157
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,680
Take him to church with you.

158
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,640
It's a place filled with love.

159
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,640
That's what he needs.

160
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,160
Why are you telling me these things?

161
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Thank you, James.

162
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
Getting to know you…

163
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,920
has been a blessing.

164
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
Officer Lin.

165
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,760
I would like to meet you.

166
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
Mrs. Shaw.

167
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,760
What's the matter?

168
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Let me answer this call first.

169
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,160
I'll call you back later.

170
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
Something urgent came up.
I'll make a move first.

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,440
Mrs. Shaw!

172
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,520
TINGTING CAN'T BE FOUND

173
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,840
Tingting.

174
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,400
At least tell me which classmate's place
you're staying over at.

175
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,600
Also, we agreed that
we would never go to bed angry.

176
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,240
Today is the Lord's Day.

177
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,200
I'll see you at church in the morning.

178
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,520
If we have the savior's love
in our hearts,

179
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
we'll find various ways

180
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,840
to help others to know Christ
and to return to him.

181
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,160
Let's close our eyes

182
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
and pray together.

183
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,600
Paul!

184
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,560
Open up, Paul!

185
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,760
Open up!

186
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,720
- Be quiet!
- Open up!

187
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,960
Weren't you just here this morning?

188
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,120
Sir.

189
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,160
Is the family at home?

190
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,760
There's no one at home!

191
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,240
Stop coming here!

192
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,280
Here's an extra-large packet
of black coffee… without sugar.

193
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,440
Don't chase my fish away.

194
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,960
Master.

195
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,119
Isn't fishing boring?

196
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
It isn't.

197
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
It's very carefree.

198
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,640
Don't underestimate fishing.

199
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,960
There's a science to it.

200
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,200
You didn't catch a single fish.

201
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,120
It seems that the science
is beyond your comprehension.

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,960
What do you know about it?

203
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,800
Come on. I'll treat you to steamed fish.

204
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,760
It tastes different
when you catch your own fish.

205
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
You'll have to catch some fish first.

206
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
Fish are like criminals. They're cunning.

207
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,760
They make us put more and more fish bait.

208
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,600
So, we need to wait patiently

209
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,320
and observe patiently.

210
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Why are you looking so glum
when the murderer has been caught?

211
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,520
Master.

212
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,880
There's more than meets the eye.

213
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,240
The murderer was not caught
for more than ten years.

214
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,880
Why would he casually
leave evidence in his home?

215
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
Also, DD's hand injury

216
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
is something we can't explain away.

217
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,120
I showed him Sun Allan's video.

218
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,960
He doesn't seem to know anything about it.

219
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,200
I don't think he is faking it.

220
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,000
Did you find the video taken
by the ice cream seller?

221
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,520
He sold his phone long ago.
And he didn't save a copy.

222
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,520
Fishing is the same
as investigating a case.

223
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,200
You must follow your gut instinct.

224
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,840
Gut instinct?

225
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,560
Shouldn't we follow the evidence?

226
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,120
You need to follow your gut instinct
to find the evidence though.

227
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,440
Give him what he likes.

228
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,440
It's like how the fish in the sea
love to eat shrimp,

229
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,000
so we feed them shrimp.

230
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,480
Change the location… and change the bait.

231
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,800
Change the location?

232
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Change the bait?

233
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,840
Most men are lecherous, except me.

234
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,120
Ask the ice cream seller
if he has shared the video

235
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,880
with another lecherous man like you.

236
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,640
There's something!

237
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
Master, you're so good!

238
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,320
You thought a steamed grouper
was waiting for you?

239
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,440
It's just seaweed. Are you kidding me?

240
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,560
Quick, let's leave.
It's going to rain soon.

241
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
Don't go yet! There's more stuff!

242
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
Take these things.

243
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
There's so much stuff!

244
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,920
Shanwen is sick with a fever.

245
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,600
I bought so much food
because I wanted to cook for him.

246
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,320
A fever?

247
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
That sounds serious.

248
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
I was wondering if Tingting is here.

249
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,680
She hid Shanwen the other time.

250
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,440
I wonder if he's hiding her this time.

251
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,520
Tingting isn't here.

252
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,800
I contacted her classmates,
but they don't know where she is either.

253
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,560
I tried calling Shanwen,

254
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,360
but he didn't answer my calls either.

255
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Are they playing some sort of game?

256
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,400
Tingting… really isn't here.

257
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,280
No worries.
I'll head upstairs and ask him about it.

258
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,240
- Is it this way?
- James.

259
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Shanwen.

260
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,840
Is Tingting in there with you?

261
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,600
James. He really needs to rest.

262
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,880
Shanwen.

263
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
Tingting,
can you come out if you're in there?

264
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,080
We agreed to never go to bed angry.

265
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,960
If you're feeling angry,

266
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,600
it's all my fault.

267
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,120
Can you come out now?

268
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,040
Shanwen. Is Tingting in there with you?

269
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
- Shanwen.
- Uncle James.

270
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,080
Tingting isn't in here.

271
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,320
Tingting.

272
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,520
What's going on?

273
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,200
No matter how angry she is,
she would never miss a church service.

274
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm sorry, James.

275
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,200
I really have a lot of things to do.

276
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

277
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,640
Please tell me immediately
if you have any news about Tingting.

278
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,400
Shanwen.

279
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
Please tell me immediately
if there's anything.

280
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,480
Are you all right?

282
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
You look a little pale.

283
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,200
I guess I'm a little tired.

284
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
You should rest early.

285
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,360
Also, tell me immediately
if you have any news about Tingting.

286
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
All right then.

287
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,360
- Uncle Hua.
- Hey.

288
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,400
Officer Lin, do you want breakfast?

289
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm fine.
Did you manage to find the video?

290
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
I did.

291
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
Luckily, my friend didn't delete it.
Take a look.

292
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,680
How is it? Is it useful?

293
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,840
The video captured someone,

294
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,560
but it's not very clear.

295
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,840
So, it isn't useful to you?

296
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,760
No worries. Thanks, Uncle Hua.

297
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,720
I'll transfer the video to my phone.

298
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Sure.
I hope it can help you find the murderer.

299
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
Can you make it any clearer?

300
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,400
It's too grainy.

301
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,800
This is the best I can do.

302
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,200
Baozi.

303
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,520
Who's looking for me?

304
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
Pastor Zhang.

305
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,480
- Officer.
- Please take a seat.

306
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,040
I heard you filed
a police report yesterday.

307
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,800
Has your daughter gone missing?

308
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,600
It's been three days.

309
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,000
She hasn't come home.

310
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,160
She hasn't answered
any of my calls either.

311
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,520
What happened when you last saw her?

312
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,800
We had a big fight.

313
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,720
She might still be fuming.

314
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,240
People who leave home in such situations

315
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,360
will usually return home after a week.

316
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,400
Don't worry too much.

317
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
Okay. Officer…

318
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
I'm a pastor.

319
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,160
I can sense certain things.

320
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
I don't think she has run away from home.

321
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Something must have happened to her.

322
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
Are you suspecting
it's the Leap Day Killer?

323
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm not sure.

324
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,760
The Leap Day Killer targets…
girls who sleep around,

325
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
are involved in transactional sex…

326
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,120
and have premarital pregnancies.

327
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,920
That's not it then.

328
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,720
Tingting is not that kind of girl.

329
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
Actually,

330
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,520
I am suspecting someone else.

331
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,200
Who?

332
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,920
His name is Paul.

333
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,200
His full name is Guo Jinlong.

334
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,560
He was released from prison
a few days ago.

335
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,480
He's someone I know.

336
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,120
He didn't answer my calls.

337
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,840
When I went to his home,
I knocked and kicked on the door,

338
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,840
but nobody was there.

339
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,800
That feels very suspicious to me.

340
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,080
Why do you think
he would harm your daughter?

341
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
I think he wants to take revenge on me.

342
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,360
Don't worry.

343
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,800
I'll notify you immediately
if I have any news.

344
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Please help me.

345
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,160
I'm counting on you.

346
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,680
Can pastors drink alcohol?

347
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
Of course.

348
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,400
The first miracle of Jesus Christ
was turning water into wine.

349
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,360
That's good.

350
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
You don't need to spend money on alcohol.

351
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,600
I'll have another glass.

352
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,560
Get him a glass too.

353
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
Drink as much as you want.

354
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,640
It's my treat.

355
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Thank you.

356
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,520
It must be tiring being a pastor.

357
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,080
It must also be tiring
being the scion of a wealthy family.

358
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,960
Pastor James.

359
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,160
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

360
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
I broke my classmate's nose.

361
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm better than you.

362
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,840
I cheated on my wife.

363
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
I beat my father up once.

364
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,840
I'm still better.

365
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,160
I watched my own daughter do a striptease.

366
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
I'm completely rotten.

367
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,160
I feel like I'm the worst husband…

368
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,720
in the entire world.

369
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,400
I'm the worst father too.

370
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
Do you know who I hate the most?

371
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,320
It's probably yourself.

372
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,240
You're right.

373
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,520
I hate myself too.

374
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,160
When did you come back?

375
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,480
You can't even go
one day without drinking.

376
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,280
I want you to quit drinking… from now on.

377
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
I've brought Shanwen home.

378
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,600
You're so drunk. How are you
going to take care of him?

379
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,880
He was willing to come home?

380
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,480
Is he in his room?

381
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,440
He's not in the best mood right now.

382
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
Give him some space.

383
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,360
What happened?

384
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,600
Just let him rest.

385
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,000
Take good care of him.

386
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,080
Pay attention to him.

387
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,280
Don't let him harm himself again.

388
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,080
Why did he start to cut himself again?

389
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,560
Does he know what happened
between you and Cindy?

390
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,400
It has nothing to do with her.

391
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120
Allan.

392
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,640
When I'm not around,

393
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,480
you must protect Shanwen…

394
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,360
no matter what happens.

395
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
How do you expect me
to take care of and protect him

396
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,080
if you refuse to tell me what's going on?

397
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,840
Where are you going?

398
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,920
I'm going on a retreat
for a few days to create something.

399
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,840
Create something?
Did I hear you correctly?

400
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,600
You're still in the mood for that?

401
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,160
It's precisely at such times…

402
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,560
that I need to do it even more.

403
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
Your son needs you the most right now,

404
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
but you're thinking of going
on a retreat and creating something?

405
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,680
How can you be so selfish?

406
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,880
Shut your mouth
if you don't know anything.

407
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,760
Don't blame me for your mistakes.

408
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,760
Yes.

409
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm the only one at fault!

410
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,400
It's all my fault!

411
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,640
Let me tell you.

412
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
I'll take a DNA test.

413
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,320
I'll prove to you that
Sera's child doesn't belong to me!

414
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,120
Did you hear me?

415
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,920
<i>Is that you, Ruoyun?</i>

416
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,920
James.

417
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,920
<i>I can't feel…</i>

418
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,920
<i>I can't feel…</i>

419
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,280
<i>the thread that we talked about before.</i>

420
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
<i>It's broken.</i>

421
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>It has been three days</i>
<i>with no news of her.</i>

422
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,320
<i>Something must've happened to Tingting.</i>

423
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,160
<i>Did I tell you?</i>

424
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,720
<i>When my wife died,</i>

425
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,600
<i>it felt like a part of me</i>
<i>was taken away from me.</i>

426
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,920
<i>Tingting was the one</i>
<i>who gave me the will to live.</i>

427
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,280
<i>She's the one who made me whole again.</i>

428
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
<i>If…</i>

429
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,720
<i>If something really happens to her,</i>

430
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
<i>I don't know what I'll do.</i>

431
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,040
Shanwen.

432
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,680
Your mother brought
you home all of a sudden.

433
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,960
Something must've happened.

434
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Can you tell me what happened?

435
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,800
I'm sure you have many questions for me.

436
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,360
Rest assured,

437
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,280
I'll be honest with you.

438
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,719
I cheated on your mother before.

439
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
I broke her heart.

440
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,199
She ignored me after that.

441
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,840
I felt very lonely,

442
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
so I visited a pornographic website.

443
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,880
I really didn't know that
the performer was your sister.

444
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,640
On the day that she was attacked,

445
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,440
she discovered…

446
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,240
that I was the person…

447
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,040
who paid for exclusive time with her.

448
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,600
I'm truly a monster.

449
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,600
Why?

450
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Why are all of you so disgusting?

451
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,160
Even Sis, who was like an angel…

452
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
was equally disgusting.

453
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,040
Why?

454
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,200
Why?

455
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,280
On the surface, you're a philanthropist,
and Mom's an artist.

456
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Actually,

457
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
all of you are monsters.

458
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,840
So,

459
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,840
I've become like all of you.

460
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,080
I've become a monster too.

461
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm a monster.

462
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,320
I'm a monster.

463
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Shanwen.

464
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,800
Actually, a mother who kills…

465
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,880
will have a son who kills as well.

466
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,440
Pastor, can I have a chat with you?

467
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,800
I received a call from the police.

468
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,520
I went down to the police station

469
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,120
to assist them
in Tingting's disappearance.

470
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,720
Assist?

471
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,640
You'd better explain yourself.

472
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,240
What did you do to her?

473
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,160
I can understand
why you'd misunderstand me.

474
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,520
You think that I hate you
and want to take revenge.

475
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,960
So, you think that I have something
to do with her disappearance.

476
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,560
When I was in prison,

477
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,000
I met many prisoners.

478
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,320
They've been in and out
of prison many times.

479
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
They don't know
what lies in their futures.

480
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,680
However, over those 21 days,

481
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,760
you were the one
who helped me figure out my future.

482
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,240
I don't know what you're trying to say.

483
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,080
What I mean to say
is that you were the one

484
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,240
who helped me to wise up
before I committed a worse crime.

485
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,680
It's a fact that I did something wrong.

486
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,520
I don't need to make any excuses.

487
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,120
I'm very grateful to you.

488
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,120
So, I was wrong to suspect you.

489
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm sorry, Paul.

490
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,000
I didn't want things to turn out this way.

491
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,880
But Tingting has been missing for days,
and I couldn't reach you by phone.

492
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
During the service on Sunday,

493
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,680
I suddenly received a call telling me
that Grandpa had a fall.

494
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,320
He was admitted
into the Intensive Care Unit,

495
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,080
and my phone was switched off
these past few days.

496
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,680
Then, did you inform the church?

497
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,640
Is he feeling better?

498
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,880
He's fine and has been transferred
to a regular ward.

499
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,200
I want to thank you
for taking care of him these three weeks.

500
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,400
That's what pastors do.

501
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,240
They always put others first.

502
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
If the police didn't inform me,

503
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,360
I wouldn't have known
that Tingting was missing.

504
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,920
On the day that she went missing,

505
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
I spoke with her on the phone.

506
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,840
You did?

507
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,600
Did she say anything?

508
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
I wanted to have a meal with her that day

509
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,640
and ask her to help me
think of a way to thank you.

510
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,560
She said that she would
call me again on Sunday.

511
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,400
Then… did she say where she was?

512
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,400
I did ask her, but she…

513
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,600
Oh, I believe she was near the wooded area
where her cell group often goes to.

514
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,880
The wooded area?

515
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
I've gathered my friends to help out.

516
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,120
We plan to search for her
after we distribute the food.

517
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,280
Is that okay?

518
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,200
Of course.

519
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,800
Thank you, Paul.

520
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,640
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

521
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,120
Don't worry about it.

522
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,000
Thank you, Paul.

523
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,400
Hey, Ruoyun.

524
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,880
I know Tingting's last known location.

525
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
- Tingting!
- Tingting!

526
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
- Tingting!
- Tingting!

527
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,000
- Tingting!
- Tingting!

528
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,720
Tingting!

529
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,440
Does this belong to Tingting?

530
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Tingting!

531
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,320
Where are you?

532
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,480
Tingting!

533
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,000
Tingting.
