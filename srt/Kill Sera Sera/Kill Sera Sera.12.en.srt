00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,640
WHO KILLED HER?

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,920
IT TURNS OUT THAT ALL OF US
HAD A HAND IN IT. - SHAW MAY'S FAMILY

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,440
‪THE STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
‪ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURE COINCIDENCE

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,040
JAMES

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,880
YOU HAVE ONE MISSED CALL

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,720
Who's calling?

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,440
It's Uncle James.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,560
Put him on speakerphone.
We'll speak with him together.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Uncle James.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,560
Shanwen. Is your mother with you?

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,680
She isn't.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,520
What's the matter?

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
I… Allan.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm at Ruoyun's place now.
I see her car parked outside,

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
but no one answered the door
when I pressed the doorbell.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,560
She should be home.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
What's going on?

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
She's not answering the door.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,320
She might be taking a shower.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,440
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm taking Shanwen home now.
He has the keys.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,800
Wait for me to arrive.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,360
<i>Okay, I'll wait for you here.</i>

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
All right. See you in a bit.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,200
You seem popular.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,600
Someone came to look for you.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,040
Is it a man?

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,960
My mother was popular too.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Many men came to look for her.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,320
THURSDAY
FEBRUARY 28

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
Good job.

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
Lili.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,200
Your daughter is becoming prettier.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,600
What's your name,

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,200
Little Princess?

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,720
I'm talking to you.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Little Princess.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,560
Her name is Baozhu.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,840
When she's of legal age,
you'll be the first to name your price.

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,280
I can't wait that long.

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Come on. Come.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's go inside.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
- Let me go!
- Let's go inside.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
Let's go inside.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,720
Mommy!

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,200
Help me, Mommy!

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,320
Help me, Mommy!

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Mommy!

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Let me go!

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,200
Let me go!

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,160
Save me, Mommy!

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
Mommy!

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,280
Save me!

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
Save me!

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
<i>I don't blame her though.</i>

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,360
That's because I know…

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,240
she was suffering.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,880
I was the only one…

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
who could end her suffering.

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
Come eat!

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
It's time to eat.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
Happy birthday.

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
You spent my hard-earned money like this?

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Eat!

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,440
FRIDAY
FEBRUARY 29

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Thankfully, I only celebrate my birthday
once every four years.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I don't have to be reminded
of it every year.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,280
I shouldn't have even been born.

69
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,600
XIFENG WINE

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
Mommy.

71
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,880
You won't be celebrating
any more birthdays.

72
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
You don't have to suffer anymore.

73
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,400
That day,

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,840
my mother heard me scream
and shout for help.

75
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,200
After the ordeal ended,

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
she didn't…

77
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
even ask me,

78
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,600
"How are you?"

79
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,680
On the eve of the leap day,

80
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
you posted an in memoriam notice
to mark four years since Sera died.

81
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,080
You even asked her,

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
"How are you?"

83
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,040
SUN SERA
DECEASED FEBRUARY 29, 2020

84
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,920
HOW ARE YOU?

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
<i>You even said that…</i>

86
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,520
<i>you would give up your life…</i>

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
<i>in exchange for getting her back.</i>

88
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,960
<i>I witnessed a mother's agony.</i>

89
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>I was really moved by you.</i>

90
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
It's because of you that…

91
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
I didn't kill Apple.

92
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,600
In the end,

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,080
someone decided to be a copycat killer.

94
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,360
She succeeded in provoking me to anger,

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,880
so I still killed Apple in the end!

96
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,680
I later guessed that…

97
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,640
the copycat killer might be you.

98
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,720
<i>I tried to test you.</i>

99
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,280
<i>I deliberately left my DNA on the letter.</i>

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,440
Mrs. Shaw. What's the matter?

101
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
<i>I can't believe you went</i>
<i>to turn yourself in.</i>

102
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>You wanted to give up your life</i>
<i>in exchange for mine.</i>

103
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
<i>I was moved by you once again.</i>

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,880
<i>I found a selfless mother.</i>

105
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Something urgent came up.
I'll make a move first.

106
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,920
However, you left the police station! Why?

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,600
I was so angry and disappointed!

108
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,120
That night, I followed you again.

109
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
<i>I saw you…</i>

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,080
<i>leaving with a big suitcase.</i>

111
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
What was… in your luggage?

112
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,680
Was it…

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
another girl's body?

114
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,200
The second one is easier
after killing your first one, isn't it?

115
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
Who was that girl?

116
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,400
Is she the missing Zhang Tingting?

117
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,560
Turn yourself in.

118
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
You can't run away from this.

119
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
From the moment I stepped in here,

120
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,840
I had no intention to leave.

121
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,880
What I'm looking for… is an answer.

122
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,400
A mother is willing to face
the death sentence

123
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,800
in exchange for the murderer
who killed her daughter.

124
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,640
What made her change her mind?

125
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,360
My instinct tells me…

126
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,840
that she did it for her child…

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,080
that the person
who killed Zhang Tingting is…

128
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,320
Sun Shanwen.

129
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,280
You rushed home…

130
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,720
to help him get rid
of the body and the evidence.

131
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,560
Am I right?

132
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,480
‪Huh?

133
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
It's impossible!

134
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
How can such a mother exist?

135
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,200
There's no mother in this world…

136
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,960
who doesn't love her own child,

137
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
including…

138
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,640
your mother.

139
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
Who are you to make such a conclusion?

140
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
You didn't even know her.

141
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,680
You didn't even know her!

142
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,200
It's because I'm a mother too.

143
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,000
How far will you go…

144
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
to protect your child?

145
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,080
I'd kill you if I had to.

146
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,280
Shan…

147
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,200
Leave! Leave, Shanwen!
Don't worry about me.

148
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,200
Hurry up and leave!

149
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,560
Ruby. Shanwen.

150
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,480
You have a noble mother.

151
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,080
How are you?

152
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,240
<i>I've imagined many different ways</i>
<i>of killing Sera's murderer.</i>

153
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
<i>I would imagine the scene of them</i>
<i>dying in front of me one day.</i>

154
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,440
<i>It has driven me in the last four years.</i>

155
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,200
<i>However,</i>

156
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,280
<i>when Ruby died in front of me,</i>

157
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,400
<i>I didn't feel any elation at all.</i>

158
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,880
<i>I realized that… she's just…</i>

159
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,080
<i>another character in this tragedy.</i>

160
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,360
<i>Like us,</i>

161
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>she's been drifting through life,</i>

162
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>feeling small…</i>

163
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,840
<i>and in immense pain.</i>

164
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,200
<i>She craves for the love</i>
<i>that she rightfully deserves.</i>

165
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,880
<i>Death… has fulfilled love.</i>

LEAP DAY MURDER CASE - SUN SERA

167
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,800
<i>We've all made mistakes…</i>

168
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,200
<i>and have paid a price for them.</i>

169
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,080
<i>In the process, we discover that…</i>

170
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,520
<i>the hardest person to love…</i>

171
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
<i>is actually… ourselves.</i>

173
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,040
Ha!

174
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,280
Not again!

175
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,880
Master, your instinct is inaccurate again.

176
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,480
After having solved the case,
you're very free to gossip, aren't you?

177
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Master.

178
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
Give me a few years.

179
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll be truly free then.

180
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,360
You've done it?

181
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,280
Don't worry. The punishment
shouldn't be too serious.

182
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,000
However, you had a hit-and-run,
withheld crucial information,

183
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,760
broke the law knowingly
and had sex with an underage girl.

184
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,720
Master, you're so good
at consoling people.

185
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm glad.

186
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,360
I'll have to go now.

187
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,480
When I'm out, I'll teach you how to fish.

188
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,480
I'll teach you some tricks too.

189
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,680
My father gave this to me.

190
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,200
Look after it for me.

191
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,440
Return it to me after you're out.

192
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,320
Master.

193
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Did Sera's child…

194
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
belong to me?

195
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,840
DNA ANALYSIS: 99,99% MATCH

196
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
Master…

197
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
is the child mine?

198
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,640
<i>One thing we can be grateful for is that</i>

199
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,920
<i>you'll always find someone who loves you</i>

200
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,680
<i>and is willing to reach out a hand,</i>

201
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,080
<i>even at your lowest point.</i>

202
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,240
The baby camel asked its mother, "Mommy.

203
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,240
Why do we have such long eyelashes?"

204
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,200
The mother camel replies,

205
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,800
"They can help us see where we're going

206
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,560
when there's sand in the air."

207
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,000
The baby camel asked its mother again,

208
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
"Mommy, why do we have such ugly backs?"

209
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,120
The mother camel replies,
"Those are called humps.

210
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,000
They can help us store
a large amount of water

211
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,600
and prevent us from dying
from thirst in the desert."

212
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,720
The baby camel asked its mother again,

213
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,320
"Why do we have
such thick soles on our feet?"

214
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,760
The mother replies,

215
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,320
"They help us
to not sink in the soft sand,

216
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,240
"so that we can walk for long distances."

217
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
The baby camel was elated.

218
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,720
He said, "I didn't know
we were so impressive!

219
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,040
Why are we still in the zoo then?"

220
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,320
I came here today… to bid farewell to you.

221
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,080
I want to take Shanwen to Australia
to start a new life there.

222
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,480
I'm going to look for my desert.

223
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,680
That's understandable.

224
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,040
You shouldn't be trapped in the zoo.

225
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,720
Is Shanwen doing all right?

226
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,480
It's better to start anew
in a new environment.

227
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,960
Will you continue
to create sculptures in Australia?

228
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,000
When I was creating my final sculpture,

229
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,880
I told myself that…

230
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I would never sculpt again.

231
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,440
You're very talented.

232
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,080
It would be a shame to give it up.

233
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,480
Your final sculpture
must be very meaningful then.

234
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
Can I see your final sculpture?

235
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
It must be something unforgettable.

236
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,400
I might never see it again in the future.

237
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,720
Is this it?

238
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,880
That's right.

239
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,120
Can I see this sculpture?

240
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,920
It's a failed sculpture.

241
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,880
I feel like… it's calling out to me.

242
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,480
I want to see it.

243
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,200
<i>Ting Ting Yu Li</i>.

244
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,360
What did you say?

245
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
Slim and graceful.

246
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm sorry.

247
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,560
I helped you to name this sculpture.

248
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
I feel like…

249
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm really drawn to it.

250
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,680
Let's name it…

251
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,920
<i>Ting Ting Yu Li</i> then.

252
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,120
It's a beautiful name.

253
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,880
I'm pretty sure this is
your real final sculpture.

254
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,680
I can't hide anything from you.

255
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Can I ask a favor of you?

256
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,000
Sell it to me.

257
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,920
It's not for sale.

258
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
That makes sense.

259
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
This is your final sculpture after all.

260
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
I'll gift it to you then.

261
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,800
Thank you.

262
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,600
<i>We're all imprisoned.</i>

263
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,880
<i>Hatred, guilt, fear,</i>

264
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
<i>accusations and longing.</i>

265
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,800
<i>We're tightly bound by an invisible rope.</i>

266
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,680
<i>We live our lives as if nothing happened.</i>

267
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,800
<i>Then, we put…</i>

268
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,560
<i>one lock after another…</i>

269
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
<i>on our cry for mercy.</i>

270
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,880
Daddy made this for you.
It's your favorite sandwich.

271
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,080
Have some.

272
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,320
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

273
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,760
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

274
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,160
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

275
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,280
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

276
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,200
Make a wish first.

277
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,280
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TINGTING AND SHANWEN

278
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,080
Shanwen.

279
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,080
Snap out of it already.

280
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,480
Hurry and pack up your things.

281
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,160
How did you…

282
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,000
How did you… get rid of…

283
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,880
her body?

284
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,280
In order to move on,

285
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,280
you have to put the past behind.

286
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
Don't ask further questions.

287
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,120
I mentioned this at the previous meeting.

288
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,360
Let me take at least half a year off.

289
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,600
I can't continue to put on a front.

290
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,000
How do you expect me
to give a sermon in this state?

291
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,600
I'm begging you.

292
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,320
Someone's at the door. That's all for now.

293
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,680
Shanwen.

294
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Come in. Take off your shoes and come in.

295
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,040
Did you come here by yourself?

296
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,800
Come in.

297
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,480
Uncle…

298
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,200
I have something to tell you.

299
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,520
Come on in then. What's the matter?

300
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,120
It's all right.

301
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,600
We're all feeling stressed
about Tingting's disappearance.

302
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,800
I know that.

303
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,120
Your mother told me that

304
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,280
you're going to start
a new life in a new place.

305
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,480
That's a good thing!

306
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,680
God will bless you. I'll bless you too.

307
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
I have something to show you.
It's a gift from your mother.

308
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,720
Come in and have a seat.

309
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,880
This is it.

310
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,199
It's a gift from your mother.

311
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,280
It's her final sculpture.
I named it <i>Ting Ting Yu Li.</i>

312
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,000
That's because it reminds me
every day that…

313
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,840
Tingting is still alive.

314
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,400
<i>How did you…</i>

315
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,800
get rid of…

316
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,560
her body?

317
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,600
<i>She'll definitely come home.</i>

318
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,800
Tingting will definitely come home safely.

319
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,440
She'll definitely come home.

320
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,480
She'll be slim and graceful like always.

321
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,800
Un… Uncle.

322
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm sorry.

323
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,520
I'm sorry.

324
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,240
<i>Sun Shanwen!</i>

325
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,120
<i>Sun Shanwen!</i>

326
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,240
<i>Sun Shanwen.</i>

327
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,280
A murderer deserves the death sentence!

328
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,480
Don't you know that?

329
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,880
I'll turn myself in.

330
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,080
No! You're still young!

331
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,840
What if you're given the death sentence?

332
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,440
<i>Sun Shanwen!</i>

333
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
<i>Sun Shanwen.</i>

334
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
<i>Sun Shanwen.</i>

335
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,760
<i>Sun Shanwen.</i>

336
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,480
<i>Sun Shanwen.</i>

337
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,080
- <i>Sun Shanwen…</i>
- <i>Sun Shanwen…</i>

338
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,160
Tingting.

339
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,200
Tingting. Tingting!

340
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm sorry, Tingting!

341
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,520
I'm sorry, Tingting!

342
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Tingting.

343
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
<i>How do you move on…</i>

344
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,080
<i>if you're carrying such a heavy burden?</i>

345
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
<i>Freedom…</i>

346
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,600
<i>seems so far away.</i>

347
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Shanwen.

348
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
What's wrong?

349
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,680
<i>I can't pretend any longer.</i>

350
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm sorry.

352
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,200
<i>I love you,</i>

353
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
<i>Mommy.</i>

354
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,880
CENTRAL POLICE STATION

355

356
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,200
<i>This is a breaking news report.</i>

357
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,920
<i>There has been a development</i>

358
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>in the case of the missing girl,</i>
<i>Zhang Tingting.</i>

359

<i>Zhang Tingting's classmate, Sun Shanwen,</i>

<i>turned himself in at the police station</i>
<i>at around 8:00 p.m. yesterday.</i>

<i>He admitted to involuntary manslaughter.</i>

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,120
<i>in the home of renowned sculptor,</i>
<i>Shaw May,</i>

367
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,680
<i>who is the mother of the Sun siblings.</i>

368
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,800
<i>James.</i>

369
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm sorry.

370
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,520
I'm… I'm sorry.

371
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,400
<i>Deep down, what we all crave most is love.</i>

372
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,560
<i>However, what we seek isn't love.</i>

373
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,440
FOUR YEARS LATER

374
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,400
ACCEPTANCE AND LETTING GO

375
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,600
When we're going through a difficult time,

376
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,800
those around us often say,

377
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,000
"Let it go."

378
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,480
While letting go is important,

379
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,800
we often neglect…

380
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,000
to accept something…

381
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,320
before letting it go.

382
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,520
ACCEPT THOSE WHO HAVE HURT YOU.
ACCEPT PAST MISTAKES.

383
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,680
We must learn to accept those who hurt us,

384
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,800
the mistakes we made…

385
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,360
and the setbacks in life.

386
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,760
We must learn to accept illness,

387
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,280
death,

388
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,440
who you truly are

389
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,840
and difficult times.

390
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,200
This seemingly ugly blessing

391
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,880
will make us a much stronger person.

392
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
<i>Who killed Sera?</i>

393
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,240
<i>Over the last few years,</i>

394
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,040
<i>the answer to this question</i>
<i>became more vague.</i>

395
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,360
<i>In this very moment,</i>

396
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,480
<i>there's only one thing I know.</i>

397
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,680
<i>Death…</i>

398
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,280
<i>has fulfilled love.</i>
