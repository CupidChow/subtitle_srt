00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
THE BETTER YOU ARE AT KEEPING SECRETS,

2
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,560
THE BETTER THE ILLUSIONS YOU CAN CREATE.
SUN ALLAN

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,000
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

4
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
Didn't a university student
get murdered a few days ago?

5
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Be careful when you're outside.

6
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,880
Could this have been done
by the Leap Day Killer?

7
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,320
All my classmates
have been talking about him.

8
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
They found a severed leg.

9
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,280
That's right.
It's near to where we always have coffee!

10
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Professor Huang,

11
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,240
why were you at a hotel with Cindy?

12
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,000
Were you giving her private tutoring?

13
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,440
Officers, I beg of you.

14
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,640
Please don't reveal my identity.

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll fully cooperate
with your investigation.

16
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm begging you. All right?

17
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Cindy isn't even
a student from your school.

18
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,760
How did you get to know each other?

19
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
I knew her through a website.

20
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,520
That night at the hotel
was the only time I met her.

21
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I didn't kill her. I swear!

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
What website is that?

23
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,040
For Your…

24
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,960
For Your Eyes Only.

25
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,720
It's a popular livestreaming website.

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
What was her username?

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,640
Cindylicious.

28
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,120
How long have you known her?

29
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,520
A little more than two months.

30
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,400
She agreed to meet me
only after I sent her many gifts.

31
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,280
We arranged to meet at the hotel.

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,640
She left hurriedly after we did the deed.

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,480
I stayed overnight
and left at 11:00 a.m. the next day.

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
Hence, I couldn't have killed her.

35
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
You mentioned
that you met her for the first time.

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,840
‪Yes.

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,200
How did you send her so many gifts then?

38
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
Do you have her address?

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,320
I was referring
to virtual gifts on the website.

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
Virtual what? Why do you have to…

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
CINDYLICIOUS

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,840
GOLDEN MIGHTY KNIGHT

44
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
Within seven years,

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
this Professor Huang followed
more than 800 girls on this website.

46
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
His surname is Huang after all.

47
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,480
The higher someone's social standing is,

48
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,600
- the filthier they are.
- Hey!

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
You're the filthy one!

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,160
Hey. Throw that away for me.

51
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,320
Do it yourself.

52
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
- Where did it land?
- It's behind me.

53
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
These are their profile pictures?

54
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,440
Are they minors?

55
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,320
These men are taking such a huge risk.

56
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,120
Hey!

57
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
All right. Enjoy your browsing.
I shouldn't spread it to you.

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
I'll go home and rest now.

59
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
What video are you watching
instead of doing your work?

60
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,040
It's nothing.

61
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Zoom in on that.

62
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
She has the same tattoo as Sera.

63
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
Find out who she is.

64
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,880
Hello?

65
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
All right. We'll head over there now.

66
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
Someone found a severed limb. Let's go.

67
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,760
<i>Dehui, I heard you helped your</i>
<i>older brother clean up his mess recently.</i>

68
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,800
Honestly speaking, if it wasn't
to save face for my late father,

69
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
I would've sacked him a long time ago.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,080
The reputation of the Sun Group
lies in your hands.

71
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,320
I'm focused on the bigger picture.

72
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
- I must not be soft-hearted.
- That's right.

73
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Hence, I really need
the board members to support me.

74
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,720
We definitely will!

75
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
That goes without saying.

76
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,720
- Allan.
- Hey, Mr. Deng.

77
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,160
Where's your wife?
She didn't come with you tonight?

78
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,480
She's not feeling well.

79
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
I understand.

80
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,400
She put so much effort
into her exhibition.

81
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
She must be tired.

82
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I apologize.
Her exhibition affected you negatively.

83
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Frankly speaking,

84
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,800
I was very angry when it first launched.

85
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,000
However, after giving it some thought,

86
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,920
she paid a price as well.

87
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,640
Some reporters wish to interview me.

88
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm currently in a tight spot.

89
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Should I publicize this recording?

90
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,720
"Famous Artist Shaw May…

91
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,800
Sold Her Body to Hold Exhibition."

92
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,880
It won't hurt me since I'm a widower.

93
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,360
However, I wonder
what people would think of…

94
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,000
your family.

95
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,120
Allan.

96
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,360
What should I do?

97
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
I didn't know you were such a tramp!

98
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Come here!

99
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
Shanwen!

100
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
- Let go of me!
- Tell me!

101
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Let go!

102
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
- Let…
- Tell me!

103
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,760
- Let go!
- How much did he pay you?

104
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
- Tell me!
- Shanwen!

105
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,120
He can afford it, but so can I!

106
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Shanwen!

107
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
I didn't know you were such a tramp!

108
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
I didn't think you were so filthy.

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,840
You're filthier than me!

110
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
<i>Hubby.</i>

111
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm home.

112
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
- Hubby.
- Hey.

113
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,400
- You're done with work?
- That's right.

114
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,120
I was very productive this time.

115
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,520
I created many works
that I'm very satisfied with.

116
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,320
Congratulations.

117
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,320
Did you just come back from Taiwan?

118
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,520
That's right.

119
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
Weren't you supposed
to come back yesterday?

120
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400
I stayed an extra day.

121
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
- How are the kids?
- They're doing great. Don't worry.

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,880
It's been tough on you these few days.

123
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll make it up to you guys

124
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
by being a good mother and wife.

125
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,080
What if I want you to be
a good wife right now?

126
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
Whose hair is this?

127
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,480
I…

128
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,960
I briefly hugged Ms. Hong
after our meeting ended.

129
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,600
It must be her hair.

130
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,720
Would she use such a cheap perfume?

131
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,040
These are the clothes you wore to bed.

132
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,480
Who are you trying to deceive?

133
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Is this the reason
you came back a day later?

134
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
- No…
- Don't lie to me.

135
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
I…

136
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,600
When I met with Mr. Lan for business,

137
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,000
he invited a few ladies to drink with us.

138
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,520
- I drank too much.
- Did you have sex?

139
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,520
I drank too much,
so I wasn't thinking straight.

140
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,680
I asked if you had sex with anyone!

141
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,480
Why did you come in here?

142
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,360
Go back to your room.

143
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,160
I told you the truth about what happened.

144
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
Why won't you forgive me?

145
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,280
You betrayed our marriage.

146
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Can you give me another chance?

147
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,520
You're filthy.

148
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,400
Don't you dare touch me.

She died in a similar manner as Sera.

156
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,280
Master, do you think this
is related to Cindy's case?

157
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,400
We've found two bodies so far.

158
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,000
They were found just four days apart.

159
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,720
We must find the other body parts
before coming to any conclusions.

160
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,280
The killer dumped the severed leg
in a crowded place.

161
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,560
He's very daring.

162
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Dad, I made your coffee.

163
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,040
I bought your stuff already.

164
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,920
Is this correct?

165
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,440
It's 35 centimeters, for overnight use.

166
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,920
Dad. It's the short one that has run out.

167
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
No worries.
I'll get it myself after school.

168
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,720
I get distracted even when buying stuff.

169
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
What's wrong?

170
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
Do you know there's been another murder?

171
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Be careful when you're outside.

172
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,440
Don't go to any quiet places.

173
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,800
Also, don't come home too late.

174
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,200
- Dad, you're very long-winded.
- There's more.

175
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,920
Can you stop looking down at your phone?

176
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,880
You have to be aware
of your surroundings, all right?

177
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
Understood.

178
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,920
That reminds me. Give me your phone.

179
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,920
- What for?
- Give it to me.

180
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,040
There's a new app.

181
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
Let me download
this location tracker for you.

182
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,920
I'll know where you are at all times.

183
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
This is the app.

184
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,920
Leave it on at all times.
I want to know where you are.

185
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,640
Is that understood?

186
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,480
Dad, you're being a little extreme.

187
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,520
I'm trying to protect you.

188
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
Hey, Grandpa!

189
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,360
Paul has returned?

190
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,160
Sure thing. I'll be right over.
Don't let him leave.

191
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,760
All right.

192
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,800
Shanwen. Come quick.

193
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,120
I've prepared your favorite:
pancakes with fruits.

194
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
Shanwen!

195
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,120
I've told you many times that you need
to have breakfast before going to school.

196
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,440
Shanwen.

197
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
Pancakes with fruits was
Sera's favorite, not mine.

198
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
Shanwen.

199
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,040
You won't get any cars at this hour.
Get in.

200
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,680
Sun Shanwen!

201
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
You'll be late for school
if you don't get in now.

202
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,480
I won't drive off unless you get in.

203
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,760
You'll get lightheaded
on an empty stomach.

204
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,920
Here.

205
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,640
The police report is out.

206
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,720
The semen does not belong to you.

207
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,560
Why did Cindy look for you
on the day that she died?

208
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,400
You're still considered a suspect!

209
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,080
I can't help you
if you don't tell me the truth.

210
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,840
I'm talking to you!

211
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
Sun Shanwen!

212
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
What's the meaning of this?

213
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,480
For how long are you planning
to treat me like this?

214
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,160
What did I do to make you hate me so much?

215
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,120
Can you answer me?

216
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,720
I can barely get you to say a word to me!

217
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,040
What did you do wrong?

218
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,520
Everything is your fault.

219
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
That year, you hit Sera
because of something she said!

220
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,600
This is all your fault!

221
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,240
It's because you refuse
to have sex with him!

222
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Why did you have to call the reporters
to come to witness your fake love?

223
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,320
Why put on an act?

224
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,920
- You even implicated Shanwen and I!
- Shut your mouth!

225
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
If you don't love each other,
then get a divorce!

226
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,400
Sera!

227
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You'll never understand
the problems we adults face.

228
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,960
Is that it?

229
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,320
I don't know why you and Dad
not having sex made Sera so upset,

230
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
but if you didn't hit her,
she wouldn't have run away!

231
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,560
If she hadn't run away,
she wouldn't have been murdered!

232
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,680
You even slept with another man.

233
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
You really disgust me.

234
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
Who told you that?

235
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,440
Shanwen.

236
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,520
I've said a mountain of words to you.

237
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,480
Are you satisfied?

238
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,520
- Grandpa.
- He's in his room.

239
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,480
How did you know I was home?

240
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,720
It was me. I called Pastor James.

241
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,240
Pastor says you have to repent
if you make a mistake!

242
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,520
Grandpa, I'm doing fine.
What mistake did I make?

243
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,760
My only mistake was being too honest
during our counseling session.

244
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,680
Paul.
You've been hiding for a month already.

245
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,800
Did you feel at peace during this month?

246
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,960
Let me tell you something.

247
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,520
Avoidance is a cowardly behavior.

248
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,040
Facing your problems will set you free.

249
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,920
It's the only path to take.
Do you understand?

250
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
I've been seriously reflecting
on my mistake.

251
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,560
Why do I still have
to turn myself in to the police?

252
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,480
It's a principle we counselors adhere to.

253
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,120
When I know you've committed a crime,

254
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm obliged to report it to the police.

255
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
Is it that serious?

256
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,720
Ah Long can't get arrested by the police!

257
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Grandpa, don't worry
and listen to me first.

258
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,320
Paul is a first-time offender.

259
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
First-time offenders
won't get into any trouble.

260
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,280
We have to obey the laws of the land.

261
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,160
We must bear the consequences
if we do something wrong.

262
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,640
Then… are there no other alternatives
besides turning myself in to the police?

263
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,880
How about…

264
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
we go to the shop and look for the owner?

265
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,240
You'll apologize to him
and seek his forgiveness.

266
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,840
Are you sure he'll forgive me
and not call the police?

267
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
We must have faith in God.

268
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,920
God is gracious. God will protect us.

269
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,040
I'll accompany you.

270
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
We'll do the right thing together.

271
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,240
Sir.

272
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,840
Hello, sir.

273
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,000
Sir.

274
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm sorry, sir. I was in the wrong.

275
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,120
I shouldn't have stolen your things.

276
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
I'll return this to you.
Please forgive me.

277
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,520
Sir, he stole this supplement
because his grandfather has weak knees.

278
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,200
He knows that it's very effective.

279
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,200
He wanted to buy it,
but he didn't have any money.

280
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,120
He stole it in a moment of poor judgment.

281
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,520
He really regretted his actions
after he went back home.

282
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,040
Could you give him
a second chance on behalf of God?

283
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,280
If you were truly remorseful,
you wouldn't have waited for a month.

284
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,920
- Ah Jiao, call the police!
- Sir.

285
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Sir!

286
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,800
CENTRAL POLICE STATION

287
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,080
<i>The great artist</i>
<i>can't be touched by anyone?</i>

288
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,800
I didn't know you were such a tramp!

289
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
<i>I didn't think you were so filthy.</i>

290
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,760
<i>You're filthier than me!</i>

291
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,240
You even slept with another man.

292
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
You really disgust me.

293
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,960
POLICE

294
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,960
<i>I told you the truth about what happened.</i>

295
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,200
Why won't you forgive me?

296
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,320
You betrayed our marriage.

297
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,400
Can you give me another chance?

298
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,600
You're filthy.

299
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
Don't you dare touch me.

300
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,560
How did this happen?

301
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,600
You were supposed to help us!

302
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
Stop arguing with him, Grandpa.

303
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,560
I shouldn't have admitted to him
that I stole something.

304
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,120
So much for God being gracious.

305
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,600
Did he give me a second chance? He didn't!

306
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,040
Excuse me, are these your keys?

307
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
- I found them on the road.
- Thank you.

308
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,880
Are you Shaw May?

309
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
Shanwen's mother?

310
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
How did you know I'm his mother?

311
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
I'm his classmate Zhang Tingting's father.

312
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,000
I heard from Tingting
that you're a famous sculptor.

313
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
It's nice to meet you.

314
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,080
I'm Zhang James.

315
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Shanwen is very artistically talented.

316
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,720
Tingting showed me his work.

317
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,600
It was very well done.
He's indeed your son.

318
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,720
You seem to have a close relationship
with your daughter.

319
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,680
We're all right.

320
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,400
At their age,
they just want to become adults.

321
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,920
What we can do is talk to them
and share more with them.

322
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,760
We try to play the role of a friend.

323
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,160
In my case,
Shanwen shuts me out completely.

324
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,080
He treats me as the enemy.

325
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,280
Perhaps, they need time to build up trust.

326
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,760
Love is all about patience.

327
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm sure Shanwen will feel
the love you have toward him.

328
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,560
- Love is all about patience?
- That's right.

329
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,480
Love is all about patience and gratitude.

330
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,600
Gratitude?

331
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,640
- That's easier said than done.
- It's not easy indeed.

332
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,320
That's because we all have expectations
when it comes to love.

333
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,640
When these expectations aren't met,
the love will slowly fade away.

334
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,680
I must have disappointed him greatly.

335
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,000
He hasn't addressed me
as "Mom" in three years.

336
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,720
I just greatly disappointed two people.

337
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,320
Sometimes, we can't grasp
the expectations people have of us.

338
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,320
This is very normal.

339
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,720
Do you know if Shanwen has
any friends at school?

340
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,040
I believe Tingting is his only friend.

341
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,800
She told me that
he mostly keeps to himself at school.

342
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,600
They only became friends after some time.

343
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,960
I hope she can help look out for him more.

344
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
That's not a problem at all.

345
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,720
What about this? Give me your phone.

346
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
I'll save Tingting's number in it.

347
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,840
You can call her whenever you need.

348
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
- Is that all right?
- Of course.

349
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,680
If it's all right with you,
I'll give you my number as well.

350
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,520
If Shanwen needs counseling,

351
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
our church runs a community care service.

352
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,360
Besides myself, we have
many other great counselors.

353
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,120
Thank you.

354
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,520
Thank you.

355
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,440
Whenever a tragedy happens,
everyone in the family is affected.

356
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Love is all about patience.

357
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,760
Don't give up. Hang in there.

358
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,760
<i>Whenever a tragedy happens,</i>

359
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,200

360
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,440

363
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,440
Don't give up. Hang in there.

364
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,280
What's wrong?

365
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,120
What happened?

366
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,960
I fought with my mother.

367
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,560
Why did you two fight?

368
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,520
I blamed her for causing
the death of my older sister.

369
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
Actually,

370
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm to blame too.

371
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
On the day my sister died,

372
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,120
I didn't stop her.

373
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,840
- I didn't ask her to stay.
- Sun Shanwen.

374
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,800
Sun Shanwen, look at me.

375
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,600
Stop blaming yourself, all right?

376
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm going home. This is annoying.

377
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
What?

378
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
On the day Cindy died,

379
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,800
why did she look for you?

380
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,600
The whole world
is asking me this question.

381
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,360
- I'm sick of it!
- Sun Shanwen!

382
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,800
She was my good friend.
I'd want to know, of course.

383
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,320
Okay. Since you really want to know,

384
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,960
I can tell you,
but you'll have to keep it a secret.

385
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,400
Again?

386
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,360
You know I really hate keeping secrets.

387
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,280
I'll be forced to tell lies.

388
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,680
Do you want to know or not?

389
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
I do.

390
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,320
Cindy told me that…

391
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,960
she saw my mother…

392
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,720
I just saw your mother
enter a hotel room with an older man.

393
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,800
What did you say?

394
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,520
I don't believe you.

395
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,760
Come see for yourself
if you don't believe me.

396
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,800
I'll be waiting for you
in the alley in front of the hotel.

397
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,040
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

398
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
Could she have seen wrongly?

399
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,440
My mother admitted to it
when I confronted her this morning.

400
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,120
How did she admit to it?

401
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,040
She asked me who I heard it from.

402
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,400
Sun Shanwen,
how is that an admission of guilt?

403
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,040
Auntie Ruoyun is so classy and graceful.

404
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,760
She couldn't have
done something like that.

405
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,240
Perhaps…

406
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,520
Cindy didn't see correctly.

407
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,560
Also, she had never met
your mother before, right?

408
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,120
I don't think so.

409
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,120
There you go.

410
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,040
Cindy always did things
without thinking them through.

411
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,840
It's very likely
that she recognized the wrong person.

412
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
I really hope that…

413
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,120
her murderer can be caught soon.

414
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,800
- Let me walk you home.
- It's fine. It's not on the way.

415
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Don't look for an excuse to not go home.

416
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,400
You're always carrying so much stuff.

417
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,880
Hello, Auntie. I'm Tingting.
I'm Shanwen's classmate.

418
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,199
Tingting.

419
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,120
Have you seen Shanwen?

420
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,160
He left.

421
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,160
It's okay. Thanks for letting me know.

422
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,040
These must be heavy. I'll drive you home.

423
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,000
It's all right.

424
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,880
I have a direct bus home.
It's very convenient.

425
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,320
You're Shanwen's friend.

426
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,120
Don't be overly formal with me.

427
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,360
Here. I'll help you.

428
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,360
My dad and I love
exercising in the morning.

429
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,480
I love nature too.

430
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,720
Therefore, for the topic of "Happy Times",

431
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,880
I always choose to paint nature.

432
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,720
What did Shanwen paint?

433
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,640
He… has never painted anything.

434
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,120
However, he does other things.

435
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,440
He does everything but paint.

436
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,000
Shanwen is introverted
and keeps to himself.

437
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,640
I always worry about him.

438
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,880
I'm thankful he has
a good friend like you by his side.

439
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,960
Thank you, Tingting.

440
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,520
Don't worry, Auntie Ruoyun.

441
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,400
I'll keep buzzing
around him like a mosquito…

442
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,680
and tell him to treat you better.

443
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,600
Thank you for sharing
about Shanwen with me.

444
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,000
Don't mention it, Auntie Ruoyun.

445
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,120
Thank you for your guidance.

446
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
Feel free to look for me anytime
if you need anything.

447
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,600
Auntie Ruoyun, something dropped inside.

448
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,040
So, that's where it went.

449
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,880
Cindy had the same bracelet.

450
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,840
Who knew that Cindy and I
share the same taste.

451
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,200
Such bracelets are common.
They're sold everywhere.

452
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,320
That reminds me.

453
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,680
Have the police found any clues
regarding Cindy's murderer?

454
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,720
I don't think so.

455
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,520
Otherwise, Cindy's mother
wouldn't be so upset.

456
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,680
She refuses to see anyone.

457
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,320
It'll take some time to heal.

458
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,920
Auntie Ruoyun,

459
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,680
could I make a presumptuous request?

460
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
Let's hear it.

461
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,920
Are you willing to meet Cindy's mother?

462
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,920
You could counsel her.

463
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,520
She said that
we don't understand her pain.

464
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,920
I saw the two of you hugging
in the bathroom the other day,

465
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,520
so I hope you can help her.

466
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,200
Auntie Ruoyun,

467
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,320
it's all right
if it's inconvenient for you.

468
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Forget I said anything at all.

469
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,520
If you think I'd be able to console her,

470
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,960
I'd be more than willing to try.

471
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,880
Thank you, Auntie Ruoyun!

472
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,440
<i>Should I publicize this recording?</i>

473
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,000
<i>It won't hurt me since I'm a widower.</i>

474
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,400
However, I wonder
what people would think of…

475
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,240
your family.

476
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,720
What are you doing?

477
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,840
Did you take my things?

478
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
I did.

479
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,120
What right do you have to take my things?

480
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,320
- Why did you take drugs then?
- Why do you care?

481
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,640
You must quit taking drugs.

482
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,960
Drugs will ruin your life.

483
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,160
Did you take the high heel too?

484
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Yes.

485
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,440
Cindy wore those before she died, right?

486
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,040
Did you meet her that night?

487
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Why did she look for you?
What did she tell you?

488
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,080
What would have happened if the police
had decided to search your room that day?

489
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,640
Yes, I met Cindy that night.

490
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,920
Why?

491
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
The semen may not have been yours,

492
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,120
but if the police knew
you were there that night

493
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,880
and if they found
your fingerprints on the high heel,

494
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,200
you would become a prime suspect!

495
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,200
Shanwen!

496
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,320
Do you think that…

497
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,800
I killed her?

498
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,800
As depraved as I might be,

499
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,720
I would never kill someone.

500
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
What's wrong?

501
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,600
I can't sleep.

502
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,200
Same here.

503
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,160
I haven't turned 18 yet.

504
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,560
Your birthday is next month.

505
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,320
<i>Do you think that…</i>

506
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,960
<i>I killed her?</i>
