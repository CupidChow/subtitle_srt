1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Where are you taking me?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Just follow me.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,240
Hey, be careful.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,840
Okay, be careful.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,560
Come over here.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,840
- Okay, sit down.
- Here.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,440
Okay, don't take it off!

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
Keep it on.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
- Can I take it off now?
- No.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,280
Make a wish and blow out the candles.
Be careful of your saliva!

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,560
I hope Mom's exhibition goes well.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,880
I hope Dad buys me a new computer.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,280
And I hope Sis… doesn't get a boyfriend…

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,400
so that she can be with me all day!

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,320
You have a boyfriend?

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,360
You can't say your wish out loud.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
We shouldn't have any secrets.
We're family.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,480
Shanwen's right.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,920
Does your sister have a boyfriend?

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,240
It's just a wish.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,360
Mom, I also wish that
you can make me a small sculpture!

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
A small sculpture!

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
- Quick, blow out the candles.
- A big sculpture!

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>A small sculpture!</i>

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,960
<i>Wow.</i>

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,880
<i>Great! Blow out the candles.</i>

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,680
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE
LIES A MULTITUDE OF SHADES OF GRAY.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
ZHANG TINGTING

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,120
Thanks.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
Your coffee is so disgusting!

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,720
We'd prefer to throw the coffee at you.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,560
Are you threatening me, Officer?

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Take a look.

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
We found traces of blood
on Sun Shanwen's seat that night.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
The surveillance footage showed that
he left in a hurry,

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
and you chased after him.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
How do you explain that?

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,680
It's hard to explain.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,520
Take your time. We have plenty of time.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,040
Starplayer, are you in a bad mood?

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,280
Would you like some "escape"?

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
You haven't been buying from me recently.
Do you have other suppliers?

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,840
- I've stopped taking it.
- For what?

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
This one's…

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
on me.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
But…

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,880
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,160
- Let's do an exchange.
- What do you want?

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,880
I want to build a new escape room,
and I need some material from you.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
What material?

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,520
The escape room is called…

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,320
What did you say?

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,880
Say that again.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,800
You're bleeding!

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
You cut your wrist!

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Don't kill yourself here!

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
If you talk nonsense again,

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,800
I'll report you to the police,
you stinking drug dealer!

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,440
Why are you zoning out? Speak!

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,800
That night,
when we were about to close shop,

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,680
Sun Shanwen angrily rushed in.

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,920
I asked him why he was in a bad mood.
We didn't talk much.

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
When I found out that he was self-harming,

65
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
he angrily ran away.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,920
I was worried, so I ran after him.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,880
But he was already gone.

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
Sun Shanwen didn't die, did he?

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
We found this in your internet cafe.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,720
How do you explain this?

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,240
Business was slow at the escape room.

72
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
I wanted to build a Kill Sera escape room
to attract customers.

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
After all, it's a hot topic.

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,880
Youngsters are discussing

75
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
why the killer only killed young women

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,120
and why they dismembered their bodies,
and why only on leap days.

77
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
They think it's very cool.

78
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
You're very excited.

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,880
No, I'm not.

80
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,320
What happened to Shanwen?

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,040
On February 29 of this year,
where were you?

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
I got into a car accident
and was hospitalized.

83
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,960
- When were you discharged?
- I don't remember.

84
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,040
Probably a few days later.

85
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,320
The first time that the Leap Day Killer
didn't kill on a leap day,

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
you were hospitalized.

87
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,680
Was I the only person
who was hospitalized on February 29?

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,400
You were discharged on March 3.

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,240
On March 11, the dismembered body parts
of another victim, Apple, were found.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
Someone caught you on video,

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
at the scene where the dismembered
body parts were found.

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,640
What a coincidence.

93
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,840
I told you,

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm doing research
for the Kill Sera escape room.

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,280
I saw on social media that someone
had found the dismembered body parts.

96
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
I got nosy and went there
to look for inspiration.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Do you remember her?
She was the first victim, Xie Liping.

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,960
You were her regular customer.

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,400
Officer,

100
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,280
you questioned me eight years ago.

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm innocent, I have an alibi

102
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,120
- and I have nothing to do with her.
- Are you sure?

103
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,760
What about the second victim, Sera?

104
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,040
You have a close relationship
with her brother, Sun Shanwen.

105
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
The third victim was Cindy.
Cindy knew Shanwen.

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
And the stockings you bought…

107
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,160
were exactly the same
as those found on the bodies.

108
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,680
When the fourth victim, Apple, was found,
you were at the scene.

109
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
They were all related to you!

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
Is this how you handle cases?

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,920
I have nothing to do with them!

112
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,720
I want to call my lawyer.

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not done.

114
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Don't let my coffee go to waste. Drink it!

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Thank you. Please keep a lookout for me.

116
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
How are you? Please keep a lookout for me.

117
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
Have you seen my son?

118
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
Take this.

119
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,880
Please contact me if you have any news.

120
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
Thank you.

121
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
Have you seen my son? Take one, please.

122
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,440
Have you seen my son?
Please take one. Thank you.

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,280
Ruoyun, do you want to take a break?

124
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
- I'm not tired.
- It's okay. Take a break.

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
You've been standing the whole day.

126
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll give them out for you.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,840
How are you?

128
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,640
Please keep an eye out for Sun Shanwen.
Thank you.

129
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
Sit down.

130
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,760
I've been asking
all around the school about him,

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
only to find out that…

132
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,080
Shanwen doesn't really have any friends.

133
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
His classmates…

134
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,320
don't usually hang out with him.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,320
That's how lonely he is.

136
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
Let's not think about this.
Let's be positive.

137
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't worry. Shanwen will return safely.

138
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,400
I'll hand out the flyers for you.

139
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Hello.

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,720
Please keep an eye out for Sun Shanwen.
Thank you.

141
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,880
What are you doing?

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
How many times have I told you?
Lying is a sin.

143
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,120
No wonder you've been cooking so much
for every meal.

144
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,720
I really didn't lie.

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,200
You didn't lie,
but not telling the truth is wrong too.

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,720
Auntie Ruoyun thought that
Shanwen was killed.

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,160
Surely, you know how serious this is?

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Uncle James, it's my fault.

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,520
I asked Tingting to keep this a secret.

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,840
If she told you,

151
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,880
she would've broken her promise
and become a disloyal friend.

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,480
She was in a difficult position.

153
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Exactly.

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,760
He told me to keep it a secret
and insisted I not tell anyone about it.

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
It's really annoying.

156
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
Shanwen, you're at fault too.

157
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,560
You know your mom is worried about you,
and yet you did this.

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,920
Look. Your mom looks so tired.

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,840
She looked more tired
when she was working.

160
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,960
Since you know that she's tired,
you should show her some concern.

161
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,640
You've been blinded.

162
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,840
You have to feel with your heart.

163
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll call your mom now.
She'll bring you home.

164
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,960
No, Uncle James. I don't want to see her.

165
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,560
I don't want to see anyone.

166
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,480
I'll leave now. I won't trouble you guys.

167
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,000
If you leave, where will you go?

168
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,040
What if something happens?

169
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Shanwen.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Shanwen!

171
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,120
Dad, I have an idea.

172
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,640
It'll help Shanwen feel with his heart.

173
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,640
Do not give up hope.

174
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,000
You said it before.

175
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,080
How long do I have to hold on
to this hope?

176
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
I don't have the strength.

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,120
So, you don't believe Shanwen is safe?

178
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
I don't know.

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,160
It has been so many days.

180
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,960
Forgive me for being blunt.

181
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,200
I think you feel guilty toward Shanwen,

182
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
and this guilt…

183
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,520
is your biggest inner demon.

184
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Since losing Sera,

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
my life has been turned upside down.

186
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,520
I think about revenge every day.

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,600
I forgot that Shanwen,
who was only 13 at the time,

188
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,080
still needed a mother.

189
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,520
I forgot that, having lost his sister,

190
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,520
he also needed to be comforted.

191
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,880
I neglected him.

192
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
It's right for him to hate me.

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm not a good mother at all.

194
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240
I made it through these years…

195
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,640
because I still had Shanwen.

196
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,560
Even if he hates me…
and refuses to call me Mom,

197
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,520
he's still the reason I keep going.

198
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,240
But if something happened to Shanwen too,

199
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
there'd be nothing for me
to live for anymore.

200
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,760
Let's take a deep breath.

201
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Shanwen resents you…

202
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
because he loves you.

203
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,320
Both of you need to understand each other…

204
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,120
and communicate your thoughts.

205
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Only then will your hearts open up.

206
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,800
With the blessing of God,

207
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
that hate will turn into love.

208
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
Do I still have a chance?

209
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,640
Shanwen!

210
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,720
Shanwen!

211
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm just glad you're okay.

212
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm glad you're okay.

213
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,880
What a waste of my time.

214
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,160
Officer, don't do this again, okay?

215
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,560
I'll gift you a coffee machine later.

216
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,040
Zhao Di!

217
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
We found blood stains in your storeroom

218
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,840
that match the victim Apple's.
Want to take a look?

219
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
We're holding you without bail.

220
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,560
I didn't kill anyone!

221
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,680
You didn't like my coffee.

222
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Silly!

223
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,120
Lawyer Hu, do something!

224
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Man, I'm so tired.

225
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,200
- Goodnight, Dad!
- Come here.

226
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,400
I think we should talk.

227
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,560
You're going to teach your dog a lesson,
Pastor Zhang?

228
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,280
Tell me everything, from the top.

229
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,200
Come here.

230
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,120
Shanwen called me the other day.

231
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,440
He was crying miserably.

232
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,320
He told me that…
he didn't have a home to go back to.

233
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,880
Why? Did he fight with his dad again?

234
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,120
He didn't tell me.

235
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,760
When we met at the church the next day,

236
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,680
he looked really scary.

237
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,920
There were wounds on his wrist.

238
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,600
I wanted to call Auntie Ruoyun,

239
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,040
but he wouldn't let me.

240
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
He wanted me to let him stay in the church

241
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,960
because he felt safer there.

242
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
He was self-harming.

243
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,000
- You bandaged his wounds too?
- Yes.

244
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,600
I even gave him a good scolding.

245
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,840
Do you think I should give you
a good scolding too?

246
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,440
Come on, Dad.

247
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,440
All's well that ends well, right?

248
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,480
My idea helped bring them back together.

249
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,240
If Shanwen hadn't disappeared,

250
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,560
Auntie Ruoyun wouldn't have
said those touching words either.

251
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Right?

252
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,080
Yes. You're right about everything.

253
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,120
But you're lying more and more.

254
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,960
You hid Shanwen in the church
for so many days.

255
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,680
How am I going to explain that
to the council?

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,160
When you took money from the offering bag

257
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
and lent it to Cindy,

258
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
they were already very unhappy.

259
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,720
Now, you're at it again.

260
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
Please. You're the pastor's daughter.

261
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,200
Don't embarrass me.

262
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,640
You should know
what's acceptable and what's not.

263
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
Is it wrong to help my friends?

264
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,520
Any more comments?

265
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,160
You still want to argue?

266
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,240
Dad, don't be angry.

267
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,800
If you get angry,
my heart will be in a lot of pain…

268
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,400
You're still acting?

269
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,119
There are some things
you shouldn't joke about!

270
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,640
Does it hurt?

271
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
Promise me.

272
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,040
Don't hurt yourself like this
in the future, no matter what.

273
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,840
If you cut yourself,
it's like you're cutting my heart.

274
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Okay.

275
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,320
If you have any problems,
you can talk to me.

276
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
I will help you.

277
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,760
What's wrong?
Do you want to say something?

278
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,000
Are you hungry?
I'll cook something for you.

279
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,360
I don't hate you.

280
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
I never have.

281
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Shanwen.

282
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,760
Let's start over, shall we?

283
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,680
I neglected you all these years.

284
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
I promise you…

285
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,840
I'll be a good mom from now on.

286
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,880
Give Mommy one more chance, okay?

287
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Dad.

288
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
Come in.

289
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,800
Dad, I'm sorry.

290
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,920
I made the joke to lighten the mood.

291
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,560
Your joke wasn't funny at all.

292
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,920
I know I was wrong.

293
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,920
Sit down.

294
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,440
Back when…

295
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,000
your mom had the heart attack,

296
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,400
she looked just like that.

297
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,680
You were only five years old.

298
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,960
You don't remember anything.

299
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,960
But I remember it very clearly.

300
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,480
Your mom said she had chest pains.

301
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,560
She was holding her chest
and said she felt terrible.

302
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,000
I was holding her
while I called for an ambulance.

303
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,400
She couldn't breathe,
but all she could say was your name.

304
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,560
You were the one
she cared most about in her life.

305
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,040
The ambulance didn't arrive in time,

306
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,280
and she died in my arms.

307
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll never forget… how her body…

308
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
went from warm to cold.

309
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,840
I promised her I'd take good care of you.

310
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
So,

311
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
that joke you just made…

312
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,080
wasn't funny at all… to me.

313
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
Why didn't you tell me…

314
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,160
any of this?

315
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,800
You…

316
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,600
You keep everything to yourself.

317
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,800
When I was helping
Auntie Ruoyun look for Shanwen,

318
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,040
I suddenly…

319
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,880
had some thoughts.

320
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,360
I was thinking

321
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,680
if one day…

322
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,480
you go missing or disappear,

323
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,560
what would I do?

324
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,400
I won't. I won't run away from home.

325
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,360
You are too young…

326
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,400
to understand how parents feel.

327
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,520
There's nothing under the sun…

328
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
that's more terrible
than losing our children.

329
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,120
Dad.

330
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Don't be paranoid.

331
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
God will bless me.

332
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,080
Don't you always say that

333
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,720
there's a link between you and me?

334
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,840
Here.

335
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,160
Close your eyes and try it.

336
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,360
You'll be able to sense my presence.

337
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,720
You're full of nonsense.

338
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,360
Do you feel it?

339
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,560
Yes, I sense your presence.

340
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,160
It's time to take a shower, right?

341
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,520
You need to do your homework too.

342
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,480
Goodnight, Dad. Love you!

343
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,000
Do you like it?

344
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,560
Do you want to unpack first?

345
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,960
I just grabbed a few things.

346
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,560
I think you didn't bring enough clothes.

347
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Let's go home together
to get some clothes.

348
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,280
Could you help me get some?

349
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,320
I don't want to go home.

350
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,760
Shanwen,

351
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
what happened?

352
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Why did you run away from home
for so long?

353
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,040
It's okay…
if you don't want to talk about it now.

354
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
If you need anything else,
just send me a text.

355
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,600
I'll go back and get it for you.

356
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,560
It's not urgent.

357
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll be quick.
Take a shower and sleep early.

358
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,920
Why?

359
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,480
Shanwen won't come back?

360
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Can you let me meet him?
Even if it's just for half an hour,

361
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,680
- I'm okay with that.
- You should sober up first.

362
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
I am sober.

363
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,000
There's nothing I can do
if he won't see you.

364
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,480
There must be something you can do.

365
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
You both refuse to tell me
what's going on,

366
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
so how am I supposed to help you?

367
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,200
What are you hiding?

368
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,280
I've never seen Shanwen
so disgusted with you.

369
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
What's going on?

370
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,160
Hello.

371
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

372
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,200
We're at the last house.

373
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,800
Are you okay?

374
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,800
- Is it that obvious?
- Yes.

375
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,680
- That's Paul's home.
- Paul, who's in jail?

376
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,880
When I delivered food to them
the last time,

377
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,040
his grandpa threw two rotten eggs at me.

378
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm okay if he wants to take it out on me.

379
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
But I don't want to get you involved.

380
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,720
It's okay. I'll go with you.

381
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,960
- Hello, Grandpa.
- Why are you here?

382
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,320
You put Paul in jail.
Now, you want to kill me?

383
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,480
Grandpa! It's dangerous.
You'll fall down easily.

384
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
Don't fall because of him.

385
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,800
Grandpa, keep the bee hoon and herbal tea.
I'll leave right now.

386
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,160
- Take it away!
- You can be mad at him.

387
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
But don't be angry with the food.

388
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,400
Take the food and the herbal tea.

389
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,200
You'll have the strength to scold people
once you have eaten the food.

390
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,680
For the sake of your wife,
I'll take the food.

391
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,560
Let her bring the food next time.

392
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,000
Auntie Ruoyun,
do you want to go in and take a look?

393
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,320
It looks really pretty.

394
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,600
It is very pretty.

395
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,560
However, I have sensitive skin,
so I can't wear jewelry.

396
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,480
I can only look at it.

397
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,360
Hey, where are you two taking us?

398
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,320
Shanwen said that he has a present
for Auntie Ruoyun.

399
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,600
- Let's go.
- Go.

400
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,920
We're here.

401
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Boss.

402
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,640
Hey, I thought you weren't coming anymore.

403
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,120
Doesn't it look like you, Auntie Ruoyun?

404
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,600
Did you draw this?

405
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,880
The butterfly represents…

406
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,160
Sis.

407
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,080
I love it.

408
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,400
Thank you.

409
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
Thank you, Son.

410
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,280
DAD: GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THE THUMB DRIVE

411
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,840
<i>Sera. I'm sorry.</i>

412
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
<i>I'm wrong.</i>

413
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,640
<i>It's all Dad's fault.</i>

414
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,360
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

415
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

416
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,200
- <i>I'll strip for you!</i>
- Don't!

417
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,760
<i>Don't!</i>

418
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,640
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

419
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,080
I saw it.

420
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,120
I saw everything.

421
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,280
Shanwen is still covering for you.

422
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
I told you

423
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,040
I'd get to the bottom
of whatever you're hiding!

424
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,800
Tell me!

425
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,680
Tell me everything!

426
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
Tell me exactly what happened!

427
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,080
Hey, Sera.

428
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,280
Go downstairs to take a picture.

429
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
- Sera.
- Don't touch me.

430
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,840
- Sera.
- Don't touch me, you hypocrite!

431
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,000
Sera, you can't talk to Daddy like this.

432
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,440
- Sera.
- Why did you have to call the reporters

433
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,680
to come to witness your fake love?

434
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,600
- If you don't love each other,
- How dare you…

435
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,960
then get a divorce!

436
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,240
Sera.

437
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,040
Sera.

438
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
Sera, listen to me.

439
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,480
I know you saw some things on my computer.

440
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
There are grown-up things
that you won't understand.

441
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,360
You're not a real philanthropist.
You're disgusting!

442
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,920
Don't touch me!

443
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,280
Sera, calm down.

444
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,040
Let's talk about this at home, okay?

445
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,320
Sera, I'm wrong.

446
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,040
It's all my fault.

447
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,520
Don't touch me!

448
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,720
You want to see it so badly, right?

449
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,560
You want to see it, don't you?
You want to see it, right?

450
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,480
- I'll strip for you!
- Sera, no!

451
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,760
- I'll strip for you!
- Don't!

452
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,960
Don't touch me!

453
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,720
That's not Sera.

454
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,280
It's not her.

455
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,720
She doesn't have tattoos.

456
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
It's not her.

457
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,520
Are you crazy? You're crazy!

458
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,200
Sera is my daughter!

459
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,840
How could you do that to her?

460
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,120
You… you are a monster!

461
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,560
Monster!

462
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,640
You killed Sera!

463
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,360
You killed her!

464
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,280
Why did you destroy her computer?

465
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,200
There might have been evidence in it
which could have helped solve the case!

466
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,160
I really didn't know she was Sera.

467
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,120
I checked it.

468
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,120
There was nothing inside
but porn site records.

469
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
I did that to protect Sera's reputation.

470
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,960
Shut up!

471
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,040
You did that
to protect your own reputation!

472
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,400
You're not fit to be a human!

473
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,200
You only care about yourself!

474
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,200
Sera's baby…

475
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,280
Was it yours?
