00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,520
AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE.MP4

2
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
<i>Sera.</i>

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,760
<i>It's my fault.</i>

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

5
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,240
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,640
<i>I'll strip for you!</i>

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,360
<i>Don't!</i>

8
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,160
THERE'S JUST A THIN LINE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,120
CROSS IT, AND THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.
LIN GUOGUANG

10
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Sera.

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,960
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,560
Listen to me, Sera.

13
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,160
I know you saw some things on my computer.

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
There are grown-up things
that you won't understand.

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,160
You're not a real philanthropist.
You're disgusting!

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,480
Don't touch me!

17
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Ma'am.

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,440
How long has your shop been open for?

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm not the boss. He isn't here yet.

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
Has your shop been around
for at least four years?

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,240
We've been around
for seven to eight years.

22
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Can I ask you something?

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,800
Do you still have the CCTV footage
from 29 February 2020?

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,240
You're joking.

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,040
Why would anyone keep a copy
of CCTV footage from four years ago?

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,720
Thank you.

27
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,440
Tingting, I'm home.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm making pasta tonight.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
Tingting.

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,640
Tingting.

31
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,480
MASSIVE JERK!

32
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,840
ZHANG JAMES, YOU MASSIVE JERK!

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,400
‪It's true.

34
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
My father isn't that kind of person.

35
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
Stop talking.

36
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,160
Your father isn't a good guy

37
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,640
- no matter what you say, so stop.
- He's really good to me…

38
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,960
Hey! What are you doing?

39
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,240
- What are you doing?
- Dad!

40
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,800
- Dad, stop!
- Why did you touch my daughter?

41
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,040
Come for me if you dare!

42
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,760
Don't touch my daughter!

43
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,000
Are you nuts?
She was the one who looked for me!

45
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Get your facts straight!

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
You're a lunatic.

47
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,320
Why did you look for him out of the blue?

48
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,320
I knew that Paul misunderstood you,
so I wanted to help you clear the air,

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
but why must you be so rash?

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Tingting.

51
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you really going to ignore me?

52
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,120
We agreed to never go to bed angry.

53
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,840
I was very worried
when I saw the photo Paul sent,

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
and then

55
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,480
I hit him because I got anxious
when I saw the situation unfold.

56
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,200
However, I know this isn't a good excuse

57
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,280
because I still did something wrong.

58
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
You should go.

59
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,080
I'm going to sleep.

60
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,440
If you're going to ignore me,

61
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,040
I won't tell you a secret.

62
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
I thought we agreed
not to have any secrets between us?

63
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,120
I'll tell you a secret then.

64
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
Your grandfather was an abusive man.

65
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,480
He used to hit your grandmother.

66
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Whenever he hit her,

67
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,680
I'd shield her from his attacks.

68
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,440
When I was 18 years old,
he was drunk one day.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,120
He took a knife
and tried to slash your grandmother.

70
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
I used my body to shield her from it.

71
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,760
That slash severed our ties
as father and son.

72
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,400
I eventually became
a violent person myself.

73
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,280
I felt that I could protect
myself with violence,

74
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,600
and that it could solve all issues.

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,440
That all changed when I met your mother

76
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
and came to know God.

77
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,360
They taught me to look toward the future

78
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
and not at the past.

79
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,240
So,

80
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,480
I forgave your grandfather

81
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
and mended our relationship.

82
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
However,

83
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,760
earlier today,

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,600
the person who I hate returned.

85
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
For that,

86
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,640
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,600
Dad.

88
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,440
Don't worry.

89
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,640
I won't look back at the past.

90
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
You're still

91
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,600
the adorable dad that I love.

92
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
How adorable?

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
You're this adorable!

94
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm sorry for scaring you.

95
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Go to sleep soon.

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,600
Good night.

97
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
Good night, Dad.

98
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,360
NEXT WEEK IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.
CAN MOMMY CELEBRATE IT WITH YOU?

99
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,400
ARE YOU FREE?

100
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,760
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO EAT?
I'LL COOK IT FOR YOU.

101
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,680
Sun Shanwen, reply to your mother.

102
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,760
Hey, what are you doing?

103
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,240
You're as nosy as them!

104
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,280
I'll reply to her for you.

105
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
‪Hey.

106
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,120
- Give it back!
- Hey…

107
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,160
Here, take it back.

108
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,480
Where exactly are we going?

109
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
You'll know when we get there.

110
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,160
Sun Shanwen,
why are you being so mysterious?

111
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,560
Are you the famous sculptor?

112
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,160
‪Hey, hey!

113
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,360
How's business today?

114
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
It's a rare day.

115
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,360
Starplayer brought his friend
to try the escape room today.

116
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,840
Sun Shanwen?

117
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
No wonder I saw his mother nearby.

118
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,440
His mother?

119
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
I'll take over from here.

120
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,920
Go for your lunch break.

121
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,640
Boss, it's already 2:30 p.m.

122
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,040
I've already eaten.

123
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,000
Would it kill you to eat again?

124
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,280
My third aunt died from overeating.

125
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
Are you talking back to me?

126
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,720
Seven.

127
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,640
Four.

128
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
Three-seven-four.

129
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,760
Sun Shanwen.

130
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,600
You're really good at this!

131
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
Look! We figured it out in 20 minutes!

132
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
My parents were often not at home.

133
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,040
My sister would come up
with riddles and treasure hunts.

134
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,440
She would get me to play them.

135
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
We still have some time left.

136
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
Let's not waste our money.

137
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,560
Let's just sit here and chat.

138
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,240
Actually,

139
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,120
this is my first time in an escape room.

140
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,560
It's because of my dad.

141
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,920
He doesn't let me
do any dangerous activities.

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Are escape rooms dangerous?

143
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes! You'll get scared.

144
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,440
I was born with a hole in my heart.

145
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,160
It eventually closed up,

146
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
but…

147
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,400
my mother died from a heart attack,

148
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,640
so my father has always
been worried about me.

149
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
So, you've never been on a roller coaster?

150
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,400
Not even a cable car.

151
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,760
However,

152
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,040
I must thank you
for giving me a new experience today.

153
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,920
My life feels like an escape room.

154
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,560
I can't solve any of the riddles.

155
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,320
We always stay in our rooms.

156
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,240
It feels like…

157
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,480
we're letting my sister down…

158
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,200
if we live happily.

159
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
Sun Shanwen,

160
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,040
the riddle you wish to solve…

161
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400
is right here.

162
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,920
Also, you're no longer all alone.

163
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
You have me now.

164
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,320
I believe that

165
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Auntie Ruoyun and your father
are trapped in their own escape rooms too.

166
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
They can't find their way out either

167
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
and are as miserable as you.

168
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
You look frail.

169
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,960
I guess you haven't been
sleeping or eating well.

170
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Why does it feel like I'm at the doctor's?

171
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm not so capable as to treat you,

172
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,160
but I know someone who can:

173
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
Sun Shanwen.

174
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,600
He's my poison.

175
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,800
He's your antidote.

176
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,160
Look at this glass of water.

177
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,920
You see it as half-empty,
but I see it as half-full.

178
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,760
I'm trying very hard

179
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,400
to crawl out of this dark space
I'm trapped in.

180
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,040
However, no matter how much I try,

181
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm stuck in the same space.

182
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,720
We'll have to…

183
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,280
feel and see the invisible thread.

184
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,160
This thread is known as the Rope of Grace.

185
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,400
There's an invisible thread
that ties each family closely together.

186
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
Regardless of how tense
the relationship is,

187
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,960
blood is still thicker than water.

188
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,560
My dad was abusive when I was a child.

189
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,920
At the time,
I thought my mother hated him to her core.

190
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,600
However, at his deathbed,
she cried her heart out.

191
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,640
I later realized that…

192
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,560
hurt people hurt people.

193
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Those who've been hurt
will arm themselves.

194
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,640
They'll unknowingly hurt others.

195
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,640
Let's talk about something else.

196
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,119
Shanwen's birthday is next week, right?

197
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,160
I remember that his and Tingting's
birthdays are four days apart.

198
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,839
Shall we celebrate
their birthdays together?

199
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,040
You can really read my mind.

200
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,160
I looked for you

201
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
in the hopes you could act
as a middleman for me.

202
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,920
He hasn't replied to me,
even though I've tried contacting him.

203
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,160
Rest assured.

204
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,480
Leave it to Tingting and I.

205
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
Thank you.

206
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,680
You should eat something.

207
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,840
Here.

208
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
What about this?

209
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,400
I'll have this.

210
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,000
What do you want written on it?

211
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,360
"Happy Birthday, Tingting and Shanwen".

212
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
"Shan" like in kind (shanliang)
and "Wen" like in quiet (wenjing).

213
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,440
"Ting" is the word for pavilion
with the "woman" radical.

214
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,360
Sure.

215
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,480
How many candles do you need?

216
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,640
They're both turning 18 years old,
so I'll just get a single candle.

217
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,440
Are they fraternal twins?

218
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,840
No, they're not.

219
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,400
They're classmates.

220
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm the girl's father,

221
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,240
and she's the boy's mother.

222
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
All right. Please wait a moment.

223
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
Thank you.

224
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,320
Hi.

225
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
What a coincidence.

226
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
You're Mr. Sun, right?

227
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,440
It's nice to meet you. I'm James.

228
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,680
- I often see you on television
- Hi.

229
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,960
James is Shanwen's classmate's father.

230
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,400
Is that so?

231
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,920
All right. I won't hold you back.

232
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
You arranged it beautifully.

233
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,640
You're an artist indeed.

234
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,880
It's all right.

235
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,840
It's more than all right.

236
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,560
For my part,

237
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,560
the ratio of the egg mixture
and stock is 1:2.

238
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,320
If I can get the ratio right,
it's half the job done.

239
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,240
It's the same
as when I make sculpting clay.

240
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,120
Dad.

241
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,760
Will you be done soon?

242
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,000
Shanwen said that he'll be arriving early.

243
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,960
- He'll be arriving early?
- Yes.

244
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,320
I still have many things left to do.

245
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,960
Auntie Ruoyun,

246
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,840
you're so nervous,
as if you're meeting your boyfriend.

247
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,440
Aren't you feeling nervous?

248
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,840
What do I have to be nervous about?

249
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,760
Are they…

250
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,520
I don't think so.

251
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,680
However, if that were the case,
would you approve of their relationship?

252
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,960
Although they're still young,

253
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,640
Tingting is such a good girl,

254
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,520
so I would be more than happy.

255
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,240
She's too good for Shanwen though.

256
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,240
Nonsense.

257
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,240
However,

258
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,040
maybe only when they are older.

259
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,440
We'll have to be on the same page then.

260
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,920
But I'm afraid that Tingting will be
snatched up by someone else by then.

261
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,520
Do you have so little confidence
in your son?

262
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,520
He's here.

263
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,840
Sun Shanwen!

264
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Here.

265
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,840
Why did you bring alcohol?

266
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
Your father asked me to bring some.

267
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,120
We haven't reached
the legal drinking age yet.

268
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
A few days doesn't make much difference.

269
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,840
Shanwen.

270
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,920
Don't be rude. It's my birthday today!

271
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,640
Your mother is my guest. All right?

272
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,680
They went out early in the morning
to buy the ingredients.

273
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,080
Don't look so upset. All right?

274
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,920
Greet my dad.

275
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,720
- Hi, Uncle.
- Hello.

276
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,840
Have a seat. We'll have dinner in a bit.

277
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Come on.

278
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,320
Tingting. Come give me a hand.

279
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,400
Dinner will be ready soon.

280
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,120
Happy birthday, Shanwen.

281
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,280
Go ahead and open it.

282
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,160
Shanwen.

283
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,320
Open it.

284
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,960
That year,

285
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,880
when you won the arts award,

286
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,120
I promised to make you
a sculpture for your birthday.

287
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,520
I'm sorry…

288
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,920
that I'm a few years late.

289
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
You remembered.

290
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,840
I've never forgotten my promise.

291
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,440
Shanwen,

292
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,240
the place I'm staying at
isn't too far from your school.

293
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Come stay the night next week.

294
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,680
I won't be free that day.

295
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,640
It's all right
if you don't stay the night.

296
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,440
You can invite Tingting over for a meal.

297
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Shanwen.

298
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Good night.

299
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Hello.

300
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,080
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

301
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,560
- <i>Go away!</i>
- <i>Don't!</i>

302
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,600
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

303
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,320
Hello.

304
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,520
Who is this?

305
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,320
What do you want?

306
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,880
Were you the one who sent the envelope?

307
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Hello?

308
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,240
Hello!

309
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,080
That's quite good.

310
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,120
Thank you, Teacher.

311
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,640
All right. Class is over.

312
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,040
You can continue next week
if you haven't finished painting.

313
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,400
Someone has been in a good mood recently.

314
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,920
Indeed.

315
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,840
I've straightened out my thoughts.

316
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,360
What do you mean?

317
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,760
You said that…

318
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,120
getting a divorce
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

319
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,960
You're right.
Divorce is a good thing for all parties.

320
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,160
Our dear Shanwen has grown up.

321
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,280
He has become mature too.

322
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,160
So, does that mean
you're no longer mad at Auntie Ruoyun?

323
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,440
Are you free later?

324
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Why? Are you asking me out?

325
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,640
I want to frame this painting.

326
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
I have more here.

327
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,720
Take your time to look through them.

328
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,640
- We'll get this one!
- We'll get this one!

329
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
That's right.

330
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,600
You lovebirds have really good chemistry.

331
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,760
Sir, you've misunderstood us.

332
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,080
We're just friends.

333
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
You'll become
more than friends in no time.

334
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,720
- I'll call you when it's done.
- Thank you, sir!

335
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,240
You're still denying it
despite having such good chemistry?

336
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,920
We…

337
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,120
Let's go in and have a look.

338
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,440
Which one do you like?
I'll gift it to you.

339
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,600
Why do you need to gift it to me?

340
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,040
It's to commemorate…

341
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
you becoming my girlfriend today.

342
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,480
This is nice and beautiful.

343
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,240
Miss, this one.

344
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,320
Give me your hand.

345
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
Do you like it?

346
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,280
Auntie Ruoyun likes such bracelets too.

347
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,400
Shall I buy one as a gift for her?

348
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,360
It's all right. She has sensitive skin.

349
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,560
She makes sculptures,
so she can't wear any accessories anyway.

350
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,600
She doesn't even wear her wedding ring.

351
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

352
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,880
Auntie Ruoyun, something dropped inside.

353
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,240
So, that's where it went.

354
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
Cindy had the same bracelet.

355
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,000
Who knew that Cindy and I
share the same taste.

356
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
Such bracelets are common.

357
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
They're sold everywhere.

358
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,640
I'll go pay for this.

359
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,640
Miss, I'd like to pay.

360
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,920
This way, please.

361
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,520
Hey.

362
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,160
It's been so many years.

363
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,760
This place hasn't changed much.

364
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,440
Thank you.

365
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,120
I ordered a cup of yuan yang for you.

366
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,280
It's blander than I remember.

367
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,680
Certain tastes may become bland,

368
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,120
but not for family relationships.

369
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,360
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

370
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,160
I… don't know what you're talking about.

371
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,800
Cut the pretense.

372
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,080
I ran into Dehui earlier.

373
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
He told me everything.

374
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,480
Hey, Sister-in-Law. What a small world.

375
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,920
You're looking good.

376
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,600
I'm no longer your sister-in-law.

377
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,280
I take my hat off to you.

378
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,440
You cut all ties with my brother

379
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,160
once you found out
he has no money or authority.

380
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,120
What are you talking about?

381
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,760
Haven't you heard?

382
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,800
He sold all his shares to Mr. Deng.

383
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,360
I have an ulterior motive.

384
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,920
I'm not a match for Dehui,

385
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,520
so I sold all my shares to the big fox,

386
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,120
so he can tackle the little fox.

387
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm sorry…

388
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,800
that I made you pay such a high price.

389
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,720
Don't apologize to me.

390
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,320
I was in the wrong as well.

391
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,840
I…

392
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,240
deserved it.

393
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,560
That day,

394
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,160
you asked me if I have killed…

395
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,200
You don't have to tell me.

396
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,400
You deserve to have your secrets.

397
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,120
Let's…

398
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,480
respect each other's privacy.

399
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,840
Everything we do is for our daughter.

400
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,320
That's right.

401
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,360
It's all for Sera.

402
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,360
<i>Calm down.</i>

403
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,920
<i>Let's talk about this at home, okay?</i>

404
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,360
<i>It's all right.</i>

405
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,639
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

406
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

407
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,719
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

408
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,440
<i>You want to see it?</i>

409
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,159
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

410
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,040
- <i>I'll strip for you!</i>
- <i>Don't!</i>

411
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,920
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

412
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,080
Boss, did you change the passcode
for the storeroom?

413
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,120
Yeah.

414
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
What's the new passcode?

415
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,440
I'm not planning to tell you.

416
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,440
You don't need to enter
the storeroom anymore.

417
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,160
Why?

418
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,640
That's because I'm the boss!

419
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,800
Hey, Shanwen!

420
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Ruby.

421
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,280
Go home first.
I'll stay to close the shop.

422
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,320
You're asking me to go home first?

423
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,520
You're staying to close the shop?

424
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,440
Why?

425
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,800
That's because…

426
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
That's because you're the boss.

427
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
Get lost already!

428
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,440
I'm getting lost now.

429
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,080
XINGYOU CLUB

430
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,760
Allan.

431
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,560
What are you doing here so early?

432
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Did Shanwen come to look for you?

433
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,160
He didn't. Did something happen?

434
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,360
He didn't come home yesterday.

435
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,880
I tried calling him,
but he turned his phone off.

436
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,360
I thought he might be here.

437
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,400
Why would he come here?

438
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,040
Did something happen?

439
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,360
Did the two of you get into a fight?

440
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,440
No.

441
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,760
We didn't.

442
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,040
It just seems like he hasn't been
in the best mood recently.

443
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,720
- He's been in a bad mood?
- Yes.

444
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,760
Let me check with Tingting.

445
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,560
- Hi.
- James.

446
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,560
Sorry to disturb you.

447
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,920
Don't worry about it. Come on in.

448
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,720
Hi, Mr. Sun.

449
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
I haven't been able
to get a hold of Tingting.

450
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,840
It's a Saturday after all.

451
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,320
The church members
are visiting an old folks' home.

452
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,040
She's probably in the midst of it,
so she hasn't answered my calls.

453
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I'm not too sure
why you're looking for her urgently.

454
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,440
Our son hasn't come home all night.

455
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,560
He turned off his phone, and we wanted
to know if he's with your daughter.

456
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,120
From what I understand, he's not with her.

457
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,440
Young people won't usually turn off
their phones unless they're in a bad mood.

458
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,040
Allan said that he hasn't been
in the best mood recently.

459
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,720
Did he get into a fight with Tingting?

460
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
I don't think so.

461
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,240
Tingting was in a good mood
when she left this morning.

462
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,040
Don't worry.

463
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,320
Shanwen should be fine.

464
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,960
Shanwen often goes to an internet cafe.

465
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,960
It should be somewhere near Daoming Road.

466
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,480
Do you know of it?

467
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,600
I've heard Tingting mention it.

468
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,520
It's called Lost.

469
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,240
Are you saying that Shanwen
might be there?

470
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,040
In that case,
I'll join you to search for him.

471
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,880
All right. Thank you.

472
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,920
I'll head in first, Ruby.

473
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,480
Excuse me.

474
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,840
Hello.

475
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,680
Do you know this person
by the name of Sun Shanwen?

476
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
Sun Shanwen.

477
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,560
Do you mean Starplayer Samuel?

478
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,040
Yes! That's him!

479
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,680
- Did he come by last night?
- He did.

480
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,760
What time was that?

481
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,000
I left work at 11:00 p.m.

482
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,920
He got here at around 10:00 p.m.

483
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,280
What time did he leave?

484
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,680
Do you know where he went?

485
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,560
Boss told me to clock off
not long after he arrived.

486
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,440
He was the only person left in the shop.

487
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,960
I'll call and ask him for you.

488
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,240
Thank you.

489
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,840
That's weird.

490
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,720
His phone is turned off.

491
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,920
Can we see the CCTV footage?

492
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,440
No! You're not the police.

493
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,920
We just want to know what time he left.

494
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,760
I can't just show it to you.

495
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,440
Boss will scold me if he finds out.

496
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,440
- Is there any way to contact him?
- I can't give you that too!

497
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,680
Boss will scold me if he finds out.

498
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,840
Why can't you just help us?

499
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
Will you be responsible
if something happens to my son?

500
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,680
They're Shanwen's parents,
so they're feeling agitated and nervous.

501
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,800
I apologize.

502
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,840
I'm sorry. I can't help you

503
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,160
I have customers coming soon.

504
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,080
There are many things to prepare.

505
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,280
How about this? This is my business card.

506
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,760
Inform me immediately
if Shanwen comes by again.

507
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Is that all right?

508
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,520
Thank you.

509
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,640
