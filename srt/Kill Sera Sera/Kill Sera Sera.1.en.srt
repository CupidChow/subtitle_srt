1
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,640
Sam.

2
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,880
DEATH IS A RELEASE TO ME,

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
BUT TO MANY OTHERS, IT SHACKLES THEM.
SUN SHANQI SERA

4
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,760
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,680
<i>It's February 29 tomorrow, a leap day.</i>

6
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>Although they only celebrate</i>
<i>their wedding anniversary</i>

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
<i>once every four years,</i>

8
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,440
<i>there are still 96 couples</i>

9
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,320
<i>who chose to get married on this day.</i>

10
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Look at the time.

11
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
Didn't we agree to go
pay our respects to Sera?

12
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll drive you to school.

13
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,480
I wouldn't want to trouble you.

14
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,640
It's finally her death anniversary,

15
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,080
so you must be really busy.

16
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,080
Is this what you mean by taking action?

17
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,760
Waiting for the killer by the river,
knife in hand?

18
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,280
What else can I do?

19
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,880
The police won't look into this.

20
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,200
I really don't get what you're thinking.

21
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
I'll tell you then.

22
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,640
If the murderer turns up,

23
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll stab him to death.

24
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,080
I don't care if he takes me down with him.

25
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,920
Is that so?

26
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
What about Shanwen?

27
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,600
You've gone insane!

28
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Shanwen!

29
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Hey, why don't you
come visit Sera with me after class?

30
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,400
I'm not free.

31
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,760
Okay.

32
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,840
What are you doing?

33
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,600
Stop! Get out!

34
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
Who said you could touch this bed?

35
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,920
Get out! Hands off my things!

36
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,880
Get out!

37
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,360
Ruoyun…

38
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
It's been so long since Sera died.

39
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,680
You need to let her go.

40
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
Sera…

41
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,560
I think my period's coming.

42
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
Wear a pad then.

43
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
Of course, my period would come
right on prom night.

44
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,920
You're not on your period yet.

45
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Maybe…

46
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,120
I should wear the black dress instead.

47
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
It's safer, and I like that one better.

48
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,400
No. It's too sexy.

49
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,320
All right. Okay.

50
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,040
Sera.

51
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
Open it and see if you like it.

52
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Wow.

53
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
Thank you.

54
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
I'll help you put it on.

55
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
Gorgeous.

56
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,320
IN MEMORY OF SUN SHANQI SERA

57
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
<i>Don't touch me, you hypocrite!</i>

58
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,080
- Hi, you're here.
- Mr. Sun.

59
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,600
This way. Make yourselves at home.

60
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
You have a beautiful home.

61
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,720
Thank you.

62
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
<i>Mingzhou Daily</i> wants
an interview with you.

63
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,640
I pushed back our dinner appointment.

64
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Come on.

65
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,040
One last question.

66
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,120
If your son wants to be
a professional artist,

67
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,360
will you support him?

68
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,840
Of course.

69
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,280
We've always let
our kids follow their dreams.

70
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,880
I won't.

71
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,600
An artist's path is an arduous one.

72
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,960
I don't want my son
to follow in my footsteps.

73
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
<i>He's very talented.</i>

74
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,280
<i>At such a young age, he's already won…</i>

75
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,680
the International Arts
and Craft Competition.

76
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,720
Why would it be arduous?

77
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,760
Why don't we take a picture?

78
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll go get your awards and Sera.

79
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
One moment, please.

80
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,120
Sure.

81
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,840
We can frame the shot like this.

82
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,200
And have her sit here.

83
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
Sera.

84
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Come down for a picture, Sera.

85
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,080
How old is she?

86
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,200
Almost 16.

87
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,880
Sera.

88
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,000
- Sorry.
- Sera.

89
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,400
- Sera.
- Don't touch me.

90
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,880
- Sera.
- Don't touch me, you hypocrite!

91
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,080
Sera.

92
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,120
Are you doing well over there?

93
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
You know…

94
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
I cleaned your room today.

95
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
It was due for some cleaning.

96
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,240
Your anniversary comes
once every four years.

97
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,320
Many people have forgotten about you.

98
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,400
But don't worry,

99
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,920
I'll make sure you'll never be forgotten.

100
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,800
I'll lure your killer out…

101
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,120
and take revenge for you.

102
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,080
IN MEMORY OF SUN SHANQI SERA

103
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,040
<i>I want a look that will make me…</i>
<i>completely unrecognizable.</i>

104
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,760
<i>I got it.</i>

105
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,800
All done. Take a look.

106
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,440
Hey! What are you doing?

107
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,360
Why are you tearing up my painting?

108
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
Hey, Sun Shanwen!

109
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,520
Shanwen!

110
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,080
<i>When did Sera get that tattoo done?</i>

111
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,360
Do you know?

112
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
<i>Have you seen the butterfly tattoo…</i>
<i>on her thigh?</i>

113
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,200
You must know it.

114
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,320
Don't lie to me.

115
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,240
Here.

116
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Hey.

117
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,400
Lattes are expensive, you know?

118
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,599
This is your favorite drink too.

119
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,200
How would you know?

120
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm observant.

121
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,760
My mom only gives me milk.

122
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,080
It's nutritious.

123
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,800
What came over you earlier?

124
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
I've had it with him.

125
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,560
Do you want to hear me sing on Sunday?

126
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,440
I don't need to go
to know that you'll be bad.

127
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,800
My singing can cleanse…

128
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,120
all that rage pent up in your head.

129
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,600
You're the one with pent-up rage.

130
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm not going.

131
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,760
Just swing by.

132
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
I wrote the song myself.

133
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,760
Just swing by
and let me know what you think.

134
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,920
Wait!

135
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
Take this.

136
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,880
Don't throw it away
even if you don't drink it.

137
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,040
The security guard loves it.

138
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,520
Of course, I'm going.

139
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,880
It's a class reunion. I'll be there.

140
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,640
All right, see you in half an hour.

141
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,080
Hey, police officers clock out too.

142
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

143
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,600
Okay.

144
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,240
I'll call you back.

145
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,880
What's this?

146
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,520
Your phone.

147
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,040
Yesterday, you said
you were busy looking into a case.

148
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
And yet?

149
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,280
I guess the police lie.

150
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Mrs. Shaw,

151
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
there's no proof
that the killer will be at the beach.

152
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I can't mobilize officers
to patrol that area the whole night.

153
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,120
My daughter was his second victim.

154
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,960
The first victim
on the leap day eight years ago

155
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,880
was Xie Liping,

156
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
- who was also dismembered…
- Xie Liping's limbs

157
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,320
were found in the forest.

158
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,880
Then your team can split up.

159
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,680
They can patrol the beach and the forest.

160
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,080
Mrs. Shaw.

161
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,600
Yours is not the only case
we handle here at the station.

162
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
This is not how we investigate cases.

163
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Are you even investigating?

164
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,920
Where's Fu Dashu? I want to see him.

165
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
Mrs. Shaw.

166
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
My mentor is retiring soon.

167
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Please leave him be.

168
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,320
Plus, the police clock out too.

169
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I can attend the birthday party
of my supervisor's daughter.

170
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,080
Her birthday is on a leap day.

171
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,720
It's once every four years,
so why shouldn't I go?

172
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,800
What about those who died on this day?

173
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,720
Are they not important?

174
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,040
Without any leads,

175
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,840
we can't catch the killer.

176
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,960
There's nothing we can do.

177
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,920
I understand how you feel.

178
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,760
Do you have children?

179
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,400
Then you understand nothing.

180
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,480
You will never understand.

181
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,560
How can they cancel it just like that?

182
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,360
I've already finished all the pieces.

183
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,920
It can't be helped.
We just can't find a sponsor.

184
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Companies used to fight to sponsor me.

185
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,720
Like you said, they used to.

186
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,880
You've lost your market value

187
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,520
because you haven't made art
in four years.

188
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,920
Why don't you try the Sun Foundation?

189
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,440
Probably easier
to negotiate with your own.

190
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,840
By 2034,

191
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,920
our foundation will be able
to help 30% more families.

192
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,040
We'll be able to help
between 550 to 650 youths.

193
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,640
Mr. Sun.

194
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,400
Mr. Sun. What do you think?

195
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,160
Sir?

196
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,840
Do you have any questions, Mr. Sun?

197
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,880
No.

198
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
I'll be in touch. Thank you.

199
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,280
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Sun.

200
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,680
Who's the next applicant?

201
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,320
What are you doing here?

202
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
Mrs. Sun is requesting funding.

203
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,520
Let's take a break.

204
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,640
Did you come here to laugh at me?

205
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,400
There's a limit to my patience.

206
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,080
You refuse to talk to me,

207
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,080
so I have no other choice.

208
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
I need funding to hold an exhibition.

209
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
You're the only one who can help me.

210
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
You're seriously
holding an exhibition now?

211
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,280
What are you up to this time?

212
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,400
You've forgotten Sera too.

213
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,440
I won't let her be forgotten by the world.

214
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,840
I won't be a part of this.

215
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,320
You have the money.

216
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,480
Sell the branded bags and the diamonds.

217
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,400
That'll be more than enough.

218
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,400
I need the Sun Foundation's reputation.

219
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,680
- You're a renowned philanthropist.
- I have no real power.

220
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Go ask Sun Dehui for the money.

221
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,160
He's the one running the ship, not me.

222
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,080
Allan,

223
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm begging you.

224
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,280
Sera's killer is still on the loose.

225
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,400
I must hold this exhibition.

226
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,120
I need notoriety and publicity,
which is what you're good at.

227
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,600
Let this go, Ruoyun.

228
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,920
You've torn this family apart.

229
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
Me?

230
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,680
Why did Sera yell at you?

231
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,960
It's been four years.

232
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,080
Have you ever given me an answer?

233
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,960
I don't have the answers anymore,
because she's dead.

234
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,880
That's right!

235
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
Tell me whose child she was carrying then.

236
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,160
I will only know if I catch the killer.

237
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,600
You're insane.

238
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,600
Mr. Deng, looking for Dehui?

239
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,840
Yeah.

240
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,240
I just came out of a meeting.

241
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,120
Talk some sense into your brother.

242
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,360
Tell him to stop calling
shareholder meetings.

243
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,320
We're busy too, you know?

244
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,960
I'll get going.

245
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,040
Don't touch me, you hypocrite!

246
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,480
Don't speak to your dad like that, Sera.

247
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,040
How should I speak to him?

248
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,600
The way you do?

249
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,160
What?

250
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,280
- Sera!
- Why did you have to call the reporters

251
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,400
to come to witness your fake love?

252
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
Why put on an act?

253
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,960
- You even implicated Shanwen and I!
- Shut your mouth!

254
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,280
If you don't love each other,

255
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,720
then get a divorce!

256
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,400
Sera!

257
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,320
That's not Sera.

258
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,880
It's not.

259
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,680
That's not Sera.

260
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
She doesn't have a tattoo on her thigh.

261
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
She doesn't. That's not her.

262
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,840
This is not Sera's leg.

263
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,840
She doesn't have any tattoos.

264
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
I need to see the head you found.

265
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,640
No…

266
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,760
No…

267
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,600
Sera!

268
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
No…

269
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,040
Why…

270
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,120
Sera!

271
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,760
She was three months pregnant.

272
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
No…

273
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,720
<i>Tell me whose child she was carrying then.</i>

274
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
Ruoyun.

275
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,040
Mr. Deng.

276
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,320
I heard you're applying for funding.

277
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,520
Why didn't you come to me?

278
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm sure that will look good on you.

279
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,440
SHAW

280
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,920
<i>Since the beginning of time</i>
<i>And until the end of eternity</i>

281
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,600
<i>Your words have never changed</i>

282
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
<i>You guide me</i>

283
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,480
<i>And fill my heart with peace</i>

284
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,080
<i>Jesus</i>

285
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:41,080
<i>I call upon you</i>
<i>To water your mighty spirit</i>

286
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,920
<i>May the Holy Spirit</i>

287
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,800
<i>Set our hearts aflame</i>

288
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,760
<i>May your spirit</i>

289
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,400
<i>Bring blessed showers of revival</i>

290
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,520
<i>That wake my soul</i>

291
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,400
<i>I am not afraid, for you walk with me</i>

292
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,000
<i>You give me courage to live confidently</i>

293
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,160
<i>I throw myself completely</i>
<i>Into your shelter</i>

294
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,320
<i>May I devote this life to you</i>

295
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,560
<i>And sacrifice this heart of mine to you</i>

296
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,520
<i>I throw myself completely</i>
<i>Into your shelter</i>

297
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,760
<i>May I devote this life</i>

298
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,680
<i>To you</i>

299
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,040
<i>And sacrifice this heart of mine to you</i>

300
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm Peter.

301
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,480
James isn't here today.

302
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,520
Is this funny?

303
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,920
Who's laughing?

304
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,840
Laugh and I'll have
you come up here to sing.

305
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm not as nice as James.

306
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,600
Hey, why isn't anyone laughing?

307
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,920
All right then.

308
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,600
Well then, nice, old James is back.

309
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,600
I've been wearing this mask for so long…

310
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,080
that I've forgotten what I look like.

311
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,280
What about you?

312
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,280
Do you wear masks too?

313
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,000
Especially when you've been hurt.

314
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,760
Do you find yourself thinking…

315
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,880
that life is full of pain?

316
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,600
Whether you like it or not,

317
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,160
you're always hurting.

318
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,120
"I just want to be happy.

319
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,360
I don't want to hurt anymore."

320
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
But this is impossible,

321
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,880
because joy and pain go hand-in-hand.

322
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,200
Many people don't know
how to deal with their pain,

323
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,000
so they put on masks,

324
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,960
because they're afraid
of getting hurt again.

325
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,800
You know what's worse?

326
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,240
Some people use vices to numb themselves.

327
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,400
Like alcohol, for example,

328
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
or drugs,

329
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
medications,

330
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,160
smut

331
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,760
or violent games.

332
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,520
We allow escapism, hatred and pain…

333
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,520
to eat away at our weak hearts.

334
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,440
What then?

335
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,280
Let God…

336
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,480
heal your pain.

337
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,159
Come on.

338
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,120
Let's turn
to Proverbs chapter 17, verse 22,

339
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,800
and read this aloud together.

340
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,520
"A joyful heart is good medicine,

341
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,280
but a crushed spirit dries up the bones."

342
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,639
Why did you leave halfway?

343
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,400
There's no twist to it at all.

344
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,480
Maybe you're just not used to this yet.

345
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,239
Maybe it'll be fine
after a few more sessions.

346
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,360
How many more?

347
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,679
This is for you.

348
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,440
Our new friends are all stars to us.

349
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,760
Next time, if you don't leave
during the sermon,

350
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,920
we'll give you two stars.

351
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
There won't be a next time.

352
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,360
Shanwen.

353
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,520
Here you go.

354
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,120
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

355
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,200
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

356
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,600
See you.

357
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Don't be so long-winded next time, Pastor.

358
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Keep it short.

359
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,240
Everyone's hungry.

360
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,400
Don't be rude.

361
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,720
Were you paying attention?

362
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,720
I saw you on your phone.

363
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,600
I was just verifying what you said.

364
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,360
Cindy, you're a vice leader.

365
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,800
You have to set a good example

366
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,360
because many of the lambs look up to you.

367
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,280
More of them look up to Tingting,

368
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,000
and she's on her phone more than I am.

369
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,960
Bye, Pastor.

370
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,480
I'll talk some sense into her.

371
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,040
- All right. God bless you.
- Pastor.

372
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,960
Bye.

373
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
Zhang Tingting.

374
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
Someone really stood out earlier,

375
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,240
running out while I was preaching.

376
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,880
That wasn't very pious of you.

377
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,040
I worked so hard to get my classmate here,

378
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,120
so I had to ask him
why he left so suddenly.

379
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,920
You could have texted him.

380
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,840
You ran out in your heels,
clicking and clacking.

381
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,080
Everyone was looking at you.

382
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,560
Dad.

383
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,240
Don't you always tell me…

384
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,480
that our new friends are stars?

385
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,280
If the US president was here,

386
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,800
would you run after him,
or would you text him?

387
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,920
The US president, huh?

388
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
All right, I surrender.

389
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,920
Don't forget that you're my daughter.

390
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,560
You have to set a good example.

391
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't put me in a difficult position.

392
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Have I, Pastor Zhang?

393
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,680
Don't wear
such eye-catching heels next time.

394
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,800
It's tough being a daughter,

395
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,040
but it's even worse
being a pastor's daughter.

396
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,200
The real struggle
is raising such a stubborn daughter.

397
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,240
Yeah. My heart breaks for you.

398
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,960
One minute, you wear a father's mask.

399
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,600
The next, you wear a mother's mask.

400
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,000
Why don't I treat you to a meal, Dad?

401
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,320
You make it sound so nice,
but I'm still the one paying.

402
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,720
I guess nothing comes for free.

403
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,880
Is that a no?

404
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,160
That's fine with me.

405
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,280
Did I say no?

406
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,560
I'm in.

407
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,760
What are we having?

408
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,720
What I like!

409
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Such is reality.

410
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,480
It's easy to talk
about staging a comeback,

411
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,200
but even my husband won't support me.

412
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,120
Your husband… has no real power.

413
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,520
These days, to run an exhibition,

414
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,440
you need gimmicks.

415
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,720
I'm your guy for that.

416
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,920
Will you help me?

417
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,080
<i>Many people have forgotten about you.</i>

418
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,840
<i>But don't worry.</i>

419
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,440
<i>I'll make sure you'll never be forgotten.</i>

420
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,120
<i>I'll lure your killer out…</i>

421
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,520
<i>and take revenge for you.</i>

422
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Mrs. Shaw, since you're from Hong Kong,

423
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,880
have you ever thought of returning
to Hong Kong or China for your career?

424
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,280
If the opportunity arises.

425
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,960
But my family is here,

426
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,320
and I want us to be together.

427
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,400
I hear you hole up somewhere for months
when you're working on your art.

428
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,840
Does that break your heart, Mr. Sun?

429
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,440
Of course, it does.

430
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,480
She holed up in her workshop

431
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,160
for three months to work on this project.

432
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,720
For three months, I had no wife.

433
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,720
I've repressed this inspiration
for four years,

434
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,840
and now, it is surging
like a wave I cannot ignore.

435
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,320
I'm lucky that my husband and son
are supportive of me.

436
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,720
My family are not the only ones
I must thank for this solo exhibition.

437
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,400
I'm also thankful for my sponsor,

438
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,920
philanthropist Deng Wanhao.

439
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
For every piece sold,

440
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,800
Mr. Deng will donate $100,000 to UNICEF.

441
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,080
That's enough from me.

442
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,800
Let me unveil the main piece of the night.

443
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,080
My artwork is entitled…

444
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,520
<i>Who Killed Sera?</i>

445
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,200
In commemoration of my daughter, Sera,

446
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,160
who died four years ago.

447
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,560
She died on February 29, 2020.

448
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,080
On the same day in 2016,

449
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,600
another woman named Xie Liping
was also dismembered.

450
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,720
It's been so many years,

451
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,000
but the police
still haven't caught the Leap Day Killer.

452
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,000
I hope this immoral killer sees my art.

453
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,400
I hope they feel a mother's pain

454
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,160
and turn themselves in.

455
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
LEAP DAY KILLER STRIKES AGAIN

456
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,160
SECOND VICTIM

457
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,920
<i>It's been so many years,</i>

458
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,080
<i>but the police</i>
<i>still haven't caught the Leap Day Killer.</i>

459
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,520
<i>I hope this immoral killer sees my art.</i>

460
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,640
<i>I hope they feel a mother's pain</i>

461
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,560
<i>and turn themselves in.</i>

462
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,920
LEAP DAY KILLER STRIKES AGAIN
