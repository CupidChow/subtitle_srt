00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
- Take a photo of us.
- All right, I'll take a photo.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay. Take a photo.

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,480
Our family hasn't been like that
for a long time.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,440
After Sera died,

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,000
everything changed.

12
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
That's right.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,360
Everything changed.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,680
Shanwen.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,480
I want to end our family's pain,

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,760
so…

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,560
I've made a decision.

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,160
I'd like to hear your opinion.

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,960
I want to divorce your mother.

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,280
Game over. That's good.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,960
Only then can you start a new game.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,320
I didn't want it to go this far.

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,720
But your mother and I…

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
really can't go back to where we were.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
I hope that this is a good decision.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,440
Shanwen.

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
I want to ask you something.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
I hope you can be honest with me.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
Why did you go to that hotel?

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,000
Was it related to Cindy?

31
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
Cindy told me that…

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,480
she saw Mom and a man…

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
go into a hotel room.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
She told me to take a look for myself.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,240
Do you believe your mother would do that?

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,240
Cindy probably got the wrong person.

37
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,960
She had never seen Mom before.

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
She would never do that.

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
She wouldn't.

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,560
By the way,

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,760
did you tell anyone else about this?

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Officer Lin looked for me,

43
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,280
and I told him about it.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
But I didn't tell him…

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,320
that I kept Cindy's high heel.

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
You kept Cindy's high heel?

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,720
But Mom took it.

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Mrs. Shaw,

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,520
we suspect that you were involved
in Lau Cindy's murder.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,560
Please come with us to the police station.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,280
If you didn't do anything,
you don't have to be afraid.

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,760
I can prove that
you were home the whole night.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,440
On March 5,

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,160
at 12:59 a.m., Cindy called you.

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
Why?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,079
Shanwen. Tell it as it is.

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,519
Only then can you help your mother.

58
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,280
I already told Officer Lin about it.
Didn't he tell you?

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,480
On March 3, from 2:00 to 5:00 a.m.,
where were you?

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,600
I was at home.

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
You don't need to think about it?

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,520
You'd definitely ask me where I was
on the night of the murder.

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
I already thought about it
on the way to the police station.

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,880
So, do I need to pretend to think about it

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,200
to reduce your suspicions of me?

66
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,040
Be serious.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,240
Here.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
Mr. Deng.

69
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Mr. Deng, the police are looking for you.

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,040
Hello.

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,720
The police are investigating
a murder case.

72
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
Can you tell me
who the woman in the video is?

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,440
What makes you think this woman is me?

74
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,400
I made a guess.

75
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,760
Would you like to hear my thought process?

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,280
You went to a hotel room
with your sponsor, Deng Wanhao.

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,080
And Cindy saw you.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
You were worried that
your son would find out about it.

79
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,400
So, you killed Cindy to silence her.

80
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
You wanted to be thorough

81
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,760
and tried to kill two birds
with one stone.

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,120
You imitated the modus operandi
of the Leap Day Killer.

83
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
Your goal…

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,640
was to force the person to kill again,

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,400
right?

86
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
You're good at making up stories.

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,320
I don't have anything else to say.

88
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
Speak to my lawyer
if you have more questions.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,640
Mr. Sun,
in the early morning of March 5,

90
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,960
where was your wife?

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
She slept beside me the whole night.

92
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,120
When I came back the next afternoon,

93
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,920
she even asked me
where I had been that night.

94
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Do you have surveillance cameras
in your home?

95
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
Why did you do that?

96
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,560
I sneaked out to play computer games
till the next day.

97
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,160
My mom found out about it
after looking at the CCTV footage.

98
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,000
She gave me a good scolding
and reduced my allowance.

99
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,520
I spray-painted the camera
because I was upset.

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,720
Mr. Sun.

101
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
Didn't you know about this?

102
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,799
Why would I look at
the surveillance footage out of the blue?

103
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,679
Hello.

104
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,040
Okay.

105
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,520
Send me her address. I'll head over now.

106
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,440
- Ms. Zhang Jingjing.
- Yes.

107
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Are you the woman in the photo?

108
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes.

109
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,560
Is it illegal to catch up
with an old friend at a hotel?

110
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,320
Have some tea.

111
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,240
May I know who is that friend?

112
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
Haohao.

113
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Deng Wanhao.

114
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
Can you prove it?

115
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,720
I've already sent the clothes
for dry cleaning.

116
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,680
The hat… is in my room.

117
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Do you want to come in and take a look?

118
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,520
Hello. Speak.

119
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,840
<i>That woman isn't Shaw May.</i>

120
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,920
Are you okay?

121
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm Lawyer Wang.

122
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
This is my business card.

123
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
She's just assisting in investigations.

124
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,320
Mrs. Shaw,
thank you for your cooperation.

125
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
I hope it didn't cause you
too much trouble.

126
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,720
First, it was my son.

127
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,160
Now, it's me.

128
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,320
It'll be my husband next, right?

129
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm just doing my job.

130
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,360
If you worked harder on solving the case,
the Leap Day Killer

131
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,880
would've been caught by now.

132
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,560
Mrs. Shaw, like you,

133
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,800
we want to seek justice
for the victim and find the killer.

134
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
We've been working hard on the case.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,120
Let's go.

136
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,160
Sorry, I missed the exit to our home.

137
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
I'll make a loop here.

138
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,360
At least we'll still be home
after making the loop.

139
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
But once you miss…

140
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,320
certain paths,

141
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,040
they'll be gone forever.

142
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,720
I'll move out today.

143
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,440
Let's get a divorce.

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,480
Do you need help?

145
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
I'll do it myself.

146
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
Let me help.

147
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,840
Our tragedy started with a suitcase.

148
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
It's the beginning and the end.

149
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
Once that suitcase is closed,

150
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,680
everything will end.

151
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
My sun hat…

152
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,480
You took it, right?

153
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
I needed the evidence.

154
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,800
I don't want Shanwen to get hurt again.

155
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,040
In his heart,

156
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,280
you're still his mother.

157
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,320
Thank you.

158
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,080
I didn't expect that you'd help me.

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
Ruoyun…

160
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
I hope you can be honest with me.

161
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
Did you kill anyone?

162
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,680
Cindy's high heel… Did you take it?

163
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,080
I did.

164
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I killed Sera.

165
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
I killed her…

166
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,720
four years ago.

167
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,280
Shanwen.

168
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm leaving.

169
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,080
Please take care of yourself.

170
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
Don't sleep too late.

171
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,760
Remember to eat breakfast, okay?

172
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
<i>Quick.</i>

173
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
<i>Let's take a photo.</i>

174
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
Come.

175
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,080
One, two, three. Get closer.

176
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,840
- Again.
- Woo.

177
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,840
You guys are out of the frame.

178
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,520
Yes.

179
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,360
Thank you for the drink.

180
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,040
What's up with you?

181
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
What's wrong?

182
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Leave.

183
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,560
‪Huh?

184
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,560
Sorry, please leave.

185
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,880
Are you kidding me?

186
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,800
<i>When we keep secrets,</i>

187
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,840
<i>we're either protecting ourselves,</i>

188
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,000
or we're protecting someone else.
What about you?

189
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,560
Who are you protecting?
What secrets are you hiding?

190
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
I don't have any secrets.

191
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,080
I think that Sera is trying
to tell us something.

192
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,960
<i>Boss,</i>

193
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,520
the IT department is still looking
for clues in Cindy's web activity.

194
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
They haven't found
any suspicious person yet.

195
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,360
Apple has many enemies.

196
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,360
I'm still trying to figure out
who's the most suspicious.

197
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,680
The killer dumped the bodies in places
where there were no surveillance cameras.

198
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,160
The person knew what they were doing.

199
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,120
They knew better than you guys for sure.

200
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,480
Why aren't you considering
why they chose a leap day?

201
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,840
It could be a special occasion,

202
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,320
like an anniversary or a birthday.

203
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Then why was Apple not killed
on a leap day?

204
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,720
Maybe they didn't want to kill anymore,

205
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,240
but Shaw May's exhibition triggered them.

206
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,440
Maybe not. They might've been overseas.

207
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,680
Maybe they were sick
or got into a traffic accident.

208
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,160
- I still think it's Shaw May…
- Hey.

209
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,160
Although she looks suspicious,

210
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,240
we lack the concrete evidence
to pin her down.

211
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,240
Check all hospital records
and immigration records

212
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,040
between February 29 and March 10.

213
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,840
Master,

214
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,120
that would be tens of thousands of people.
How do we check that?

215
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
Stay up and work overtime.
Is this your first day at work?

216
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,240
Also,

217
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,840
reopen Sera's case.

218
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,280
I want to know the father
of her unborn child.

219
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Boss, that case went cold four years ago.

220
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,840
How are we going to investigate now?

221
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,880
Clues will appear slowly.

222
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,200
You just have to look carefully, right?

223
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,880
Yes.

224
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,000
Dismissed.

225
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,360
What kind of place is this?
It's so hot and dirty here.

226
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
My new shoes are ruined.

227
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,480
It's my first assignment.
Why must it be so difficult?

228
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,360
You! Come over here.

229
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
Sir, what are you doing?

230
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,640
Are you doing a fashion show?
Search in the water!

231
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
There are so many people searching…

232
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
Okay, I'll go right now!

233
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,560
There's something here! Quick!

234
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,080
You're finally back.

235
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,280
I thought Mr. Deng chewed you to pieces.

236
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,520
Dad gave me the stocks.

237
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,160
I can sell them to whomever I want.

238
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,160
Dad and Grandpa worked so hard
for this business.

239
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,840
Now, he has even more shares than me.

240
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,360
Sooner or later, he'll take over
the Sun family's business.

241
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,480
Would you let him take over?

242
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,120
I know you.

243
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,480
You would buy shares from other people
if you could.

244
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,760
How could you have sold your shares
to someone like Mr. Deng?

245
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,240
Why?

246
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,800
How do I know you don't have other copies?

247
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,040
Trust is essential in business.

248
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,680
It's also a principle of mine.

249
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,280
Is that woman reliable?

250
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,080
Money…

251
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,360
is always reliable.

252
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
You're too selfless.

253
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,320
Your wife cheated on you,

254
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,160
and yet, you sacrificed yourself
to protect her.

255
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,160
As long as I get them, I'm satisfied.

256
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,040
Hey.

257
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,480
Are you mute? I'm asking you why!

258
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,960
If you're so capable,
why don't you fight with him?

259
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,360
Mr. Sun, Mr. Deng and his son are here.

260
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,520
Mr. Deng, welcome!

261
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,120
Zach.

262
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,560
This is your new office.

263
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,280
Do you like it?

264
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,520
You don't like it?

265
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,040
In that case, let's renovate it.

266
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,240
Great idea.

267
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,200
It's best if you knock down this wall too.

268
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,000
It'll look bigger and better.

269
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
Paul.

270
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,640
How dare you show up here?

271
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,280
Are you here to see
when the police will arrest Ah Long?

272
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,800
You scoundrel!

273
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,920
Grandpa, I didn't expect things
to turn out this way.

274
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,440
I'm sorry. These things are for you.

275
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,920
I don't want anything from you.

276
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,160
You scoundrel.

277
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,520
Pretending to be kind!

278
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,680
Paul, we have to believe in God.

279
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,400
- We may encounter bad things…
- Believe in God!

280
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,920
…but those things force us
to turn and head

281
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,880
- toward the right things.
- Stop talking nonsense.

282
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,000
Going on and on about God.

283
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,120
You…

284
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,880
Are you crazy? Let go of the cleaver.

285
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,120
- Let go!
- Let go of me!

286
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,840
- Let go!
- Put it down!

287
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,040
Put it down!

288
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720
- Go!
- I'm sorry.

289
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,600
- Put it down.
- I'm sorry.

290
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,720
Get out of here!

291
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,280
Tingting.

292
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Dad?

293
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Uncle James.

294
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm already grown up.

295
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,360
Why are you still picking me up
from school?

296
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,280
I'm just worried about you.

297
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,920
I'll take my leave.

298
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,040
Shanwen, join us for lunch.

299
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
You guys, go ahead.

300
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,400
He's usually very polite.

301
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,000
He's been in a bad mood recently
because his parents got divorced.

302
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,120
Well, show him some concern then.

303
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,880
Dad, I think…

304
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,600
you should show Auntie Ruoyun
some concern too.

305
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,720
Hot chocolate.

306
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,200
I'm not thirsty.

307
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,640
Have some.
You haven't eaten anything all day.

308
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,800
It's amazing.

309
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,040
When I'm here,

310
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,760
I feel much calmer.

311
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,000
When I'm in a bad mood,

312
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,720
I turn off my phone

313
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,360
and sit in the church alone too.

314
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,280
You get bad moods too?

315
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,720
Of course. I'm human too.

316
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,720
Every time I see you,
you're so happy and positive.

317
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,000
There are always low points in life.

318
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,440
On the day my wife passed away,

319
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,760
I suddenly felt like my life was empty,

320
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,960
especially in here.

321
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,280
Tingting was five years old at the time.

322
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,520
I asked my friend to take care of her…

323
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,640
and came to the church alone.

324
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,480
I remember sitting on this exact seat.

325
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,120
It was a Monday.

326
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,440
There wasn't anyone in the church.

327
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
I could finally shed
my identity as a pastor…

328
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
and cry…

329
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,000
and cry.

330
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,440
After crying,

331
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,480
I felt like my body
wasn't so heavy anymore.

332
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
My heart didn't feel as empty either.

333
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,320
I don't know how many times I've cried.

334
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,920
My heart… is still empty.

335
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
Perhaps my faith gave me strength.

336
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,640
Aren't you angry?

337
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
Your God didn't protect you.

338
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,159
Blame can't solve problems…

339
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,120
so I choose to let go.

340
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,880
Stretch out your hand.

341
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,719
Clench your fist.

342
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,120
Tighter.

343
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,080
Tighter.

344
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,520
Tighter.

345
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,480
After clenching it for a while,
you'll feel tired.

346
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,920
Why don't we use this strength

347
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,760
to climb out of the rut instead?

348
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,880
Can I climb out of it?

349
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,160
You can.

350
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,360
As long as you look forward
and don't look back.

351
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,400
Look forward…

352
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
to the future.

353
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,760
But no one is waiting for me
to climb out of it.

354
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,080
You still have Shanwen.

355
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
Shanwen…

356
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
hates me to the core.

357
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,800
Let me tell you another story.

358
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,240
In the past, I really hated my father too.

359
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,320
But one day, I told him,

360
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,200
"Dad, I don't hate you anymore."

361
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,800
He started crying.

362
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,640
When we're at a low point,

363
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,520
everything looks dark.

364
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,960
But as long as we have faith,

365
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,040
the world outside

366
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,400
will still be as glorious as ever.

367
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,160
Master.

368
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,360
What happened?
Why are you sitting here?

369
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,360
It's boring to drink alone.

370
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

371
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,960
You gave me a scare.

372
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,440
Let's drink at my house.

373
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,440
I thought you didn't drink?

374
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,960
Peanuts and beer.

375
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,080
A perfect match.

376
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,800
I like to drink.

377
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't drink because of work.

378
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,200
A lot of things can't be taken
at face value.

379
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm retiring soon.

380
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,120
I can drink as much as I want then.

381
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,040
Okay, Master. I'll drink with you then.

382
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,360
Who's your master?

383
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,400
If you really see me as your master,
you'll have to learn from me.

384
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,560
Master,

385
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,520
you've always been my role model.

386
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,400
I'll wait till I retire to drink too.

387
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,680
You're disgusting!

388
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,240
If you want to learn from me,

389
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,840
stop your smooth talking.

390
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
As a criminal investigator,

391
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,040
I can put my hand on my heart

392
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,200
and retire with a clear conscience.
What about you?

393
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,800
Do you have a clear conscience?

394
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,120
I've been in this line of work
for a long time.

395
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,440
Promotions and salary increments
are not important to me.

396
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,880
What's most important
is my sense of purpose.

397
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,360
In the past few decades,

398
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,160
I've seen too many bodies.

399
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
They're really pitiful.

400
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
They can't speak anymore.

401
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,680
We are their spokespeople.

402
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,600
We solve the cases for them.

403
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,600
We bring them justice,

404
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
so they can rest in peace sooner

405
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
and so the sadness of their families
can be relieved.

406
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,280
It's that simple.

407
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,040
Tell me.

408
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,480
What's most important to you?

409
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,880
I'm aware that you knew Sera.

410
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,520
You even got someone to delete this photo.

411
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Be honest with yourself.

412
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,160
What are you hiding?

413
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,200
Tell me!

414
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,160
What was your relationship with Sera?

415
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,680
Master…

416
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,720
Sir…

417
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm sorry.

418
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,920
I don't want an apology! I want the truth!

419
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,000
You've forsaken your duty

420
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,560
and the oath you took
at the police academy.

421
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
Tell me now!

422
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,200
What was your relationship with Sera?

423
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,080
You're not going to tell me?

424
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,600
I'll find out sooner or later.

425
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,160
But let me remind you.

426
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,840
The consequences will be
more serious than you imagine.

427
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,840
You'll have to pay a greater price.

428
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,320
Master!

429
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,160
I'm begging you.

430
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,320
- I'm begging you.
- What are you doing?

431
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,920
- I'm begging you.
- Okay.

432
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm begging you. Don't do that.

433
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,680
I'm begging you. Please don't beg me.

434
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,520
Stop it.

435
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
Don't call me sir anymore.

436
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,480
Just call me Dashu.

437
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,800
When I was little, I hated my name
and hated my dad…

438
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,320
for giving me such a funny name.

439
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,720
Dashu…

440
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
I was made fun of
by my classmates in school.

441
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
When I graduated from the police academy,

442
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,920
my dad put his arm around my shoulder
and said…

443
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,240
"Dashu, you're…

444
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,760
like a big tree now.

445
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,880
You can provide shade and bear fruit.

446
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,480
You can help people now."

447
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,280
From that day on, I really liked my name.

448
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,160
What about you?

449
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,000
Lin Guoguang.

450
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,440
Do you like your name?

451
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,280
SHAW MAY

452
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,200
AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE.MP4

453
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,400
<i>Sera.</i>

454
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,640
<i>‪It's my fault.</i>

455
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,560
<i>It's my fault.</i>

456
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,120
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

457
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,080
<i>You want to see it, don't you?</i>

458
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,480
<i>I'll strip for you!</i>

459
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,320
<i>Don't!</i>

460
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,120
<i>Don't touch me!</i>
