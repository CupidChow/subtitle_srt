1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,520
Sir.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,000
We found this over there earlier.

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,560
DON'T LET GO. ONLY BY HOLDING ON TIGHTLY
CAN ONE STILL FEEL ALIVE - SHAW MAY

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Have they all arrived?

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,480
They're waiting outside.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,040
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,920
Come on in.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,280
Hey. Wait outside.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,880
Mrs. Lau.

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,360
Dear God,

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,520
I beg of you.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
Don't…

13
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,280
Why did this happen to her?

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Why did this happen?

15
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,840
How could you leave me all alone?

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,440
How could you leave me alone?

17
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,240
Go get some coffee.

18
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Yes, Master.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,480
Add some sugar to it.

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Since when do you take yours with sugar?

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
It's not for me. It's for Mrs. Lau.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
Yes, Master.

23
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,440
Don't call me that.

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,080
Go on then!

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
Yes, Master!

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
I have some questions to ask you.

28
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,440
It'll give us more leads.

29
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,600
Do you know if Cindy
had bad blood with anyone?

30
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,400
She didn't have bad blood with anyone.

31
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,840
She was a kind child.

32
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,080
She had many good friends.

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
His daughter and Cindy were good friends.

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
He can testify to that.

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,760
Did Cindy have a boyfriend?

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,720
She didn't.

37
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
She wanted to focus
on completing university.

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,200
She wouldn't have wasted
her time on a relationship.

39
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,560
We found traces of semen in her body.

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Was she raped?

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Was she?

42
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,480
Don't get worked up, Mrs. Lau.

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,760
There are no signs
of her having been raped.

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
The coroner has ruled out
this possibility for now.

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
Do you recognize this high heel?

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,200
Don't wear
such eye-catching heels next time.

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
These are branded.

48
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
A pair of these costs more than $1,000.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
All right.

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,880
Thank you for your cooperation, Mrs. Lau.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Go back and get some rest.

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,120
We'll contact you again. Take care.

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
Master.

54
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Do you think the Leap Day Killer did this?

55
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,000
Master?

56
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,640
- Can I help you?
- Mr. Sun Allan,

57
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,280
the police found
a floating corpse this morning.

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
What do you have to say about the
possible return of the Leap Day Killer?

59
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Could your wife Shaw May's exhibition
have triggered him to kill again?

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,840
You should speak with the police.
Why are you asking me?

61
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,880
Am I that capable?

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,920
Can a few pieces of art
trigger someone to kill again?

63
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,000
We're talking about murder.

64
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,200
It's someone's life.

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
He's the Leap Day Killer.

66
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,000
He kills someone every time
the 29th of February comes around.

67
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
It has nothing to do with my exhibition.

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,520
As for why he's a week late this time,

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,080
the police can answer
that question for you.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,200
DON'T LET THE WORLD CHANGE YOUR SMILE

71
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,360
LET YOUR SMILE CHANGE THE WORLD

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,960
You should rest after drinking your milk.

73
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
I'll drink it later.

74
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,120
I know that Cindy's death
must be hard for you to take.

75
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,320
However, life still goes on.

76
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,800
You still have school tomorrow,

77
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,640
so rest early, all right?

78
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Why did God let such a cruel thing happen?

79
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,760
Many things happen without good reason.

80
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,960
However, no matter what you face,

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,920
never be doubtful and never give up.

82
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,040
The intention conveyed by God

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
is one of peace…

84
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,120
and not one of disaster.

85
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,760
How is this not a disaster?

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,800
How can human beings be so cruel…

87
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
and kill another person?

88
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
We must believe that
God has good intentions.

89
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,320
How is death a good intention?

90
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,600
Death is not the end.

91
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,600
It's the beginning of eternal life.

92
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,280
It's just like…

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,840
Although Mom has left us,

94
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,720
she's waiting for us in Heaven.

95
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,760
We'll meet her again one day.

96
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Similarly, we'll meet Cindy again one day.

97
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,120
All right.

98
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Hurry and finish the milk
and get some rest.

99
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,520
Good night, Dad.

100
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,080
Good night.

101
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,360
Hey.

102
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,560
It would be easier if you were still here.

103
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,600
You could be here for our daughter,

104
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
cry with her,

105
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
laugh with her,

106
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,360
<i>talk with her about her problems,</i>

107
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,200
<i>sleep with her.</i>

108
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,520
<i>That way, she wouldn't be so lonely.</i>

109
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
<i>Our daughter needs you.</i>

110
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,080
Actually, I need you too.

111
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,000
How's it like in Heaven?

112
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,200
How's life over there?

113
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,760
A female university student calling
a private hire car to this hotel.

114
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,080
It's pretty telling.

115
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Telling of what?

116
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,040
There's no evidence,
so stop spouting nonsense.

117
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
High heels worth more than $1,000.

118
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,960
A single-parent family.
Her mother's a cleaner.

119
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,200
Did money fall from the sky?

120
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
- I couldn't bear to buy it for myself.
- Yours aren't cheap either.

121
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
Master.

122
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
It seems like you took notice of me.

123
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Are my new shoes nice?

124
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
Who's your master?

125
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,600
I don't take disciples.
Stop calling me that.

126
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,360
Yes, Master!

127
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,080
Check if there's
anything dirty on my back.

128
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,080
Sir, could you rewind it by two seconds?

129
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay.

130
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,240
Check the time that they left.

131
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
Do this.

132
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,520
Check all the cars that left
the parking lot

133
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,680
at 11:00 a.m. on March 5

134
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,520
and all the private hire cars
that arrived at the hotel.

135
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,640
We must find out who this man is.

136
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
Do you have footage
from outside the hotel?

137
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,680
Yes.

138
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,720
The CCTV footage indicates that…

139
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Cindy left from this road.

140
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,600
Why would a young girl come
to a back alley at such a late timing?

141
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
Even if she called for a private hire car,

142
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,280
she wouldn't have been waiting here.

143
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
There are two possibilities.

144
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,240
One, someone picked her up.

145
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Two,

146
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,560
she realized she was being followed
and tried to escape here.

147
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,560
We need evidence.

148
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,080
Master,

149
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,840
I've given it some serious thought.

150
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,960
I don't think this was
the work of the Leap Day Killer.

151
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,000
Firstly, she didn't die on a leap day.

152
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Secondly, the body was not dismembered.

153
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Master.

154
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,640
Any thoughts?

155
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,640
I know you think I'm very smart.

156
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,880
Praise me, won't you? Don't be so stingy.

157
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,560
Everyone…

158
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,480
Today, on behalf of Cindy's family,

159
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,160
I would like to thank
her family and friends

160
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,000
as well as our fellow brothers
and sisters in Christ

161
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,480
for participating in her memorial service.

162
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
We're all saddened

163
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
by Cindy's sudden departure.

164
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,120
We wonder why the murderer was so cruel.

165
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,840
The rage and sense of injustice we have

166
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,040
towards her murderer

167
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,120
is completely understandable

168
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,480
because we're only human.

169
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,760
However, God wants us to be forgiving.

170
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
We must learn to be forgiving.

171
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,720
That's because rage
and a sense of injustice

172
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,200
will only make us increasingly unhappy.

173
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,920
It's like ingesting poison every day.

174
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,480
We're the victims,

175
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,320
but we also become our own perpetrators.

176
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,560
I hate you.

177
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,839
You caused my daughter to die.

178
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,359
Like everyone else,

179
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,680
I hate your exhibition.

180
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,280
You caused Cindy to be murdered!

181
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
However,

182
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,560
that pastor told me…

183
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,120
that you had nothing
to do with Cindy's death.

184
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,160
I'm so angry,

185
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,720
but I have no one to lash out at,

186
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,720
so I cursed at you.

187
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm the one…

190
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,120
who should apologize.

191
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
I can understand how you feel now.

192
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,160
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

193
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,200
We met yesterday.

194
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,760
Can I ask you some questions?

195
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,960
Were you good friends?

196
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm the leader of Cindy's cell group.

197
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,440
Did Cindy display
any unusual behavior recently?

198
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,240
When was the last time
you were in contact with her?

199
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,360
It was around two weeks ago.

200
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't really remember.

201
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,440
You can check your text messages.

202
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,760
We… usually…

203
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,280
call each other.

204
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,760
Do young people still call each other?

205
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,800
The members of our church

206
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,040
prefer to call each other.

207
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,840
There are call records
for phone calls too.

208
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,160
Do you…

209
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,800
wish to check my call records?

210
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't have to anymore.

211
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,240
If you had anything to hide,
you would've already deleted it.

212
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
Am I right?

213
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,760
- Pastor.
- Hey.

214
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,560
- Is anything wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

215
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,520
My subordinate is just asking
some questions as a formality.

216
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
It's tough for you policemen.

217
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
You even have to come to a funeral.

218
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,680
It's not easy.

219
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,080
It's only right.

220
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,320
We're giving
the family some moral support.

221
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,000
Why didn't Cindy's father
attend the funeral?

222
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,680
Her parents haven't been in contact
with each other since their divorce.

223
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,720
She grew up in a single-parent family.

224
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,200
It's inevitable that she had
some emotional trauma.

225
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,160
She had a tough life.

226
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
I share the same sentiment.

227
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,040
It's indeed not easy for someone
who grew up in a single-parent family.

228
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,280
It's not easy indeed.

229
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,800
Regardless,
be careful whenever you're outside.

230
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,160
Also, tell me wherever you're going.

231
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,480
If it's really the Leap Day Killer,

232
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,120
he always targets young girls,

233
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,600
girls around your age.

234
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,040
Zhang Tingting.

235
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,840
Did you hear what I said?

236
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,680
I know that Cindy's death
must have been hard on you.

237
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,760
However, God will judge everyone.

238
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
The murderer will be caught eventually.

239
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,960
- Dad.
- Hmm?

240
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,920
How does God treat liars?

241
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,640
You should know that.

242
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
Will they really be forgiven?

243
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,240
As long as they repent,
they'll be forgiven.

244
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
How does one know that
they've been forgiven?

245
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,000
Can one really tell… white lies?

246
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,560
White lies are still lies.

247
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,160
What are you trying to tell me?

248
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,560
It's nothing.

249
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,440
Something's definitely troubling you.

250
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,000
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

251
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,120
Dad.

252
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood to eat.

253
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,360
The coroner ruled that

254
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,160
Cindy died on March 5
sometime between 1:00 am and 5:00 a.m.

255
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,720
The CCTV footage
from the hotel indicates that

256
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,520
Cindy left the hotel at around 1:02 a.m.

257
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
She entered the hotel with a man.

258
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,040
This man left at around 11:00 a.m.

259
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,960
We're still figuring out his identity.

260
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
The coroner's report indicates that

261
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
Cindy died after being struck
in the back of her head by a heavy object.

262
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,160
The murder weapon is likely
to be a square-shaped heavy object.

263
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,760
We're still figuring out
what it is exactly.

264
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,040
Here's the main question.

265
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
Could Cindy have been killed
by the Leap Day Killer?

266
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,440
Xie Liping.

267
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,200
She died on the leap day in 2016.

268
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,400
Sun Shanqi Sera.

269
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,280
She died on the leap day in 2020.

270
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
The coroner's report indicates

271
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
sleeping pills were found
in both of their bodies.

272
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
They were both dismembered.

273
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,200
Sera's injuries were more prominent.

274
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,680
As for Cindy…

275
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,680
WHAT DO THESE 3 HAVE IN COMMON?

276
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,840
You'll share about Cindy's case.

277
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,600
You presented a good analysis that day.

278
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,320
I don't think Cindy was murdered
by the Leap Day Killer.

279
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,560
Firstly, she didn't die on a leap day.

280
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,480
Secondly, she wasn't dismembered.

281
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,840
Perhaps, the killer
didn't have time to do so.

282
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,960
Sir.

283
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,040
These are Cindy's call records.

284
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,400
She called Zhang Tingting…

285
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,760
and someone called Sun Shanwen.

286
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,000
She's definitely lying.

287
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
It's okay.

288
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
Relax. Treat this as a chit-chat.

289
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,840
Are you certain that the last time
you contacted Cindy was two weeks ago?

290
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,800
However, Cindy's call records
indicate that

291
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,000
she called you at 12:55 a.m.
on the night she died.

292
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,840
Tingting…

293
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,880
it's against the law to falsify evidence.

294
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,600
Tingting,

295
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,880
be honest with the police.

296
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,360
Otherwise, there will be
serious consequences.

297
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,160
Dad.

298
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
Why was Cindy looking for you?

299
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,040
She borrowed money from me.

300
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,920
So, how much did she borrow?

301
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,760
She borrowed $500.

302
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,240
Did you lend it to her?

303
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I've finished counting these.
The total is $900.

304
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,120
I have something to do,
so I'll leave first.

305
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,040
- Okay. Bye! Thanks!
- Okay. Bye.

306
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,920
Dear God,

307
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,640
you taught us to love and help others.

308
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,760
We shouldn't leave our friends
in the lurch if they're in trouble, right?

309
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,760
The money belongs to you.

310
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,600
However,
if I take some first to help Cindy,

311
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,880
you won't be angry at me, right?

312
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,080
Cindy, this really is the last time.

313
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,280
Last time, you said
you broke your classmate's laptop.

314
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,200
This time, your classmate's mother
is dying soon.

315
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,640
What's next?

316
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
You won't lie to me, right?

317
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,600
It's all true!

318
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,800
I swear I'll die a tragic death
if I'm lying to you, all right?

319
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,240
Why make it so serious?

320
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
I believe you.

321
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,720
Remember not to tell anyone.

322
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,320
I'll give it back to the church
once I have the money.

323
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
She swore to me!

324
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,520
She swore that she would die
a tragic death if she was lying to me.

325
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,720
Did I cause her death?

326
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,760
Don't believe such things like swearing.

327
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
Everything's fine.

328
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm sorry. I'll continue.

329
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,480
Okay.

330
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,560
When Cindy called you on the day she died,
what did she say?

331
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,760
She asked me for the number
of our classmate, Shanwen.

332
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,600
Why was Cindy looking for him?

333
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,960
I asked her,
but she didn't tell me the reason.

334
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,440
Is there anything else
you're hiding from us?

335
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,000
There's nothing else! I swear!

336
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,520
I've recorded it all down.

337
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,480
Thank you for your cooperation.

338
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,840
Sorry to disturb you, Pastor.

339
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Safe travels.

340
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,200
You.

341
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,720
What have I always taught you?

342
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,680
I'll put back the money that you took
from the tithe offering bag.

343
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,320
I'll report this to the committee, and
we'll see how they want to handle this.

344
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,720
I'm sorry, Dad.

345
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,440
It's all right as long as you repent.

346
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,960
All right. Stop crying.

347
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,760
All right. Good girl.

348
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,320
There are no secrets between us.
All right?

349
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,760
There won't be
any secrets between us any longer.

350
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,440
Why would she ask for a guy's number
in the middle of the night?

351
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,560
Sun Shanwen.

352
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,600
He's Sera's younger brother.

353
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,480
Let's go to his place now!

354
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,240
Hey! Are you waiting for an invitation?

355
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,040
What are you waiting for then?

356
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,280
A murder case
makes life hell for the living.

357
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,720
Do you have an update about the murderer?

358
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,120
Your son is related to a murder case.

359
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,240
We wish to speak with him.

360
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
What do you mean?

361
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,880
You're not handling my daughter's case,

362
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,480
and now you're making accusations
about my son?

363
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,200
Your son was the last person
whom the deceased, Cindy Lau, called.

364
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm sure you've made a mistake.

365
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,440
My son doesn't know anyone named Cindy.

366
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,920
Call…

367
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,160
Give me the call records.

368
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,280
The call records indicate that,

369
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,560
at 12:59 a.m. on March 5,

370
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
they were on a call with each other.

371
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,640
I'll be straight with you.

372
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,760
The coroner's report indicated there were
traces of semen in Cindy's body.

373
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,920
We're currently figuring out
this man's identity.

374
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,320
There's a possibility that
he could be your son.

375
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
We need him to come in for a test.

376
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,640
I'm calling my lawyer.

377
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,720
You can test all you want.

378
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm not scared of you.

379
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,360
I'll be in touch again
when the report is out.

380
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,840
I hadn't even finished my sentence.

381
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,560
Thank you.

382
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,680
Don't worry.

383
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,680
The evidence will speak for itself,
even if they don't.

384
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,520
Shanwen. Shanwen!

385
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,280
Why did Cindy look for you?

386
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
What did you tell the police?

387
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,080
What must I do to make you speak up?

388
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,400
- Must I confiscate your phone and laptop?
- That's enough!

389
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,560
He's 17 years old already.

390
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,960
I hope we can be on the same page

391
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,400
when it comes to educating our son.

392
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,920
Is that too much to ask?

393
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,720
Whose page are we talking about though?

394
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,080
It's always yours.

395
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,040
You're always in the right.
We're always in the wrong.

396
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,239
Always?

397
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,000
Can you treat me fairly?

398
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,600
I've listened to you many times
and look at what has happened!

399
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,000
It's clear that I'm always right!
However, I…

400
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,560
Shanwen!

401
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,040
Stop chasing after him!

402
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,280
Stop pushing him further!

403
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,440
Here.

404
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
It's your favorite milk tea.

405
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,640
I haven't liked milk tea for a long time.

406
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
What do you like then?

407
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,240
Why did Cindy look for you?

408
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,640
Did you like her?

409
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,240
You're like the rest of them.

410
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,120
None of you believe me.

411
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,720
Don't worry.

412
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,520
I believe that you didn't kill anyone.

413
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,960
Do you really believe me?

414
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,720
How could my son do something like that?

415
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,440
I'll do everything to protect you…

416
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,440
and support you.

417
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,760
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

418
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,120
I'm not going.

419
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,120
Don't be like this.

420
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm not in the mood
to put on an act with you tonight.

421
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,360
You know that Dehui
is plotting to kick me out.

422
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,560
Tonight's dinner is very important to me.

423
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
Our son is a murder suspect.

424
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
How can you act as if nothing happened?

425
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,320
He was only called in for questioning,

426
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,560
and I believe Shanwen
wouldn't do something like that.

427
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,520
It's been so many years.

428
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,920
You should know how much
I've tolerated Dehui.

429
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,800
I'm Zheng Shizhen's eldest son.

430
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,800
He's the son of a mistress,
yet he has more authority than me!

431
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,240
Many shareholders will be present tonight.
I need you there.

432
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,160
LEAP DAY MURDER CASE - SUN SERA

433
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,840
<i>Why did Cindy look for you?</i>

434
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>What did you tell the police?</i>

435
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,520
<i>Why did Cindy look for you?</i>

436
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,760
<i>Did you like her?</i>

437
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,400
- <i>At 12:59 a.m. on March 5…</i>
- <i>Behind you!</i>

438
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,720
<i>…Cindy called you. Why?</i>

439
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000
<i>Hello. It's Cindy.</i>

440
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,040
What's the matter?

441
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,760
What did you say?

442
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,960
What's wrong?

443
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,920
Go back to your room.

444
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,600
Get off your high horse.

445
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,200
Don't forget that I'm still your husband!

446
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,040
Are you crazy?

447
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,440
Go back to your room!

448
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,520
What's wrong? The great artist
can't be touched by anyone?

449
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,440
Is that so?
I didn't know you were such a tramp!

450
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,360
- Come here!
- Let me go!

451
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,040
- Let me go!
- Tell me!

452
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,800
- Tell me!
- Shanwen!

453
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,440
- Tell me!
- Shanwen!

454
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,760
Shanwen!

455
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,800
Get off!

456
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,400
Shanwen!

457
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,640
Shanwen!

458
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,160
Shanwen!
