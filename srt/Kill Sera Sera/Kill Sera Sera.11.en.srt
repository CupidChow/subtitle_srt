1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,440
Losing a loved one…

2
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,240
is like losing a piece of ourselves.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,760
It's excruciating.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,960
It really is.

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,120
We're all saddened…

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
by Cai Taiwen's passing.

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,440
However, death is not the end.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,720
He has simply…

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,720
gone to a better place first
and is waiting for us to join him there.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,520
One day,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
we'll all meet again in Heaven.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,920
Now,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,120
let's invite his grandson

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,000
to give his eulogy.

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Thank you, everyone,

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,000
for coming to send my grandfather
on his final journey today.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,800
I wasn't the best grandson,

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,880
but he…

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,680
was the best grandfather.

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm very grateful that…

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
I was able to cook for him…

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,200
during his last days.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,000
We only had each other to depend on.

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,000
I feel that…

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
a family's happiest moments…

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
are actually…

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
the simple times spent at home together.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,600
<i>You are my light in the darkness</i>

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,400
<i>You are my companion in difficult times</i>

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,200
<i>I'm willing to look up to you, Lord</i>

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,040
<i>You are my hope in life</i>

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,480
<i>You are the stronghold of my life</i>

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,280
<i>You set me high upon a rock</i>

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,640
<i>With your love, I am strong</i>

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,120
<i>And I am confident</i>

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,480
<i>I call upon you</i>
<i>To water your mighty spirit</i>

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>May the Holy Spirit</i>

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,160
<i>Set our hearts aflame</i>

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,400
<i>May your spirit</i>

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,920
<i>Bring blessed showers of revival</i>

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,920
<i>That wake my soul</i>

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,960
<i>And sacrifice this heart of mine to you</i>

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,880
<i>Since the beginning of time</i>
<i>And until the end of eternity</i>

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>Your words have never changed</i>

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,000
<i>You guide me</i>

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,000
<i>And fill my heart with peace</i>

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,120
<i>I call upon you</i>
<i>To water your mighty spirit</i>

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,320
<i>May the Holy Spirit</i>

49
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,680
<i>Set our hearts aflame</i>

50
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,400
<i>May your spirit</i>

51
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,880
<i>Bring blessed showers of revival</i>

52
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,800
<i>May I devote this life to you</i>

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,680
<i>And sacrifice this heart of mine to you</i>

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,040
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR MY TRAGEDY,

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
BUT I CAN STOP OTHERS
FROM PERPETUATING IT.

56
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
RUBY

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
THIS STORY IS PURELY FICTIONAL
ANY RESEMBLANCES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL

58
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
<i>Dear Son,</i>

59
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
<i>from the day you refused to call me Mommy,</i>

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
<i>I knew that…</i>

61
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,880
<i>I had lost you forever.</i>

62
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,760
<i>I thought I was protecting all of you,</i>

63
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,920
<i>but in fact, I was actually hurting you.</i>

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,160
I had no choice because of your sister!

65
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,920
Don't blame it on Sis and me!

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,240
You should just die!

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
- Shanwen.
- Don't touch me!

68
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,800
You're sick. You're a murderer!

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
<i>You're right.</i>

70
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,800
<i>My hands are stained with Cindy's blood.</i>

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>I will atone for my sins with my life.</i>

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,200
<i>I can also find your sister's murderer.</i>

73
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,600
<i>I've let you down.</i>

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,400
<i>After I'm gone,</i>

75
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
<i>your life… will become better.</i>

76
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
<i>I love you.</i>

77
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,000
- Are you out of prison already?
- <i>That's right.</i>

78
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,000
<i>I just got out.</i>
<i>Let's have a meal together.</i>

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,800
- <i>Hey.</i>
- The reception here is poor.

80
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,320
<i>Where are you?</i>

81
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm in the wooded area where
the church always conducts activities.

82
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,920
The reception here is always patchy.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
<i>A wooden area?</i>

84
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
<i>I can't hear you clearly.</i>
<i>You keep breaking off.</i>

85
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,120
I think I'd better call you
again tomorrow.

86
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,560
SHANWEN: WHERE ARE YOU? CAN WE MEET?

87
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,840
OKAY, I'M AT HOME.

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,560
TINGTING: I'M HERE.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sun Shanwen.

90
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,880
What took you so long to open the door?

91
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,799
Sun Shanwen.

92
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,919
What's the matter with you?

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,799
Why does something feel amiss?

94
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
Here. It's a letter for you.

95
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,520
I got into a fight with my father earlier.

96
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
He almost hit me!

97
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,440
I haven't been on a roller coaster
despite my age.

98
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,120
I know he's worried about me,

99
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,240
but I don't have any heart issues at all.

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,120
He's the one with a fear of heights,

101
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,280
so he worries about every little thing.

102
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
Give it back!

103
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
- Sun Shanwen!
- Give it back!

104
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,600
What does she mean?

105
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,720
What's Auntie Ruoyun talking about?

106
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,920
Does this mean she killed Cindy?

107
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,920
Why did she kill her?

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
- She didn't!
- Why did she kill Cindy?

109
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,920
I'm telling you she didn't!

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
When did you find out about this?

111
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,520
Why didn't you tell me when you found out?

112
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,080
When did you find out?

113
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,320
I don't know anything. I really don't.

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
Hold on.

115
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,840
The bracelet in your mother's car
was Cindy's.

116
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,960
They must have had some bad blood.

117
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,760
That explains why Cindy said
that she wanted to forgive her.

118
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,520
- Don't touch me!
- Tingting.

119
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
- Calm down, Tingting!
- Your mother is disgusting.

120
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,600
She attended Cindy's funeral…

121
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
and even consoled Auntie Yuxin.

122
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,680
Calm down first, Tingting.

123
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,560
- Calm down.
- Sun Shanwen.

124
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Let's call the police, all right?

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
- Let's call the police!
- No!

126
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm begging you.

127
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
Give me some time. I'm not prepared yet.

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,480
Prepared for what?

129
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,680
Sun Shanwen.

130
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,840
A murderer deserves the death sentence!

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,200
Don't you know that?

132
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm begging you, Tingting.

133
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Calm down first.

134
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,800
- Let go of me.
- Calm down!

135
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,400
Listen to me.

136
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
She did it for me!

137
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,960
She did it to protect me!

138
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
What about my best friend then?

139
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,000
What about Cindy?

140
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
Do you plan to cover up for her then?

141
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,520
That's fine.

142
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
You won't go, will you?

143
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
- I'll go!
- No! I'm begging you, Tingting!

144
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,640
- I won't let you go!
- Let go of me!

145
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
- You can't go!
- Let go of me!

146
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,760
- You can't go!
- Let…

147
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,240
Tingting. Tingting!

148
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
Tingting. Tingting.

149
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,200
RUOYUN SHAW

150
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
Let me take this call first.

151
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,080
<i>I killed someone.</i>

152
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,080
<i>I killed someone!</i>

153
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Shanwen. Don't be afraid.

154
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,520
I'll be arriving soon.

155
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,640
<i>I killed someone,</i>

156
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,640
I killed someone.

157
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,000
<i>I killed someone…</i>

158
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
Wait for me.

159
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,760
Don't touch anything. Do you hear me?

160
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,920
I…

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,560
I killed Tingting.

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>I killed Tingting!</i>

163
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,320
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

164
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,640
Don't do anything. Do you hear me?

165
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,120
Shanwen! Shanwen.

166
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm a murderer.

167
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm a murderer.

168
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm a murderer.

169
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm a murderer.

170
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
You're all right now.

171
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,880
I'm a murderer.

172
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,680
You're all right now.

173
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
Take a deep breath, Shanwen.

174
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,600
Come on. You're all right now.

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,120
Breathe in. Slowly.

176
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Breathe out.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Breathe in.

178
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,920
Breathe out.

179
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Slowly. You're all right now.

180
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
I'm here. You're all right now.

181
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
What happened?

182
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
Why did this happen?

183
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,280
The letter…

184
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,520
She saw the letter you sent me.

185
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,000
She wanted to call the police.

186
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,400
I stopped her,
but I pushed her by accident.

187
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,160
- I didn't do it on purpose!
- I know.

188
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,720
You're all right now.

189
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,640
- I'll turn myself in…
- No!

190
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,360
You can't!

191
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,600
Shanwen.

192
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,720
Shanwen.

193
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,840
You have to go to jail
for killing someone.

194
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,200
What if…

195
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,720
What if you're given the death sentence?

196
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,040
That can't happen.

197
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,000
It's fine if I die,

198
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,520
but nothing must happen to you.
I can't lose you!

199
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,280
All of this is my fault.

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,800
It's all my fault.

201
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
It's all my fault.

202
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
Don't think about anything.

203
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
Don't do anything.

204
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,000
You're all right now.

205
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,280
I'll handle it.

206
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,200
Listen to me.

207
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,080
Do you understand me?

208
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
Head upstairs first.

209
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
You're all right now.
Head upstairs first. Come on.

210
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Come on.

211
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,120
You're all right now.

212
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Don't think about or do anything.

213
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Head upstairs first.

214
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,640
- Are you going overseas?
- That's right.

215
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.
It has never acted this way before.

216
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
All right.

217
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
Let's go.

218
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,800
Shanwen is sick with a fever.

219
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,280
I bought so much food
because I wanted to cook for him.

220
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,960
What?

221
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
A fever?

222
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,280
I was wondering if Tingting is here.

223
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,960
She hid Shanwen the other time.

224
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,600
I wonder if he's hiding her this time

225
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,200
since she has gone missing.

226
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,280
Tingting… really isn't here.

227
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,400
No worries.
I'll head upstairs and ask him about it.

228
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
Shanwen.

229
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,000
Why is it locked?

230
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,080
Shanwen.

231
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
Open up, Shanwen!
Is Tingting in there with you?

232
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
James. He really needs to rest.

233
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,000
Shanwen.

234
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,960
Tingting,
can you come out if you're in there?

235
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,800
We agreed to never go to bed angry.

236
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,920
If you're feeling angry,
it's all my fault.

237
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
Shanwen.

238
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,000
Is Tingting in…

239
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,120
- Shanwen.
- Uncle James.

240
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Tingting isn't in here.

241
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,600
What's going on?

242
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,840
No matter how angry she is,
she would never miss a church service.

243
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm sorry, James.
I really have a lot of things to do.

244
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

245
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,160
Please tell me immediately
if you have any news about Tingting.

246
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,800
Shanwen.

247
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
Please tell me immediately
if there's anything.

248
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,840
Tell me immediately
if you have any news about Tingting.

250
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,400
All right then.

251
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,600
I can't take it anymore.

252
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,600
I can't face him at all.

253
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,520
- I'll turn myself in.
- No!

254
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
You're still young.

255
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
You have a bright future ahead of you.

256
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
I'll take the fall for you.

257
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,480
You weren't even here when it happened.

258
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,560
Just let me handle this.

259
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't think about anything.

260
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,800
I'll take you to Dad's place

261
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
just in case Uncle James comes again.

262
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
Tingting!

263
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Tingting!

264
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
- Where are you?
- Tingting!

265
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Tingting!

266
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,800
Tingting!

267
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,480
James.

268
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,080
James.

269
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm sorry. I guess…

270
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,320
I…

271
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,120
What are you sorry for?

272
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
You came down here to help.

273
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,200
All the church members have come to help.

274
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,920
Tingting will be fine.

275
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,360
Don't worry. It's all good.

276
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,280
She'll be fine.

277
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

278
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,560
- I have to leave first.
- What?

279
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,600
Well…

280
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,760
PARK - BACK ALLEY

281
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,800
How is it going?

282
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,720
Look at this.

283
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,520
Stop there.

284
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,720
It only takes two minutes to get
from the back door to the trash bins,

285
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
but she took 20 minutes to return.

286
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,320
We discovered Apple's body on March 11.

287
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,000
She must have been dumping the body
if she always took such a long time.

288
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Did she think she was safe
by deleting all of the CCTV footage?

289
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Sir, I made a significant discovery!

290
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,600
It turns out that Ruby
used to work at a slaughterhouse.

291
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,280
Who would have thought that
with her small build…

292
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,400
ASSISTANT BUTCHER, 2015 TO 2017

DATE OF DEATH: FEBRUARY 29, 2008

296
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,320
February 29…

297
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,280
Sir, it's this one.

298
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
According to the records,

299
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
Ruby's mother was born on a leap day.

300
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,440
ZHUO LILI

301
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,920
Baozi.

302
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,280
What is the probability
of someone's birth and death date…

303
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
both being on a leap day?

304
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,800
I don't know. Let me check.

305
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,880
ZHUO LILI

306
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,720
Sir, do you mean…

307
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,520
No way. Even her own mother?

308
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,600
Baozi.

309
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,880
Apply for a search warrant now.

310
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,960
Ah Wei, prepare to move in.

311
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,640
Roger that.

312
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,240
FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS

313
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,280
SUN SERA
DECEASED FEBRUARY 29, 2020

314
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,840
HOW ARE YOU?

315
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Ruby!

316
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,320
POLICE

317
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,400
Ruby!

318
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,280
You're surrounded by the police!

319
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,560
Come out immediately!

320
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,680
Come to the station with us
to assist in our investigation!

321
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,080
She's not here.

322
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,960
MANSLAUGHTER

323
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Ruoyun. You finally called.

324
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
How's Shanwen doing?

325
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,360
<i>Don't worry. He's doing fine.</i>

326
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,920
He didn't…

327
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,600
harm himself again, right?

328
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
<i>No.</i>

329
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,720
<i>I've been by his side this whole time.</i>

330
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,640
His mood is much more stable now.

331
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,280
I'll bring him home later.

332
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
I know what happened already.

333
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,920
Shanwen has told me… what he did.

334
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
Ruoyun.

335
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,880
I can't let you…

336
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,000
face this alone.

337
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,360
I'll bear the consequences with you.

338
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,000
How ironic.

339
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,679
Life separated us,

340
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,239
but death

341
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,600
brought the three of us together.

342
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
You must be exhausted.

343
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,199
Don't come over.

344
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,520
I'll take Shanwen to your place.

345
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,800
<i>We'll discuss this later.</i>

346
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,000
Okay.

347
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,760
Hello, Mrs. Shaw.

348
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,120
Do you still remember me?

349
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,160
I'm Ruby.

350
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,800
You're DD's employee.

351
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
How did you know where I live?

352
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,240
Shanwen… told me his address previously.

353
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm sorry…

354
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,480
for disturbing you.

355
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,120
I found this…

356
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
in my boss' office.

357
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
It…

358
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
might be related to you.

359
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
Come in.

360
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,800
Thank you.

361
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,000
This box…

362
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,400
was hidden by my boss.

363
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,080
That's why the police never found it.

364
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,480
I've looked through its contents.

365
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,360
There's a red wig inside.

366
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,800
There's also… some weird stuff.

367
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,640
These…

368
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,400
were hidden by my boss for a long time.

369
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,360
I've seen him…

370
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,000
take out that red wig

371
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,680
and sniff it repeatedly.

372
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,840
There's also…

373
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,200
some sexy women's clothing.

374
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,600
There's also…

375
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,880
a photo of Sera.

376
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,160
Why did you--

377
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,640
Look at you.

378
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,800
You're scared out of your wits.

379
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,280
You and I are the same.

380
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,080
You shouldn't be afraid.

381
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,760
That's right.

382
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm the person…

383
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
you've been wanting to kill…

384
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,640
every day for the last four years.

385
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,800
We have quite a good chemistry,
don't you think?

386
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,720
Why?

387
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,400
Why did you kill my Sera?

388
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Why?

389
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,000
Why did you kill my daughter?

390
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,320
What did you say?

391
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,160
Why?

392
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,040
‪Oh…

393
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,880
You're asking me…

394
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,600
why I killed Sera?

395
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,080
That's because your daughter
was promiscuous.

396
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,200
She wouldn't have been a good mother.

397
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,600
Don't touch me!

398
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,120
You want to see it, don't you?

399
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,720
If you want to,

400
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
- I'll strip for you!
- Sera, don't!

401
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,520
Don't!

402
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,080
Don't touch me!

403
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,360
Hello.

404
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,200
<i>Are you arriving soon, Ruby?</i>

405
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,320
I missed my bus earlier.

406
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,600
I'll be there soon.

407
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,600
One beer and one cocktail, please.

408
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,880
Hey. You should keep a low profile.

409
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
What's the matter with you today?

410
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,480
Hey,

411
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,880
am I your friend or not?

412
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Although we've only known
each other for two months,

413
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,240
you've already become my best friend.

414
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,600
You can share all your secrets with me.

415
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,680
My mouth is…

416
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,000
Do you remember that I told you that

417
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,800
I danced on the For You website?

418
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,640
Someone spent a few thousand dollars
to enter my private room.

419
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,480
I found out today that…

420
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,960
that person…

421
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,840
was my father.

422
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,160
Did you…

423
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,040
Is your child…

424
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
I never meet my clients in person.

425
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,600
Do you think that…

426
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,240
I'll make a good mother?

427
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,280
Are you planning
to give birth to your child?

428
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,000
A girl like Sera…

429
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
wasn't fit to be a mother!

430
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,880
She would only bring
pain and suffering to her child.

431
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,520
Sera once told me that…

432
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,280
she wouldn't make a great mother.

433
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,680
That's because…

434
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,680
she doesn't have a good mother.

435
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,800
My mother has never been
a good role model.

436
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Whenever she works on something new,

437
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,200
she'll go on a retreat for a few months.

438
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,240
She didn't even care
when I was down with chickenpox.

439
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,280
To her,

440
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,920
her career is the most important thing
in the world.

441
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,000
I won't be like her for sure.

442
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,120
I'll give my child all the love

443
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,200
and care in the world.

444
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,640
Most importantly,

445
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,080
I'll give my child freedom.

446
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,200
Sera.

447
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,080
Sera?

448
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,080
Will you really be a good mother?

449
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
No, you won't.

450
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,200
You'll only bring
pain and suffering to your child.

451
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
You need to be released from your pain.

452
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,440
Tomorrow…

453
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,080
is the leap day that
happens once every four years.

454
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,000
Heaven is really kind to you.

455
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,600
It's really kind to me too.

456
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,280
Hey.

457
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm helping all of you.

458
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,920
I was helping Sera to be free
from all the pain and suffering.

459
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,720
I set her child free
from all the pain and suffering too.

460
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,400
You're suffering too, aren't you?

461
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,000
Your perfect daughter

462
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,960
turned out to be a streamer
on a pornographic website.

463
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,320
She was barely 16 years old
when she got pregnant.

464
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,800
She even flirted with your husband.

465
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,480
If you're willing,

466
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,280
I can set you free
from all the pain and suffering too.

467
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,400
Help!

468
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,840
Help me! Help…
