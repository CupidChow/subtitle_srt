1
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I didn't buy anything to eat up here.

2
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,840
There's someone coming.

3
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,120
Hello

4
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,360
Who are you visiting?

5
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm here to visit Foam.

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,000
What is your relationship to the patient?

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,280
I'm his manager.

8
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
May I check your ID?

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,040
Do you have to check my ID?

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
For safety purposes, it's a rule.

11
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,960
How is my friend's condition, doctor?

12
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,440
His condition has improved compared to before. Overall, he's healthy.

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,320
If he's healthy, why hasn't he woken up?

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,880
I still can't find the reason. Let's hope for a miracle. I'm rooting for you.

15
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,720
Thank you.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Until when will you remain asleep, Foam?

17
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,120
Please wake up.

18
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Everyone is hoping for him to wake up. The situation hasn't improved yet. He hadn't made it far and fainted at a bus stop.

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,600
But it's been 15 days now, and his condition remains unchanged.

20
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,440
At first, journalists spread the news recklessly.

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,760
Does anyone know yet who was the one who did that to Boo?

22
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,560
Foam was the first one the police focused on, the evidence was very compelling.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,680
Do you believe Foam was the one who did?

24
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,320
I don't want to believe it.

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,040
I saw the situation on that day with my own eyes.

26
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,040
But you were away for a while on that day, something could have happened in between.

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,920
It's because Boo asked me to buy drinks, but...

28
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,600
But what?

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,480
While I was on my way back, I saw Nenie's bodyguards, but I didn't see her.

30
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Since Foam is hospitalised, I haven't seen Nenie visiting him at all.

31
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Who would dare to come visit? They're probably afraid of ending up in the news. He's the number one suspect in the murder case.

32
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,000
That's true. Who else would dare to come, if not us?

33
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,920
Nenie!

34
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360
Could you please just stay out of this?

35
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
No!

36
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Stop!

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,120
I'm not the one who did it!

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Ms. Nenie, please listen to me.

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,440
Calm down, please.

40
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,360
Foam did it. You told me you would call the police to arrest him, didn't you?

41
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
Why haven't the police arrested him yet?

42
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,840
Miss, it's Riam. I'm here. It's okay. Please take a deep breath.

43
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you okay? I'll help you. Master will send us overseas and make sure you're taken care of.

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,960
Taken care of? Why would I need to be taken care of? I'm not crazy!

45
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,480
No, you're not crazy.

46
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,480
We'll go on a trip abroad and wait until the situation clears up, then we'll come back.

47
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,240
We'll go on a trip abroad? My father will take me?

48
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,200
Yes

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,360
Watch this situation carefully.

50
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,000
Sure, boss.

51
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,760
Probably no one knows about this, right?

52
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,320
Yes, I'll try to keep things as quiet as possible. Don't worry.

53
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,960
Solve problems in order Don't let it negatively affect our organization.

54
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,280
Roger that, boss.

55
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
What did you do, Thientot?

56
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
I just went for a visit.

57
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,280
I told you I wanted this matter to remain quiet. Why are you still giving interviews and making it a news stream?

58
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,160
Well, the reporter asked. According to etiquette, you must answer.

59
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,160
Don't interfere or give any more interviews, okay?

60
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Why are you afraid? We're not involved in this matter.

61
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,440
You understand this isn't a typical situation. The adults instructed it, so I'm obligated to comply.

62
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,960
Why do you have to involve yourself?

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Let's just say I'm requesting you to keep the matter quiet.

64
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,120
This afternoon, your brother will come back from overseas. Hurry back to have dinner together. I've arranged for reporters to meet us.

65
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,760
I don't know why she had to nag me so much. I just gave an interview.

66
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
What happened?

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,200
I had a fight with my mother about visiting Foam. It would have been worse if I had told the reporter that Nenie was also involved in the incident.

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,040
Drink some water first so you'll feel calmer.

69
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
Thanks

70
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,360
Do you feel better now?

71
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,920
Yeah

72
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,760
Mom, I missed you so much.

73
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,520
Sweetheart! I've missed you. Let me see, I haven’t seen you for a long time. How have you been?

74
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,920
Have you changed? You're looking even more handsome.

75
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,280
By the way, go take a shower and get dressed up.

76
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,400
Can I hug you like this for a little while?

77
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,640
Aww, you can continue hugging me after your shower so you'll smell nice and clean.

78
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,080
Today, there will be a reporter coming to interview our family. Hey, hurry up and take a shower. It's almost time.

79
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
Could I please not be interviewed? I'm already exhausted from flying all day.

80
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,040
It will be a brief interview, sweetheart.

81
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,600
And I won't bother you. I'll let you rest.

82
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,640
Just answer them for her. I did as well.

83
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Hey, we still need to discuss the interview you gave today.

84
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
What did you talk about during the interview?

85
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:31,160
Don't worry about it, you just need to focus on our family being interviewed today.Hurry and take a shower.

86
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You, too.

87
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,200
Hurry back, son.

88
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,080
This is Kongtub, my youngest son. He just graduated from an art school. He came back this time and wants to follow his brother's footsteps.

89
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,480
Tomorrow he has a casting, the director reached out to us.

90
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,280
Really? You haven't told me about this.

91
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,440
Yes, really. And the reason I didn't tell you is because I wanted to keep it as a surprise for when you're back.

92
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,280
That's really something. You just got back, and someone is already chasing after you.

93
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,080
I want to support them in pursuing what they love. If they're happy, I'm all for it.

94
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,360
Thientot, have you given your brother any advice?

95
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,400
I probably don't need to advise him on anything. He's the type to figure things out on his own, not one to be pushed.

96
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,720
As for experience, we have to let him learn on his own.

97
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,880
That's great to hear. And Mr. Tassanai, do you support the idea of Kongtub entering the showbiz industry following his older brother's path?

98
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,400
That's up to Pareenawee. She enjoys organizing everything.

99
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,080
Thanks

100
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,400
Come this way

101
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Kongtub, wait here for a moment. I'll go greet the director first.

102
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
But you can go after work, right, Nokkaew?

103
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,800
No, Ms. Pareenawee told me repeatedly that upon arrival, the first thing we should do is greet him.

104
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Please wait for a second.

105
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
Oh, Little?

106
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,800
Oh?

107
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,680
How are you?

108
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Are you back?

109
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Yes, and?

110
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,520
Have you two met before?

111
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,720
Kongtub, give me your composite card.

112
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,280
Oh, I was wondering who it was. It's you, Nakrob.

113
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,440
Did you bring anyone to audition today, or are you going to poach someone from around here again?

114
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,560
I thought this gang left the industry a long time ago. You're all such a nuisance.

115
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,840
I'm not leaving. As long as you're here, I'll stay. I'm worried you'll be lonely.

116
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm not lonely because I have plenty of work to keep me occupied, and all my boys are good boys.

117
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,720
They are not evil. They don't go around and stab or kill people.

118
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
Please understand that you don't need to worry about me.

119
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,680
You should be careful. With your sharp tongue, you might get stabbed one day.

120
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,200
Are you really going to be like this? You and I are not in the same league.

121
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Be careful, you might not have a place in the industry anymore. And now, Boo isn't here to protect you.

122
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,920
It would be wise to show a little humility around me, got it?

123
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,480
You whippersnapper!

124
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:30,160
Come on, let's settle this. That jerk! Do you know who I am?

125
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
Hello

126
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,280
Hello

127
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:49,280
Today, I'm going to have both of you play the roles of best friends, and then one will have to sacrifice so the other can have a chance.

128
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,240
Are you ready?

129
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm ready.

130
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
You two seem to be close.

131
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,640
We're best friends.

132
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,120
I sent you the script. Have you prepared?

133
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,400
Yes, I have.

134
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,400
Okay, then let's begin.

135
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
What's up? You're asking me out late at night. Is something wrong?

136
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,560
I just want to go out for a walk. Bored of staying at home with nothing to do.

137
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,480
You usually draw when you're bored at home.

138
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,560
Actually, I don't wanna go.

139
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,040
Where are you going?

140
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,240
I have to study abroad, but I want you to come with me.

141
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,520
I'm not going. My family doesn't have enough money for that.

142
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,920
You can work and study at the same time. I'll help you with your job.

143
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm not going. You can go without me.

144
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,280
If you're not going, I won't go.

145
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,520
But it's your dream, isn't it? What does this have to do with me?

146
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:27,680
We made a promise to each other that we would live together in a place where no one would know us.

147
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Did you forget?

148
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
Have I ever made a promise like that?

149
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:49,480
Why are you saying that? I never forgot about our promise from that day. You should come with me.

150
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,680
Then you should forget about it. Because it will never happen.

151
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,520
My feelings for you has changed.

152
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,680
Please stay out of my life.

153
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,480
I won't. I won't let you go. I love you. I love you a lot.

154
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,040
And I believe you love me too.

155
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,800
You both acted really well.

156
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
Really well.

157
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
But today, I can choose only one person.

158
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,320
But I heard you said you need two actors.

159
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,080
Yes, but I can only choose one for now.

160
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,600
Um, if there's only one spot available, both of us can forfeit our rights.

161
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,920
But I don't think like that.

162
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,160
If you believe I have sufficient potential or that the character is fitting, then you can select me. I am ready to work to the fullest.

163
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,160
What about the other one?

164
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,440
He may not be ready to work yet, but I am definitely ready.

165
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,160
Director, just to inform you, Kongtub is Ms. Pareenawee's son.

166
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,880
Little, it's your turn.

167
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,240
Alright

168
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,720
Keep fighting and give it your all!

169
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,360
Thank you

170
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,320
Please continue to smile brightly like that.

171
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,840
Uncle, look at this, I've reached one million views.

172
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,960
Oh wow, you're really talented! Just one dance and so many people love it.

173
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,800
I have one more request. I want to learn acting. I aspire to become an actress like Thientot.

174
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,720
If I get to learn, I'll definitely become famous.

175
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,120
You want to learn acting and become like my son?

176
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
I've been following his works. See!

177
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,800
I saw a lot of reporters just now. I'm very excited. Please let me learn acting.

178
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,720
Okay, Baimon. But I'll discuss this matter with Auntie Pareenawee first, mentioning that you're interested in this area.

179
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,120
If you take an acting class, you'll be able to help Thientot.

180
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,360
I won't disappoint you.

181
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,760
That's truly delightful, my dear niece.

182
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Hello

183
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,600
His condition seems pretty much the same as before, not better but not worse either.

184
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm not sure how long he'll remain asleep.

185
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
They've been sleeping for a day.

186
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,520
Right.

187
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,520
When will they wake up?

188
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,840
Right?

189
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,280
Chris seems really concerned about this person in a way I've never seen before.

190
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
Right

191
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,280
Don't you have anything else to add besides "Right"?

192
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,640
Right

193
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,040
When we get back to our room, you can't escape from me.

194
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,680
Tar

195
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,960
Tar

196
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Help him up, will you?

197
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Are you okay?

198
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,560
Mind your head

199
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,400
What's with the sudden collapse? Did you get knocked out by Chris or something?

200
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
What happened?

201
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:59,160
Chris mentioned that you suddenly collapsed. When we called the ambulance, they said you were just sleeping.

202
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,160
We tried to rouse you, but you were out like a light. Ended up snoozing the whole day.

203
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:19,640
As for the one looking after you, it's Chris. He nodded off a little while ago, probably totally wiped out.

204
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,160
If you wake up, we're outta here, okay?

205
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:33,160
If Chris wakes up, tell him we've gone. We're outta here. Take care of each other, you two.

206
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,120
Let's go

207
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,200
See you

208
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
Thanks a lot

209
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Tar? Are you awake now?

210
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,720
I am.

211
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,200
How do you feel?

212
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,840
Do you feel any pain in your body?

213
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,640
I'm really worried about you. Do you know that?

214
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,280
I'm alright. Look at me, I'm good.

215
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,560
Are you sure?

216
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,080
See? I'm fine.

217
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,520
Are you still up for playing around?

218
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm not playing. Do you doubt me?

219
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,720
Do you believe me now?

220
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,840
I believe you now.

221
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm genuinely worried about you, you know?

222
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
Whose picture is that?

223
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh, that's my mom.

224
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,160
Is your mom no longer with us?

225
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,480
Yes, she's in heaven now.

226
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,080
It's okay. You have me.

227
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,760
Thanks

228
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,200
Chis, what are you doing? Where is your sister?

229
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,040
I have no idea. Oh, I'm doing homework.

230
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,440
And who is this? Your friend?

231
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes, this is my friend Tar. We're working on homework together.

232
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,840
Hello

233
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
Hello

234
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Chris, come here.

235
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,000
I want to introduce someone to you.

236
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:35,240
This is Aunt Orn. From now on, she'll be living with us and becoming a part of our family.

237
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,360
Say hello to her.

238
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,720
Hello, Aunt Orn.

239
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,440
Hello, Tar.

240
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
Hello, Aunt Orn.

241
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,640
Chris, you can call me Mom.

242
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,440
I don't want to. I only have one mother.

243
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,040
Chris!

244
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
Are you okay?

245
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm okay.

246
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200
I have to apologize on his behalf.

247
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,960
I understand,

248
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,560
He needs some more time to adjust.

249
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,800
It's totally fine.

250
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,040
Tar, let's go make some delicious desserts.

251
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:21,480
There you go, Enjoy.

252
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,600
Chris, let's eat together.

253
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
No, I don't want to.

254
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Chris, do you want to eat with me?

255
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
Well, alright.

256
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,920
Do you want some orange juice? I squeezed it myself.

257
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,440
Want one?

258
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,080
Chris, make sure to say thank you to her.

259
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,240
Thank you.

260
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,080
Aunt Orn made it especially for you because it's your favorite, right? Take a sip.

261
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:10,480
How is it? Is it tasty? This is your favorite, freshly squeezed orange juice. Here, try these pandan cookies too. They're also your favorite.

262
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,960
Aunt Orr knows you well, right? She made only your favorite things.

263
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
If you like it, I can make more.

264
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,320
Eat a lot.

265
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,920
Does it taste good?

266
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,360
Eat the bear one, too.

267
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,600
It's yummy.

268
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,960
Be on your best behavior, Aunt Orn might spoil you with lots of snacks later.

269
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,600
Tar seems to like it. You can eat a lot.

270
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,400
You know, in the future, we'll love each other a lot.

271
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,000
Will we love each other that much?

272
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,520
Our love will grow stronger.

273
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:10,640
You're ready to do whatever it takes for me to chase my dream of becoming an actor.

274
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,000
You're cool with giving up everything, even if it means you'll go through some tough times.

275
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,520
Really? I'd do that much for you?

276
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:33,920
But you don't know that I suffer too, just like you do.

277
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:43,800
Even if I become the actor of my dreams, it won't mean anything without you by my side.

278
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,200
But I want you by my side, just as much as you do.

279
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,800
I'll go see Dad tomorrow. I'll be back in the evening after I visit him.

280
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,640
Okay, sure.

281
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,960
Hurry there, but please hurry back. I miss you.

282
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,160
I know. You're quite possessive, aren't you?

283
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,640
Feel free to order whatever you like to eat, my treat.

284
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,960
I know you two wanna eat together, just the two of you.

285
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,960
Next time, no need to invite us.

286
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
It's because he's sick, though.

287
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,280
Alright

288
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
Or do you want to pay?

289
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I'm kidding, my friend.

290
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,240
Feed me, I'm hungry.

291
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,480
Let's order.

292
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,120
I'll have crispy pork stir-fried with salt and chili.

293
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,200
I'll have American fried rice with fried egg on top and two sausages.

294
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Sounds yummy.

295
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,560
But I think this place serves the best fish soup with rice. I guarantee it's delicious.

296
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,320
We'll have three fish soup with rice.

297
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Why even bother asking?

298
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Why did you even make me think about what I want to eat?

299
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,720
Well, it's my treat. Do you want to eat or not?

300
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,160
Oh, you're the host. If it's not delicious, you're in trouble. I'm starving here.

301
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,760
Hello

302
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,720
Hello, Chris. You are here.

303
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Aunt Orn, I brought Chris here.

304
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,640
Thank you so much, Pang

305
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,760
How is my father?

306
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,360
This morning, the doctor came to check, and the condition has improved significantly.

307
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,000
However, the doctor still advises against too much movement as there may still be soreness in some areas.

308
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,880
I felt lost when my father faced this situation.

309
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,600
When I first heard the news, I was so shocked that I immediately called Aunt Orn. However, I must thank you for being the first person to call.

310
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
It's okay.

311
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
How about my father?

312
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:54,880
Your father is getting better now. He's been asleep for quite a while, but when he woke up, you were the first person he asked about.

313
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,880
Your father must be missing you a lot. He keeps asking about you all the time.

314
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,640
Yeah! Chris is here.

315
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,160
Miss you so much. Wow, it's been so long. you've grown up a lot.

316
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,880
Where have you been? I've been missing you.

317
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,920
You've even learned how to sweet-talk now.

318
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,880
Please don't disappear like that again.

319
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,560
I miss you. Can you drop me off at school?

320
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,040
If I'm free, I'll go to drop you off at school every day.

321
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,080
Really? Yeah! Chris will drop me off at school.

322
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:56,560
Why are you upset? I drop you off at school everyday. Come down, Chris might feel heavy.

323
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,320
Chris, how are you?

324
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
What about you, dad?

325
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:14,000
Me? This time, it's a little bit serious.  The doctor advised me to stay here for a few nights.

326
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,720
What about you?

327
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,760
The doctor said I can go home after resting for a while.

328
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,200
We shouldn't have acted so recklessly.

329
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:47,400
By the way, Pang, you're amazing. Where did you find Chris, my son? And how did you manage to bring him here?

330
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:56,720
Yeah, these two have been together for quite some time. It's about time they tied the knot and started giving us grandchildren.

331
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,960
Even though they haven't been together for long, they've still managed to find each other.

332
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,080
I agree with you. Chris and Pang,

333
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,280
I can see that both of you have known each other for a long time.

334
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,040
Back in the old days, those two were really close and inseparable.

335
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:28,680
We all hope you settle down soon. Don't make me wait too long, because who knows how much longer I'll be here.

336
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,880
We keep talking about them. I say they should just get married already.

337
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Both Chris and Pang have known each other since they were kids. I want them to get married soon so I can carry my grandchild.

338
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,720
Calm down

339
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,640
Why?

340
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:57,480
You don't need to hurry, especially since you're the bride's father. Besides, my son Chris is already your son-in-law.

341
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,800
If we keep procrastinating, I might end up without a son-in-law after all.

342
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,840
What do you think, Chris?

343
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Dad

344
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
Hello

345
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,520
I have something to discuss with you at the right moment. I think I'm going to request time off from work.

346
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,000
Now people are copying data from flash drives.

347
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,640
and hacking systems in our organization's network.

348
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,080
Now it has taken some of the information.

349
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,800
What did you say?

350
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,360
But don't worry. that the system protects in time or the information will definitely leak.

351
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,760
You're going to have to find the person who did this.

352
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,920
and take the information they obtained and destroy everything as quickly as possible.

353
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,160
Including the people who do it and everyone who
Know this information too, it must not survive.

354
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,320
I hope you don't make any mistakes. I'm keeping an eye on you.

355
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,040
Tar

356
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:34,400
Is it you, Chris? Why are you back so early? Oh, you must have missed me, right?

357
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,280
Who misses whom?

358
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,600
Oh, it's you, Bew.

359
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,840
It's me. Who are you expecting to see?

360
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:03,080
No, I'm not expecting to see anyone. Why are you here, though?

361
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,040
About that flash drive you asked me to find the data.

362
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,280
Oh, at this point, I probably wouldn't care about it anymore.

363
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:27,240
You take this, check out the information inside, it's pretty interesting.

364
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,320
Is that so?
