1
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,840
I thought he'd remember us dating, but turns out, he just remembered our childhood days.

2
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,520
What are you complaining about?

3
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm not complaining.

4
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,200
Do you actually remember us as kids?

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,000
Um, yes.

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,720
Guys, do you want some snacks?

7
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Why do you have so many snacks?

8
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,320
My parents took me to play a game there, so I ended up with a bunch of snacks.

9
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
Thanks for sharing them with us.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Actually, they're my brother's too.

11
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,520
But where is your brother?

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,120
My brother is lost with our parents. We're currently looking for them.

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,560
Come one, let's eat.

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find him.

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,240
Hey, relax. Everything's going to be fine. Just take a deep breath.

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,360
Let's take a look that way.

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Welcome to Children's Day 2006! Does anyone happen to know the Children's Day motto for this year?

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,960
Hello

19
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,560
Hey, what happened? Why are you crying?

20
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm lost from my parents.

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,240
It's okay. I'll help you find you parents.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,400
Will you?

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes, I will. My name is Ta.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,240
Thanks a lot. I'm Chris.

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,520
Come on, let's get up and find your parents.

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Okay

27
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Mom!

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Chris!

29
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,800
Where were you, sweetheart? I've been searching for you for hours.

30
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,800
Are you okay, son?

31
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,640
I was really worried. Are you hurt?

32
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,160
No

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,560
Are you hungry?

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,720
Let's head home and grab something to eat.

35
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,000
Come on, Chris.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Let's go, baby.

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,920
We were very young.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,240
But thank you anyway.

39
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,800
Welcome

40
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,320
When did you realise it was me?

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,200
Yes, I'll head there right away.

42
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,560
Where are you going?

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
I'll be back. Just stepping out for a moment.

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,280
Let me go with you.

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,160
Just stay here.

46
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,880
It's my personal business.

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
I won't involve in your business.

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm about to go to the front of the alley. Can I tag along? Please

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,200
Didn't you hear what I said? I won't let you go with me.

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,240
If you want to go to the front of the alley, just take a taxi.

51
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,480
What? It's just the front of the alley.

52
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,920
Hey, follow them.

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,600
Sure

54
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,080
You're late.

55
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Who told you to ask to meet me this early in the morning?

56
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,640
Early in the morning? Look, it's already 10:30.

57
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,280
So, what's up?

58
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,320
What did you find out about what I asked you to keep an eye on?

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,400
Next time, just shoot me a text if this is all you wanted me to come out for.

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,040
So, you're not interested in the money?

61
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,760
No, I'm interested.

62
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Then tell me what you got.

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,080
What took you so long?

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,600
Well..

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,400
Did you bring it here?

66
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,520
Before I give it to you, tell me the password first.

67
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,320
Hey!

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Please stop here.

69
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
There you go.

70
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,840
We've been working for quite a while.

71
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,760
Just give it to me, no need to make things difficult.

72
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,120
I said, tell me the password first.

73
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600
I think he's asking for trouble.

74
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
What is Chris doing here?

75
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,760
What the hell?

76
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,440
What should I do?

77
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
Do you really want to get in trouble that badly?

78
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,640
Then let me leave a scar on your face.

79
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,320
Come help.

80
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you think you're cool?

81
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,240
Chris!

82
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
Take a seat.

83
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,840
Ouch!

84
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,040
Be gentle.

85
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,800
Come here, let me take a look at the wound.

86
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,320
It hurts. Be more gentle.

87
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,880
The wound isn't that deep. Why do you have to be so loud?

88
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,280
You're hurt because you're being stubborn.

89
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Just dressing a wound shouldn't make you complain.

90
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,920
See? I told you to stay in the room. Why did you follow me?

91
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,160
I notice you're always going around by yourself.

92
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,520
Since you didn't tell me where you were going, I decided to follow.

93
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,240
Why did you have to butt in instead of staying put?

94
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,960
I should have let you getting punched.

95
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
What did you say?

96
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,080
I care about you.

97
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,520
If I were the one being beaten up,

98
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,240
would you help me?

99
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,880
I might let you get beaten up because you're so stubborn.

100
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,200
Are you helping me with the wound or causing another one?

101
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Can't you just be nice?

102
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,120
ok

103
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,440
Next time, if this happens again, you don't have to help me.

104
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,080
I don't want you to get hurt like this again.

105
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,800
I don't want to see you pretending to be weak.

106
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,040
Roger that, boss.

107
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,280
Oh, so you can joke? Want another wound?

108
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,280
If it were you, no matter how many more wounds there would be, I wouldn't be afraid.

109
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Aha? So you want another wound now?

110
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,520
No, I have enough wounds. It really hurts.

111
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,360
Be gentle.

112
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,280
Yes, Piak. I'm not feeling very well, so I'd like to take a sick leave.

113
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Thank you

114
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Was it Piak?

115
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,600
Yeah

116
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,240
I don't have to work today, so I can take care of you.

117
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,680
If it's not me, who will come to take care of you?

118
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Why don't we go our separate ways to grab something to eat?

119
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,760
If you want to eat something, go ahead and eat it. Why do you have to follow me?

120
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I want to eat street food. Plus, this place looks great.

121
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,600
You're such a pain in the ass.

122
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,080
Why? Can't I eat with you? We live in the same room, anyway.

123
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,080
I think we should be friends.

124
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,960
No way

125
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,920
I'll see just how stubborn you can be if I insist.

126
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,680
This one's yours, Park. And this one's your friend's.

127
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,320
No, he's not my friend. He's just someone I know.

128
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,200
Someone I don't really want to get acquainted with.

129
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
But we live in the same room.

130
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,520
Then the two of you must be friends.

131
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,560
If not, then you must be boyfriends.

132
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,560
Boyfriends? Look at my handsome face, do you really think someone like me would date him?

133
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,720
But he looks handsome and kind.

134
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,720
Thank you. You have a good eye.

135
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,640
You can tip.

136
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,120
Sure, I'll tip you.

137
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
Thank you.

138
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
There you go.

139
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,480
She's got a good eye.

140
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,680
Hello, Piak. What? Me and who?

141
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,560
I lost my appetite now.

142
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,080
Just eat, or else you'll lack the energy to work.

143
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,840
Why is there so little data? You said you know everything.

144
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I told you everything I know.

145
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,360
Where is Bew now?

146
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,440
How am I supposed to know?

147
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:16,040
Hey, I've been answering your questions since half past ten, and it's already 5pm now. Can't you let me go back and rest?

148
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm not getting enough information. Do you still want money?

149
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,040
If you don't want to pay then don't pay. I'll head back now.

150
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Are you going to leave me hanging?

151
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,680
Who's the one leaving who hanging?

152
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,760
Let's make it fair. You've already asked me a lot of questions. Let me ask you questions in exchange.

153
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,000
Who are you? Why do you want to know about our bar?

154
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you know Bew? Or are you spying for a rival?

155
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,120
No, I have good intentions.

156
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,840
Do you want to know where Bew is, huh? Well, tonight he's got a job outside. You can follow him if you want.

157
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,040
I'm not available tonight. I have some business with my mother.

158
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,760
Can you give me his address?

159
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,280
Sent

160
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,040
Why does Chris have to be sick today?

161
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Now, the disaster has shifted its focus to me.

162
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,800
Instead of being accompanied by another professional, I have to bring along a newbie like you.

163
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,080
Piak wants me to do it, so I should. Why do you have to complain?

164
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,960
Didn't you say you're a professional?

165
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,840
I am professional

166
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,960
But i get confuse with Peak why did she allow you to take care
of VVIP guests

167
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,040
because it is the power of money

168
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Could you say that again?

169
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,840
She probably wants me to pay off my debt quickly, so she gave me this job.

170
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,320
That makes sense. Anyway, today you have to listen to me.

171
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,560
Just take good care of the customer.

172
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,760
And I'll take care of the rest.

173
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,920
You have to follow every instruction I give, understood?

174
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,920
I understand, mentor.

175
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Good. Now, follow me. The customer is waiting.

176
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,960
Girls, I'm bringing the top-tier hosts to you.

177
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,920
Let me introduce them. This is Bew. Bew, please sit over there.

178
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,280
Hello

179
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,920
And this one is Park. He's mine.

180
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,840
Thank you

181
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,880
Please have a seat.

182
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,680
Okay

183
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,080
You've already taken care of us, let me bring you the drink.

184
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
Alright

185
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
Here's your drink.

186
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,960
One shot!

187
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,400
Do you know?

188
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,760
Do you know why I'm so insecure that I often need to consult a surgeon?

189
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:34,800
Hey, you're the prettiest and cutest in my eyes.

190
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,560
You’re such a sweet talker

191
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,280
If you're not feeling well and need someone to talk to, I'm here to listen.

192
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,960
My job is to make you happy.

193
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,040
When I see you coming with a sad face, it makes me feel sad too.

194
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,480
And most importantly, I'm very good at keeping secrets.

195
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,840
Thanks a lot.

196
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:26,920
I'm sad that my husband doesn't understand or care about me.

197
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,400
He always works. He's a workaholic.

198
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,880
I tried to change myself, thinking it would get his attention.

199
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,320
But he's working for you and your family.

200
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,280
That's true but I'm still lonely.

201
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,960
Ning, you already have me. Do you still feel lonely?

202
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,040
I'll help you relieve your loneliness, okay?

203
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,480
Thanks

204
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,680
Are you okay?

205
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,320
I can stay all night.

206
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I don't think you're okay.

207
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,000
Dance with me.

208
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,600
Sure, come one. Get up.

209
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Drink! Good job.

210
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,040
No, you drink it.

211
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,160
That was amazing.

212
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,160
That boy Ning hired for us looks yummy. I'm drooling.

213
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,000
I'll get him tonight.

214
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Don't worry, I have a secret.

215
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,280
But I'll have him first.

216
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,320
You're always like this, but I'm totally fine.

217
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,680
Let's begin.

218
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,640
Are you having fun?

219
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,680
Yes, are you?

220
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,280
I am.

221
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
I brought you the drink.

222
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,800
Thank you

223
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,800
How is it?

224
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,560
Very good.

225
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,680
Don't you think it's hot here?

226
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,960
No

227
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,880
If it's hot, then take it off.

228
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
Take it off.

229
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Take it off.

230
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,720
Are you okay?

231
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,000
Please excuse me for a moment.

232
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,840
Take it off if it's hot.

233
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,200
Bew, stop.

234
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,600
Oh? Park, did you come to see me?

235
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,160
Why are you so drunk?

236
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
I drank quite a lot.

237
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Why are you so handsome today?

238
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,000
What did you feed him?

239
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Nothing

240
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There was nothing, really.

241
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
If it's gonna be exposed, it will be right here because of you.

242
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,480
Get up. Come here.

243
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Ning, the time is up. I have to go. See you.

244
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,200
Why is it so hot, Park?

245
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,120
Be careful. Your left foot, left foot. Yes, like that.

246
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,520
Slow down

247
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,120
Walk properly. Come here.

248
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,560
You're hot.

249
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,200
What's wrong with you? Come up here.

250
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
What?

251
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,200
There's a lift.

252
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,280
Lift?

253
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,680
Why did you make me walk the stairs?

254
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,800
In case you vomit.

255
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,480
It's so hot, and you made me climb the stairs.

256
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,440
We're almost there. Stop complaining.

257
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,440
What is it now?

258
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,520
You look handsome today.

259
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,160
Can you stop joking, Bew?

260
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,080
What? I'm just having fun.

261
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
Come on

262
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,000
It's fun.

263
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,440
It's not.

264
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,920
Can I walk on my own now?

265
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,200
Why did you drink that much?

266
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:35,400
You told me to take care of the customers and do as they please.

267
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,680
What's gotten into you?

268
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,440
I did what you told me to do.

269
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,240
That's right.

270
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,040
But it doesn't mean you should just drink whatever they give you like this.

271
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
You sucker

272
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,560
Sucker?

273
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,120
Yeah

274
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,240
Sucker?

275
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,120
Yeah

276
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Hold on, Bew.

277
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,520
You said I suck, right?

278
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Bew

279
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,920
Bew

280
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,760
Bew!

281
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,360
Bew, what are you doing?

282
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,880
I like you. I really do.

283
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,400
What should we do today?

284
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
What did you say?

285
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
What should we do today?

286
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,520
I don't know. Um, so your..

287
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,880
Happy Children's Day, Tar. Be kind and happy.

288
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,440
Thank you for taking Chris back. Open it and see if you like it.

289
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,000
I will get going now.Take good care of it.

290
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,080
Can I have a look?

291
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,680
Do you know why time has to move forward?

292
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,720
If it moves backward, then it's broken.

293
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm serious. Do you know why?

294
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
I don't know. Do you?

295
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,760
It moves forward because our lives have a beginning and an end.

296
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:43,920
So it moves forward to take our lives past the past and present and into the future. My dad told me so.

297
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
Okay. I think I understand but I don't.

298
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:55,640
If you want to do something, do it now because time waits for no one.

299
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
Okay, I get it now.

300
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,320
Try it on.

301
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Do you think it suits me?

302
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,800
It suits you.

303
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,040
It looks good.

304
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
I agree.

305
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,360
It looks cool.

306
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,600
Yes, I look cool.

307
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,960
You complimented yourself.

308
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,160
Oh, you're awake. Do you want to eat right away? I brought some congee.

309
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,360
What? Why is he being nice?

310
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,000
How's your wound?

311
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,200
It's getting better. It doesn't hurt much now.

312
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Did you take the pills I gave you?

313
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,280
I took it last night but not yet this morning.

314
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,760
I'm waiting to eat together with you.

315
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Why are you smiling?

316
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,400
Can't I smile?

317
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Weird

318
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,400
What's weird? I'm acting normal.

319
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,680
Yes, very normal.

320
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Eat. What are you waiting for?

321
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,320
Or does your arm hurt? Do you want me to feed you?

322
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,480
No, you don't have to. It doesn't hurt that much.

323
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,640
Ouch!

324
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,560
What's wrong? Does your arm hurt?

325
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,960
Just kidding

326
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,760
Park did the VVIP job instead of me last night. I'm curious about him because he went with Bew, the newbie.

327
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,480
With Bew?

328
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,240
Yes

329
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,200
I don't know what Piak is thinking. It's VVIP.

330
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,600
Does this mean I am also allowed in the VIP zone?

331
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,240
In your dreams.

332
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,320
Why do you want to treat the VIPs that much?

333
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:10,880
It makes a lot of money. You like it too. It's nothing strange.

334
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,640
It has pros and cons. But you're not ready yet.

335
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm ready.

336
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
Just eat.

337
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,320
Eat. Or do you want me to feed you?

338
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,360
No

339
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,840
Park! Did you wake up? Park?

340
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,920
Park

341
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,600
What are you doing up so early in the morning?

342
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,160
Look at you.

343
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,760
If you sleep like this, what condition will Bew sleep in?

344
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,280
Bew? He didn't sleep here last night.

345
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,640
By the way, what are you guys doing here so early?

346
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,080
Early? Look, the sun is almost set.

347
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,800
Already?

348
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Were the customers playing you too hard?

349
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,720
Yes, I'm still tired.

350
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,360
Get dressed quickly and let's meet at the bar.

351
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,640
Bew didn't sleep here?

352
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,440
No, he didn't.

353
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,440
Please leave

354
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Alright

355
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,240
These two are weird.

356
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,680
Here's your Kraphrao rice.

357
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
Thank you.

358
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,240
Do you think Park is acting weird today?

359
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,480
No, he's normal.

360
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
How do you know?

361
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,160
He doesn't normally act so suspicious.

362
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,600
I know.

363
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,840
Where do you think Bew goes?

364
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,640
I think I saw him inside.

365
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:25,040
Why do you have to care about others? You can't even manage your own problem right now.

366
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,840
My own problem? What problem?

367
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,200
There are a lot.

368
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,120
Let's eat. Piak will complain if we're late.

369
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Alright.
