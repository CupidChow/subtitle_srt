1
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Where the hell is Park?

2
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,720
I was going to ask him to help me carry things.

3
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,160
Why are you complaining?

4
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,440
When I'm the one carrying them.

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,200
That's because you are the one who bought them.

6
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,480
You never changed a bit.

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,880
What do you mean?

8
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,880
I was talking about what you use.

9
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
You never change what you use,

10
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,360
always sticking to the same brand.

11
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,520
How do you know what I like?

12
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,480
I helped you clean up yesterday.

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,600
I can remember which one you use.

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,880
That's why I bought the right one.

15
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,520
You're quite nosy.

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,640
Hurry up and pack your stuff so we can go to work together.

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,520
What's with you.

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,560
Helping doesn't help, and you're still complaining.

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
Or will you go by yourself?

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll go with you. I'll pack my stuff now.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,480
Hi ladies, Are you ready?

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Hello, Piak.

23
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm ready. If a customer comes and orders, I'll take care of it right away.

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
Excellent, number one!

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,040
But I'm not ready yet. Yesterday's bills are a mess, and I still can't figure them out.

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,240
So, will the shop be able to open today? Hurry up.

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,960
You called me here, is there anything urgent?

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
Now there's nothing.

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,200
What? I hurried all the way here.

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Hurry? Please think about what time I called you and what time you arrived.

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,640
And who did you bring here?

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,640
Good evening.

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Good evening.

34
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,080
This is the person who came and destroyed our bar last night.

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,880
He said he'd like to speak to you.

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,120
Well, I would like to come and compensate for the damage caused last night.

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,800
Your mother has already taken care of that matter.

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,720
My mum?

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,040
because your mother..

40
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,960
We should go talk over there.

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,440
Please

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Enough, enough

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,960
Has my mother paid for all the damages?

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,200
Yes, is anything up?

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,160
There's nothing. I just intend to come and compensate for the damages.

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
I was the one who caused the damage.

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
It's okay.

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,440
Just don't cause trouble here again.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
Piak

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
What else?

52
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,520
Can I also work at this bar?

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,680
What do you mean?

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,760
I want to work here. It looks fun. I don't take any pay at all.

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,040
I'm serious about it. You can have it all.

56
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,240
Just please don't tell my mom.

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,440
Please

58
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,600
Please, I excel at taking care, and I know how to coddle.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Alright, then.

60
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,760
Thank you so much.

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,680
Guys! I have something to say.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
Please be prompt when I call.

63
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,680
Bew is going to start working as a host from today onwards.

64
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,480
What? Are you serious?

65
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,000
He just destroyed our bar last night.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,840
We humans make mistakes, right?

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
Right

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,160
You also have to train him.

69
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Why me? Let Chris do it.

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,480
I'll let you do it, Park. Chris is already very busy.

71
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,400
Bew, regarding accommodation, you can share a room with Park. Only one room is available.

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
You can stay with him, right?

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,960
Yes, I can. I'm pretty chill.

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
This is Chris and Ta.

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,120
Ta just started working yesterday.

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,640
After all, you work at the same place, so it's better to get to know each other.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,760
I understood.

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,400
Does everyone understand now?

79
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,560
It's almost time. Get ready, I'm going.

80
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,000
What's wrong with your face?

81
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
It's pretty wrinkled.

82
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,120
That's true.

83
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,240
Go to work, both of you.

84
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,760
Chris, look at Piak. Why did you do that to me?

85
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,200
Just like what you did to me, my friend.

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
Bew, I'm Ta. Officially introducing myself.

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,880
I hope to learn from you.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, I'm also a newbie.

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,080
You're pretty cool, actually. Destroying the bar from the first day.

90
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,000
Is that a compliment?

91
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
It is.

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
I'll take it then.

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,960
It's almost time. Let's get changed.

94
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,800
Okay, I'll follow you.

95
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,760
By the way, what's it like working here?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,120
I don't know yet, I just started working here two days ago.

97
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,080
Until when do you have to work to pay off your debt?

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,720
Until the bar's damages are fully compensated.

99
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,360
So I guess you'll have to work here for a while.

100
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,640
I know, right?

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
But if it's fun, I'll continue to work here.

102
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,880
What?

103
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:57,880
Nothing. Who are you staying with? I heard that one room could accommodate two people.

104
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,520
I stay with Chris.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,320
Chris?

106
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
How is it?

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
He looks weird and mysterious to me.

108
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,680
Also, he's quite hard to reach. It's as if he keeps everyone's secrets to himself.

109
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,440
You think so? I don't find him that difficult.

110
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,080
You're the one who has to watch out for yourself.

111
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,200
A person like him has a smart mouth but a bad temper.

112
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,600
Be cautious, or you might find yourself beneath his feet.

113
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Well

114
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm not afraid.

115
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,480
I like it.

116
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,120
You're even weirder than Chris.

117
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,080
Why? I'm having fun.

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,880
What are you guys talking about?

119
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Why do I get the feeling that I'm the star of the show here?

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,160
We're talking about no one.

121
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
It's just us, the newbies, having a chat.

122
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
So that if there's any problem, we'll help each other sort it out.

123
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Whoa

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Before you help someone else, make sure you don't cause any trouble. Especially you, newbie.

125
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,360
I've got something to discuss with you, come with me.

126
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Where are you going?

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,840
What's making you smile? Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

128
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Of course, I should. I should.

129
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,160
What are you doing?

130
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,840
You startled me.

131
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,160
What if I have a heart attack?

132
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,320
I'll call the ambulance.

133
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,560
You're annoying.

134
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,160
Hey! Is that how you talk to an adult?

135
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,520
An adult is bothering me first.

136
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,440
You're a quite interesting kid. What are you doing here, if I may ask?

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,280
You seem underage. We don't allow kids here.

138
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Well, I'm not a kid.

139
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,320
What are you doing here?

140
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
Do you work here?

141
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
Then, please take me inside. Please, I'm begging.

142
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
I can't. You're still underage.

143
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
Then, I'll be your sugar baby.

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,960
What?

145
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,480
Please

146
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,920
I can't. There's a rule.

147
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,320
I won't go inside, but you can be my eyes and ears.

148
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,640
So, what's in it for me?

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
I've got money.

150
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Interesting

151
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,680
Let me have your contact information.

152
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,520
What kind of information do you want?

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
I'll text you about that.

155
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,400
Okay, I'm going to work now.

156
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Go ahead. Have fun at work.

157
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,520
What's with him?

158
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,840
Ignore them.

159
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,040
Why? Are you not on good terms with them?

160
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,600
They're generally not very friendly with new people or those who stand out.

161
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,440
You'll know one day.

162
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,720
What's up, mentor?

163
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
Seems like the new kid has decided to stick to you.

164
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,440
You look good together, though.

165
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Or are you guys..

166
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,600
I kinda ship you two.

167
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,080
Ship?

168
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Have you heard that there's another new kid? Who is it?

169
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
News travels fast, huh?

170
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,960
I heard the girls talking about it.

171
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,880
He's over there with Park.

172
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,360
Where is he? I want to see his face.

173
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,440
Are you sure you want to only see his face?

174
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
Follow me and you'll know.

175
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,400
Today, I won't be on the first floor. I'll be taking care of VIPs upstairs.

176
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,520
But it's my first day of hosting.

177
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,840
You can observe the other hosts, or if you have any questions, feel free to ask Park.

178
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Are you scheduled to take care of VIPs for the entire night?

179
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes, typically, I'll be taking care of VIPs until they leave.

180
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,200
Can't I be with you? I don't take the money.

181
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,800
No, there are standards for customer care here.

182
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,760
Plus, you're still a newbie. You can't handle VIPs just yet.

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,600
How long do I have to work until I can take care of VIPs?

184
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:09,560
At least three months, or until Piak gives you the green light.

185
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,640
Are you giving me a dissatisfied look or are you looking for trouble?

186
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,720
No

187
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
Hurry up.

188
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,920
Do you want it? Follow me.

189
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,200
How do I go out?

190
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,920
It's our welcoming ceremony, grab your towel quickly.

191
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,640
Hello

192
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,280
Let's drink. Where's your glass?

193
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,800
This table is the only source of fun.

194
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,560
Do you think those two newbies will last long?

195
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,680
Yes, I think so. They seem fine, and customers will likely enjoy their company.

196
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Let's make it interesting. I think they'll last, if not, I'll give you 1,000 baht.

197
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't think they'll last.

198
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,880
What are you guys gossiping about? Seems like you're not into working here anymore.

199
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Piak, do you think those two newbies will be okay?

200
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,440
I'm sure they are, Chris and Park are the ones showing them the ropes.

201
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,440
I'm afraid they won't be okay because those two are training them.

202
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,280
No one stays after training. They always stick to each other.

203
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,200
There are still possibilities. There's a lot to gossip about in the future.

204
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,480
Mark my words, these two are gonna stick around for a while. I'd bet on it.

205
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,640
We've got a 1,000-baht bet on it already.

206
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,200
Yes

207
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,200
I'kk make them our new stars.

208
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,040
How was it? You were quite hot for your first day.

209
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
You can take your time to learn, and you'll get better.

210
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,760
We were nervous, just like you, when we started working as bartenders.

211
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,080
I picked up this and that all wrong. My hands got tangled.

212
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
Really? Were you that nervous?

213
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
Really

214
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,800
Your job is way easier. Just taking care of the customers.

215
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,440
That's true.

216
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,280
Taking care of people is my strong suit.

217
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,920
What is the VIP zone like?

218
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,560
It's quite different from here.

219
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,320
There are only rich and powerful people.

220
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:01,120
Why do you ask? Or do you want to go there? It's not easy, I'd say but it will make you a lot of money.

221
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,160
You have to make Piak trust you first.

222
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
What if I sneak up there?

223
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,440
Don't even think about it. Some people here either get fired or just disappear.

224
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:25,520
I heard VIPs' secrets are top-secret. If any of it gets leaked, you won't survive.

225
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,800
This is interesting. VIPs?

226
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,560
Hey, what's the group chat about? Avoiding work, huh?

227
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,960
Ta, Piak wants to see you.

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,080
And you, follow me. The customer is waiting.

229
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Copy that, my senior.

230
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Good evening Ms. Tina.

231
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,920
Good evening.

232
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,520
This is Ta. Ta, take a seat.

233
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,440
Piak asks me to introduce our new host to you.

234
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,600
Can a new host take good care of me?

235
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,880
Piak wants to tell you that we guarantees you won't be disappointed.

236
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,960
Ms. Tina, if you choose Ta,

237
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:34,960
you'll be the first one to get, oops, to have him as a host.

238
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,920
Alright, I'll choose him.

239
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,800
You're handsome. I thought you're a celebrity.

240
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,960
We're very welcome.

241
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,800
Do your best. Ms. Tina is a well-known figure in high society who spends generously.

242
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,480
If the service is good, you might receive multiple drinks.

243
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,960
I'll take my leave now. Let Ta take care of you.

244
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,240
Once again, a warm welcome, Ms. Tina.

245
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,480
Hello

246
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,120
I'm Ta.

247
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,280
Hm, how old are you?

248
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm twenty.

249
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,320
You're still young

250
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,680
How long have you been working here?

251
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,640
I just started today.

252
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,280
Let's have a drink.

253
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,120
Sure

254
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,320
Do you come here often?

255
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,800
Um, yes.

256
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,080
But I've never met anyone young like you.

257
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,200
Do you like young boys?

258
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,840
Yes, if they please me.

259
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,640
Let's continue drinking, Ms. Tina.

260
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,640
Alright

261
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,880
Cheers

262
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
How is it?

263
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Very sweet.

264
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,800
Are you a good drinker?

265
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,120
Yes, of course.

266
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
If you're interested, you can join me for drinks all night.

267
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,920
I'm in. Please stay with me all night.

268
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,120
Sure

269
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,000
Please look after me.

270
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,520
I've got you covered. If you need anything, just let me know.

271
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,600
How about another drink?

272
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,400
Good

273
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,960
Bottoms up

274
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,600
Alright

275
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
You're quite good at drinking.

276
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,680
How can I stop if a young boy comes and pleases me?

277
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,080
It's fun here.

278
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,360
Of course

279
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,240
You don't have to be worried if you're by my side.

280
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,200
Nice, please stay by my side tonight.

281
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,360
I will.

282
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,240
Excuse me.

283
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Good evening.

284
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,360
You look gorgeous today.

285
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,280
What about the other days?

286
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,120
You look gorgeous every day, but you're extraordinarily gorgeous today.

287
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,120
You look prettier than any other day we've met.

288
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,320
Really?

289
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,160
Really

290
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,360
You know, there's never been a customer as beautiful as you before.

291
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,680
I want to define my jaw and do some more work on my eyes. It's going to look even more beautiful than it does now.

292
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,160
You don't have to do anything. You're very beautiful to me.

293
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,040
You think so? But I think...

294
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:14,480
You don't have to overthink it. But if you're serious about getting plastic surgery, I know some really good hospitals.

295
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,520
I'll try to get you a special discount since you're a special person.

296
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,160
Will you?

297
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,640
Of course

298
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,200
You're the sweetest.

299
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,880
Here's a tip for your hard work.

300
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,360
Thank you so much.

301
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,160
Let's empty our glasses.

302
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,880
Alright

303
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,680
What did I do wrong? Why did he leave me?

304
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,920
It's okay. At least you still have me.

305
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Am I not good enough? Why does he have to cheat on me?

306
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,920
Just let him go.

307
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,120
If he can't make you happy, you don't have to worry about it.

308
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,400
But it hurts.

309
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,320
But you've got me here, right?

310
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,240
Let's have some fun together. How about a drink?

311
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,160
You'll feel better.

312
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,120
Aw, it's okay.

313
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,640
Come and have some fun today. I'll make sure you're happy, what do you think?

314
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:11,480
Don't be sad. Try smiling like me for a bit.

315
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,000
Please drink a little bit more, Ms. Tina.

316
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,160
Oops!

317
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,560
Ta, you've got booze all over you.

318
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,840
Do you feel cold?

319
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,840
Yes, I do. I'd like to go change my shirt first.

320
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,840
You can change here.

321
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,640
Are you sure?

322
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,760
Yes, I am.

323
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,200
That's Boo and Ms. Pareenawee.

324
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,040
Do they know each other?

325
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
Hello, uncle.

326
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,640
Hi

327
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
I'm here to meet auntie Pareenawee.

328
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,760
I saw that she's out on business. She won't be back until the evening. Let me know if you have anything to pass on.

329
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,480
I'm learning about characters and acting.

330
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,240
have to pay monthly, or else I won't be able to watch it.

331
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,840
I can pay for you.

332
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,040
But you have to be good at school.

333
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,240
Okay, I won't let my series addiction affect my life, definitely.

334
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,920
Done

335
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,760
Thank you, I love you the most.

336
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
Pareenawee

337
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,480
Doesn't pick up the phone.

338
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,040
She'll probably call back.

339
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,000
I heard you're quite busy lately.

340
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,160
I was pretty busy. After all, new stars are born every day

341
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,440
They need comprehensive training in acting.

342
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
Otherwise, the drama organisers may not find them appealing

343
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,000
You're the number one stars maker.

344
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:54,600
I'm interested in the entertainment industry. If I set aside a sum of money for investment, what are your thoughts?

345
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,760
Great! The entertainment industry is thriving at the moment.

346
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,560
Invest now, and I guarantee that I'll go the extra mile to promote your company to its fullest potential with your customers

347
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,200
Right?

348
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,800
As for the eldest son, he's diligently studying to become a doctor.

349
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,800
So, I want to encourage him to venture into the entertainment industry, as a way to relax and pursue a hobby.

350
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:30,360
Oh, sure. Don't worry about that. If there's a role, I'll get him involved right away.

351
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,560
I'll make him a superstar from the first role.

352
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,320
Amazing. You're so sweet.

353
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,080
Come one.

354
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,080
Let's celebrate for a star maker.

355
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,520
Here's my eldest son, Thientot.

356
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,720
Son, this is Boo, a manager of many actors.

357
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,160
Like who?

358
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,480
Hello, Dr. Thien.

359
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,680
It's Thientot.

360
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,880
Come one, let's drink.

361
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,760
He's handsome, right?

362
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,080
Son, what do you want to drink?

363
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,000
Excuse me, I'll have.. err

364
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,960
Ferris wheel

365
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,520
I'll have a glass of Ferris wheel.

366
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,920
Boo and Ms. Pareenawee are acquainted and plan to invest together.

367
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:05,480
And they agreed to make Thientot an actor. But why are their future selves not on good terms?

368
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
Come here!

369
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
It hurts.

370
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I told you not to go upstairs.

371
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,800
I'm sorry.

372
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,960
You're sorry?

373
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,400
I made a mistake, so I need to apologise.

374
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:55,080
Didn't I tell you from the beginning not to go up? It's not just you who stands to lose your job.

375
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,400
Everyone in that room will lose their jobs including me because of you.

376
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,720
Why do you have to be that serious?

377
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,040
Why? You're so selfish.

378
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,040
Look at what you've done.

379
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:24,560
What if the customer finds out that an unauthorised person went up? What happens with the leaked information?

380
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,160
The VIP zone and possibly this bar will be closed.

381
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,640
I'm afraid the unlucky one will be me, as I am your mentor.

382
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,320
All the effort I've put in will be destroyed.

383
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,520
They're scarier than you think.

384
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,240
Do you believe you can just take a stroll and enter any room?

385
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,640
Did you have fun?

386
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,160
Are those VIPs really that intimidating? Do you have to be this concerned?"

387
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,400
You only care about yourself, too.

388
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,840
You don't understand anything. All you care about is losing your job, everyone being in trouble, and the bar being closed.

389
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,360
Do you ever care about me?

390
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:48,080
Do you know why I have to be here right now and go to the VIP zone?

391
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm here to fix what's wrong—what you've done and what I've been through.

392
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,600
You know nothing.

393
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:28,800
Loneliness, boredom, sadness, emptiness.

394
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I have to face them all by myself.

395
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,400
But you don't know a single thing. Have you ever understood me?

396
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,360
Let me ask you something, Chris.

397
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Can you remember anything?

398
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
I remember you from the first time
