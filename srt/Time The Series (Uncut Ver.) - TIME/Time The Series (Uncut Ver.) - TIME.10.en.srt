1
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,520
Or maybe it's all just a dream.

2
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Ouch, I need to use the toilet. I'll be right back.

3
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
Can I join you? I was thinking of grabbing something to shake off this drowsiness.

4
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,440
If we both go, who's gonna keep an eye out?

5
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,280
We've been keeping watch for a month now. He's probably not gonna be up today.

6
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,720
Alright then, let's go. I'm really feeling the urgency.

7
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,240
What happened?

8
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,000
The patient's gone

9
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,160
My phone!

10
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,920
Alert for interception.

11
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,000
The suspect has broken out of the hospital. All units, move in and apprehend immediately.

12
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,160
Today's just a laid-back fitness day.

13
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
Got it, Nokkaew.

14
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,840
Probably sometime next week. Anyway, let's start getting ready for it.

15
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,560
Alright

16
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Wait, someone called me.

17
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,320
Kongtub, you head to the shooting scene first.

18
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
Okay

19
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,560
Who's calling me now?

20
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,800
Hello, miss.

21
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,800
I have big news to report Foam has recovered.

22
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,560
I thought something major had happened, but it turns out Foam just woke up.

23
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
Wait? Foam woke up?

24
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you very much. If there's a press conference or anything, please let me know right away. I appreciate you keeping me informed.

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Is Ms. Pareenawee aware of this?

26
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,600
Please answer the phone. This isn't her usual behavior.

27
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Rest in peace, Boo.

28
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,360
If I'm mistaken, I'll accept the consequences.

29
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Hello, Sosie. Can you arrange me a press conference?

30
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,720
I want to be completely transparent and share the truth about everything with everyone.

31
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,640
But first, I'll head somewhere else. Catch you later.

32
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,080
Do you recall where we first met?

33
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,960
The park nearby?

34
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
Yes

35
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,680
If I can't find you, I'll wait there everyday.

36
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
I hope you got bitten by mosquitoes.

37
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,720
Now, let me bite you first.

38
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,680
If it's possible, I want to come wait for you here everyday.

39
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,680
This box

40
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,080
It's December 31st, 2018. I'm doing fine now. I've severed ties with Black Boss, just as you asked.

41
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,080
Don't worry about me. Black Boss can't harm me or anything. I'm staying with Lee, Bew's mother.

42
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,720
I miss you a lot. I hope you miss me too.

43
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,320
I miss you too.

44
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,000
Park and Bew are officially together now. I'm feeling a bit envious. It's making me miss you even more.

45
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,280
I envy them too. When will we be able to meet again?

46
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,960
Where  are you guys now. I miss you all.

47
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Damn!

48
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,200
Hello

49
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Hello, Kongtub. Could you please change your clothes first?

50
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,920
Alright

51
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,480
Your clothes are over there.

52
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,960
Place the products here. We'll insert the shot later.

53
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,400
Hello

54
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,680
Hello, have a seat.

55
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,960
Our products will have a fresh and bright tone. I noticed that you're lively and cheerful.

56
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,040
I'm aiming for a mood and tone that exudes freshness, cuteness, and promotes good skin health.

57
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Our advertisement will be unlike typical advertisements.

58
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,640
You guys are already supporting actors. I want you to embark on a promotional tour to various provinces.

59
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,600
I want you to be close.

60
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,160
Because whenever the trend picks up, we'll turn it into a series starring both of you.

61
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,800
Thank you so much.

62
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
Is that alright?

63
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,920
Yes

64
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,320
Yes

65
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Okay then, we'll take off.

66
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,800
Let's get ready for shooting now.

67
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,440
Little, can we talk for a bit?

68
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,320
Are you still upset with me?

69
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm just too afraid to ask for your forgiveness.

70
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,360
Because I know my actions hurt you deeply.

71
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,440
And why didn't you tell me the reason why?

72
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,520
I've always believed that there's a reason behind everything you do.

73
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,600
Reason?

74
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,040
The reason is that I'm selfish. I only think about myself.

75
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,480
I only think about myself. I didn't consider your feelings at all.

76
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't dare to find any excuse for you to forgive me.

77
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:56,680
Selfish? Okay, you're very selfish! Happy now?

78
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,480
What's the next step then? Usually, you're not the type to give in like this, right?

79
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,600
Throughout all this time...

80
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,880
I've been feeling guilty about this all along.

81
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,520
Because deep down, I know that being an actor is your dream.

82
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,640
But isn't studying abroad in the arts your dream?

83
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,600
How did you know?

84
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,840
I've known for a long time. I asked your maid about it.

85
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,200
But following my dreams has turned into destroying yours.

86
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Pursuing dreams isn't easy at all.

87
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:35,520
That incident made me grow up and become much stronger.

88
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,560
I may have to thank you, but you should be able to move on from those feelings now.

89
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,040
Even if you're stuck in the same old rut, dwelling on it won't lead to anything good.

90
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,920
It's time to move forward and tackle the issues head-on.

91
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm sorry.

92
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm sorry I upset you.

93
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

94
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,520
Why are you crying, loser?

95
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Can I ask for one thing?

96
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,560
Can we be friends again?

97
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,040
Can I make a reservation first?

98
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,520
Okay

99
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Okay

100
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,720
I was waiting to hear that.

101
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,240
Thank you. Thank you so much.

102
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,440
Nokkaew is calling again.

103
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Alright, no need to answer right away. Call her back later.

104
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay

105
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,600
Cut! Okay! Clearing the mic now. That was really good.

106
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,200
Let's designate this area as a bedroom.

107
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,800
You look tired today. Are you okay?

108
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,440
Could you please hold off on interruptions? I'm reading the script.

109
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,560
You can read it later. You're Thientot, it shouldn't be difficult for you.

110
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,600
I don't want to behave like this anymore.

111
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,720
Like what?

112
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Like what you're doing now. I'm seeking a serious relationship now.

113
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,360
Are you serious? With who?

114
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,920
I suppose it's not with me, is it? Or is it Korn?

115
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,160
Has the food already arrived? Why so fast?

116
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,880
Thientot?

117
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
Why didn't you call me first?

118
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,040
I usually come like this.

119
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,880
I have something to tell you today but I'll better say it inside.

120
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
Is something the matter?

121
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,560
No

122
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,240
Well, it's hot inside my room. The air conditioning is broken.

123
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,200
How is it broken? It's obvious that it's working.

124
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,440
Is there anything inside that you can't let me see?

125
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,840
No, please trust me.

126
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,560
Let's talk outside. Wait for me at the lobby, okay?

127
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Sure, let's talk outside. But before we start, mind if I take a quick peek inside?

128
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Hold on

129
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,280
See? I told you there's nothing. Please wait for me in the lobby.

130
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,040
Has the food arrived?

131
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
Mom!

132
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Why are you in Korn's room?

133
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,920
Please go outside first.

134
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,120
Don't bother. How did you even end up in this room wearing that outfit?

135
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,160
Mom replied to me, how did you end up in this room?

136
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm sorry.

137
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,960
You're sorry? For what? What are you sorry for?

138
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
It's my fault.

139
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,800
Oh, of course. It's your fault.

140
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,200
It's your fault as well.

141
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,080
But I want to know when it all began.

142
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,160
Even though I might be promiscuous and rebellious,

143
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,440
I still shouldn't have the same husband as my mom, right?

144
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,800
Don't say that.

145
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,720
Since when?

146
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm asking you, when did it start? Reply to me.

147
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,640
A long time ago.

148
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,120
It started before I joined showbiz.

149
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
Why has no one ever told me?

150
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,480
Do you all see me as stupid or something?

151
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm sorry.

152
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,400
Ms. Pareenawee, something big happened.

153
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,080
You're also aware of this?

154
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
You guys are having fun, aren't you?

155
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,040
What do you guys see me as? How could you treat me like this?

156
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:56,440
I'll remember each and every one of you for what you've done to me. You, you and also you.

157
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,720
No!

158
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,880
I'll remember.

159
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Oh my god.

160
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,800
Ms. Pareenawee, Foam is about to hold a press conference.

161
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,800
Everyone who has hurt my feelings has to go through the pain with me.

162
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,560
The press conference is about to start. Why is it still so quiet?

163
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,800
Oh my, I've invited almost every press. A hot issue like this should be quite interesting, don't you think?

164
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,400
There are only one, two... Only two of them came. What should we do?

165
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,080
Did you announce the right date?

166
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,440
Sosie, if I announced the wrong date, would there be those people coming?

167
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm really curious why there's such silence surrounding this issue. It's unusually quiet.

168
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,040
What should we do? I'm stressed.

169
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,640
The press isn't coming. Why is it so quiet?

170
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,560
There are only a few people coming.

171
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,000
What should we do?

172
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,760
There should be people coming since the press conference is about to start. What's wrong?

173
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,920
That's right, I also find it strange.

174
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,320
Or..

175
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,640
Mr. Foam, I need you to come with us.

176
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,520
What do you mean?

177
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,600
Hold on, please.

178
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,680
You evade arrest by law enforcement officers, no matter what, you must go with me.

179
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,040
Take him.

180
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,720
I request that we conclude the press conference first.

181
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,680
If the media finds out that I didn't attend the press conference because of the police, it wouldn't be good.

182
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:49,360
Once it's finished, I will consent to surrendering myself to you and allowing you to take me into the legal process.

183
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:00,680
You know there are a lot of media outlets present. I can't escape anymore.

184
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,240
Let me finish this first before you take me, please.

185
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,560
Hey, it looks like they're not letting you go.

186
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Then, we need to use this method.

187
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,000
They're coming.

188
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,600
We're ready. You can come closer.

189
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,720
Alright.

190
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,320
Hello everyone, first of all, I'd like to thank everyone who's joined me in today's press conference.

191
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,880
I've just regained consciousness after losing consciousness not long ago.

192
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,240
Right now, I still can't remember much.

193
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,560
But as far as I can remember, it was my birthday party that day.

194
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,800
I have to admit that we were drinking.

195
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:36,000
Some of us were completely intoxicated, including myself, but regardless, I had no motivation of doing anything like that to Boo.

196
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,080
And as for the guest list, I haven't seen any information disclosed yet.

197
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,640
The information is still confidential and hasn't been disclosed yet because it could affect the case.

198
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,040
Yes, as the police said...

199
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,160
Hey, Thientot posted a video.

200
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,320
What is it about?

201
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,120
What is it?

202
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,200
About the situation that day related to Foam.

203
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,640
Instagram?

204
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,880
Hello everyone, I heard about the upcoming press conference regarding this matter. I also have something to share with everyone.

205
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,560
Aside from Foam, whom everyone already knows, there's another important hidden character.

206
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,000
Do you want to know who it is?

207
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I will tell you now. It's Nenie.

208
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,600
I've heard that her father is influential. Isn't it suspicious why they haven't disclosed the names of people at the party?

209
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,240
And why has the news been silent? If anyone knows more, please share.

210
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,760
I have information about Nenie's father's business

211
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,640
and another behind-the-scenes figure in the entertainment industry that may impact this case.

212
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,080
And I'll give this flash drive to the police.

213
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,880
You can take a look at the information now on my livestream page. The password is TIME1384.

214
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,160
Let's see.

215
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Your time is up now, Foam. You'll have to leave.

216
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:23,600
There are anonymous sources providing updates on the confidential information, continuing from Mr. Foam since 2019 to the present.

217
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,920
Have you seen the video?

218
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,000
There are CCTV camera captures from the hotel where the incident occurred.

219
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,880
Mr. Foam, we should go.

220
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,880
Following this, I ask all of you to follow the process of proving the truth. Mr. Foam, please leave.

221
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,520
Take him away.

222
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,080
Anyway, I'll take pictures of them first.

223
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,880
From today's events involving Mr. Foam and Naphatsanat, a suspect in the murder of his manager, commonly known as Boo, Foam has held a press conference.

224
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,240
His press conference has led to well-intentioned individuals sending important video clips that could potentially change the course of the case.

225
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Let's watch those video clips together.

226
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:13,920
Hello, I'm Gavin. I am Ms. Nenie's bodyguard, and I was at the scene of Boo's murder.

227
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,760
On that day, I orchestrated everything to make Foam appear guilty.

228
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,120
And I had to do it because Ms. Nenie ordered me to.

229
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,440
Aside from the recent clip, there is still information about Nina's psychiatric treatment, as well as various cases that have been covered up.

230
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:50,040
During the press conference, Foam revealed evidence regarding certain business dealings of Mr. Danupol, the father of actress Nenie, which suggests potential legal violations.

231
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,680
And another individual, Ms. Pareenawee, is also involved in the network.

232
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,480
In addition, there were well-intentioned individuals who submitted CCTV footage related to the murder case,

233
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,080
with the expectation that it would serve as another crucial piece of evidence in identifying and punishing the perpetrator.

234
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,680
Why can't I make a call?

235
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,560
Mr. Danupol, what should I do? I can't get through to Black Boss.

236
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,280
I don't know where Foam got the information from.

237
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,000
How would I know that?

238
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,520
in this situation, Backboss should have abandoned us.

239
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,440
Then, what's our next move?

240
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
Now it's whoever it is.

241
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:46,160
Hey! Mr. Danupol! Damn it, he hung up.

242
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
I would like to invite Ms. Pareenawee to provide a statement at the police station.

243
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,120
Mr. Tasanai!

244
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,360
You have to help me.

245
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,080
I won't involve you in this matter. You have to take responsibility for your own actions.

246
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,760
This matter has already affected my job enough. Officer, please take her.

247
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,880
Hey!

248
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,480
Take her into custody and bring her to the station.

249
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,320
Please allow me.

250
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,680
Are we really not going on vacation together after all the heavy stuff we've been through?

251
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,240
No, you all can go. I'm fine.

252
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,080
Why does Foam always come here?

253
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,480
I have no idea. Maybe he's waiting for someone.

254
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,840
Are you ready?

255
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Yes, let's go.

256
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,760
Is this for me?

257
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Yes, someone asked me to pass it on to you.

258
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,680
What is this?

259
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,600
It's okay. I'll help you find your parents.

260
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,640
Where are you guys?

261
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,240
I miss you guys so much.

262
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,960
Hey, why are you crying?

263
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,720
Can't you find the person you miss?

264
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,200
Don't cry. I'll help you find the person you miss.

265
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,520
Chris! Park! Bew!

266
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,040
I miss you so much!

267
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,880
I miss you

268
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,360
Same here.

269
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,440
Is this real?

270
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Yes!

271
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,320
Where have you guys been?

272
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,840
We were hiding. Chris told us to hide. If we didn't, how could we help you?

273
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,600
Does that mean you guys were helping me after all this time?

274
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,000
Yes, it's Chris's plans.

275
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,960
But when it comes to information and computers, it's me.

276
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:35,880
You guys... Let me ask you all.

277
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,480
I miss you.

278
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,680
I'm here.

279
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,640
Don't cry anymore.

280
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
You cried like a baby.

281
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,560
I thought you were in a music video.

282
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,720
I won't leave you alone again.

283
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,120
I miss you.

284
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,720
Stop crying.

285
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,560
We're not going anywhere.

286
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,840
You're more handsome.

287
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,920
Right? What did you do to your face?

288
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,640
Tell me, I'll take Park there.

289
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,440
Why? I'm a superstar.

290
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,160
That's my friend, not humble at all.

291
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,720
Are you blushing?

292
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:26,200
Blushing? No? I'm not blushing.

293
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,880
By the way, how did you get the information?

294
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:38,960
After that incident, when you got shot, I knew that someday we'd have to meet at the right time.

295
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,040
I've been watching you from afar, gathering information, and caring about you from a distance.

296
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,040
Because I know that standing beside you here is a result of manipulating the past,

297
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,720
I don't want to get involved in your situations.

298
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,040
But in my heart, I want to protect you at all costs.

299
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,000
Thank you so much for always helping me.

300
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,440
How about the murder case?

301
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,000
It seems like the case isn't going to end anytime soon.

302
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,080
But Nenie, she was detained by the police at the airport while traveling to see her father,

303
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,200
but her father hasn't been caught yet because he's still abroad. It's hard to contact him.

304
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,720
As for Ms. Pareenawee, it seems like the police are still investigating,

305
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,000
but Black Boss hasn't been caught yet. There isn't enough information.

306
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,760
Black Boss? Nobody knows his true identity.

307
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,440
He's clever and has a lot of connections.

308
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,400
As far as I know, Black Boss is the mastermind behind an international hacking group,

309
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,200
creating networks to attack financial systems and attempting to drain bank accounts worldwide.

310
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,320
I got involved in the wrong thing because I wanted quick money.

311
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,280
But I never thought for a moment that one day I'd be in trouble myself.

312
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,960
That information is quite exclusive. Only a few people know the access codes to the network.

313
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:30,000
But I believe that ultimately, those who commit wrongdoing must be held accountable and face consequences

314
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,560
But now, let me punish someone first.

315
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,440
Why do I have to be punished?

316
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,360
Because you already found me, but you leave me waiting and missing you.

317
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,640
Then I'll have to punish you too.

318
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,320
Because you also leave me waiting and missing you. I miss you more than you miss me.

319
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,240
I always wrote you letters.

320
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,880
How should I punish you?

321
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,960
Can you move in with me? I've been living alone for a long time.

322
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,120
I want to be with you. I believe in the concept of time.

323
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:37,760
It separates us, but it also allows us to come back together again.

324
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,360
I'll be there to support you and face obstacles together.

325
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,760
So let's live our lives together.

326
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,520
Thank you.

327
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,240
Oh my goodness!

328
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,080
This is Thientot, our newest host.

329
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,320
He's single, virgin and playful.

330
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,840
Who wants him? Please buy 10 drinks.

331
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,680
You want to start? 10 drinks one...

332
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
20 drinks!

333
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,360
30 drinks!

334
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
40 drinks!

335
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,960
Then, I'll buy 100 drinks.

336
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,200
100 drinks One..

337
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,920
Two.. Three..

338
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,240
Show off your abs!

339
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,320
This way

340
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,640
Next, Ton and Pak.

341
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,640
This is our promotion, only one drink!

342
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,120
What do you think you're doing? Do you have to go this far?

343
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:14,600
What does it have to do with you? And what's wrong with being a host? I'm happy and I don't have to bother anyone.

344
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,680
And I don't fool people around like you.

345
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,000
Let's leave.

346
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,840
You are the one to leave. Stop following me. I want to be a host.

347
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,080
I want to live my own life and be happy, okay?

348
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,120
Hello, everything goes as planned.

349
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,720
Copy that, Black boss.
