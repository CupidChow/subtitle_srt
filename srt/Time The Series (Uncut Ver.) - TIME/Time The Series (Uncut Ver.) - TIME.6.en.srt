"Time The Series"
(Episode 6)

2
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,920
Park, what is this?

3
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Why are you acting so strangely?

4
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,720
I just want to be near you.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
I get goosebumps.

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Why?

7
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,000
Did I change?

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
Act like you normally do.

9
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,600
How can I do that?
We're together now, as boyfriends.

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,560
However.

11
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,960
You have to be responsible for that night.

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,280
Okay.

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,160
Can I ask for one favor?

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
Don't tell anyone just yet.

15
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,280
And I'm willing to do whatever you ask of me.

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Bew, please.

17
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,440
Please, I'm begging you.
Handsome boy, please.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Alright.

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,520
Please, just act like you normally would.

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Why? Don't you enjoy it?

21
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,000
Nah, not really feeling it.

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh? Does it give you goosebumps?

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Stop.

24
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,440
What's wrong?

25
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,560
Hello, Ms. Pareenawee.

26
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,080
What did you send me?

27
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
The earphones you've been searching for.

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,720
What am I going to do with earphones?
What I'm searching for is a flash drive.

29
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,280
If you can't find that flash drive with the crucial information,
the bar is going to have a big problem.

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,120
I'll have the staff search the entire bar.
Don't get angry just yet.

31
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
This is of utmost urgency.

32
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,360
Got it. I'm truly sorry.

33
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,600
Here.

34
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,640
It looks like you study a lot, Thientot.

35
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,360
I just read for revision.
I already know everything.

36
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,600
Okay, eat the snacks if you're hungry.
I'm heading out.

37
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
Hey, Little!

38
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Kongtub.

39
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,640
What are you drawing, son?

40
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm drawing this and that.

41
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,840
I brought you some snacks, in case you're hungry.

42
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,800
I think the weather is starting to get hot here.
You can go inside and wait in the house for now.

43
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,600
I'll draw for a little bit more.

44
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,560
Alright, I'll go inside first.

45
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Little, what's up?

46
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Kongtub.

47
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,560
Let's play outside.

48
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
Then.

49
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Follow me.

50
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,840
Okay, let's go.

51
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,200
What's up?

52
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,480
Do you like drawing?
I've noticed you drawing every day.

53
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:17,120
I like drawing lines until they form a picture.
I think it's wonderful.

54
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,480
So what do you want to be in the future? A painter?

55
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,440
Yes, I want to be an artist.
What about you?

56
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,840
I want to become an actor.
Someday, I'll make it happen.

57
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,880
My mother also wants me to become an actor
because she's planning to invest in the entertainment industry.

58
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,080
That's great. It should make things easier for you.

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,240
If I were to become an actor,
I'd prefer to do it based on my own abilities.

60
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,480
Until then, I want you to be there.

61
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,920
I found what the customer is looking for.

62
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,160
If you're relieved, please bring it to me.

63
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Alright.

64
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,320
Oh, or perhaps you can return it
to Ms. Pareenawee before you come to work.

65
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,280
Roger that.

66
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,120
Today, I have to go somewhere else before heading to work. You'll have to go to work by yourself.

67
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Chris, I think I've already told you.

68
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,160
If you don't stop meddling with Black boos,
you'll die. Please stop messing with him, I beg you.

69
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,760
How did you know about Black boss?
Who are you exactly?

70
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm your boyfriend from the future,
I already told you.

71
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,960
That day, before you died,
you told me about Black boss.

72
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
It made me understand everything.

73
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,640
Stop messing with Black boss, I beg you.

74
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,480
If I stop, you have to stop too.

75
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,640
I promise.

76
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,320
But I need to gradually step back.

77
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,440
Just you telling me you'll step back makes me happy.

78
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,600
When I go to work, can we go together?

79
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,720
No, I have something to do.

80
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,640
You go do your thing, I'll wait in the car.

81
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,560
I promise I won't go anywhere.
Just let me go with you.

82
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,160
But I'll just sit and wait in the car.

83
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,440
Got it, mister. I'll wait in the car
and won't move an inch.

84
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,720
When you're not stubborn and nosy,
you're quite cute.

85
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,440
Did you just say I'm cute?

86
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,840
I didn't.

87
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,680
I heard it.

88
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,680
Don't be shy, I heard it with my ears.

89
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,800
You're imagining it.

90
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
No, I really heard it.

91
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
Where is my 12ZUM?

92
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,520
Under the drawer.

93
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,960
Are we at the point of needing medication to help?

94
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
So it can reach its full potential.

95
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,920
Can we have one more round?

96
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,200
No, I'm exhausted.

97
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,000
And we'll be late to work.

98
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
Just one more round, please.

99
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,800
No.

100
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,880
We can make it quick, please.

101
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,120
Alright, then let's take a shower together.

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,240
In the bathroom? Okay, let's go.

103
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,640
It's yummy.

104
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Do you like it? I'll bring you here often.

105
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,920
I like it.

106
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
But I might not be able to come here often.

107
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
You can sneak out like you did today.

108
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,960
Hurry up and eat it, or it'll melt.

109
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,400
By the way, why do you want to be an actor?

110
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,520
I don't know. Maybe I feel good
when I get to portray a character.

111
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,280
I want to ease my father's burden. He seems tired.

112
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,920
Have you ever been to an audition?

113
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,000
No, I haven't.

114
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,880
Hmm, try make a happy face.

115
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,280
Why do I need to make one?
I'm feeling happy right now.

116
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,720
I won't be around after today.

117
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,080
Where are you going?

118
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,080
I like you. Just wanted to make sure
I said it before I go.

119
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,240
Why are you saying it now?

120
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,160
Then...

121
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,720
can we make a reservation for you to be mine?

122
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
Yes.

123
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,760
It's finished. Are you in a trance?

124
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,600
No.

125
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
Wait here.

126
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,360
Okay, Mr. Chris.

127
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:50,440
What are you doing here? Did you come with
the person who just went inside? Do you two work together?

128
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,960
In case I want to hang out with you.

129
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,360
You want to test me?

130
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:08,320
I really like those eyes of yours. No fear, no avoidance.

131
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,960
I really like them. By the way, what's your name?

132
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,360
It's Foam, remember it well.

133
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,880
Where are you headed in the early evening?

134
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm about to go hang out with my friends before the exams.

135
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
Don't come back late.

136
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,760
Are you planning to go by a motorcycle?
Why not let the chauffeur take you there?

137
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,720
Well, a motorcycle seems more fun.

138
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,280
Hello, sir.

139
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,800
Hello.

140
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,040
Is everything alright?

141
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,120
Yes.

142
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh, you already have a partner.
Interesting. I like a challenge.

143
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
Let's hurry to the bar.

144
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:36,560
I saw your face yesterday.
You seem to quite like it, huh? Do you like me?

145
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,000
Can you change the topic?

146
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How about another round tonight?

147
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,600
Do you want to get hit?

148
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,840
Oh, wow, you guys are sticking close together.

149
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
You guys got close pretty quickly.

150
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,200
Is there something going on between the two of you?

151
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:01,400
That's right. I see you two sneaking out to eat together all the time.
You call each other constantly, but never invite me.

152
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
How did you know?

153
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:13,840
I already told you I'm your best friend from the future.

154
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,000
What's wrong with the two of you?

155
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,160
Right, why do you have to gossip?
Is there anything I should know?

156
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
You're acting very strangely.

157
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
That's my question.

158
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,320
We work together.

159
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,840
Right.

160
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,760
That's why we're close.

161
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,240
Right?

162
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,960
Nothing's strange.

163
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,280
Yes, nothing's weird about that.

164
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,240
What's strange about us being close?

165
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,560
Nothing.

166
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Let's go inside.

167
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,840
Let's go to work before Piak starts nagging us.
I really don't want to listen to it. It's annoying.

168
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Don't you think you hug us too tightly?

169
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
Do you hug us to relieve your shyness?

170
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
Shyness? Bew, follow us.

171
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,280
Come in.

172
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,680
Wow, you arrived right on time, Ms. Gift.

173
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,720
I've been here for a while,
but there are customers coming in and I need to talk.

174
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,920
Chris, someone is asking for you.

175
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,160
Who is she?

176
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Why don't you ask for her name?

177
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,160
Chris.

178
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,520
Gift, who is that woman? Do you know her?

179
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,400
I don't know.

180
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,520
I don't know for sure. But I overheard Chris mentioning
when he was drunk that she's his ex.

181
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:02,520
It's like she's his first love from high school.
Their fathers are quite close too. But I'm not sure why they broke up.

182
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,040
But I think they're back together now.

183
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Even though you say you don't know, you're still sharing this much information.
If you knew, wouldn't you tell us their whole life story?

184
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,080
Why don't you go get changed?
You keep staring at them.

185
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,280
You're acting as if you're his boyfriend.

186
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,440
Well, that's correct.

187
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,120
Wait, Piak! No! I'm just curious.

188
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
This is Jane, not Piak. Are you lost in space?

189
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,240
Right, it seems like you're distracted.
Change your clothes, you'll need to welcome customers.

190
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,200
My father and your father got into
an accident on their way to a reunion.

191
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,280
Their symptoms are very concerning.
The director is helping to take care of them.

192
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,760
Chris, please go see your father.

193
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,560
Chris.

194
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Chris, no one knows where you are.

195
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,480
That's why I'm here.

196
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,600
Thank you for telling me.

197
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll go see him later.

198
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,000
Chris, will you go today with me?

199
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,760
Chris.

200
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Damn, you smell nice after your shower.

201
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,720
Where are Park and his friends?

202
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,560
What's wrong with him? Why isn't he talking?

203
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,080
Bottoms up.

204
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,520
Chris, are you alone? Are you lonely?

205
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,800
Of course I'm alone. Or do you see someone?

206
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,800
Or are you really sitting with someone I can't see?

207
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Be serious.

208
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,880
I'm alone.

209
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
Aw, I'm totally shocked.
Bew was already running away.

210
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,920
I'll tell you something.

211
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,720
What?

212
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,240
It doesn't need to be a fancy spot, just lounging around with
someone who gets you, a companion – that's happiness.

213
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,680
Sweet!

214
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,640
Sweet / That was touching.

215
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,920
That's deep. Does that mean
Bew and I are like the someone you mentioned?

216
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,360
What are you waiting for?

217
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,000
You're lucky to have me and Bew as friends.
Without us, you wouldn't have any friends.

218
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I always protect you, though.

219
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,480
So, how was today?
There were a lot of customers today.

220
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,520
For me, it was chill. Everything was pretty easy.

221
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,160
I saw you getting touched.

222
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,600
No, that never happened. I'm very careful.

223
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Or you were the one to touch them?

224
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,440
It's all peeled off.

225
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,000
No, I never did that. It's you guys. You're dangerous.

226
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,600
You drank a lot, your voice sounds different now.

227
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
It's the result of hard work.

228
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,560
What about you?

229
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,440
Me?

230
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,240
Why do you lay down?

231
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,800
My level is at least 200-300 drinks per day.

232
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
Alright, handsome boy.

233
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,720
And what about you, Chris?

234
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm in the top tier, of course.

235
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
If I weren't in the top tier,
I wouldn't be able to chill here like this.

236
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,840
It's your treat, then.

237
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,680
It's on me. It's on me.

238
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,800
Oh, he's feeling like a rich man today.

239
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,480
Then, I'll get more.

240
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,400
Just order everything,

241
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
I'm fine with that.

242
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,000
Be prepared.

243
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
Have you seen Tar?

244
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
Tar?

245
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,360
Where is he?

246
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,040
I haven't seen him around much today.

247
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,880
I haven't seen him either. Where could he be?

248
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,000
Right?

249
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,160
You have to know.

250
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
You two are usually attached at the hip.

251
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,320
I know, right?

252
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,440
Hey, Tar! Speak of the devil. We just talked about him.

253
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,400
Sit here. Yes, right here. We just talked about you.

254
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,560
Let's have a drink with us, Tar.

255
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
Give him one.

256
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,640
Tar, have a drink.

257
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,760
Take a sip.

258
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,280
Why are you late?

259
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,000
Ask him.

260
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Why did you come late today?

261
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,560
I didn't go anywhere.
Was it you guys who didn't see me?

262
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,080
He said he didn't go anywhere.
It's you who didn't see him.

263
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,000
And were there a lot of customers today?

264
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:39,520
Just ask him yourself. Okay, how was today?

265
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,160
There were a lot of customers today,
but it was pretty chill.

266
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:55,160
I heard a regular guest of somebody came to visit, is that right?

267
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,280
A regular guest of somebody?

268
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,800
I didn't mention the name, but I mean "somebody."

269
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,520
Who is it.

270
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,840
A regular guest of somebody?

271
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,880
Who?

272
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,920
Not me.

273
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,600
Is it you? A regular?

274
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,640
No, I don't have a regular. Or is it you?

275
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,080
Is it you?

276
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,240
I do have one.

277
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,840
So it's clear that "somebody" is you, then.

278
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,160
Yes, you are that "somebody".

279
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Me?

280
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,720
If there's a regular, then it must be you.

281
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
You're the only one.

282
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,240
So it's me?

283
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,040
What did you do to make him angry?

284
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,840
What did I do?

285
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,200
Think thoroughly.

286
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,840
He didn't talk to you, didn't you notice?

287
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,360
Yeah.

288
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,680
Keep thinking.

289
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,320
Mr. somebody, please think.
If you can't think of one, then go ask him.

290
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,240
Do I have to reconcile with him?
Do I have to ask him?

291
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,440
Yes! Can't you see he's angry with you?

292
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,200
Go to him and don't forget to tell me what made him angry.

293
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,680
Don't forget to tell us.

294
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,760
I'll go first.

295
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Go now, Mr. Somebody.

296
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,440
Oh, you guys want a private time together, right?

297
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
Mr. Somebody.

298
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,040
Cheers.

299
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,360
I'm so exhausted today.

300
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Why are you complaining?

301
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,560
Well, the customer has been sitting on my lap since they entered the bar
in the evening until they left. Oh wow, my body hurts so bad.

302
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,720
Come here, I'll give you a massage.

303
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
I'm fine.

304
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,720
What is going on with Tar and Chris?

305
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:39,520
I don't know about them but what about us tonight?

306
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,960
Nah, I'm sleepy and very tired.

307
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
Where are you going?

308
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,520
I'm going to take a showerl

309
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
I'll go with you.

310
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,640
Nah.

311
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,600
Please, I'll help you rub your back.

312
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,480
Taking a shower alone can be lonely, don't you think?

313
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,240
Just a shower, I promise.

314
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,080
Alright, then.

315
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
Hurry up and follow me.

316
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,520
Are you sure? Don't lock the door, wait for me.

317
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,520
Why are you packing? Where are you going?

318
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
Where are you going?

319
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,240
If there's something bothering you,
let's discuss it calmly. What's going on?

320
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,840
We can talk.

321
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,640
And what about you? If something's on your mind,
why don't you share it with me?

322
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:19,120
You're still the same, whether it's the past
you or the present you. You never change.

323
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,800
If you want to know, ask me.
I'll tell you everything.

324
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,040
If you want to know, just ask me.
I'll tell you everything.

325
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,880
I wanted to know about Pang, your girlfriend.

326
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:43,840
You even keep her picture in this room.

327
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,440
You must really love her, don't you?

328
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
I do.

329
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,200
Why did I go back in time?

330
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:15,000
To remind myself that in the end,
the person I love and hope for still loves someone else.

331
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,480
Ir hurts!

332
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,440
Didn't you tell me you came back in time to fix things?

333
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,720
To change the past so that I wouldn't die, right?

334
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,360
I can still sense your care.

335
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,080
And I'm aware of the feelings you have for me.

336
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,440
Even though you're curious about everything.

337
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:25,760
Even though you were aware of the risks,
you always went out of your way for me.

338
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,320
But what significance does it hold
when you're already in love with someone else?

339
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:45,560
What I meant by what I said earlier is
that I used to love Pang a lot.

340
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,120
But it's not like that anymore.

341
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,280
That's all in the past now.

342
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,280
I no longer love her.

343
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,480
We're good friends now.

344
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,520
But she still comes to see you
and asks for reconciliation, right?

345
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:33,640
She only came to inform me about my father and her father's accident
and asked me to come visit him. That's it.

346
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,320
Why didn't she call?

347
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,680
I haven't been in contact with my family
for a long time. Only she knows where I am.

348
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,120
Why you didn't tell me?

349
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,080
I was thinking too far ahead.

350
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,920
Jane and Gift fooled me.

351
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,680
You know they like to gossip.

352
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,760
Yeah, I know.

353
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:43,440
Next time, if you have anything, ask me directly,
don't just keep it to yourself like this.

354
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,480
By the way,

355
00:38:49,840 --> 00:39:01,480
You care for me this much,
does it mean you already have feelings for me?

356
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
No.

357
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,600
I know you like me, just accept it.

358
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,800
It's all in your head.

359
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,160
It's not.

360
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,240
You cared a lot for me just now.

361
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,840
What's wrong, Tar?

362
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,480
Tar! Are you okay?

363
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,960
You just talked to me just now. Tar?
