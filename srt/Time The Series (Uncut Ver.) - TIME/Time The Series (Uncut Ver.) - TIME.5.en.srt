1
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,280
Long time no see, Chis.

2
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Oh? How long have you been here?

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,880
Ms. Nenie.

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,600
Why didn't you inform me when you returned?

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,560
Welcome back. Do you want to go upstairs now?

6
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Today, I'd rather stay here.

7
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Can you please have Chris stay with me?

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,440
No problem, Ms. Nenie. Let me clear the table first.

9
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,000
Girls, clear the table in the VIP zone for Ms. Nenie.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,600
Yes, it's for VIPs.

11
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,080
Hey, do you happen to be familiar with a woman named Nenie?

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,880
Yes, of course. She used to come here very often, but she's mostly upstairs.

13
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
She's a regular customer of Chris.

14
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,200
She often caused troubles back then. She's grumpy.

15
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
When she's in a good mood, she's a big tipper, but when she's not, watch out for her mood swings.

16
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,800
Then why does Piak still let her in?

17
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Because her father is a VIP, he's always sorting out her issues.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,000
That's the advantage of having a powerful father.

19
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,400
But actually, I haven't seen her for two years.

20
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,920
Her father sent her to study abroad because of the murder...

21
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
What are you gossiping about? Don't you have work to do?

22
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,200
Customers waited to drink the Ferris wheel until they all changed to eat the Bumper cars.

23
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,280
What about you? I told you to prepare the table for Ms. Nenie.

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,520
I'll do it now.

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,000
See?

26
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,440
Hey, where are you going? I'm taking you to meet the customer.

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,840
I'll use the toilet first, and then I'll follow you to the table.

28
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Will he know which table it is?

29
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
Let me go pick up the phone.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,480
Why didn't you let me know you were here?

31
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Why do I have to tell you?

32
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,480
So I could be prepared to welcome you.

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,120
Yes, sure.

34
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes, boos. I haven't seen him yet, but I think he's about to arrive.

35
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,840
I'll send you all the data tonight.

36
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,320
No one doubts that, for sure.

37
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,200
Boss? Or is it that black boss Chris mentioned?

38
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm a little smashed now.

39
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
Do you want some snacks?

40
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Can you feed me?

41
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't feed me with your hand.

42
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,000
Ms. Nenie, your room is ready. Would you like to go there now?

43
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
I'll be back.

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,680
Alright.

45
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
Can I have another boy to take care of me?

46
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,320
Sure, no problem at all, especially for you, Ms. Nenie.

47
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,600
This way.

48
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,560
Be careful.

49
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,400
Hey

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,640
What?

51
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Where are they going?

52
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,040
Looks like they're going to VVIP zone.

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
VVIP?

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,480
They said they would talk here, but what's really happening?

55
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,040
Are you alright?

56
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,240
What kind of person talks to themselves, anyway?

57
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,840
Well, I'm alright.

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
I better go now.

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
Wait

60
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,400
Can you help me?

61
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,960
What can I help you with?

62
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,240
If you're looking to snag your first regular, you gotta grab their attention yourself.

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,760
No, that's not it. I mean...

64
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,880
I won't disappoint you.

65
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,440
Great, please help me.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Hello

67
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Wow, you're just as pretty as Boo said.

68
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Thank you so much. Today, I came here instead of my father, he's not available.

69
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,280
This is Ms. Pareenawee and Thiantot. They're coming to invest with us.

70
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:14,840
And I assure you, our first series is bound to make waves with the presence of the lovely Ms. Nenie and the dashing Thientot.

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
Disgusting

72
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,080
This investment isn't just for the series.

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,200
But it's for everything in the entertainment industry.

74
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,320
And each of us will invest 50 million. I've already discussed it with your father.

75
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
There won't be a problem if I get the protagonist role.

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
Okay

77
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,760
What if we change the storyline? Actually, we'd better change the main couples. I don't want to play opposite this person.

78
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,760
We can discuss the main roles later on.

79
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Okay

80
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,840
Seems like we're done talking. I'll be heading off now.

81
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,240
Thientot

82
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Maybe we can discuss some other details.

83
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
That's great.

84
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,360
You're so pretty that it doesn't matter who you're paired up with, you'll still be famous. Don't worry.

85
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,440
I hope so.

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
As for today, if there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

87
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,720
Hold on, please convey our conversation to your father.

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll try.

89
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,680
I suggest you consider investing in another business. It seems like this project has a troublemaker.

90
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,920
It would be nice to explore other options for me.

91
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,000
I feel like the one you brought today doesn't seem to fit. I'll leave now.

92
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,240
Hey, Boo. Will what we discussed today work out?

93
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,720
I'll take care of everything.

94
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,400
Is everything alright, Boo?

95
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,720
Yes

96
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,120
I heard you were talking about main roles. Can I also be a lead actress?

97
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,320
Sure

98
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,480
Sure?

99
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,640
Sure

100
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,800
You're always nice to me.

101
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,480
Please have one more drink.

102
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,720
Tar, I'm already drunk. I can't handle any more drinks.

103
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Is that so?

104
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
Yes

105
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Are you alright?

106
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes, I am.

107
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,520
Are you sure? You look drunk, Boo.

108
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,720
Hold her well.

109
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
Are you really drunk?

110
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,640
Tina, would you mind if I excused myself to use the restroom quickly?

111
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,440
Sure, hurry back. I'm feeling lonely.

112
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Alright

113
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,800
Come, come.

114
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,120
Hey, how was it? Did you get anything?

115
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,640
Well..

116
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Hey, how was the VVIP zone?

117
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Talk to you later.

118
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,600
Talk about what? Go get to work.

119
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
Alright

120
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,080
You too.

121
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,280
What are you doing just standing there? Get to work already.

122
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,840
Tar! Chris! Look at this.

123
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,440
What's happening? Why are you rushing over like that?

124
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,000
Something big happen!

125
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
Look at this news.

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Your hands are all tangled.

127
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,160
Take a look first.

128
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,160
Look

129
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,760
A young host from the host bar nearly dies after vanishing for a week.

130
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,160
A young host from the host bar nearly dies after vanishing for a week.

131
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,720
Before the police found the body, he had been severely beaten, with his arms and legs tied up, and left locked in an abandoned building.

132
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,280
That's really terrifying.

133
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,480
Wait

134
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,280
That's Frong, our top-tier host who was taking care of VVIPs just last week.

135
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
Yes, that's him Look at the picture.

136
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,480
He has a tattoo on his arm just like Frong's, and his hair and everything else match.

137
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
Shit!

138
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,800
What?

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,520
That day, I was also in the VVIP zone with Frong.

140
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,840
But that group of customers didn't appear dangerous at all. They were also willing to pay.

141
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,880
That's why there's a saying, "You can't judge a book by its cover."

142
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,680
We should find a time to visit him in the hospital.

143
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,720
Yes, we should.

144
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
At least he'll know we're there for him.

145
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,560
I think our job can be quite risky at times.

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,520
We never know what we're going to face each day.

147
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,000
Who will guarantee our safety?

148
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:08,600
And the fact that they're VVIPs with such big connections...wow, the police might not be able to help us.

149
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,320
That sucks

150
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,640
Okay, I've got an idea. What if we all just quit?

151
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,640
And we'll go find a fun and safe jobs.

152
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
That's a great idea.

153
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
I know, right?

154
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,840
By the way, what are you going to do if you quit.

155
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:45,320
Umm, for a game addict like me,

156
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:52,840
If I didn't work for a company, I'd probably be a programmer in the IT department.

157
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,520
Am I cool?

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,120
Me? My eloquence is outstanding, my handsomeness is withstanding.

159
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:14,480
What else could I be if not an influencer or an actor?

160
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,200
With your looks, you'd be better off being a hero in folk opera.

161
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,720
Or maybe a trot singer?

162
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,760
You always discuss me and inquire about others. But what about you? If you weren't a host, what would be your occupation?

163
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Right, what would you do?

164
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,840
I want to be a chef and have my own restaurant.

165
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,800
I think I have to work here until I can open my own restaurant.

166
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,680
Are people like you going to become chefs, really?

167
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,200
Did you forget? You still manage to burn your fried egg in our room.

168
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,280
What?

169
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
That's not true.

170
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,040
Make sure you can fry your own egg perfectly before making one for others.

171
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,200
It's not easy.

172
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,200
You can always make cup noodles. Don't try cooking a real meal just yet.

173
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,360
But actually, being a host also has its upsides.

174
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,400
Like what?

175
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:27,600
Like being able to take care of our customers.

176
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,760
When they have something bothering them, we can be the ones to listen and make them feel better.

177
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,880
That's true.

178
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,360
My friend is super kind.

179
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,640
Now, I know what job suits you best, Tar.

180
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,440
What job?

181
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,000
social worker

182
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,240
It does suits you.

183
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,960
It's the only job for a kind person like you.

184
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,160
How was your customers last night?

185
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
Which one?

186
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,720
Um, Nenie.

187
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,640
Why do you want to know about her?

188
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,680
You two seem to be very close.

189
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,720
Like "Do you want more drinks?" or "I will take care of you".

190
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,520
You're really getting on my nerves.

191
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,960
No, I'm not.

192
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,760
Why do you have to please her?

193
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,160
She's my customer, that's why I have to please her.

194
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,440
You talk as if you're jealous.

195
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:09,440
Yes, I am. I'm jealous when I see you with others.

196
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,360
Why do you have to be jeaous?

197
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,480
You don't know how little time I have to spend with you.

198
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,680
I want to make the most of every moment we have together.

199
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:37,720
That's why I don't like everyone who's near you.

200
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

201
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,720
Hurry up and take a shower.

202
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,560
Can I take a shower first?

203
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,240
The first to reach the bathroom gets to shower first.

204
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,240
Let's take a shower together, then.

205
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,520
Hey, Can I take a bath with you?

206
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,160
Why are you here?

207
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
I am here to take a bath with you

208
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,320
give me some privacy!

209
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,320
I told you i will take a bath with you

210
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,520
So

211
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Let's take a shower

212
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,520
I said no!

213
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,320
I told you

214
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Let's take a bath together

215
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,080
Why are you in hurry?

216
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
It won't take long.

217
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,800
But I have Ken.

218
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,920
Alright, I'll hurry.

219
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,160
But this is right in front of the toilet.

220
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
It's okay.

221
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
How was last night?

222
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,080
Last night? Nothing happened.

223
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,120
But if there's anything, it must be this.

224
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,200
What do you mean?

225
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,240
It's strange. They were acting very suspicious.

226
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,800
But I didn't take a look inside.

227
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Hey! I'm outside buying food. I'll be right back.

228
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,120
What's going on between the two of you?

229
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,440
Nothing.

230
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,280
Hm?

231
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,400
I think there must be something important on that flash drive.

232
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,880
There might be something important on it, but there's something more important right now.

233
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,520
What is it?

234
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
That call

235
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,080
What is going on between you and Park?

236
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,640
Absolutely nothing.

237
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Are you sure?

238
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,680
Bew!

239
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,320
Jilly, how did you get here?

240
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,320
Because you're never home. I miss you.

241
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,480
One of your girls?

242
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,600
No, it's a long story.

243
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,800
I'll head upstairs first.

244
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,040
I'll follow you.

245
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,240
See you

246
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,960
Hey Jilly, why are you here? Does Mom know you're here?

247
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,240
No, I came here alone and didn't tell her.

248
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,360
How did you know I'm here?

249
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,280
A fortune teller told me.

250
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,480
This is not funny.

251
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,200
I have a spy and she's so cute.

252
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,440
What did you say? What's cute?

253
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,240
Nothing. I searched for you by myself. But what are you doing here?

254
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,200
Actually, I'm here to gather secret information.

255
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,360
Really?

256
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,600
Be quiet

257
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,040
You're the only one who knows, Jilly, because I trust you.

258
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:52,520
You can't tell anyone, not even a dog. Do you understand?

259
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Yes

260
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,200
I'll go now. I need to keep gathering secret information.

261
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,520
Okay

262
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,440
Don't tell anyone.

263
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
You can trust me.

264
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,160
Yes, Kongtub. I came to the clinic at the hospital.

265
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm sorry.

266
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm sorry.

267
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
I'm really sorry.

268
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
Are you okay?

269
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,200
Yes, it's not a big deal.

270
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,560
I'm sorry.

271
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Nothing much, I just bumped into some people.

272
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,000
I am glad that you are okay mum

273
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,680
Will you arrive home late?

274
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,160
Okay

275
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,120
I love you too mum

276
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,640
excuse me

277
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,240
What are you looking for?

278
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,120
oh, nothing

279
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,320
urmm

280
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,520
so

281
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,520
today i invited friends to come to my house

282
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,480
Does your mum know?

283
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
i just spoke with mum

284
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,520
she won't be at home

285
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,120
and she will come back late

286
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,960
Please do not tell her

287
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Okay i understand

288
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,240
Thank you

289
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,840
you invited me here

290
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,800
Don't you think your mum might get angry

291
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,320
my mum is busy

292
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,120
and she will arrive home late

293
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I just want to thank you

294
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,480
that you accept me as a friend

295
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,200
even your mum doesn't like me

296
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,720
because of my status

297
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,720
you are my only friend

298
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
i am the one who has to say thank you

299
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,560
come

300
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,040
let's paint

301
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
there you go

302
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,200
Have you ever painted this style?

303
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
I have never done this in my life

304
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,360
let me teach you then

305
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,160
you have to do this

306
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,680
hold it

307
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,720
yes and then

308
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,840
start to draw the line

309
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
there you go

310
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,640
slowly draw the line

311
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,720
and then

312
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,120
keep doing it

313
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,920
and you

314
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,480
apply colour here

315
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
and here

316
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
apply more

317
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,680
like this

318
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,600
okay?

319
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,760
okay

320
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,280
I'll try it my self

321
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,160
okay let's try

322
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,560
why your hand is shaking

323
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,840
when you draw

324
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,400
you have to be patient

325
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,480
I am not good at it

326
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,840
Doesn't matter

327
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,080
when you draw this

328
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,960
you have to express your feelings

329
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,960
whatever you feel

330
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,040
just express your feeling through painting

331
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,560
try it again

332
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,320
Ms. Pareenawee, please see the doctor inside.

333
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,120
Please allow me to see the scalp.

334
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,720
May I adjust the bed, please?

335
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,840
Your scalp and hair examination results indicate good condition.

336
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,000
Really? But I'm feeling quite insecure because of my heavy workload in entertainment.

337
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,320
The hairdresser will need to use some spray or mousse. There's a lot happening with my hair.

338
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,720
When I wash my hair, my hair falls out a lot.

339
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,920
Your hair doesn't seem thin at all. It looks very healthy.

340
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,760
Actually, hair loss is a normal and natural occurrence in the body.

341
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:24,000
It has its own cycle of shedding.  In fact, within the normal range, a person's hair typically sheds about 100 strands per day

342
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If it exceeds that, you should see a specialist doctor which is me.

343
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,960
If it falls within the limit of 100 strands, it's still considered normal.

344
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:40,000
Lately, I've been attending a lot of events since my son entered the entertainment industry.

345
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,680
Oh, is that so?

346
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:48,080
As a mother, I feel the need to look my best, you know? What's next on the agenda?

347
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,000
I might suggest that Ms. Pareenawee come in for a follow-up with me.

348
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,920
I'll also administer an additional injection of Vitamin D3.

349
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,600
Thank you

350
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Thank you so much.

351
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,400
look at your face

352
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,800
What's on my face?

353
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
come here

354
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,120
let me wipe it for you

355
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,200
What's the matter?

356
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:35,960
why don't you wipe it?

357
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,840
i

358
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,640
am joking

359
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,440

360
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,080

361
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,560
What?

362
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,200
So be it

363
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
Is this what you want?

364
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,880
Is this what you want

365
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,960
Are you happy now huh?

366
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,880
Are you happy?

367
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,000
so you want more?

368
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
what a mess !

369
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,560
Hello, Boss.

370
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,560
I already got it.

371
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,240
I'll hang up now, Boss.

372
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,680
Yes, Kongtub. I came to the clinic at the hospital.

373
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,400
I'm sorry.

374
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
Hey

375
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,040
Oh, you're still here?

376
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,800
When I bumped into you, did you pick up my stuff?

377
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,320
Me? Picked up your stuff?

378
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,440
Give it back to me.

379
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,800
You don't believe me? Wait, I'll let you check.

380
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,480
I'll give you my number, and you can go home and find it.

381
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,600
If you can't find it, then give me a call.

382
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,240
Yes, ms. Pareenawee.

383
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,160
Piak, did I drop something there yesterday?

384
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,520
Oh, yeah. I was wondering who it belonged to. So, it's yours.

385
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,280
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you earlier.

386
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,160
It's okay. How about you treat me to a meal as an apology?

387
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,560
This meal isn't convenient for me. Let's plan for the next one.

388
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:46,520
It's alright. Do you mind if I give you my contact so we can text?

389
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,880
Here's my LINE id.

390
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,160
Don't forget to text me.

391
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,680
Hello

392
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,440
Hey, you're here. What's up?

393
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,440
You've always known about me. I want to study English more.

394
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,160
With so many foreign series coming out these days, it'd be great if I were proficient in the language, but I'm still in awe of you.

395
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,560
It's okay. If it's about studying, I'm always supporting you.

396
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I also want to learn dancing. I'd like to become a TikToker to help you earn money.

397
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:02,160
You're really good at negotiating. I want you to just be kind and keep improving yourself. I'll be very proud.

398
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,240
When we go on a trip abroad, you can be my translator.

399
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,120
Okay! You won't be disappointed.

400
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,560
I bought some food. Let's eat together.

401
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,880
Alright!

402
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,240
What is it?

403
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,000
Does it work?

404
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,200
It's loacked

405
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,640
Let me do it.

406
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:00,320
A game addict like me is good at this.

407
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,600
Got it.

408
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Hey

409
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,840
What's wrong?

410
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:28,680
I want to keep this to myself. You can go back. I'll tell you later.

411
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm off.

412
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Thank you.

413
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,480
What are you doing?

414
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
I'm not doing anything.

415
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,920
Why are you so stubborn? I told you not to meddle in my affairs.

416
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,280
If everything falls apart, what will you do? It's scarier than you think.

417
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:34,880
You're the one who needs to stop. You never know that this could lead to your death.

418
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,640
Then why are you meddling in my business?

419
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,040
Because I care about you.

420
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,320
It's still not too late.

421
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,680
Can you please back off from this right now? I'm begging you.

422
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:07,080
I am your boyfriend from the future. The image of the day you died is still stuck in my head.

423
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,360
I don't want to see you go through that crazy thing again.

424
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,360
I'm begging.
