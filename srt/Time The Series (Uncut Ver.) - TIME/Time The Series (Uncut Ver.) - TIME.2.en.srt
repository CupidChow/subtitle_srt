1
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,840
Have you seen the news?

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,200
No, I haven't.

3
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
It's about thirteen boys stuck in the cave.

4
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,480
Let me see.

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,640
After 17 days, they were rescued from the cave.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,320
I see.

7
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm relieved that everyone is safe.

8
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,320
Did I dream that I ended up in the old multiverse?

9
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,800
Am I trapped within the software of the dream?

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,840
Chris!

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,160
Who is he talking to?

12
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,960
They are sending stuff too.

13
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880
Hey!

14
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey

15
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,120
What are you secretly checking out?

16
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm secretly looking at Chris.

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Who's he talking to?

18
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,840
Whoa

19
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
You startled me.

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,200
No, you're the one who startled me.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
And who are you?

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,600
Do you know Chris? Is that why you came over here to secretly check him out?

23
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,960
Oh, so you must be a fan of his.

24
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
You were our customer, weren't you?

25
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,560
Can't you remember me, Park?

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,440
You even know my name.

27
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,200
You were surely our customer.

28
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll tell you something.

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
It's not his working hours yet.

30
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,480
If you want to meet him, let's do it at the shop,

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,160
not like this, following around, got it?

32
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
You seriously can't remember me?

33
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm Foam, no wait, I mean, I'm Ta.

34
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm your friend from the shop. Chris and Bew's friend.

35
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,400
You really did your research, knowing so many names.

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,000
By the way, who is Bew?

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,240
You guys will hook up.

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,080
And, you know, you'll go along with him for almost everything.

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh? You're asking for trouble with that mouth of yours.

40
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm Park, and people like me never back down to anyone.

41
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,160
Come here.

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
Hey! What are you doing, Park?

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Well, this guy is really getting on my nerves.

44
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,960
I spoke nothing but the truth.

45
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,160
Aren't you done yet?

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,320
Enough

47
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
You have more things to do.

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Go

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
We'll see.

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
Chris

51
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
Where are you going?

52
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Do you and I know each other?

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,840
If you don't want to get hurt, don't pry into his business.

54
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Hey! Wait for me.

55
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you know him?

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,840
Know what?

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
You're protecting him.

58
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
He also said that he knows you.

59
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,240
Protecting him? I just don't want you to get into a fight.

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,520
Piak will come after you.

61
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,440
Nah, I won't get in trouble.

62
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,680
But that guy is like a fake fortune teller.

63
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,640
He randomly predicted my future, saying I'll end up with someone I don't even know.

64
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
And he said I'll go along with that someone on everything.

65
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,560
Look at my face, Chris. Do you really think a good-looking guy like me would just go along with someone that easily?

66
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,560
Even when 3–4 girls like Kit, Cherry, and Gib

67
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,040
are chasing after me, I didn't give a darn.

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,880
I was, like, playing a push-and-pull game, you know?

69
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,920
Mr.Chris, will you head back?

70
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,560
Sure

71
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,040
Then why are you zoning out? Let's go.

72
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,600
Let's go.

73
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,600
What was that?

74
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,440
This is the electricity bill for June 2018.

75
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,280
Chris didn't know me then.

76
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Wait

77
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:24,200
I traveled back to 2018, and I met Chris in 2019.

78
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,520
And Chris died in 2021.

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Or right now, nobody in Asgard knows me yet.

80
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,920
Then who is Black Boss?

81
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,600
Planning to live for free? You've been here for four months without paying, pack your bags now.

82
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Alright.

83
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,280
If I were to uncover the reasons behind Chris's death, it must be here, in Asgard.

84
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,120
Hey, don't the two of you go practice?

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,480
Practice what?

86
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,040
Do you still have to ask what practice?

87
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,720
Do top-tier folks like us still need to practice?

88
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,920
Oh, you're a braggart. I saw the show, there were two of you in the wrong queue.

89
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
You're overacting.

90
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Just go practice.

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,080
She doesn't know her job.

92
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
I think she's stressed.

93
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,680
We're not open yet.

94
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
Um, I, uh

95
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,840
Ah, You're here to apply for a job.

96
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,080
Stop hesitating. You seem to have a good physique and appearance.

97
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,560
Yes, Piak.

98
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,040
Oh, you're familiar with my name.

99
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
You've done your homework.

100
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Let's see who's here.

101
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,840
Come here, please guide our new friend on the job.

102
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I'll need to settle the bill now.

103
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,000
Fill him in on everything, but hold off on letting him welcome our VIPs for now.

104
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
By the way, what's your name?

105
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm Ta.

106
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,280
Alright, Ta. Chris, take care of him.

107
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,040
Copy that

108
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
It's you again? You're not giving up, huh?

109
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,480
I'm not following you. I'm here to work.

110
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,520
See? I just got a job.

111
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,760
Hey

112
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,360
Thank you so much for today. Now, go about your business.

113
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,120
And as for you, come with me.

114
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,680
That area over there is the bar zone, designed for solo patrons.

115
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,560
This section is for regular customers, and the second floor is the VIP zone.

116
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,920
Have you ever worked at a host bar before?

117
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes, I have.

118
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,520
The main thing is to take care of the customers.

119
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,640
If a customer wants to dance, you have to dance with them.

120
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,280
If the customer feels like talking, you just gotta find the right words to chat with them.

121
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
Ah

122
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,200
There are a lot of customers here every day. Wanna know why?

123
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
Because we really know how to take care of our customers.

124
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,840
Our top hosts are Tee and Art, but they haven't arrived yet.

125
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,200
This is the VIP zone right here. You can't come up yet since you're a new host.

126
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,480
Let me hit you once.

127
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,800
What's with you?

128
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,040
That is my question.

129
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,840
She's asking you to learn about the job. What are you doing?

130
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
Well..

131
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Well?

132
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,520
Does Chris's face look like a dessert? You're gazing at him with sweet eyes.

133
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Seems like you're itching to devour him.

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm just listening to him explain about the job.

135
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
Don't tease him

136
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,600
By the way, what was I talking about?

137
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,280
Right, what were you talking about?

138
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,840
This is Park, Piak's brother.

139
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
He's also one of the top-tiers.

140
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,920
Every day, boys and girls gather to buy drinks just to be with him.

141
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,040
I can't help with that. I'm just too hot. Don't you think so?

142
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,880
But I gotta go. Rooting for you and the newbie.

143
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,720
Hold on, why are you in a hurry?

144
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,760
Hey! You came early today.

145
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,040
Of course I came early. I'm short on money lately.

146
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,760
This is a newcomer that Piak wants me to teach.

147
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
Aha? So you're new here?

148
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Where is Tee?

149
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,800
Is he not coming with you?

150
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,400
I don't know. I saw him holding stuff in his hands in front of the bar.

151
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Are you talking about me? I always know.

152
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,160
I'll have to go. Hey, Tee! Wait for me.

153
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,840
Try to observe others and follow them.

154
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,640
Understood

155
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,040
I'll catch you later.

156
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,440
Let's go

157
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm going with you.

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,920
Today, just focus on serving and observe others to see how they work.

159
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,200
On your first day, just doing this is enough.

160
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,800
Alright

161
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,960
That's the shower room, and here are the towel and clothes they've prepared for you.

162
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
Can I eat that?

163
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Why don't you ever buy them yourself?

164
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
There you go.

165
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
What are you guys doing? So annoying.

166
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,760
You're so noisy. I'm gonna eat these snacks.

167
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,400
Hurry up, I'm leaving.

168
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Chris, wait for me.

169
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,920
You guys can't fool me.

170
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
What a pity.

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,080
Shit

172
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
Sorry

173
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,240
How long will you keep making noise?

174
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,240
Can't you see I'm using the shower room?

175
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm sorry, other people just played a prank on me.

176
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,000
Looks quite good.

177
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,400
Hurry up and go back to work.

178
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,000
Let me borrow your towel.

179
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,120
Good evening.

180
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,520
Good evening. Oh, you're cute.

181
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,440
Is this your first day?

182
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Yes, my name is Ta.

183
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Hello, do you want some drinks?

184
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
Here you go.

185
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,560
How is it? Does it taste good?

186
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,080
What?

187
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,240
Hey!

188
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,640
What

189
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,120
Park!

190
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,080
What are you guys going to do?

191
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,280
Do you want to get hit, huh?

192
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
Stop!

193
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
It's a complete mess and chaos right now.

194
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,360
What kind of doomsday is this for me?

195
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,640
You guys are in the mood for a fight, why not head to the boxing stadium?

196
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,840
The fun's done for now.

197
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm Sorry.

198
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,600
Yes?

199
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Oh, no.

200
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,280
My name is Sorry, I'm not saying I'm sorry.

201
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,040
Why are you making that face? I'm just kidding.

202
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,480
As for the damages, I'll claim compensation, regardless of the amount.

203
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
I'll pay whatever amount you claim.

204
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,520
Especially you

205
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,960
Alright

206
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,200
Enough

207
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Come on, let's clean this up so we can get back. I'm getting a headache.

208
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm off, take care.

209
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,640
Goodbye

210
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,800
Bye bye

211
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm heading out. Goodbye, Piak.

212
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,840
You're going back too?

213
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,760
Yes

214
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,400
Alright, go home safely then.

215
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,160
Thank you so much.

216
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,040
You're eager to go back and meet your boy, huh?

217
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,400
My boy? I'm just feeling sleepy.

218
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
I saw him dropping you off.

219
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,480
Don't believe her, Piak.

220
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Okay, enough already.

221
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,520
I took care of all the customers at the front door.

222
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
It was real chaos.

223
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Also, I'm injured. See?

224
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm not sure if my handsome face is ruined or not.

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
Such a crybaby, the wound is as small as an ant bite.

226
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
I see no problem.

227
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
By the way, where is Chris? Did he already head home?

228
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I don't know.

229
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,120
I saw him briefly just now. He might be sending off VIP customers.

230
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,080
It's fortunate that the VIP customers didn't come downstairs today.

231
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Otherwise, it would've been a big deal.

232
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,480
Chris, how was today? Was everything okay in the VIP zone?

233
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes, everything was fine. The customers didn't complain, so there were no issues.

234
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,360
I'm glad to hear that.

235
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,800
How about your first day, Ta?

236
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
It was alright.

237
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
If you don't count the fact that I got punched.

238
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,240
How about your accommodation? Is it far from here?

239
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,840
Right! I haven't found one yet.

240
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
There are accommodations for everyone who works here.

241
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,520
There's the owner's building nearby. It's just a short distance away.

242
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
One room can accommodate two people.

243
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,000
But it seems like it's already full.

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,200
No, Park and Chris use the room alone.

245
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,440
I snore.

246
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,360
I grind my teeth.

247
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
I wet the bed.

248
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,200
I always rap in the middle of the night.

249
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,520
I do the Thai dance.

250
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
I also dance.

251
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,320
I dance all the time.

252
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
I like to preach.

253
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,520
What do you preach?

254
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,280
Didn't you say you knew Chris?

255
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,960
If you stay with him, you guys will become closer.

256
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,640
After work, you can return to your room and learn about the job from him privately.

257
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,400
It's so cute, don't you think so?

258
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,200
My room is messy.

259
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Super messy.

260
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll decide. Ta, stay with Chris so you can learn from him.

261
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Yes, correct.

262
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,480
Copy that.

263
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,520
And tomorrow, I'll let you welcome customers. You'll become a host.

264
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
Yes?

265
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,840
Why are you so surprised? I mean what I said.

266
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,280
Tomorrow?

267
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,920
Yes, be prepared.

268
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,560
Are you serious?

269
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
Do I look like I'm joking?

270
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm serious.

271
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,320
Right, does she look like she's joking?

272
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,600
You can change your mind. My room is a bit...

273
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,120
messy

274
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,360
Not a bit.

275
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,360
But it's fine. Just need a little touch.

276
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
You can put your stuff there.

277
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
Oh, you didn't bring anything.

278
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
Do you want to take a shower first?

279
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,640
Go ahead and take a shower first. I'd like to sit for a bit.

280
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,800
Make yourself at home.

281
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,560
Who is it?

282
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,520
She's pretty. So beautiful.

283
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,880
You're done?

284
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,120
You can take a shower now. I'll clean up the rest.

285
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Um, I don't think you'll have to.

286
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,320
Can I borrow your towel?

287
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,000
Sure

288
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,280
Make sure to dry it after using.

289
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,680
You can sleep wherever you want. I don't mind.

290
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,560
What? Why get on the bed?

291
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,040
Go sleep on the floor.

292
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,760
Oh? You told me to sleep wherever I wanted.

293
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,680
I wanted to sleep beside you.

294
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
Go sleep on the floor.

295
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,360
You said you don't mind.

296
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
I mind now.

297
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,400
Get off the bed.

298
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
But I don't mind.

299
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Go!

300
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,960
Sleep somewhere else.

301
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,600
Whoa, how sweet.

302
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,000
What's with you? Get off the bed.

303
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Alright, alright, I'll sleep on the floor.

304
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,640
You said you don't mind.

305
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,680
I'll sleep here, then.

306
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:23,600
I was tired from work and helped you tidy up.

307
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,920
The air conditioner also doesn't seem to work properly,

308
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,680
but you made me sleep on the floor.

309
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,880
Do I really have to be here, at a time when no one knew me?

310
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,760
I had to start over with a new job and meet new people.

311
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,000
What will I have to do tomorrow?

312
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
This is for that table.

313
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,600
Here's fish porridge.

314
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,280
What would you like to order?

315
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,840
Hello, what would you like to have?

316
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,360
Hello, what do you recommend?

317
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,600
I would recommend Chinese sausage fried rice, Pad Si Eiw, and American fried rice.

318
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,200
Okay, I'd like to have American fried rice.

319
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,000
With a fried egg on top. Wait

320
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,600
You don't have to make it super delicious. I'll feed them to the dog upstairs.

321
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,800
Noted.

322
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,640
Here's your American fried rice.

323
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Thank you. Keep the change. I'll leave a tip.

324
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,000
Thank you very much.

325
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,560
Do you really think I'll cook for you?

326
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,560
That boy.

327
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,240
You're up pretty late.

328
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,680
Did you make all of this by yourself?

329
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,680
Of course.

330
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,320
I even woke up early to go shopping.

331
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,160
Want to eat now? It won't be as tasty if it's not hot. I know you prefer it that way.

332
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,120
How do you know?

333
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
I mean

334
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Don't you prefer to eat it while it's still hot?

335
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
How do you..

336
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
Where did you buy it?

337
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,480
Well, there's a thing called 'internet'.

338
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,920
How do you know what I like to eat?

339
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, um, I'm a good guesser.

340
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,160
I can tell what you like or don't like to eat just by looking at your face.

341
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm serious. You told me you knew me before.

342
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
When was that?

343
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,160
If I told you

344
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm your boyfriend from the future

345
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,400
would you believe me?

346
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Are you nuts? Finish your meal quickly.

347
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll take you to shop what you need.

348
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,920
What do I need? I already bought them.

349
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,560
Did you buy your towel?

350
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,000
That's right. I forgot about my towel.

351
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,640
Right

352
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,800
Hurry up and finish your meal.

353
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,160
Hello

354
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm outside. I'm taking Ta to shop what he needs.

355
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,520
At Paradise. Wanna come?

356
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,880
You can come with us if you want to.

357
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,520
Why are you purchasing so much? I believe it should be sufficient by now.

358
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,800
I bought things for both of us so that we don't have to come here often.

359
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,320
Both of us?

360
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,600
I'm only allowing you to stay with me temporarily. I'm not permitting a long-term stay.

361
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,480
Hello, welcome to RYU, proudly made in Thailand.

362
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,320
This is RYU snail cleansing foam.

363
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,840
Chris, which cleansing foam do you think is better?

364
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,320
Either one is fine. Sometimes, I even use only water to wash my face.

365
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,280
They're not the same. Look at this one.

366
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,200
It is very good for your skin.

367
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,720
In addition to helping clean dirt on the face, it also nourishes the facial skin.

368
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,560
My facial skin is sensitive, that's why I don't use cleansing products.

369
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,120
Please read the label.

370
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,240
It says it's suitable for all skin types.

371
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,920
It also helps in exfoliating skin cells.

372
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,720
You talk too much. If you want to buy it, just buy it.

373
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,320
Customers, there's no need to argue.

374
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,920
Washing your face with water isn't thorough enough. This foam draws out dirt and leaves it clean.

375
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,080
See? Listen to her.

376
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Mama, please don't pout.

377
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,720
Welcome to the beauty booth of the Seladon brand.

378
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Interested in trying the serum? This one is called Seladon Hyaluron Serum Glow Booster.

379
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,080
Mama, you should try.

380
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,920
You'll look like you're in your 20s.

381
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,520
You'll be gorgeous.

382
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:50,400
Are you gonna grab it? If not, and customers start calling you Uncle, I won't be pitching in.

383
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
How dare you?

384
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,560
Dear customers, please refrain from arguing.

385
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:06,320
This specific product, endorsed by the Dermatology Research Institute from Korea, is suitable for sensitive skin.

386
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
You should totally get it to wash your mouth.

387
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
It might smooth out that rough way you talk.

388
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,680
Why does my mouth have to be smooth?

389
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:26,280
Because when I..

390
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,240
Stop it. It's getting dirty now.

391
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,640
I want this one, two of these and also this one.

392
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,120
Sure, I'll take care of that for you.

393
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,120
Chris, I'm here. Am I quick?

394
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Have you eaten?

395
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm starving. My stomach hurts. Let's go grab something to eat.

396
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
It's on me. That place, let's go.

397
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,440
Okay

398
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,120
Yeah

399
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,880
I want to eat.. uh

400
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,960
I'll be right back. Let me run to the toilet.

401
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,560
Hello, Piak.

402
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Yes, there's a problem? Okay.

403
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,000
Piak wants me to be there. I can't go with you now. Catch you later.

404
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,840
What the hell?

405
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,080
Are you interested in trying it out? Feel free to test it on your hands.

406
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
How does it feel? Is it good?

407
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,080
How is it?

408
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,120
It smells nice.

409
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,560
I'd like to purchase two sets of each.

410
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,480
Certainly, please assist madam with two sets each.

411
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,360
Mama, I need to use the restroom.

412
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,680
That is Bew. Where is he going?

413
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,760
Hey! Can I go with you.

414
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,040
No, what's wrong with you?

415
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,200
Please, it would be a big issue if you don't let me go with you.

416
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,120
Please

417
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,680
Please

418
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,520
Get on the bike.

419
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,160
Quickly

420
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,720
Hurry up!

421
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
Mama

422
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,760
Oh, my beautiful Jilly.

423
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,360
Hello

424
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,240
Did you finish your figure skate exercise?

425
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,760
Yes

426
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,440
Where is Bew.

427
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,640
Bew went to the toilet. He'll be back soon. Please wait a little bit.

428
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,400
But I just saw him took a motorcycle.

429
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Took a motorcycle? To where?

430
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,800
I have no idea. I saw him go with a handsome boy.

431
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,560
Why didn't you stop him?

432
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,360
This child.

433
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,320
Madam, Bew has run away again.

434
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,800
I know, why don't you go after him? Go find him now!

435
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,280
May I ask who will be taking you home, then?

436
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,520
That's true. Then, please locate him after you've taken me home.

437
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,120
Can't you just let him go, Mama? He might desire some freedom.

438
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,120
I'm sure he will come back.

439
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,320
Jilly, you haven't seen him since you came back. I remember you mentioned that you missed him.

440
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,280
That's fine. I will meet him eventually.

441
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,240
Why did you stop?

442
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,440
Get off.

443
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,640
Right here?

444
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,520
Where are you heading? Can I come along with you?

445
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,000
Hey, could you hop off my bike? I'm running late for work.

446
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,880
Every time I run into you, something always goes wrong.

447
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Do you mean the bar yesterday?

448
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,000
Right? Please take me there, too. I'm begging.

449
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,720
Please, I'm begging.

450
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,240
Stop bothering me.

451
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,280
So that I can make up for last night's damages.

452
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,080
Please, just let me talk to the bar's owner.

453
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,240
Ugh!

454
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,080
I'm doing for Piak's sake.

455
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,080
Darn you.
