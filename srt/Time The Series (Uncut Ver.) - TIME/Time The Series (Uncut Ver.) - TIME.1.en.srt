1
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,440
Hey!

2
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,360
Hey!

3
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,560
Chris, why did you get caught up?

4
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,160
I'll be back. It won't take long. Just prepare
the food, and I'll take charge of Back Boss.

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Get in the car!

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Chris! Chris!
Chris! Chris! Chris!

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,500
"Time The Series"
(Episode 1)

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,120
Chris!

9
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:03,160
ðŸŽ¶ Being able to see you and your smile
makes me feel good insideðŸŽ¶

10
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:13,200
ðŸŽ¶ Don't smile at me like that cause it will
make my heart flutter. Whenever I'm near you ðŸŽ¶

11
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,828
You're actually good at
singing. You can become an

12
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:19,240
actor or a singer like
you've always wanted to be.

13
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,800
If I ever get into the
entertainment world,

14
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,920
you have to be there to support me.

15
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,640
I have my own work to do.

16
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:46,560
Even when we're not together,
we're always in each other's hearts.

17
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:55,160
All I ask is that you be there for me
to think of. That's good enough for me.

18
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,480
Hello, Foam is not answering
my phone calls. What should I do?

19
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,068
Hurry up and go upstairs!
Open his room with the

20
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:07,680
key card I gave you.
Bring him here right away!

21
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
Alright.

22
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
That dude, Foam.

23
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,440
Trouble comes day in,
day out. I'm going nuts!

24
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,800
What's wrong? Why are you so pissed?

25
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,400
Foam sleeps away and
does not show up to work.

26
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,480
What do you think? I had to go around
begging everyone for him to get those works.

27
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,920
And now that he's a little bit more famous,
he's behaving like this instead of raking in.

28
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,360
But you already knew Foam doesn't want to
do this kind of work anymore, didn't you?

29
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,148
If taking care of Foam is
already a big problem for you,

30
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,960
would you mind sending
him to me? I'll take care of him.

31
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
Will he let you do so?

32
00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:01,240
If he won't let me now, it won't be
long. I'll make him. Wait and see.

33
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Bullshit.

34
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,480
Look how late it has gotten!
And he's still not showing up.

35
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
The next queue is Sosie's.

36
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,040
Where did she go? She was right here.

37
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Yogurt, go find her.

38
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,320
Hurry up!

39
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,160
Foam.

40
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,440
Foam! Wake up! Foam!

41
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,920
You're such a wimp.

42
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
You're drunk again, aren't you?

43
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
You're being irresponsible.

44
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,868
You've had so many jobs
cancelled that you're basically

45
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:51,640
out of jobs, and you're
continuing to behave like this?

46
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Can I not go today? Tell
them they can take my role out.

47
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,080
You can't. Boo will have my head.
The whole crew is waiting on you.

48
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,320
Get up! Quick!

49
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Alright, I already got up.

50
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,800
Has he arrived yet?

51
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
He hasn't, Nick.

52
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,080
What time is it now? Go get him real quick!

53
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,760
Oh? When did you come?

54
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,320
Please wait for a little bit more. He's
coming. It might take around 30 minutes.

55
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,028
Do you know what time is
it now? If he doesn't show

56
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:41,280
up in 30 minutes, I'll
have to adjust the script.

57
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,480
Sorry everyone. I'm sorry.

58
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Foam.

59
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,360
Say sorry to everyone.

60
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Go get ready.

62
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,680
Wow, amazing!

63
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,200
Is there no one educating the company's
actors on what it is to be responsible?

64
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,160
Look, other people have to wait for him. That
was such a waste of time. How ridiculous.

65
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
Disgusting.

66
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,240
He only plays a supporting part.

67
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
That's so unprofessional.

68
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,624
You went all out
last night, didn't you?

69
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:38,120
Next time, let me know.
So you're not getting lonely.

70
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,838
Don't turn a blind eye.
Anyway, we entered this

71
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:48,680
industry together as partners.
Shouldn't we be together?

72
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:52,640
I know there's a problem.
But if there's anything I can

73
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:55,792
help with, please tell me.
I'll tell my mother for you.

74
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,160
But... there has to be
something in exchange.

75
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,120
Thanks, but no thanks.

76
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,200
What happened?

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Nothing.

78
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,040
Camera ready! Speed! Action!

79
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,920
- Sorry, I can't remember my line.
- Cut!

80
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,480
Foam, why can't you just speak?

81
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Oh God! Give him the script.

82
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,520
Everything is doomed.
Are you sure you can handle it?

83
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,320
It appears to me that your standard for
developing an artist is falling every single day.

84
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,800
Excuse me, director.

85
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,040
Do we have a dog barking
scene for today's shoot?

86
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,040
Ahh-wooo. It's actually dog howling scene.

87
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,960
If you're ready, we'll
start shooting. Action!

88
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,360
What do I say again?

89
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,240
Hey, what's wrong with you?

90
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,120
We've been over this 2
times already. Oh my lord..

91
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:45,525
Oh, wait a second, Thien
and Korn are only available

92
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:49,400
till 4:00 p.m. Because
they'll be attending an event.

93
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,880
And if there is a shooting delay,
I will not extend the time for you.

94
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,040
Shoot as much as you can, and that's it.

95
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,000
Because actually I've already informed you
about the time in advance.

96
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Yes, within the time frame given.

97
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay, oh? There's not much time left

98
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm in hurry.

99
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,720
You must pay attention, Foam.
It's as simple as that. You've got this.

100
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,920
You and me, we've been
through a lot together.

101
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm always by your side.

102
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
But for today's work, you must
concentrate and do it properly.

103
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,160
Then take out all the trash in your
head and throw it away, and be mindful.

104
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,880
And mark my words, "you can do it."

105
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,720
I got it.

106
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,160
Could I please speak
with Foam for a moment?

107
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,040
Foam, I'd like to go over the details of the
new product so you have a better understanding.

108
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,800
So, Avila Hybrid Collagen. Once absorbed by
the body, it can be absorbed up to three times.

109
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,640
Yes, and it also helps to maintain our
skin healthy. Soft, smooth, and clear too.

110
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,520
So If anyone buys it for you,
it shows that they care for you a lot.

111
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,440
Exactly. I'll leave it to you.

112
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

113
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,160
Camera, Speed and action!

114
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,640
Take care of yourself.

115
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Thank you for your concern.

116
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,920
My boyfriend is concerned
for everyone like this.

117
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,000
Cut.

118
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,320
You have to go home by yourself today. Boo
had already left for another filming location.

119
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,480
Got it. Oh, don't forget, it's
my birthday party tonight.

120
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,600
Boo already told me. I was thinking
about changing into a new outfit.

121
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,560
But you understand me, right?
I just don't want to be alone.

122
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,360
I understand, but you really do party a
lot. You don't even have that many friends.

123
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,520
If Boo and I don't go, is
there anyone else going?

124
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
I gotta go.

125
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
See ya.

126
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,440
- Hello, Mum.
- Hello, dear.

127
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,560
Mum, It's my birthday today.
Please wish me a happy birthday.

128
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,960
Thanks, mum. I miss you.

129
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,040
I love you so much.

130
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,880
I've got to go. I'll call you later.

131
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,200
Okay.

132
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,548
Look, He looks so worn
out, he's down on his luck,

133
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:57,160
he ain't got nothing,
but... so handsome, so hot.

134
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,600
- Hello everyone, happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

135
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,520
Foam, do you dare to take off your pants?
If you dare, I'll give you 2,000 baht.

136
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:18,600
- It's 2,000!
- Take it off!

137
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,560
Everyone, stop! He's a national husband,
if it's not 100,000,

138
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,720
you won't be able see anything.

139
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:39,920
As for Nenie, let alone 100,000, you won't
get anything even if you paid a million.

140
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,776
Awww, You know what? I
am capable of it, no matter how

141
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,880
many millions I have to
pay. Do you understand why?

142
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,760
Because my father is rich. As for poor
people like you, let me ask you a question.

143
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,788
How many lifetimes do
you have to work before you

144
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:08,120
can afford to spend even
a fraction of my money?

145
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,165
You can therefore
sit foolishly and cease

146
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,640
pretending once you
realize that you are poor.

147
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,080
You're the one who should stop pretending.

148
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,952
Foam has already got his
lover. And even though his

149
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:26,000
lover has died, the feelings
still linger in his heart.

150
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,280
And for your information, there are
people prettier and richer than you

151
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,520
but they couldn't touch Foam even a bit.

152
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:47,200
A girl like me, she must and
will get whatever she wants.

153
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,720
Just wait and see.

154
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,200
I'll wait and see. And you should wake up
and smell the coffee.

155
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
Give Foam the booze.
Then do everything I say.

156
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,680
Continue having fun, guys.

157
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,360
Happy Birthday!

158
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,800
Cheers!

159
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,160
One more sip.

160
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,680
Cheers!

161
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,280
- Sweet!
- Oh snap!

162
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,880
- Go! Go! Don't stop!
- I'll get up.

163
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Let's just stand up!

164
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,880
Be careful; it looks like you're drunk now.

165
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,640
How annoying.

166
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,040
We ran out of booze.

167
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Then go buy some. I'll give you money.

168
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,160
What are you complaining about?

169
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,320
Nothing. I said, I can walk for a little bit
and I'll be there. OK, I'll be right back.

170
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,080
You guys can leave.
And make sure you don't let anyone in.

171
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,720
Miss, yes. So, can we go to the restroom?

172
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,000
Go where you want to.

173
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,920
Nenie, you bitch! What
the hell are you doing?

174
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,760
- Foam! Foam!
- Boo.

175
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,680
Don't bother me, okay?

176
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,840
I have to bother with this matter!
Because I'm taking care of Foam.

177
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,240
Taking care? He can't work for you. He can't bring you money.
Why would you bother keeping him with you?

178
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:15,193
Send him to me. I'll take
care of him. Or are you

179
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:20,145
hesitating? Because you
want to increase his pay.

180
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
I can pay more.

181
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,720
You shut your mouth. Even though now
he doesn't make me money like before.

182
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,040
But I have to look after him because I
consider him to be my younger brother.

183
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:46,360
Keep in mind that he and I started off together.
I must take care of it. I can't abandon him.

184
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,160
Now, you act like a good person.

185
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,793
Normally, in your head,
there's only money, money,

186
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:56,400
money, money, money,
and money or am I wrong?

187
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,528
So did you forget? That
you two made it this far. It's

188
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:04,680
because of me that I begged
my father to support you.

189
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,960
It is, indeed, your father's money.

190
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,809
If it weren't for your father's
money? I would never introduce

191
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,920
a woman with a terrible
reputation into the industry!

192
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,160
Shut your mouth!

193
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Shut the fuck up!

194
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,440
Did you dare to slap me?
Is your crazy behavior back?

195
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,480
No, I'm not crazy. I'm not insane;
all I've done is because I love Foam.

196
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,360
I love Foam, really. I'm not insane.
I did everything because I love Foam.

197
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Shut up! Crazy bitch.

198
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,200
I'll call your father right now.
That I can't control your madness anymore.

199
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:04,280
No, Boo. I don't want it, I don't you want
to call dad. No, please, I'm begging you.

200
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,840
You don't want me to?

201
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,280
- Bitch!
- Stop it!

202
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Stop it! You bastard! Stop!

203
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,160
Bastard?

204
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,920
Miss, calm down. I'll handle
everything myself. You remain still.

205
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,600
I didn't do it. I haven't done anything.
I'm not the one who did this.

206
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,680
You look naive and innocent.
You're surprisingly a strong drinker.

207
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,360
- Where is Boo?
- Don't know.

208
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,960
You come find Boo with me.
She must passed out somewhere. Go!

209
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,400
Go where?

210
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,720
Boo?

211
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,560
Boo!

212
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,000
What exactly happened?

213
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,960
Boo!

214
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,360
Who did this to you? Boo, wake up!

215
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,840
Oh no! Boo!

216
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Who did this to Boo?

217
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,800
- Someone please call the ambulance!
- Foam, what happened?

218
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,160
Can you please call the police?

219
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,560
- Boo! Please wake up!
- What should we do?

220
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,160
- Who did it?
- Not me!

221
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:17,720
Sosie, it wasn't me. I'm not sure
how those glasses ended up in my hands.

222
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,800
I can't recall anything.
I saw Boo's like that after waking up.

223
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,080
You calm down first
and slowly think about what happened.

224
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,680
Audi is currently directing unrelated people to
go home first, but the cops will be here soon.

225
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,680
The cops?

226
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,280
Okay, then I'll go get you some water
and vitamins to help you feel better.

227
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,440
You'll get sober.

228
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Where did Foam go?

229
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm not sure either. I just
went to get some water.

230
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,280
I told you to watch him. If he's really
innocent, why would he try to leave?

231
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I said I don't know.

232
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,600
20 inform 0.

233
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,920
There is a suspect fleeing at 24. The
incident occurred in the Sukhumvit area.

234
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,488
Notify all units to set up
interception points. And notify

235
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:55,080
the direct line 15 in the
surrounding area urgently. Over.

236
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,640
What are you doing here? Do you want
to go take some rest in my room first?

237
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,120
Thank you.

238
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,280
That watch looks like the
one I once bought for a friend.

239
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,080
This watch?

240
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,600
That friend must mean a lot to you.

241
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Yes, he is the one I love.
He made a sacrifice for me.

242
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,440
Even though he isn't with
me today, I miss him dearly.

243
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,080
However, seeing this watch
made me miss him even more.

244
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,520
Having someone for us to miss.

245
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,040
It's a good thing.

246
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,440
However, their heart is always by our side.

247
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,720
Chris!

248
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,760
It really is you, Chris!

249
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,040
Do you realize how much I miss you? Do you have
any idea how long I've been waiting for you?

250
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,487
I'm waiting for the day I'll see you again.

251
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,040
Am I still dreaming?

252
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:48,480
But... why does the room look like
when I was still working with Hia Moo?

253
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:15,560
No, I must wake up now and find the
truth about the cause of Boo's death.

254
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,960
Ouch!

255
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,040
What the..

256
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,000
- Have you seen the news?
- What news?

257
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,680
Junior football team that stuck inside the
cave for 17 days. They were all rescued.

258
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,840
(B.C. 2561 (2018))

259
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,200
(5 years before Chirs died)
