1
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,040
Check out what's on this flash drive.

2
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,360
Fascinating. Let me put my abilities to the test.

3
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,160
Let's see, what hidden information does it conceal?

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,880
No way it's getting past me. See? I'm still sharp as ever.

5
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
What virus is going around now?

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Darn it!

7
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
The information inside is interesting.

8
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
Interesting?

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,680
What are you guys doing?

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,240
Nothing

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,120
I just came to take Tar out to eat.

12
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
You seem kind of suspicious, don't you think?

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
We just talk about eating.

14
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
There's nothing fishy going on.

15
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,880
Everything's normal.

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,480
Nothing happened

17
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,600
Chris is on his way back, so I'm inviting you to join me at the restaurant to wait for him.

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
Okay

19
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,960
Let's go.

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,720
Let's go

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
Wait a little.

22
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,120
Where are you going?

23
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll go change real quick.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,720
Why?

25
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,480
I just finished working out. It's hot. Are you guys planning to wear this outside?

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,320
You guys also should change your clothes.

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Do you think he's acting a bit weird?

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,760
You're weird.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Are you asking for fights?

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,320
Oh, you're asking for it, huh?

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,320
I assure you won't be tired for no reasons.

32
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
What are they talking about?

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm fully committed to helping as much as possible.

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,240
That's why I trust you.

35
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm interested in pursuing significant investment opportunities with Nenie's father. Could you lend a hand with the discussion with her?

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,280
Sure! I'll call her right away.

37
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Nenie, about the investment we've talked about...

38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,880
I've decided to cancel all arrangements. There will be no further collaborations.

39
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,080
Nenie, calm down.

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,160
I refuse to collaborate with someone like Thientot who shows no respect for me whatsoever.

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,040
I'll discuss this matter with Ms. Pareenawee. Please remain calm for the time being.

42
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,320
Thientot might not be comfortable around strangers yet, so just relax.

43
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,200
I don't care. No matter what, you have to choose between me and Pareenawee.

44
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,440
What did she say about Thientot? Why did she insult my son like that? You need to negotiate with her for me.

45
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,680
Otherwise, everyone will have to handle it individually.

46
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Ms. Pareenawee, please try to stay calm.

47
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,080
Park, how was last night welcoming the VIPs?

48
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,920
I don't want to talk about work now, I'm hungry. This is my regular table, I reserved it.

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,880
Come on.

50
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
What should we eat?

51
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,720
The same as usual? Crispy Pork?

52
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,200
This boy is the one who will make me great again.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
Can I sit with you?

54
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
Sure

55
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,440
I have something to discuss with you. Are you perhaps interested in pursuing acting?

56
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
Acting? My friend?

57
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes

58
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,480
Your friend is destined to become the next number one superstar.

59
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,680
Are you Boo, a customer at our host bar?

60
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,800
Are you guys hosts?

61
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,720
Yes, we are. I am Tar. These are my close friends.

62
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,080
That's fine. Whether you're hosts or not, it doesn't matter to me.

63
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,400
Here's my business card. Don't forget to get in touch with me.

64
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
I promise I can make you famous.

65
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
I believe in you. I know you can help me clear my past.

66
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Let me see.

67
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,840
Really? Is Tar going to be an actor?

68
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,040
Wow, in the flesh. Famous star.

69
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,360
That's why it feels familiar.

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,520
Chris!

71
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:18,560
Chris, you're late. Just now, Boo, a famous celebrity manager contacted Tar about becoming an actor.

72
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
Really?

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,480
Really, we might become friends with a celebrity.

74
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,440
He's a famous person now.

75
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm the next.

76
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,195
No doubt! Rolling in money!

77
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Oh? Boo.

78
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
Nokkaew?

79
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:52,120
You seem happy, calling me by my full name.

80
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,160
What are you doing here.

81
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:07,600
Of course, I'm here for the food. But today's extra special because I made a big connection.

82
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,840
What connection?

83
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,080
First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to you.

84
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:27,280
Since you're having trouble keeping customers, I'll handle them for you.

85
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
Ms. Pareenawee?

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,440
Yes, ms. Pareenawee.

87
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,520
By the way, I'll have to thank you once more.

88
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:48,600
Nokkaew! Your stubbornness runs deep, it's rooted so firmly that it's unlikely to ever change.

89
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,280
Yes, stubbornness. I'm just as stubborn as you are. It's like the pot calling the kettle black.

90
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,840
I'm just imitating you because I've been your emotional crutch and sidekick for years.

91
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,400
But I never taught you to act like this. You talked to my customer without even letting me know.

92
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Moreover, you even took my boys and opened a modeling company to compete with me. Someone like you will never succeed.

93
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,120
Everyone has to grow up, don't they?

94
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,400
You should take a look at yourself first. You seem like a former model past its prime.

95
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,240
I have no idea when you're going to get back on your feet.

96
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
Keep laughing, then.

97
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:46,680
I'll ensure my boys succeed, and I'll make sure to flaunt that success in your face.

98
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:54,480
Oh my gosh, I already did my makeup just for this. But you have to hurry up.

99
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,640
Because I'm worried you'll kick the bucket before we even get there.

100
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,960
I've been to too many funerals of people who spoke like that to me.

101
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,600
I've been to too many funerals of people who spoke like that to me.

102
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,920
Before heading to any more funerals, you might want to dye your hair first. It's all white.

103
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
Darn it! Park!

104
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,920
Chris

105
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,240
Shit! Who did it?

106
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,946
(Where is the data?)

107
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
What information?

108
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,238
(Probably it's your friends.)

109
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,200
What the heck?

110
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
Bew, what kind of information did you get?

111
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,080
Nothing

112
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,040
I asked if you went to deceive to get the info, didn't you?

113
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,800
Hey! Take it easy!

114
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,400
Tell me the truth.

115
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,960
Chris, what kind of situation is this?

116
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,480
Just go ask him.

117
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,600
The information is with Tar.

118
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,000
Tar, why aren't you picking up my phone?

119
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm concerned about you, you know?

120
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
Tar!

121
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,440
Chris, have you finished moving stuff yet, or are you still at it? Why are you just sitting there?

122
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,520
If you're done, hurry up and go. Auntie Orn is waiting, so go quickly.

123
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,920
I have to go now.

124
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Can you not go?

125
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
I have to go live with my dad.

126
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,200
But as we grow up, we'll meet again someday.

127
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,400
I promise I won't leave you again, that's for sure.

128
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,720
You promised.

129
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes.

130
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,920
Chris

131
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,680
I love you, Chris.

132
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,320
I know.

133
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Bye

134
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
yes, boss.

135
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,960
I'm here, boos. My friend isn't involved in this matter. The flash drive is here.

136
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm ready to work with you again.

137
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,480
Copy that, boss.

138
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey

139
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,200
Have you seen Tar?

140
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
No

141
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,080
Do you think something is going to happen?

142
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,680
What's going on? My room has been vandalized and everything is scattered everywhere.

143
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,240
When I attempted to report it to the police, you stopped me.

144
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm not quite sure what's going on yet, but it's probably best to keep some distance from me for now.

145
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,320
Oh, do you all have something to hide from me? Are you mysterious human beings or something?

146
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
Just believe me

147
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:07,280
Oh, are you involved in football gambling? Is there a creditor coming to collect debts?

148
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Are you crazy?

149
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Please tell me. I'm too confused.

150
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,080
That's just part of adolescence. Falling in and out of love is a common experience.

151
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,400
How do you know what I'm sad about?

152
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,960
Look at you. A sad expression like that usually indicates it's about matters of the heart.

153
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,080
But I'm also sad when I'm broke.

154
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,960
That's a different story. But if you're looking to make some money, consider joining me in the industry.

155
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:14,160
I'll help you start fresh completely, even change your name as well. What name do you think would suit you?

156
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,640
How about..

157
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,520
Foam?

158
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,880
Right? Foam Napasanat.

159
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,280
Why did you guess what I was thinking correctly?

160
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,680
Did you visit a fortune-teller who told you that this name would make you famous in the industry again, right?

161
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,320
Are you also a fortune-teller or what?

162
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,640
Can I take it into consideration first?

163
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,080
I feel like I'm not ready yet.

164
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, thank you so much, Boo, for inviting me and helping me in many ways.

165
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
By the way, let me stay with you for a little while.

166
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:09,960
No problem, but you'll have to take acting classes for me.

167
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,360
Sure, I will.

168
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,320
I have a job to offer.

169
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
What job?

170
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,800
I want you two to keep an eye on Chris and his friends.

171
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:47,160
The job's kinda risky, and I'm worried the pay might not be worth it.

172
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,880
You'll definitely get good pay.

173
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
Who's guaranteeing that?

174
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:03,520
I want you guys to keep an eye on that guy, Tar. I have a feeling there's something off about him. He's been way too curious.

175
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,920
Yeah, exactly. I'm beginning to have suspicions about him as well.

176
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,240
But the most suspicious person is Bew. He's been working for only a few days, and now he's already in the VIP zone.

177
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,640
We've been working for months but we're still not allowed there.

178
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:24,760
Alright, we're counting on you. If there's anything, report to us quickly. I guarantee we'll reward handsomely.

179
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,480
Bew, why are you sneaking around?

180
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,880
Hey

181
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,360
You seem quite impatient. Can you wait for us to return to our room first?

182
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,120
Bathroom? Interesting

183
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,520
What's the matter with you? You're being quite annoying, you know?

184
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,560
You're leaving?

185
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,040
Hey, what's up with Chris? He's been drunk a lot lately.

186
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,400
You don't have to care about him

187
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,600
You should care about us.

188
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you mean me and you?

189
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,080
You want?

190
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,920
Can I?

191
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,080
Are you back? Are we good now? You're not mad at me, are you?

192
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
Chris

193
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:07,000
"Are you back? Are we good now?" What's got you so wasted? You can't even handle yourself, let alone someone coming back to you. Just saying.

194
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,720
Leave me alone!

195
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:23,920
If I had left you, you head might have hit the ground already, Chris.

196
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,760
Um

197
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,840
You owe me a lot.

198
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,640
What's wrong with him? I haven't seen him like this before.

199
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,800
I don't know. You should thank me, Chris.

200
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,520
Can I have more? I want to be drunk.

201
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,920
Are you not drunk enough?

202
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,560
Look at you.

203
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,640
Chris

204
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,120
Chris

205
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,600
I'm having a hard time again. It happens every time.

206
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,680
How much does he weigh?

207
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,840
Let's dance together 5, 6, 7, 8.

208
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:45,360
Start here 1 and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, step 7 and turn 8, hands down. One more time.

209
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
Alright

210
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:15,480
Wait, wait, wait. Focus more on it, Foam. Because everything you have to learn today is your future. It's your reputation.

211
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,360
If you want to have it, you have to concentrate more than this.

212
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,400
Got it

213
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
Try again

214
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,120
Alright everyone, let's give it another try. Mr. Foam, please stay focused. Let's begin.

215
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,240
Hello everyone, welcome to the acting and personality development class.

216
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,880
Foam, please demonstrate your walking to your friends.

217
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,320
It's still not smooth. Try again.

218
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,560
Alright

219
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Be serious.

220
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,080
If you're still not taking this seriously, I'll reprimand you now. Focus and do it again.

221
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,080
1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8

222
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,440
Walk again. You can do it. Stay focused.

223
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,560
If alcohol runs out, there's more here. I've set some aside.

224
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't go drinking the alcohol customers left behind.

225
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,640
I know

226
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,120
What's up with him lately? He's been drunk every day.

227
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,360
He's been like this ever since Tar hasn't shown up to work.

228
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,600
Or...

229
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,680
There's definitely something going on behind the scenes.

230
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm off.

231
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,720
Look at you.

232
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,840
Why do you keep drinking?

233
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,280
Just go find Tar.

234
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,160
I can't bear seeing you in this condition anymore.

235
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,000
I told you to leave me alone.

236
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,720
I just don't want you to get into trouble, you understand?

237
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,520
What kind of trouble? All I see is you hurting yourself.

238
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,880
You should calm down and start addressing the issue.

239
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,560
And that's up to you. If you want to drink yourself to death, it's your choice.

240
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,520
Hey

241
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
Eat again?

242
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm hungry

243
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,560
Can't I go take a rest.

244
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,400
I'm hungry. We can go eat over there. It's just opened not so long ago. They said the food is great. Let's go.

245
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,040
You're always quick to hear about new places to eat.

246
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,360
Quickly, so we can rest.

247
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,040
Tar? Where have you been missing for days?

248
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,440
Do you ever realize you've made everyone worried?

249
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,720
Chris has been out of sorts since you disappeared.

250
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
He said he didn't want me to come here.

251
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,600
You know he's just putting up a tough front, saying things that don't reflect what's in his heart.

252
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,520
You'll never know what else he said to me.

253
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,760
Yes, I'll never know what you didn't tell me.

254
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,480
Never mind. By the way, is Piak here?

255
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,800
I'd like to talk to her about resigning.

256
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,760
You're resigning? If you're leaving, what are your plans?

257
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,400
Don't tell me you're going to become an actor?

258
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,640
Yeah

259
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,520
You're amazing.

260
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,480
That's my friend. I'm proud of you.

261
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,160
So, where is Piak?

262
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,440
She's inside. You can just go in.

263
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,640
Don't forget to go see Chris. He's not doing well at all.

264
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,200
Okay

265
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,240
How is he doing?

266
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,040
He seems to have made up his mind as well.

267
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,240
I've heard you've been drinking everyday.

268
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,360
Why are you back?

269
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,960
Everything is getting better.

270
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Getting better?

271
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Look at yourself now, do you think this is called getting better?

272
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
What is Tar doing?

273
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,520
It's my business. Why do you have to get involved?

274
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,240
Do you think I want to get involved?

275
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:35,560
I came to talk to Piak about resigning, so I can start over like you want.

276
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,360
Is this what you want?

277
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,560
Okay, just leave it here and go wherever you want to go.

278
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,800
I don't want to see your face.

279
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,960
I'll take care of the trouble myself.
