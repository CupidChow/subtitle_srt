1
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,320
Hey, where have you been? Lately, you've never been in our room.

2
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,240
I asked Boo to bring me here to pack my stuff.

3
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,520
Let's take our time and discuss things calmly. I want both of you to resolve this situation amicably.

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,400
Come here

5
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,920
Why drag me here when we could've just talked there?

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm not sure what's going on with you. Are you angry or just trying to push me away?

7
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:18,200
Ever since you mentioned wanting a child, do you realize how much it's hurt me? It's the one thing I couldn't give you.

8
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm most confident in one thing, and that's my love and care for you. No one can beat me in that.

9
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,640
Even after everything you've said to me, I've never been angry with you.

10
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,520
Can you go back to how you used to be? I'm asking for it.

11
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,320
And then what? Are you content with returning to the same life it used to be?

12
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm very content.

13
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,080
But when you said that to me,

14
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,440
it made me feel like a fool.

15
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,640
Honestly, I don't want to be separated from you at all.

16
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Even when I'm with Boo, I miss you every day.

17
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,000
But you don't care about me even a bit.

18
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Okay, I've changed.

19
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,240
Today, I want to tell you something.

20
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,600
I want you to know that my love for you grows stronger with each passing day.

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:14,160
Do you remember when I told you that I came back in time to change the past so you wouldn't die?

22
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
If I were to die, then what?

23
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,040
You'll never know.

24
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,520
You'll never understand the pain of witnessing your loved one's death before your eyes.

25
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
It made me not want to continue living.

26
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,920
However, I still have a chance to help you

27
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:56,480
Anyway, I'll do it because I want to see you happy, even if that happiness doesn't involve me.

28
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,720
Do you realize what you just said?

29
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,840
Yes, I do.

30
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Not only do you want me to have a good life, but I also want you to have a good life too.

31
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,360
I also didn't want it to turn out like this.

33
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
Never push me away again.

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,800
I just want to be with you. That's enough for me.

35
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,080
You've been quite the talker today.

36
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's go back to our room.

37
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
Hello, Boo.

38
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760
Hi

39
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,640
What are you doing here?

40
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm here to help Tar packing his stuff.

41
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,280
Because I'm planning to enroll him in a serious acting class.

42
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,240
Make him a superstar.

43
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,680
If you're taking Tar away, did you get permission from the owner?

44
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,720
They're clearing things up.

45
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Here they are, just in time. If you're done sorting things out, let's head out now.

46
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,280
Wait

47
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,240
Why?

48
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,360
Well, I don't think I can go with you now.

49
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,920
Why?

50
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,840
I'll stay here for now.  I'll get in touch with you again as soon as I can.

51
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm truly sorry, but I'll need to ask you to leave first today.

52
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:29,240
I understand, but please remember, good opportunities don't come around often.

53
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,880
You're the sweetest. Thank you, Boo.

54
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
Take care

55
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:55,640
My muscles are sore. It's confusing, he can take his stuff down but can't bring them back up.

56
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Why complain? Isn't it good that Tar stays?

57
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,000
It is. Chris has finally returned to his usual self.

58
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,880
Exactly! So they can finally be happy.

59
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,480
Like the two of us?

60
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,680
What do you mean?

61
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,920
You mentioned you'd handle the laundry today, correct? Could you please get started on it now?

62
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,960
Now you're enlisting me for household chores, huh?

63
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,360
No problem, I will do the laundry for you.

64
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,920
Also wash the dish you used last night.

65
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,320
If you finish, I'll have a big reward for you, okay?

66
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,200
You said it yourself, a big reward.

67
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes! a big reward.

68
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,640
I'll be eagerly waiting. I'll hurry up.

69
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Get the chores done quickly.

70
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,800
Big reward!

71
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Yeah

72
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Want some snacks?

73
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Yummy?

74
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Yeah

75
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Tar

76
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,920
I want to tell you something.

77
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,600
I really appreciate that you let me love you.

78
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
I appreciate every moment.

79
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,040
You're the best gift I've ever received.

80
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,440
Every moment spent with you is filled with happiness.

81
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,440
I love you a lot.

82
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,800
And I'm sorry.

83
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,880
for any wrongdoing I've done to you.

84
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,680
No need to apologize to me.

85
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:26,680
I have to thank you even more for choosing me and allowing me to be with you.

86
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,800
For us to be able to be together until now.

87
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm happy that I got to love you.

88
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I love you too.

89
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,800
You're naughty, aren't you?

90
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,920
Nah, you're naughtier.

91
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,400
No, I haven't been naughty.

92
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,560
Love you

93
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Love you too

94
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,520
Who's there? Tar?

95
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,400
I mean, I can explain, Mom.

96
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,120
Explain it, then.

97
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,680
Mom, I just want to live a regular life, you know, where I don't need constant pampering.

98
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,080
And one more thing, the people here are also very kind to me.

99
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,880
Especially Park, your roommate, right?

100
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,320
What gave it away?

101
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm your mother. I know everything about you.

102
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
You're not going to try to stop me, are you?

103
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,960
If I wanted to stop you, I could have just brought you back home already.

104
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,000
I mean Park and I.

105
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,320
I've experienced a lot at my age.

106
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,400
And I've noticed that you've matured a lot since you've been with him.

107
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,240
You have responsibilities now, and you don't spend all day playing games like you used to.

108
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,800
The important thing is that I see you happy, and that's all that matters to me.

109
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,400
Even though you're my only son.

110
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,480
Aw, mom. Don't cry.

111
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,200
I don't cry.

112
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,120
Why not think about adopting a kid or two?

113
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,920
A child or two?

114
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,720
Only one of you has already given me a headache.

115
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm a good boy now.

116
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm relieved. Oh, I almost forgot the reason I came today.

117
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:50,640
I came because I heard from inside sources that there's been a leak in the gray business, and it's related to your workplace.

118
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,480
Well, it was my fault.

119
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:05,480
Why did you get involved in such dangerous matters? Now that I've received this news, they're actively searching for the culprit.

120
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,240
I'm serious. I need to take you back today.

121
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:19,360
I can't go back right now. If you take me back now, my friends and others will be in trouble because of me.

122
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,440
Don't take me back just yet. I'm begging you.

123
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,840
Bew! That's a completely different matter.

124
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:37,680
Please, Mom, I'm begging you. I promise that if anything dangerous happens to me, I'll call you right away.

125
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Please let me stay here.

126
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:52,120
Bew, promise me that if you sense any risk or danger, you'll call me immediately.

127
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,720
I promise.

128
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,280
Did you finish washing dishes?

129
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,240
What's wrong? Why the sulking?

130
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm not sulking

131
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Then why aren't you smiling?

132
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,200
Smile like this. Can you smile brightly like this?

133
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Did she leave?

134
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,280
Yeah

135
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,160
Are you jealous?

136
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,400
Of course, I am.

137
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,400
I don't appreciate customers coming into our room like this. It's our private space, you get that, right?

138
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,640
Aw, it's okay.

139
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:05,880
She won't be coming here anymore, and I've already told her about us.

140
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,440
Really? Our secret won't be a secret anymore?

141
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,680
Between keeping the secret and keeping me, what do you choose?

142
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,360
I won't let you go anywhere.

143
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,080
By the way

144
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,040
I finished the chores.

145
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,480
Where is my big reward?

146
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Okay

147
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,880
Are you happy now?

148
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Do you think only that will make me happy?

149
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,600
Bew

150
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,480
Jilly?

151
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,360
I didn't mean to let mom know your address.

152
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,240
That's okay. I understand.

153
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,440
Is mom angry with you?

154
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,040
She is, but that's okay. I already explained everything to her, and now she understands.

155
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm sorry.

156
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
Why do you have to make a sad face like that?

157
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,360
My sister, please smile.

158
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,560
Thanks for not being angry with me.

159
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,800
How could I ever be angry with you? You're my only sister.

160
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,960
Then I wouldn't bother you anymore. I have an appointment.

161
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,280
An appointment?

162
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,800
Alright, enjoy your appointment.

163
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,200
How did it go talking to Bew? Are you feeling better now?

164
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,480
I'm feeling much better now. It's a relief that he's not upset with me or anything.

165
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,600
If that's all, then you should smile now. I've seen you making that pouting face for days.

166
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Do you know that you're cute when you smile?

167
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,840
Do I look cute when I smile like this now?

168
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,240
So, what's the conclusion? Are you going back to studying abroad?

169
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:12,840
I've decided to ask mom to come back and study in Thailand instead. I'm afraid people around here will miss me so much that it'll break their heart.

170
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,720
Who will miss you so much that it'll break their heart?

171
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,160
Then I'll go study abroad and never come back.

172
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:30,040
Just study here. If you go, I will miss you so much that it'll break my heart.

173
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,840
See? There really is someone who will miss me so much that it'll break their heart.

174
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,040
Chris

175
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,360
Chris? What's on your mind? You've been lost in thought for a while.

176
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm just thinking about the times when I was a kid.

177
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
Do you miss your mom again?

178
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:16,440
No, I'm just missing my dad. I'm pondering whether my life has truly moved beyond its beginning and is approaching its conclusion.

179
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,720
You came out of sudden and said I'm about to die.

180
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:31,000
You're not on the verge of dying. But in fact, you've already passed away. You died right before my eyes.

181
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,880
So, honestly, I feel like I'm still not living my life to the fullest. Am I really going to die?"

182
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,400
That's why fate brought me back to you.

183
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:55,560
I just want to be with you. Give you time to fix past mistakes.

184
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,920
And if I fail?

185
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:13,880
It's probably just a matter of fate. Time keeps moving forward, so we just have to make today the best we can. I won't let you walk alone.

186
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,480
Thanks for coming back.

187
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
What did you say?

188
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Thanks for coming back.

189
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,280
Again?

190
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,240
Thanks for coming back

191
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,800
What's that? I didn't quite catch it.

192
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,920
Thanks for coming back!

193
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,680
Clear enough?

194
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,760
It hurts my ear.

195
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,040
Serves you right.

196
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,400
Hi, do you want to go see Chris with us?

197
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Where is Chris?

198
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
Chris asked us to take you. He's right at the ice cream shop over there.

199
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,920
Please take me to him.

200
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,040
Let's go.

201
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
It seems like this watch has stopped working.

202
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Can I still travel in time?

203
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:11,040
But it's alright. Just being able to be here is enough for me.

204
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,120
I just hope I can help Chris.

205
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,760
What are mumbling about?

206
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,680
Nothing

207
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,320
By the way, you should be cautious these days.

208
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,520
It's about the time of your death.

209
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,680
The only person who can kill me is you.

210
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,280
Do you still feel like joking?

211
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,360
Wherelse can I go when you're stuck with me like this?

212
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,080
Have you stopped contacting black boss yet?

213
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,840
Let's get dressed.

214
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:19,960
Hey, are you still ignoring me? Seriously, Chris, I'm being serious.

215
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
Where is Chris?

216
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,040
I want to go to Chris.

217
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,920
We'll meet him soon.

218
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,200
Please take me to him.

219
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,720
I said "soon"

220
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,160
Do you understand?

221
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,520
I understand. I just want to see him.

222
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,680
I will go to find him.

223
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,320
You'll meet him soon. Don't cry.

224
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Understand?

225
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,120
Don't pout. Get dressed, I'll take you out for a meal.

226
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,280
Smile

227
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,000
Smile like this, you're adorable.

228
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,320
Hello

229
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,680
Hi Chris, there's been a major incident. Your niece is missing.

230
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,960
Where is she now?

231
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:54,640
Please help me. I don't know what to do now. Two men told her they would take her to see you.

232
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,720
Chris!

233
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,560
Calm down

234
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,240
How can I be calm now? My daughter is missing.

235
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,520
Take a deep breath. Chris will help you find her.

236
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,880
What happned?

237
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,520
My niece is being kidnapped.

238
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,760
Calm down first.

239
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,680
We can find her together.

240
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,600
Why is she crying nonstop like this?

241
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,000
You told me she would stop crying if she's tired.

242
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,840
Who would have known she would be this good at crying?

243
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Bring Chris here quickly before I go deaf.

244
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,280
Here

245
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,000
Chris, please come here.

246
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,720
Where are you now, Gorya?

247
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,440
I'm scared.

248
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,600
Can you tell me where are you?

249
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Gorya? Where are you now?

250
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,720
If you don't want any harm to come to your niece, come here quickly.

251
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,760
Bring the information as well. Last time you were quite cunning. You fooled us.

252
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,360
But this time, I won't let you. Your niece's life is in my hands.

253
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,960
How is it going? Where is your niece?

254
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,800
I have to go rescue her.

255
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,640
Wait, I'll go with you.

256
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,760
But it's dangerous and highly risky.

257
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,640
I don't want you to take the risk alone as well.

258
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,960
If you go, I go.

259
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,640
You're really stubborn.

260
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,280
Go

261
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,480
I told you to trust me.

262
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,800
Where are you guys rushing off to?

263
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,040
There's something going on. I'll tell you about it later.

264
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,960
Wait, what is going on?

265
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,560
Why are you in such a hurry?

266
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,920
If you want to find out, come with us and lend a hand.

267
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,520
Will you follow them?

268
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,640
It's not right here. What should we do?

269
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,520
We need to figure out how to get to the other side.

270
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,640
There's a bridge there.

271
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Let's go.

272
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,360
Stop here.

273
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,400
Hey

274
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,880
Yeah?

275
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,240
I think it's right here.

276
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,560
What are you waiting for?

277
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,440
Gorya!

278
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:51,880
Oh, you're here, Chris. I thought you'd come alone, but it seems you've brought your lover along too.

279
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,200
Shut up! And send my niece back.

280
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,400
Hey!

281
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Calm down, why the rush? Where's the information you downloaded?

282
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,480
It's Chris's motorcycle. Let's take a look.

283
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,560
We're right on time.

284
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,880
Okay, hurry up. Alright?

285
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,400
What are you doing? Why are you making a phone call now?

286
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,320
I called the emergency unit.

287
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,360
What emergency unit?

288
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,240
Trust me. You'll know when it's time.

289
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,720
Damn, that's really messed up. They arrested the kid as a scapegoat?

290
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,600
Right

291
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
It's here.

292
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,520
Take it.

293
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,320
Hey, send my niece back first.

294
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,600
I will, but I need to see the information inside first.

295
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Take it.

296
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,640
Gorya!

297
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,840
The information is authentic. There has been no duplication.

298
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,480
Yes, it should be like this. We need to be cautious. Got it?

299
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
When will you release my niece?

300
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,040
Chris, I'm scared.

301
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:48,720
You're safe now. You're the bravest, you know? Stay with my friends for now, and I'll take you home later.

302
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Hold on

303
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,760
You're done, aren't you?

304
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,320
Wait

305
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,520
We're not done yet. I've received an order from the boss.

306
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,600
Not just the information, but I'll have to take your life, too.

307
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,640
Who the hell are you?

308
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,200
That's cheating. Not cool at all.

309
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,720
Oh, what an eloquent bunch you all are. Liam, pick one.

310
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,320
I'll make your mouth shut.

311
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,400
One more time!

312
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:08,600
Oh, look who's ready to throw down! Anyone else itching for a fight? Come on, step up if you think you're tougher.

313
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,920
I am.

314
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,720
Get up!

315
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,480
Oh, so you want it this way?

316
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,160
I thought you were going to be cool

317
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,720
Chris, are you okay?

318
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,240
I'm okay.

319
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Chris!

320
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,920
I can't stand anymore. Pile on!

321
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,400
Who dares to mess with my child? Take them all.

322
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
Mom, you're here!

323
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Mom? Di you call this lady?

324
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,360
This lady? That's my mom.

325
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,080
Your mom's so cool.

326
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,560
What are you waiting for? Go to my mom. But wait!

327
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,000
Are you okay? Are you injured anywhere?

328
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,480
I'm okay.

329
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,880
I have a good caretaker.

330
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,600
That's a relief.

331
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:01,120
There's another car right in front. You come with me, it's safer to go separately.

332
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,600
Take care of your young master.

333
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,880
Roger that. Young master, this way.

334
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,480
Follow them

335
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,280
Quickly!

336
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,800
Bew!

337
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,440
Stop!

338
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:32,840
If you guys don't want to die, back off!

339
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,920
Go away!

340
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,680
Please go.

341
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,200
Where's the gun sound from?

342
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,880
Are you okay?

343
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,760
Chris

344
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,840
Chris

345
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,160
Sniper!

346
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,080
Damn, he saw me.

347
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,400
What should we do?

348
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,640
We better head to the car first. It's not safe for us to stay here any longer.

349
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,440
Okay, go.

350
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,000
Quickly! The car is here.

351
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,160
This way.

352
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,760
Game over

353
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
Chris! Watch out!

354
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
Tar!

355
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Did I miss?

356
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,360
Tar, are you okay?

357
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,480
Young master, get in the car.

358
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,000
Is he okay?

359
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,480
Be careful.

360
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,520
Tar, don't close your eyes.

361
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,280
Tar, why did you do that?

362
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:22,800
It's something I have to do. Chris, I finally know why I went back in time to the past.

363
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,440
I came here to save you.

364
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
But you don't have to do this much.

365
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,400
Let me do something for you, Chris.

366
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,400
Can you make a promise?

367
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,560
That you will continue living.

368
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,960
And miss me.

369
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,880
If I'm gone, I might be somewhere.

370
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,840
But I will miss you.

371
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,360
Tar! Wake up!

372
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,280
Tar, stay with me.

373
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,080
Tar

374
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,880
I just realized today what it feels like to have someone to love and miss.

375
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,000
Even if we're apart,

376
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,760
you'll forever stay in my heart.

377
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,880
I'll spend my life waiting on you.

378
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,280
It doesn't matter where or when, I'll wait for you.

379
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,360
I love you, Tar.

380
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,680
I love you.
