1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,750
I've come to a realization.

2
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,890
I...

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,400
live in a world governed by a certain rule.

4
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,910
In other words...

5
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,250
I'm a resident of a Boys' Love world.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
However...

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,860
as a background character
who wants absolutely nothing to do with BL...

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,790
I've studied all sorts of reference materials...

9
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,270
and have successfully dodged every flag thrown my way.

10
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
I absolutely refuse to become BL.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080
Kikuchi.

12
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,140
However...

13
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,940
Wait.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,500
This isn't right.

15
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,910
I knew it... No matter how much I fight it...

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,330
as someone who lives in this world...

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,630
I can't defy its laws.

18
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,310
I'm finally...

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,650
going to graduate from being a background character...

20
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,170
and as a main character in this world...

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,510
I'm going to fall in love with a guy.

22
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,570
Huh?

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That development is still too early.

24
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,630
Ah, well then.

25
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,880
It's almost time for my flight,
so I'm heading out.

26
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,290
Ah...

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Yeah.

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,510
Have a safe trip.

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,470
Thanks for seeing me off.

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,100
Take care.

31
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,050
Kikuchi...

32
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
Hmm?

33
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,790
Um, so...

34
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,210
does this mean...

35
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,690
I've once again...

36
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,660
managed to avoid a situation where a Boy becomes Loves?

37
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,710
Hahaha.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,990
See? I didn't fall into the trap.

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,590
I'm the only one...

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,790
who will never surrender to this world!

41
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,450
That's more like it.

42
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,130
And so...

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,840
in a world where everything inevitably becomes a BL story...

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,940
as a man who absolutely refuses to be in one...

45
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,920
my arduous daily battle begins for the third time.

46
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 1)

47
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,370
What's with you, big bro?

48
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,000
Suddenly deciding to work out?

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,700
Are you into muscular guys or something?

50
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,310
- No, I'm not.
- Then what's with the sudden change?

51
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,490
Ah.

52
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,420
Do you have a crush on someone?

53
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,290
Let me guess, she's into muscular guys?

54
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,180
Bro, you're so easy to read. You little...

55
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,030
Hey, knock it off.

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Oh.

57
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,160
I guess you don't want this then?

58
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,120
- I bought one for you too, bro.
- Ah! No, I'll eat it!

59
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,780
- Don't force yourself.
- Hey!

60
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,950
Mmm, this is delicious.

61
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,440
Hey, you've got something on your face.

62
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,330
Huh? What is it?

63
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,080
Right here.

64
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,660
Ah.

65
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,900
This scenario...

66
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
For example...

67
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,280
let's say Ayato's boyfriend...

68
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,440
that "Mr. Rose," Tojo, was here...

69
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,880
Hello.

70
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,310
Ayato.

71
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,730
And his brother.

72
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,380
The roses on his back...

73
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,600
are in full bloom again today.

74
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,950
Ah.

75
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,050
Excuse me, brother.

76
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,470
Just as you'd expect from a main character in this world.

77
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,710
So elegant.

78
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,370
No matter what, he's always so graceful.

79
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,540
Hey, what do you think you're doing, Tojo?

80
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Huh?

81
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,670
Don't get so chummy with my brother.

82
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,460
He's not your brother.

83
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,600
Why are you so mad?

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,550
Just get out of here!

85
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,450
Don't you touch my brother!

86
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
My dear little brother.

87
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,810
While pretending to be just a doting brother...

88
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,710
you're actually jealous of me
and Tojo getting close, aren't you?

89
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
I told you to leave!

90
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Are you all right?

91
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,870
Yeah...

92
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,390
I'm fine.

93
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Hmm?

94
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,740
I smell something sweet.

95
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
Oh, it's because I just ate a cupcake.

96
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,770
No... that's not it.

97
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Hmm?

98
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,140
Ayato, you always...

99
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,080
have this alluring, sweet scent about you.

100
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,790
Tojo...

101
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,310
Aah!

102
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,490
Hmm?

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,650
What is it, bro?

104
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,590
No, it's nothing.

105
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,220
Well, good luck with all that.

106
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,470
So...

107
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,940
why exactly am I working out my body?

108
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,470
The hint...

109
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,770
was hidden within that little daydream theater of mine.

110
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
And that is...

111
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,800
physical contact.

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,550
So, I'm sure you've all figured it out by now.

113
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,660
VS

114
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,210
The Physical Contact Chapter.

115
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,310
So far...

116
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,160
I've come across all kinds of BL flags.

117
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,450
So I've decided to go back to basics.

118
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,000
In daily life...

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,270
there's one element you have to be wary of.

120
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
And that is...

121
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Morning, Riki.

122
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,390
Ah, Shoma.

123
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,480
- Physical contact.
- What's wrong, Riki?

124
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,150
Did something happen?

125
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,510
Huh?

126
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,840
The feel of your back...

127
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,300
It's different from usual.

128
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,970
Hey, what's wrong?

129
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,830
The truth is...

130
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,240
my boyfriend...

131
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
No...

132
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,520
my lover broke up with me yesterday.

133
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
He said...

134
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,320
he was tired of me.

135
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,430
I'll never get tired of you.

136
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,880
Not in a million years.

137
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Shoma...

138
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,850
Exactly.

139
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,010
That kind of casual physical contact...

140
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,950
is the spark that ignites a new relationship.

141
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,950
And that's why...

142
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,570
This is bad. If someone catches me now...

143
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,260
it's guaranteed to trigger a BL development.

144
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
This is bad.

145
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,500
This is bad. This is bad.

146
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
This is bad.

147
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,600
Bad. This is really, really bad.

148
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,550
Are you okay?

149
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,730
Bad, bad, this is so bad.

150
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
Is this yours?

151
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Uh...

152
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Yeah.

153
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,910
Thanks.

154
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,780
And that's how it's done.

155
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,540
This is why my core strength is essential.

156
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,650
Still at it?

157
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,390
In other words...

158
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,160
in order to avoid physical contact...

159
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,360
daily core training is an absolute must.

160
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,090
However...

161
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,810
there's a type of contact that's impossible to avoid,
no matter how much you train.

162
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,590
And that is...

163
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,590
Tickling.

164
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,220
Tickle attack!

165
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,810
Stop it!

166
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,280
For guys over 20...

167
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,980
you might think doing something
so childish is out of the question.

168
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
But tickling...

169
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,070
is a classic event in the world of BL.

170
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,720
- You're next.
- So it happens more often than you'd think.

171
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,220
And going in order, my turn is next.

172
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,660
To avoid it, the best way is to casually excuse myself.

173
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,700
Just going to the restroom.

174
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
Hey, trying to get away?

175
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,740
No, I'll just play along for a bit.

176
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,090
Actually, I'm good.

177
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Alright!

178
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,800
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

179
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,510
Hey, my sides are off-limits!

180
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,190
Because if they think you're trying to escape...

181
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,370
or if you pretend you're not ticklish...

182
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,050
they'll usually get carried away
and go at you even harder.

183
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,740
What? You want me to tickle your sides?

184
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
And then...

185
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,810
at just the right moment,
you give the "it's over" signal.

186
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,930
With this...

187
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,730
sigh at the end of the laughter...

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,210
you create a "tickle time is over" atmosphere.

189
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,300
Okay, you're next!

190
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:30,810
(sensual moaning)

191
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,910
Huh?

192
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,210
That guy's voice just now...

193
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,900
sounded kinda hot.

194
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
And...

195
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,140
it's a voice I could really get into.

196
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Hey...

197
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,910
stop it.

198
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
This guy...

199
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,950
He's laughing so hard he's getting teary-eyed.

200
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,440
So cute.

201
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Ah.

202
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,930
I think I'm a little drunk.

203
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,780
Want to get some fresh air?

204
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,250
Ah...

205
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Mm-hmm.

206
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,570
Sure.

207
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,150
And so, everyone, please be extra careful
about physical contact.

208
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,150
(sensual moaning)

209
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:58,530
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

210
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Oh.

211
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,040
This pumpkin soup is so good.

212
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,130
Really?

213
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,840
It's delicious.

214
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,140
- I'll get you a refill.
- Thank you.

215
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,100
It really... is delicious.

216
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,980
Bro, don't slurp your soup.

217
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,680
What's the big deal?

218
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,470
Pumpkin is especially delicious this time of year.

219
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,070
In other words...

220
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,480
it's the season for Halloween parties.

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,220
To be honest, it's just a regular get-together
using Halloween as an excuse.

222
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,420
This year, too...

223
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,280
at this BL world's Halloween...

224
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,590
vampires are out in full force.

225
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,950
Big brother.

226
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,700
That voice is...

227
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,890
The quality of this vampire is on another level.

228
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,670
All the other vampires pale in comparison.

229
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,910
And what's more...

230
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,460
a vampire carrying roses on his back.

231
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,770
It's just too perfect.

232
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
VS

233
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,650
The Halloween Chapter.

234
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,470
Here you go, brother.

235
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,640
Oh, thanks.

236
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,140
So many people are in costumes.
This is fun.

237
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,230
Sorry I'm late!

238
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Ta-da!

239
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,270
Your Halloween nurse is here!

240
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,110
Ryota...

241
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,250
You guys are nurses, too?

242
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,960
Just like this...

243
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,840
when a guy cross-dresses for laughs
and comes to a party,

244
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,090
he ends up wearing the same thing
as a bunch of other people,

245
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,990
and it just falls flat.

246
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,000
- Who's that guy?
- He's so cute.

247
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,660
And as a bonus...

248
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,530
the huge difference in quality
compared to the cute-type guys...

249
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,610
is just mortifying.

250
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,190
You're right.

251
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,910
The quality is on another level.

252
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,530
Who the heck is this guy?

253
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,980
Huh?

254
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,190
Bro, you're here?

255
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,190
Huh?

256
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,150
Ayato?!

257
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,810
I didn't have a costume,

258
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,190
so I borrowed the one Mom wore
in her school play when she was young.

259
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,470
Ayato...

260
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Tojo...

261
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,430
As expected from the main characters of this world.

262
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,570
A vampire and Little Red Riding Hood.

263
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,680
A perfect visual pairing.

264
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
It really suits you.

265
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,890
You too...

266
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,390
I've been Ayato's brother for 11 years...

267
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,510
and I never realized it at all.

268
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,330
Damn it.

269
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
I...

270
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I...

271
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,970
Until now, what side of Ayato have I even been seeing?

272
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,850
Um... are you okay?

273
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,000
Huh?

274
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
This time...

275
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,550
a doctor appears.

276
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,640
And what a beautiful female doctor at that!

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,520
You look pale.

278
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Ah, well...

279
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,470
I'm definitely not sick.

280
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,060
This is just the shock from realizing
I've failed as Ayato's brother...

281
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,310
Um... I'm really fine.

282
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,390
There's no way you're fine!

283
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,050
See?

284
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,070
Your heart is beating really fast.

285
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,490
Why are there...

286
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,260
two cute-type guys in the same place?

287
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,860
Is it just a given because this is a BL world?

288
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
What should I do?

289
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,860
How can I possibly avoid this definite BL situation?

290
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,270
I've got it.

291
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,590
Aah, my eyes!

292
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,280
Huh?

293
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,540
You're a Christian! My eyes!

294
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,810
Ah...

295
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,380
Pardon me, I must be going.

296
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,240
Enjoy your Halloween. Farewell!

297
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,490
Alright! This time, I've successfully shattered
the flag once again. Hehehe.

298
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
No.

299
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,900
These flower glasses...

300
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,450
are mine.

301
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,720
No, not you.

302
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,570
The one I like...

303
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,520
where are they?

304
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Okay.

305
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,440
Alright, next.

306
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,520
These flower glasses are mine.

307
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,860
Halloween really is an event
where you can't let your guard down.

308
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,010
- Everyone, be careful when you attend these events.
- No.

309
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,150
Alright, next.

310
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

311
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
(Next Episode)

312
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,350
Let's go out. Don't wipe it off!

313
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,620
(VS The Scent Chapter)

314
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,890
Two people using the same shampoo...
It smells like him.

315
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,270
Mixed with your scent,
it becomes an even better fragrance.

316
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,710
What should I do?

317
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,500
(VS The Age Gap Romance Chapter)

318
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,420
Brother.

319
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,670
An age-gap romance is a classic theme
that often appears in fiction.

320
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,420
Back then, I had no idea...

321
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,520
of the fateful age-gap romance
that was about to befall me.

322
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,130
That person...
