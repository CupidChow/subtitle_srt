1
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,300
Whenever a couple gets together,

2
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,360
there's one question they're almost always asked.

3
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,570
And that is,

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,300
"How did you two meet and fall in love?"

5
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,810
Hey, hey!

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,790
So when did you two officially start dating?

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,100
Well... about two weeks ago...

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,320
Hey, it was two weeks and two days ago.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,220
- Oh, right.
- The details matter.

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,130
Close enough.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
And then what?

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,910
How did it happen?

13
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,490
Well,

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
that day,

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
I...

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,850
forgot my umbrella.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,420
And I happened to have one.

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
What's wrong?

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,930
I forgot my umbrella.

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,220
Oh, I see.

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,530
Here.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,190
Take this one.

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,090
Huh?

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Are you sure?

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,360
I've got this bigger one for myself.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,600
Don't you want it?

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,880
It's not that.

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,010
I just...

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,270
I'd rather have that one.

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,530
Huh?

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,380
I'd rather...

32
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,390
share that one with you.

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,230
Mizuta...

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,080
You'll get wet.

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,630
Come a little closer.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Okay.

37
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,130
You...

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,260
smell really nice.

39
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,150
So do you.

40
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,020
You smell nice too.

41
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,330
Wow, so forward.

42
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,590
How romantic!

43
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,930
Oh, shut up.

44
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,210
That's a very wholesome "how we met" story.

45
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,590
But...

46
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,600
in this world of BL,

47
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,060
not all meet-cutes are this wholesome.

ARC

52
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,030
Hey, wanna come over for a drink later?

53
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,030
Sounds good.

54
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,310
Let's go.

55
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,390
You guys coming too?

56
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Oh.

57
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Then I guess I'll...

58
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,830
What should I do...?

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,510
I guess I'll go too.

60
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,820
Oh, it's raining...

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Sorry.

62
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,590
I'm gonna skip.

63
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,990
Oh, right.

64
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,720
I have other plans anyway.

65
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,720
Oh.

66
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,860
Okay, then.

67
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
See you.

68
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,920
You know, those two...

69
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,910
tend to disappear at the same time.

70
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,270
You don't think they're secretly dating, do you?

71
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,280
Those two are probably...

72
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,160
more than friends,

73
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,660
but not quite lovers.

74
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,010
And...

75
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,030
between them...

76
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,230
things have already gotten physical.

77
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,490
You've always wanted this, haven't you?

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,750
But... the rain just wouldn't come.

79
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,740
I made it rain today.

80
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,060
That's how badly I wanted you...

81
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,990
Joji...

82
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,780
Right now, the two of them...

83
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,250
are friends with benefits.

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
That's right.

85
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,640
In this world,

86
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,130
a surprising number of relationships start with sex.

87
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,760
The phrase "it's raining"...

88
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,080
is actually their code...

89
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,080
for "let's hook up later."

90
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,090
So every beginning for them starts with rain.

91
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,630
However...

92
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,740
this is the world of BL.

93
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,040
All roads eventually lead to BL.

94
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,650
In other words,

95
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,240
two people who are just friends with benefits...

96
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,730
won't stay that way for long.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Wait, what?

98
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,790
You two are dating now?

99
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
Yeah.

100
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,830
Sorry to spring this on you.

101
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,010
It's probably a shock, right?

102
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,880
But we didn't want to lie about our relationship.

103
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,500
We're not shocked at all.

104
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,900
Thanks for telling us.

105
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,950
Huh?

106
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,230
Right?

107
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,350
Yeah.

108
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Thank you.

109
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
Congratulations.

110
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Congrats.

111
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,570
In a situation like this,

112
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,790
it's fine to congratulate them.

113
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,970
Wait, by the way,

114
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,920
how did you two get together?

115
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,800
Huh?

116
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,160
- How it started?
- Yeah, yeah!

117
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,700
Tell us your "how we met" story.

118
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,370
"How we met" was...

119
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,330
we both got drunk at a party,

120
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,000
and one thing led to another.

121
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,180
How can they possibly say that out loud?

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,760
Uh, well...

123
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,700
Well, one time in class,
I happened to be sitting next to Joji.

124
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,680
Oh, yeah, and then...

125
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,420
I dropped my eraser,

126
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,190
and Manabu picked it up for me.

127
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,280
Wow, talk about a cliché way to meet.

128
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,690
That's so romantic!

129
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,960
Oh, come on, it wasn't.

130
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,490
What a terrible lie.

131
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,980
Just like those two,

132
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,690
to avoid being put on the spot later,

133
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,660
a couple that's still just friends with benefits...

134
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,030
should prepare a plausible
"how we met" story in advance.

135
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,800
And so, one day...

136
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
Mmm.

137
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,380
This pudding is so good.

138
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,210
I should bring some to Tojo next time.

139
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,690
Tojo.

140
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,330
Lord of the Roses.

141
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,150
Hey there.

142
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Ayato.

143
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
Bro.

144
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Hey, Ayato.

145
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,630
Yeah?

146
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
By the way,

147
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,450
how exactly did you and Tojo get together?

148
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
How we met?

149
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,030
Yeah.

150
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,180
Well...

151
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,040
Um...

152
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,010
Hmm...

153
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,370
What's wrong, little bro?

154
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,690
You were just smiling so brightly

155
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,790
while eating that pudding a moment ago.

156
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,220
Why are you suddenly so hesitant?

157
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,740
Don't tell me...

158
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,340
the way Tojo and Ayato met was...

159
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,770
Huh?

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
It's fine, isn't it?

161
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,340
Ayato.

162
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,140
No, not here...

163
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,500
What if someone sees us?

164
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,650
But you said it was okay last time.

165
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,820
That was a moment of weakness...

166
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060
Hey, Tojo.

167
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Yeah?

168
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,840
Do you actually...

169
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,530
like me for me?

170
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Or...

171
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,820
do you just want my body?

172
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Does it really...

173
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,880
make a difference?

174
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,090
Don't tell me...

175
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,750
the way they got together...

176
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,090
was through a... physical... relationship...

177
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,310
Coming.

178
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,070
Sorry to intrude.

179
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,710
Oh, bro.

180
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,670
What's gotten into you?

181
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,530
This guy...

182
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,070
Beneath that sweet, gentle face...

183
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,110
lurks the instinct of a wild beast.

184
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,970
Oh, sorry.

185
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,150
Looks like I brought the same thing...

186
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,580
It's a little something for you.

187
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
A gift?

188
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,170
Oh!

189
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,350
Wow!

190
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,110
Not at all. I'm so happy I get to eat more pudding.

191
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,370
- Tojo, you have some too.
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,420
You should have some too, bro.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,060
Thank you.

194
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,360
- Let's eat.
- Please, enjoy.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,730
Wow, this is delicious!

196
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,350
I'm glad.

197
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,500
Ayato, you really love pudding, don't you?

198
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,460
Yeah, it's my favorite.

199
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,570
Bro.

200
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,470
Actually,

201
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,360
the reason I first started to notice Ayato...

202
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,830
was because of pudding, too.

203
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,890
Pudding?

204
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,250
It was the last pudding at the school store.

205
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,230
Ayato and I both reached for it at the same time.

206
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,170
So we ended up sharing it.

207
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
Mmm.

208
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
It was so good.

209
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,610
Yeah.

210
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
It was amazing.

211
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,970
You can have the last bite.

212
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,930
Tojo...

213
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,290
Here.

214
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
It's so good.

215
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,020
Tojo... Stop, this is so embarrassing.

216
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,630
Brings back memories.

217
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,670
Aww.

218
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, so it all started with a pudding...

219
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,960
Huh? A prince and princess?

220
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,300
Oh, pudding, ahh.

221
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,520
- Ahh!
- What's wrong, dude?

222
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,440
Delicious.

223
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,160
Ooh, let me try that one too.

224
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,690
Hey! Don't just grab it, man!

225
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,360
- That's mine, give it back!
- If you don't mind, you can have mine.

226
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,620
- Oh, I'll help myself then.
- Hey, man.

227
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,380
- You've got some nerve.
- It's all right.

228
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,680
Well, well, Ayato and Tojo.

229
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,740
Your meet-cute is just
as innocent as I imagined.

230
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,970
A love story that started with a pudding.

231
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,420
Makes my heart skip a beat~

232
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
My heart's fluttering.

233
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,350
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

234
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Tomoya.

235
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,680
Hey, can you please cover my shift?

236
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,590
I totally forgot my mom is coming to Tokyo.

237
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,280
Oh?

238
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,140
Such a good son.

239
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,660
Yeah, sure.

240
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Awesome!

241
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,950
You're the best!

242
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Hey, cut it out.

243
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,460
Everyone's looking at us.

244
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,590
Is another couple getting together over here?

245
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Please.

246
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,240
Join our club.

247
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,000
Our cheer squad...

248
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,740
is in danger of being disbanded.

249
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,740
I don't mind.

250
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,180
You will?

251
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,370
Really?

252
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,210
However...

253
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,000
I have one condition.

254
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,650
A condition?

255
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,410
Name it. If it's something I can do, I'll do it.

256
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,370
Will you be the captain of my love life's cheer squad?

257
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,400
Huh?

258
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,410
I've always had a crush on you.

259
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,180
I like you too.

260
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,310
A romance flag has been raised.

261
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,660
No, seriously, what kind of college students are these?

262
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,490
But still...

263
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,640
another couple's getting together here.

264
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,250
Anyway...

265
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,380
in this BL world, helping someone out...

266
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,890
is very likely to trigger a major flag.

267
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,100
VS

268
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,390
The Favor

269
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,530
Arc

270
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,960
In any case...

271
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,650
I absolutely cannot agree to help anyone out.

272
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,360
A mob character has to act like one.

273
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,500
I need to erase my own presence.

274
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,220
Oh, excuse me, you over there.

275
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,910
- Don't panic.
- Excuse me.

276
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,500
I've already minimized my presence to the absolute limit.

277
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,810
There's no way anyone would talk to me.

278
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Hey, you.

279
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Excuse me.

280
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,370
Don't panic.

281
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,240
Why would anyone be talking to me?

282
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,020
Yes, you.

283
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,990
Huh?

284
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,620
Could you help me with something?

285
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,070
Help?

286
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,760
Just a moment.

287
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,650
The main character and his lover
will be looking at each other here.

288
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,960
We need you to walk around in the background naturally.

289
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,730
Okay.

290
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
The only reason they talked to me...

291
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,870
was because they needed an extra.

292
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,080
That's a mob character for you.

293
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
See?

294
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,720
That main character over there,
with his sparkling aura...

295
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,790
could you ever give off this kind of aura that,
no matter how you look at it...

296
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,540
is clearly a mob character?

297
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
No way.

298
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,660
As long as I'm just an extra, there's no way I'll trigger a flag.

299
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Good morning.

300
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
The actor playing the love interest is here.

301
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,750
It's a pleasure to be working with you.

302
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,410
- All right, if you could come over here.
- Okay.

303
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,670
Oh.

304
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,150
This is the world of BL, after all.

305
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,970
Of course, the love interest is also a man.

306
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,870
Even from far away...

307
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,130
he's radiating that sparkling aura.

308
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,590
That's the main character's lover for you.

309
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
All right.

310
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,380
Let's get a look at your face.

311
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Huh?

312
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,810
Huh?

313
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Three years.

314
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
In three years...

315
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,490
when I turn 20, I'll say it again.

316
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
That I love you.

317
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,070
I...

318
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,470
have no intention of giving up on you.

319
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,570
So...

320
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
um...

321
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,250
That's all I wanted to tell you.

322
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,400
What is going on?

323
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,940
What is this guy doing here?

324
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,670
Um...

325
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,190
It looks like a flag has been raised
in another unexpected place.

326
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,350
All right, next up is the long-awaited final episode.

327
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,070
Wait, no, not "long-awaited."

328
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,340
It's the "Wait, stay away from me" final episode.

329
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,640
Anyway, make sure you watch until the end.

330
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,900
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

331
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,210
(Next Episode)
Huh? No way.

332
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,480
Is that me?

333
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,290
I look exactly like a main character in this BL world.

334
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,830
He seems to be drawn to you.

335
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,170
Huh?

336
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,350
You don't have to worry about me.

337
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,930
It still hurts even now.

338
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,190
To avoid the biggest flag of my life...

339
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,720
My feelings...

340
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,790
can't you accept them?

341
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,430
I really...

342
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,840
can't forget you.

343
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,870
What am I going to do?
