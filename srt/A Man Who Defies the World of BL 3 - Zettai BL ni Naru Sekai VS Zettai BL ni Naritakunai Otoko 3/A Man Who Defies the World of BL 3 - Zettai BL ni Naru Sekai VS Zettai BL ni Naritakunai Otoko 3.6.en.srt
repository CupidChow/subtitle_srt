1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,150
The actor playing the love interest is here.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,720
It's a pleasure to meet you.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,130
- Right this way, please.
- Okay.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,650
Oh.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,050
This is the world of BL, alright.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,980
Of course, the love interest is also a guy.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,810
Just looking at him from a distance...

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,770
he has that sparkling aura.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,570
Just what you'd expect from the protagonist's love interest.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,910
Alright.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,340
Let me get a good look at his face.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Huh?

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,780
Huh?

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
Three years.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Wait for me for three years.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,550
When I turn twenty, I'll say it again.

17
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,290
I'll say I love you.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,750
I...

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,360
am not giving up on you.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
So...

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,890
Um...

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,170
That's all I wanted to tell you.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,600
Didn't you say...

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,890
you wouldn't show your face for three years?

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,130
Since then, let's see...

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,970
It hasn't even been three weeks.

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,930
Hello.

28
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,490
Oh...

29
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,010
Hello.

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Um...

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,860
The director suddenly asked me to come.

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,190
I see.

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
And also...

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,070
I saw that you were here as an extra.

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,340
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,550
Are you okay?

37
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,010
Ah...

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,240
I don't think I can make it.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Ah...
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

40
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,570
Is there anything we can use?

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Director.

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,980
I just contacted the hospital.

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,630
They said he has to get checked out today,
so he won't be back.

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,880
Looks like we'll have to cancel the shoot.

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,850
Hmm?

47
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,650
The shoot...

48
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,890
I guess it can't be helped.

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
Yeah.

50
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,150
It's decided then.

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 6)

52
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,670
VS

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,600
The Film Shoot

54
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,890
Arc

55
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,330
The main character has arrived.

56
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:19,700
Huh?
No way.

57
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,110
Is this me?

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Isn't this...

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,100
exactly what a main character
in this world of BL looks like?

60
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,790
Um...

61
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,660
It really suits you.

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,140
It looks great on you.

63
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,000
That's impossible.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,390
It's true.

65
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,830
And we're rolling.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,140
Camera is rolling.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
And...

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Action!

69
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,940
Go faster!

70
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,470
We're going to be late for class!

71
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
Alright, alright.

72
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
I get it.

73
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,800
Too fast, too fast!

74
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,100
You're the one who told me to go faster!

75
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,920
I told you it's dangerous!

76
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,130
Okay, cut!

77
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Let's go again.

78
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,150
- Waving the branch like that looks a bit stiff. Try to be more natural.
- Sorry.

79
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,110
- Let's do that one more time.
- Understood.

80
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,660
Here.

81
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Thanks.

82
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,210
Oh...

83
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,570
Yours is bigger.

84
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Huh?

85
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,100
Then you can have this one.

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
Still...

87
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,830
Yours is still bigger.

88
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,850
What?

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,900
Then just take it.

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
But...

91
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,710
I want to share it with you.

92
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,250
Here.

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Thanks.

94
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,530
So this is where you were.

95
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,570
Ah...

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,960
You've been acting a little strange lately.

97
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,250
Is something bothering you?

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,080
What's wrong?

99
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,840
You can't even tell me?

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,840
What is it?

101
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,930
Aren't we friends?

102
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,460
It's because we're friends...

103
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,420
that there are things I can't say.

104
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,490
I don't want to...

105
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,210
ruin what we have.

106
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Huh...

107
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Does that mean...

108
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,870
I have to go.

109
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,230
I have my part-time job.

110
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,330
Hey!

111
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,110
Alright, cut!

112
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
OK.

113
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,010
That was great, you two.

114
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,490
Yeah.

115
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,280
Glad we got it in one take.

116
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,220
Yeah.

117
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,500
It's so beautiful.

118
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,880
Yeah...

119
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,120
Alright.

120
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,380
Let's have a contest.
See who can hang on the longest without falling.

121
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,610
If I win...

122
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,310
you have to grant me one wish, okay?

123
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,470
A wish?

124
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Yep.

125
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,130
Oh.

126
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,540
I win.

127
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,800
Yeah.

128
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,280
My wish is...

129
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,690
to always be...

130
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,330
by your side like this.

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,660
I can't...

132
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,380
lie about my feelings anymore.

133
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,370
I'm in love with you.

134
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
That's all I wanted to tell you.

135
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,110
Wait.

136
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,620
I'm in love with you, too.

137
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,170
Okay, and cut!

138
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
OK.

139
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,070
That was the last shot.

140
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,770
- That's a wrap! Great work.
- Great work.

141
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,720
- Great work.
- Great work.

142
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,690
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

143
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,910
You're really enjoying that.

144
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,900
Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,850
It tastes even better than usual.

146
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,600
I guess this is what a drink
after a hard day's work tastes like.

147
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,950
You know, acting...

148
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,550
is actually pretty fun.

149
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Oh?

150
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,810
Although...

151
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,550
for me...

152
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,300
it wasn't exactly acting.

153
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,680
I told you it's dangerous!

154
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,060
Then just take it.

155
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,110
Um...

156
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
I...

157
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,610
Long time no see.

158
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,790
Kikuchi.

159
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,290
Who's that...?

160
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,860
Aren't you supposed to be abroad?

161
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,740
I came back for my university break.

162
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,800
A scene like this...

163
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,410
Could it be...?

164
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,610
The legendary...

165
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,860
love triangle?

166
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,420
No way.

167
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,080
A love triangle centered on me has actually erupted...

168
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,040
This is the biggest flag of my entire life.

169
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,760
As far as triangles go, this is the best kind.

170
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,530
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

171
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,800
Kikuchi.

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,240
Aren't you supposed to be abroad?

173
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm back for my university break.

174
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,050
It looks like you two...

175
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,970
have something important to talk about.

176
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Uh...

177
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
No, it's not...

178
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,330
Thanks for the drinks.

179
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,090
Why didn't you contact me when you got back?

180
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
Sorry.

181
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,000
I was going to...

182
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,630
but I don't have your contact info.

183
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Well...

184
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,170
I guess that's true.

185
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,910
You know...

186
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,800
Even when I was over there,
I was always thinking about you.

187
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,870
Huh...?

188
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,690
I wondered...

189
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,220
what you were doing.

190
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,120
What was making you smile.

191
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,630
I was always thinking about that.

192
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
So, um...

193
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,170
Who was that guy from before?

194
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,910
Oh.

195
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,920
He's a friend of my brother's.

196
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,680
We were in a movie together.

197
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,290
It looked like he's into you.

198
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,190
No way.

199
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,970
There's no way that's true.

200
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,850
Don't mind me.

201
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,540
Kikuchi.

202
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,940
This beer tastes extra bitter today.

203
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,780
I wonder why.

204
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,810
Huh?

205
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,100
(Internal debate in session.)

206
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,450
What should I do?

207
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,490
What on earth am I going to do?

208
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,400
It tastes better than usual.

209
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,530
Today's beer...

210
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,350
seems especially bitter.

211
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,970
I wonder why.

212
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,280
How do I dodge the biggest flag of my life?

213
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,030
What am I supposed to do?

214
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,260
VS

215
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,680
Falling in Love

216
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,040
Chapter

217
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,680
Mmm, this is delicious.

218
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,050
Why are you always eating sweets?

219
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,310
I brought them for you, big brother.

220
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,650
You need sugar when you're thinking, right?

221
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,450
Yeah.

222
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
I guess so...

223
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,850
By the way, Ayato.

224
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
Hmm?

225
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,470
How have things been with you and Tojo lately?

226
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,550
Well...

227
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
The other day...

228
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,390
Ayato.

229
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,770
Want to stop by somewhere on the way?

230
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Ayato?

231
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,810
Sometimes, I feel insecure.

232
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,090
Why would Tojo...

233
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,300
date someone like me?

234
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,520
Because Tojo is just too perfect, too brilliant.

235
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,270
What's wrong?

236
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Oh... it's nothing.

237
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,330
For someone like Tojo...

238
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
it shouldn't be me.

239
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,430
That guy...

240
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,410
or that guy over there.

241
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,110
There are so many other people

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,100
who are a better match for him.

243
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,170
Ah.

244
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,170
Hey, Ayato.

245
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,500
Want to check out this place?

246
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Looks like they have some amazing parfaits.

247
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
Parfaits?

248
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,780
Couples only...

249
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,460
Let's get this one.

250
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,080
No, that's...

251
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,210
Don't get so flustered.

252
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,290
I'm just kidding.

253
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,810
After all...

254
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,510
After all...?

255
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,770
Yeah.

256
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,000
Because you, Ayato,

257
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,910
would be embarrassed if people around us

258
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,280
knew we were a couple, right?

259
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
Come on.

260
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,080
Let's go, Ayato.

261
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,270
Let's go, Tojo.

262
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Huh?

263
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,770
I...

264
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,170
have never once been embarrassed
about being your boyfriend.

265
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
Ayato.

266
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,570
Geez, get a room.

267
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,750
Hey, big brother.

268
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,730
Love...

269
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,080
is a truly wonderful thing.

270
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,630
Huh?

271
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,660
So you too, big brother...

272
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,250
Don't be afraid.

273
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,130
Why don't you try falling in love?

274
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
What?

275
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,190
Fall in love.

276
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,580
Fall in love?

277
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,580
- Yeah.
- Me?

278
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,020
Yeah.

279
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,530
No way.

280
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,310
Sigh...

281
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,780
Love...

282
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,970
is a truly wonderful thing.

283
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,620
Every single one of them...

284
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,970
Why does everyone want me to fall in love?

285
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,550
I'm a mob character.

286
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,560
Mob characters aren't supposed to fall in love. NG.

287
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,620
I'm a mob character with walls of steel.

288
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,190
No BL.

289
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
No Life.

290
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Huh?

291
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,300
Can you really escape?

292
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,170
Look.

293
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,700
Here it comes, here it comes...

294
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Ah.

295
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,730
Ahh.

296
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,200
I knew it... I still...

297
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,280
can't give up on you.

298
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,320
Huh...?

299
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,880
We filmed a movie together.

300
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,740
We were always together.

301
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,070
And it made my feelings for you grow stronger.

302
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,110
Huh?

303
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,860
Will you accept my feelings?

304
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,180
This is bad.

305
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,890
The flowers of love...

306
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,540
are blooming everywhere.

307
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,370
I knew it, I also...

308
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,970
can't forget you.

309
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,490
So, what will you do, mob character?

310
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
This flag...

311
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,570
How do you plan on dodging it?

312
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,500
What do I do?

313
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,700
What do I do?

314
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,620
I...

315
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,350
Oh!

316
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,320
Wait, it's over already?

317
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,700
To see what happens next, wait for the sequel!

318
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,390
Then again, is there going to be a sequel?

319
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,760
Ah!

320
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,700
