1
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,810
Good morning.

2
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,220
This smell is...

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,630
(Ham and eggs, natto, white rice,
and seaweed and tofu miso soup)

4
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,060
Yes! A perfect score again today.

5
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,110
Time to eat.

6
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,790
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Hey, bro.

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,740
Hm?

9
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,630
Um...

10
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,550
this breakfast guessing game...

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,550
How long are you gonna keep this up?

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,090
As long as breakfast is on the table,
the game goes on.

13
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,570
Are you for real?

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Still, that's pretty amazing.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,330
Guessing all that just from the smell.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,040
- Pretty impressive, huh?
- That wasn't a compliment.

17
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,590
That reminds me, though.

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,120
With a nose like a dog's...

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,110
can't you put it to good use somehow?

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,390
Oh.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,420
How about becoming a police dog?

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,430
A police dog?

23
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,730
Hey, not a bad idea.

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,070
That's a pretty good idea.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,420
It's decided then, bro.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,020
Ah, and dessert is apples.

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,430
You got it.

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,340
Bro, you really are incredible.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,510
You could be a super-elite K-9 unit.

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,220
For sure.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,550
Elite, huh...

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Well...

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,690
Whether or not I become a police dog in the future...

34
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,360
let's put that aside for now.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,830
This scent...

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,340
It's the daily special from the student cafeteria.

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,490
Beef and potato stew.

38
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,470
Scent...

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,130
has the power to evoke associated
memories and emotions.

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,080
In this BL world,

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,100
scent can trigger all sorts of things.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
(Beef and Potato Stew Set)

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,200
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"
(Episode 2)

44
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,570
VS.

45
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,850
The Scent Chapter

46
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,990
For example...

47
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,710
Caught a cold?

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,840
Um... no...

49
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,250
I just feel a little chilly.

50
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,000
By the way, that shirt...

51
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,400
isn't it a little thin for this weather?

52
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,430
Wearing something so thin...

53
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,830
Here, put this on, Satoshi.

54
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:43,900
I can't.

55
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,540
But then you'll catch a cold, Atsushi.

56
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,260
I'm not that weak.

57
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,260
Alright, I'm off to my club activity.

58
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,950
Atsushi.

59
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,570
And just like that...

60
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,480
a flag was raised.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
This is bad.

62
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,810
It's so soft.

63
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,630
It has his scent.

64
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,030
So this is where you were.

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,170
My club activity just finished.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,930
- Here, you should take this back.
- It's fine.

67
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
You can keep it on.

68
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,060
- Atsushi.
- Yeah...

69
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,670
Your scent, Atsushi...

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
How do I put this...

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
It's so comforting.

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,590
Is it?

73
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
And you, Satoshi...

74
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,150
Somehow...

75
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,440
you have a scent that tugs at my heartstrings.

76
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,430
Atsushi...

77
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Sorry.

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,570
I might give you my cold.

79
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
I already told you...

80
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,970
I'm not that weak.

81
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,530
And so,

82
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,670
with "scent" as the catalyst...

83
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,810
a couple was born.

84
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,050
Hm?

85
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,060
Somebody's got chikuwa in their bento.

86
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,060
Good afternoon~

87
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,590
Chikuwa is the best!

88
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,750
I'm shook!

89
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,860
My jaw is on the floor!

90
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,440
To heck with everything else, outta my way!

91
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,420
Even Prince Shotoku says you gotta eat chikuwa!

92
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,190
Stop it, stop it...

93
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,790
No, I got nothing.

94
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,070
Good afternoon, chikuwa.

95
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,440
And sometimes,

96
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,490
scent...

97
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,160
in ways you wouldn't expect,

98
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,330
can reveal certain information.

99
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,820
This scent...

100
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,590
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

101
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,360
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

102
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,840
They're using the same shampoo.

103
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,310
That's right.

104
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,110
This is a couple's subtle hint.

105
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,550
Ooh~

106
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,890
So those two are dating.

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,490
We're in college, so...

108
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,410
it's pretty common to borrow a friend's shower.

109
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
But this...

110
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,130
is a BL world, after all.

111
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,920
Giving off the same shampoo scent
first thing in the morning...

112
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,210
in other words...

113
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
Which means...

114
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,990
It tickles...

115
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,950
Don't move.

116
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,850
I told you.

117
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,130
I said don't move.

118
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,410
Okay.

119
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
But...

120
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,290
the fact that you're sensitive even here...

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
is also very cute.

122
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,920
So that's what's going on.

123
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,210
So cheerful this early in the morning.

124
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,010
Sigh...

125
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,000
Since I've picked up on this "hint"...

126
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,780
I'll perform the most classic NPC move.

127
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,790
Huh?

128
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,050
Hey you two, are you using the same shampoo?

129
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,010
Huh?

130
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
Um...

131
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,130
Oh... uh...!

132
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,090
We were drinking at my place yesterday,

133
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,640
and he missed the last train.

134
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,310
Yeah, so I ended up crashing at his place for the night.

135
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,890
Oh, but we slept in separate beds, of course.

136
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,650
Right, right, don't get the wrong idea.

137
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,230
As if I would.

138
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,190
Bringing up the sleeping arrangements unprompted...

139
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,360
They're totally flustered.

140
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,660
Yep, that confirms it.

141
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
By the way,

142
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,470
that shampoo smells really nice.

143
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,350
As a result,

144
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,740
because I just had to go
and make that unnecessary NPC move,

145
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,070
one day,

146
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,960
divine punishment came for me.

147
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,750
Those two went public with their relationship.

148
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,830
Huh?

149
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,280
Your shampoo scent...

150
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,760
I feel like I've smelled it somewhere before.

151
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,550
Huh?

152
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,100
Oh, you're right.

153
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,720
Oh.

154
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,210
So that's where it's coming from.

155
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Huh?

156
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,050
Ah... um...

157
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
That is...

158
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,590
Lavender...

159
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,900
Bergamot...

160
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,500
Chamomile...

161
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,450
And ylang-ylang.

162
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,230
You two smell the same.

163
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,010
Huh?

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Don't tell me...

165
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,350
Did you spend the night together?

166
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,280
And that's why you're using the same shampoo?

167
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,890
Ah, no no no no...

168
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,490
Uh... No way!

169
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,720
I use a common shampoo you can find anywhere.

170
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,480
That's not it.

171
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,470
My shampoo is a limited edition from a boutique.

172
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,200
Huh?

173
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,270
Why...

174
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,930
Why am I using the same limited-edition product as this guy?

175
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,570
Aah!

176
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,330
Oh?

177
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,530
I won!

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,880
Whoa, so refreshing.

179
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Oh?

180
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,050
What's that smell?

181
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,430
Oh, this?

182
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,240
It's the shampoo Tojo gave me. Smells great, right?

183
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,630
You are absolutely forbidden from using it, bro.

184
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,370
- I'm cherishing this stuff.
- As if I'd use it.

185
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,610
Or so I said...

186
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,020
but like a total cliché, I went and used it secretly anyway.

187
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,460
So is this my karma?

188
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,370
To think that...

189
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,240
someone else is using the exact same shampoo.

190
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,140
Maybe this is some kind of fate.

191
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,890
Huh...

192
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,710
Why don't you just start dating?

193
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,740
- Yeah, just get together already!
- Stop trying to pair us up!

194
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Even though our shampoo is the same...

195
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,220
our scents are a little different.

196
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,100
Huh?

197
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,070
The shampoo,

198
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,320
mixed with your own scent,

199
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,610
has created an even better fragrance.

200
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,240
Uh... um... well...

201
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
What do I do?

202
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
What do I do?

203
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,390
What am I supposed to do?

204
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,010
I know!

205
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Ah... Achoo!

206
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,590
What's wrong?

207
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,100
Are you catching a cold? Want to borrow my jacket?

208
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,360
Oh, it's not a cold.

209
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,510
Oh!

210
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,580
It's this, this scent!

211
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,800
I think whenever I smell this scent...

212
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,560
I start sneezing.

213
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,990
It's probably some kind of allergy.

214
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,420
I guess we're just not a good match.

215
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,540
So, that's that.

216
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
See you around.

217
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Excellent.

218
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,810
Beautifully dismantled that flag.

219
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,270
That's me, all right.

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
The one and only...

221
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,080
King of the NPCs.

222
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,980
Hey, bro.

223
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,350
Have you been using my shampoo?

224
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,790
Pay me back for it.

225
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,910
No.

226
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I didn't use it.

227
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,040
Yes, you did.

228
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,270
No, I didn't.

229
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,760
Is it expensive?

230
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,090
It's a limited edition. They don't sell it in stores anymore.

231
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,030
It costs 20,000 online.

232
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,350
What? 20,000!

233
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,920
- Please, I'm begging you.
- I only used my bottle once.

234
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,450
Oh, give me a break.
Hey, you can have this one!

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,370
I don't want it.

236
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,020
- Please, Master Ayato~
- Cut it out, hey!

237
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,130
Let go of me.

238
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,820
- Master Ayato~ Ah!
- I don't need it!

239
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,600
Anyway, "scent."

240
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,500
So many flags.

241
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,950
That said, using a family member's things without asking...

242
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,190
is a definite no-go.

243
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:30,520
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

244
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,270
In this world of BL manga,

245
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,820
the age-gap romance

246
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,760
is a timeless and frequently depicted theme.

247
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,010
VS

248
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,930
The Age-Gap Romance Arc

249
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,560
- Thank you.
- A large bowl of rice, please.

250
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,210
Not the regular size?

251
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,060
This is fine, isn't it?

252
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,140
It's super delicious just like this.

253
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,940
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

254
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,960
- Rice, large bowl.
- Okay, one large.

255
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,720
Here you go.

256
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,370
Just like that,

257
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,990
if you let your guard down for a second,

258
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,090
you'll suddenly run into a hot older guy.

259
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,630
Finally finished my paper.

260
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,680
I'm so tired.

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,730
In any case,

262
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,110
I made it through another day without
getting into an age-gap romance with a hot older guy.

263
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,290
I was heading home safely, but then...

264
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,580
What's this?

265
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,480
A middle school girl is crying.

266
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,670
No, wait.

267
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,730
In this world, with such well-defined features...

268
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,210
that means...

269
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,260
he's a middle school boy.

270
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,470
Mister...

271
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,570
So there's this version of the age-gap romance, too.

272
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,480
Mister...

273
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,610
What on earth happened to this kid?

274
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,790
- He may be a middle schooler, but he's still just a kid.
- Mister...

275
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,020
I can't just leave him here.

276
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,090
But...

277
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,160
I just pulled an all-nighter to finish my paper.

278
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,760
And now I run into a sobbing middle schooler.

279
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,330
My brain is completely fried.

280
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,640
I can't think of a good solution.

281
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,800
In a situation like this...

282
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,070
Mister...

283
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,930
Should I use a communication style
that won't raise any flags

284
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,820
and take him to a police box?

285
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,130
Ah, no, but...

286
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,450
that would just make me look even more suspicious.

287
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,270
Oh, right.

288
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,450
Mister...

289
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,340
Little lady.

290
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:38,930
Huh?

291
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,630
Sorry.

292
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,280
My mistake, young man.

293
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,090
What's wrong?

294
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,100
Did something happen?

295
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,890
My friend and I...

296
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,410
got into a fight.

297
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
He said...

298
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,920
he never wants to see me again.

299
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,920
It's all right.

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,460
Mister...

301
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
To put it simply,

302
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,030
I'm passing this hot potato to
an upperclassman from his school.

303
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,180
I'm sure you two can make up.

304
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,280
I'll go with you to apologize.

305
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,270
Thank you.

306
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,480
Mister...

307
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,830
Calling it "passing the hot potato"

308
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,950
might sound harsh,

309
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,360
but I ask you all to take a look at me right now.

310
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,380
My hair is a mess.

311
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,830
I have dark circles under my eyes.

312
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,820
My complexion is terrible.

313
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,050
I'm in sandals and sweats.

314
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,680
A listless, weird-looking guy like me,

315
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,850
talking to a kid who at first glance
looks like a beautiful girl...

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,060
what do you think would happen?

317
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,130
Right, this would happen.

318
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,200
(Report of unwanted advances.
Beware of suspicious individuals.)

319
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,280
To avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings,

320
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,010
passing the baton to a clean-cut,
handsome guy like him

321
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,120
is the best choice.

322
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,930
Let's go.

323
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,240
Okay.

324
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,420
These two...

325
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,530
had no idea at the time

326
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,000
that a 25-year-old grad student
and a 13-year-old middle schooler

327
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,650
would one day overcome their 12-year age gap

328
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,950
and become lovers.

329
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,840
I wish you happiness,

330
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,460
you future lovebirds.

331
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,720
Um...

332
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,750
What are you muttering to yourself about?

333
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,180
Oh, it's nothing.

334
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
That was close.

335
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,280
I almost ended up looking like a creep.

336
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,020
But this time,

337
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,030
I managed to dodge another flag beautifully.

338
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
However,

339
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,380
at that moment,

340
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,840
I had yet to realize

341
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,920
the fateful

342
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,120
age-gap romance

343
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,140
that was about to befall me.

344
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,080
Could it be possible...

345
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,170
that person is...

346
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,230
Paper's done.

347
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,790
Time to hurry home and play some games.

348
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,380
Can't wait.

349
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,810
Well, well, I, the NPC,

350
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,940
have once again magnificently dodged a flag.

351
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,420
Who?

352
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,130
Why are you staring at me like that?

353
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Huh?

354
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,820
As for the reason, find out next time.

355
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,700
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

356
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,950
(Next Episode)
I like you.

357
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,770
I... I like you.

358
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,860
(vs. The Confession Arc)
It's basically a confession.

359
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,230
This is the most classic flag of them all.

360
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,530
You're the only one I like.

361
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,330
(vs. The Cupid Arc)
As for this confession,

362
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,320
I have to figure out how to dodge it.

363
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,440
You two

364
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,180
just haven't realized your own feelings yet.

365
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,420
Hateno, go get a haircut.

366
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,100
Long hair isn't your style, is it?

367
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,410
There's something I need to talk to you about alone.

368
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,280
What am I gonna do now?

369
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,240
What should I do?
