1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 21

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,120
A long time ago,

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,960
I started to visit you.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,360
I drove you to your workplace.

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,160
When you got off work, I picked you up.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,760
I gave you flowers in the morning.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,080
I had dinner with you at night.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,840
I doted on you like you were a princess.

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,840
I used to look at you

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,880
for a whole day.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,680
I commended your gentleness.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,120
You were the apple of my eye.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,720
I didn't want to

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
see anyone except you.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,200
What kind of relationship do you think we have?

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,800
About those,

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,000
aren't they stories I made up to fool you?

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,240
Do you still remember?

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,560
Can your concerns be removed now?

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,080
What concerns?

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,760
I don't ask you for anything.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,520
Right.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
My turn now.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
What's your relationship with Fang Lie?

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,640
We are friends, of course.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Why do you ask?

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,880
Is it that only you take him as a friend

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
or both of you

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,320
feel the same way?

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,040
Of course we both...

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,680
What about me?

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Don't I mean anything to you?

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,280
Aren't you a little paranoiac?

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,200
Fang Lie is not as complicated as you think.

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,800
The problem is me.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
I haven't treated him

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
in a fair way.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,040
Enough.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
You asked.

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,640
I did think

59
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,800
he looked handsome.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,080
Shut up.

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,320
If there isn't anything else,

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
I'll leave.

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,160
Wait.

64
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,920
When will you accept me?

65
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,040
What?

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,960
Do you think

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
that I have no feelings?

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,720
Even if I don't have,

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,000
I will still feel hurt

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
after being hurt by you for so long.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,040
I'd like...

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,120
I'd like to wait

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,400
till the day

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
when I'm no longer afraid of being hurt.

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Then I will give you my answer.

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,960
Why?

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,400
You must have something important to tell me

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
or you would not have asked to meet so late.

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
This is what you have always been looking for.

80
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
=Heterosexual Amnesia=

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Is this...

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,560
You have been trying to defeat Fang Leng.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
I know that

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
you suspect that he has lost his memory,

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
but you have been unfortunate to obtain any evidence.

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
How did you get the evidence?

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Does that matter?

88
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,440
I don't know what you are talking about.

89
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,480
No need of hiding it anymore.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,200
If I were helping Fang Leng against you,

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,520
was it necessary to play such a trick

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,160
despite my abilities?

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
Then why are you doing this?

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
Did you

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,080
always want to marry him?

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,800
When you try to tame a prey,

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,800
it's far from enough to treat it well.

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,760
When it tries to leave you,

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,520
you have to learn how to punish it.

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,880
When it has tasted enough bitterness,

101
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,600
it will know

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
who is

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,160
the one it can depend on.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
It seems

105
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,360
I underestimated you.

106
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,560
I've got only one condition.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Say it.

108
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,160
Never let Fang Leng trace it back to me.

109
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,560
Or

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,640
I'll make you regret even more than him.

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
I never thought

112
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
I'd be back so soon.

113
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,600
Chai...

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,880
Ms. Chai.

115
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,600
Ms. Chai.

116
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,000
Ms. Chai.

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
Ms. Chai.

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Wow!

119
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,520
Ms. Chai,

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,960
have you cleaned up for me?

121
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,200
Wait.

122
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,760
This will be the cleaning cost plus the rent.

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
Don't forget it.

124
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
Ms. Chai,

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,400
you are just the same as I met you for the first time.

126
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,160
You are so kind.

127
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,160
Thank you.

128
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,480
Silly girl.

129
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,000
If anything happens to you again,

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
just tell me.

131
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
I can help you.

132
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,120
Got it?

133
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, I may have to live here.

134
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
Will it bother you?

135
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,120
No way!

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
It's so bothering.

137
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,960
You'd better bother me for the rest of my life.

138
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,800
OK.

139
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,840
What a long day.

140
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,040
Go to bed now.

141
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,920
Mr. Fang,

142
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,080
this is the document you asked. I...

143
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you going out?

144
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240
I'll check the documents on our way.

145
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,400
How do I look?

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,040
Nice.

147
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,600
Wait.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
You have just checked out from the hospital.

149
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,160
And you are going out every day.

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
Anything has happened to Xiaoqi?

151
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,720
No.

152
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,040
But you are right.

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm going to see her.

154
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,080
Why?

155
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,960
I have fallen out with Jiang Xue,

156
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
and I have offended Chairman Fang.

157
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
We don't have much time left.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,520
Let's go.

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,280
Are you saying

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
that the Chairman will try to separate you?

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
I have to settle this down

162
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
before he tries anything.

163
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,280
Eh.

164
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,960
Morning, Ms. Chai.

165
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
What is he doing here?

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
Isn't it obvious?

167
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,120
He's been waiting for you all morning.

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,760
Ms. Chai,

169
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,520
do you have time today?

170
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm going to work.

171
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,480
Why?

172
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,280
That's good.

173
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm going to the office, too.

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,800
Let me give you a ride.

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
You have just had an operation.

176
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't go to work.

177
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
Who told you I was going to work?

178
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,280
I just want to give you a lift.

179
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,520
Ms. Chai is watching.

180
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,080
Don't act like this.

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I'll wait outside.

182
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,680
You can tell me now

183
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
what the matter is.

184
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,480
Nothing really.

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,320
I just want to experience.

186
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

187
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,040
Being pestered by you.

188
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,520
And

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,440
running to the company with you.

190
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,960
You have remembered?

191
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
Assistant Han told me.

192
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,920
He also said that you were trying

193
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,280
to cure me.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,600
Weren't you?

195
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
It's all in the past.

196
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,360
Did Assistant Han also tell you that?

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,960
What?

198
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,360
Walking me across the street holding my hand.

199
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,960
Did I

200
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,680
often walk you across the street holding your hand?

201
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
No.

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Go on.

203
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,840
We are almost there.

204
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Stop following me.

205
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,760
I'll escort you upstairs.

206
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,760
Don't.

207
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,240
People are watching

208
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
and talking.

209
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,800
What's wrong?

210
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
Morning, Mr. Fang.

211
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
Morning.

212
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,360
Even if you don't care about your reputation,

213
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,120
I care about mine.

214
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,560
Morning.

215
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Let me go.

216
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
My hand hurts.

217
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,640
Do you wish my wound opens?

218
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,440
What?

219
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,280
Unbelievable.

220
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,600
Let go of me.

221
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,960
Morning.

222
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,400
Morning.

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,200
Let go.

224
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,600
I'll get angry if you go on like this.

225
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,280
Do you remember when I scolded you last time?

226
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,200
You scolded me many times.

227
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,640
Which one?

228
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
I asked you to leave in front of all colleagues.

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,240
You said that

230
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,320
I hurt you too many times.

231
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I'd like to make up for you.

232
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,120
Mr. Fang, good morning.

233
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,480
I'll pick you up later.

234
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,240
I didn't

236
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,720
mean to do that.

237
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,600
Fang Lie.

238
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,680
Didn't you leave?

239
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes,

240
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,560
I did.

241
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,640
But I'm back.

242
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,720
Something happened.

243
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,680
I am sorry

244
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,000
that I didn't have time to tell you about it.

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
Don't be mad at me.

246
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
In each of the two sentences you just said,

247
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,040
there is a sorry.

248
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
Do you really feel sorry to me?

249
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920
I know I sort of put love before friendship

250
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,560
and I said something that hurt you.

251
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,360
But I didn't mean it.

252
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,880
I didn't have a choice.

253
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,000
How about

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
you say something to hurt me?

255
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,480
Then we can be even.

256
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,440
Hurt you?

257
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,320
How?

258
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
How?

259
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Just say what you want to say most.

260
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,320
And I don't mind

261
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,440
if you go harsh on me

262
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,000
or even beat me up.

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,480
Come on.

264
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,480
The thing I want to say most.

265
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
If I say it,

266
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
I'm afraid we could not be friends anymore.

267
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,120
Yes, we can.

268
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
We have agreed to hurt each other.

269
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,640
It doesn't matter.

270
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
Just say it.

271
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,680
Come on.

272
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,960
Come on.

273
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,880
I...

274
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,840
I like you.

275
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,800
What?

276
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,160
I like you.

277
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,520
I like you.

278
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,160
I like...

279
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,120
No more.

280
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,760
Aren't we friends?

281
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,720
How can you like me?

282
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,160
I don't know.

283
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,040
At the beginning,

284
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
I did take you as a friend.

285
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
To avoid my brother,

286
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I turned to you for help.

287
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,080
When I got upset,

288
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,360
I hung out with you for a drink.

289
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,960
No matter how useless I am in others' eyes,

290
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,280
you have never looked down on me.

291
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,280
To save me,

292
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,800
you even jumped in the fire.

293
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,680
For the first time in my life,

294
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,920
I felt that I could live

295
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
outside Leng's shadow.

296
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,240
But later

297
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,280
when you broke up with him,

298
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,200
I watched you being sad

299
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
and doing everything for him.

300
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,560
We were no longer as happy as before.

301
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,440
I wanted to help

302
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
to turn you back

303
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
to the happy Chai Xiaoqi you used to be.

304
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,320
In the process,

305
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,360
I started to feel an urge to protect you,

306
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,080
which

307
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
turned into caring,

308
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,360
which

309
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,480
has turned into love.

310
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
I like you when you are doing something silly,

311
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
I like it when you love someone without hesitation,

312
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,840
I like working with you,

313
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,520
and I like you when you do nothing

314
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
and just stay with me.

315
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,320
Xiaoqi,

316
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
could you try to forget him

317
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,440
and love me?

318
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,320
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,600
Dare you say

320
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,480
that you have never

321
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,240
had any feelings for me since the beginning?

322
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,040
I did.

323
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
I did

324
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,280
like you before.

325
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That was because of your good look.

326
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,800
But now

327
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,480
I don't feel that way anymore.

328
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,080
Is it because of my brother?

329
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,120
No.

330
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
It's just me.

331
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,560
It's because I

332
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
don't want to handle such matters now.

333
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,680
You decided to leave.

334
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,600
Why are you back?

335
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,520
And today,

336
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,360
why did you come here with my brother?

337
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,480
Are you back together?

338
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,360
No.

339
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,000
Anyway,

340
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,320
the fact is that

341
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
it's impossible between you and I.

342
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,000
You'd better just forget about it.

343
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,160
Oh my god!

344
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,960
Oh my god!

345
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,880
What's going on?

346
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,960
It is Fang Leng at first,

347
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,680
and it is Fang Lie now.

348
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,600
Are they out of their mind?

349
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,320
Kubri,

350
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
what should I do?

351
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,040
You are asking me?

352
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,040
You should ask yourself.

353
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,320
Ask what?

354
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,880
Which one of the two brothers do you love?

355
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,280
You have turned down Fang Lie.

356
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,240
I'd suggest

357
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,960
you start over with Fang Leng.

358
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,400
No.

359
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
I am now completely confused.

360
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,640
I just want to stay alone.

361
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,680
People say

362
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
that humans are capricious.

363
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,760
Will their feelings for me just stop

364
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,840
after some time?

365
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,240
Are you saying that you just wait for them to drop the idea?

366
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,840
Yes,

367
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,360
I'll wait for them to drop it.

368
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
Humans are quite right

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
that it's better to have short pains than long pains.

370
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,800
If I keep turning them down,

371
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,640
they will stop wasting their time on me.

372
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,440
So it is decided.

373
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,960
Problem is solved!

374
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,360
Is there any field job in the department?

375
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,400
Yes,

376
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,360
business trips, client visits and surveys.

377
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Which one are you talking about?

378
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,640
Any is OK

379
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
as long as I don't have to face Fang Lie.

380
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,320
Ah?

381
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,080
I mean

382
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,200
since there is lot of gossip recently,

383
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
it's better for me to avoid Director Fang.

384
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,360
How about this?

385
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,160
I have been assigned a job to visit a client,

386
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,200
but I've been too busy.

387
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,040
How about

388
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
you go for me?

389
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm on my way now.

390
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,480
If you avoid him like that,

391
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,400
aren't you afraid you will fall out of his favor?

392
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,960
It's best that he dislikes me.

393
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,320
Ah?

394
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,920
By the way,

395
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,280
no matter what happens,

396
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
if the director asks,

397
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,160
you should answer that you have never seen me.

398
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:45,920
And

399
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,280
stop him if he tries to find me.

400
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,840
Got it.

401
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,400
OK.

402
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,560
Off you go.

403
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,680
Mr. Fang,

404
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,040
I've booked the dinner as you required.

405
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,520
Anything else?

406
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,720
No.

407
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,680
Well,

408
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,520
shall I ask Miss Chai to come downstairs?

409
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,120
No.

410
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,120
I'll wait for her to get off.

411
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,520
Anything else?

412
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,160
No.

413
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Mr. Fang.

414
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,760
Mr. Fang.

415
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,240
What?

416
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Are you off?

417
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,640
Why?

418
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,440
Do you want to see me again?

419
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,840
I'm downstairs.

420
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,680
Get here now.

421
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,780
=Fang Leng=

422
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,300
=Xiaoqi=

423
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,760
I'm not in the office now.

424
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,000
And I don't want to meet you.

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Don't come to me again.

426
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,200
What does that mean?

427
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,520
It means that

428
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,240
I turn you down.

429
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,960
Can't I?

430
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,560
Why?

431
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,440
Because...

432
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Because I've recently been obsessed with work.

433
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
I don't want to do anything else.

434
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm hanging up.

435
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
Am I a bit too harsh?

436
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,280
But how can I make him drop the idea if I were not?

437
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,480
Leng!

438
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,640
Do you have time?

439
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,800
I'd like to have a word.

440
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,520
OK.

441
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
I've heard that you and Xiaoqi are getting back together. Right?

442
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,560
I know you are always friends.

443
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,400
If you think that I pretend

444
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
to be with her only to hurt her,

445
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,520
I have already confessed.

446
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,560
We are now rivals.

447
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,400
Ironical?

448
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,680
If you have any problem with me,

449
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,600
direct it to me.

450
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,160
Even now

451
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
you think I am kidding.

452
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,120
It's you who fiddle around.

453
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,880
I'm always serious about Xiaoqi.

454
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
But she is my girlfriend.

455
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,360
She was a long time ago.

456
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
To you,

457
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,640
Xiaoqi is only

458
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,200
one of many.

459
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,600
You can get rid of her whenever you want to.

460
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,800
You get her back whenever you want to.

461
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,560
Have you ever thought about her feelings?

462
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,520
It's a matter between me and her.

463
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,000
Do you have to fight me for her?

464
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,080
Except her,

465
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,200
I can give you anything.

466
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,560
What if she is the only thing I want?

467
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,800
Ever since we were kids,

468
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,760
I have never outperformed you in anything.

469
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,760
As time goes by,

470
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm already used to losing.

471
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,160
I just let go,

472
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,800
let you win.

473
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
It's all right.

474
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,000
But this time,

475
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
I don't want to lose anymore.

476
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,640
From now on,

477
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
the game is on.

478
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,960
I will do everything to get her.

479
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,920
If you think you can get her

480
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
by defeating me,

481
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,200
you are wrong.

482
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,000
Xiaoqi is a person

483
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,520
instead of an object.

484
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,200
She has her own ideas and emotions.

485
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,000
I'd suggest you ask her

486
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,120
who she will choose.

487
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,840
What's more,

488
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,080
I will do my best.

489
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,000
Sister, what took so long?

490
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Shida hasn't been very well these days.

491
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,720
I've been busy looking after him.

492
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,400
I've just

493
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,120
got a little time.

494
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,120
I have had this document verified.

495
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
The evidence provided by Jiang Xue is true.

496
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,000
That's good.

497
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,600
Look for an opportunity

498
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,000
to disclose it as soon as possible.

499
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,840
Do you really

500
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
want to do this?

501
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,040
Last time when we investigated Fang Leng,

502
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,480
Shida warned me.

503
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,240
Just because the Chairman is on his side,

504
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,280
we have to disclose the evidence to the outside.

505
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,720
When the media and the company both put pressure on him,

506
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,840
he'll certainly step down.

507
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,480
It is true,

508
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
but when I really get to do it,

509
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,520
I feel

510
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,800
weird.

511
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,400
Have you gone softened?

512
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,120
If Fang Leng steps down,

513
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,600
what will happen to Shida?

514
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
What if he suspects me?

515
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,640
And Lie

516
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,720
must hate me.

517
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,400
If I

518
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,200
ruin this family,

519
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,800
what should I do?

520
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Which one is more important,

521
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,880
this family or Lie's future?

522
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,960
If you are soft on them now,

523
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,360
you will miss the only chance.

524
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,600
Forget about it.

525
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,680
I know you would not do it.

526
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll have the evidence.

527
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,160
I'll handle it.

528
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,720
If they find out it's you,

529
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,440
what about your future?

530
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,160
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

531
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,400
Don't worry.

532
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,200
I'll have it done.

533
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,880
I don't want to go to work.

534
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,680
How am I going to avoid Fang Lie today?

535
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
It's your fault.

536
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,040
We should have left by now,

537
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,480
if you didn't want to stay for Fang Leng.

538
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm not going to work.

539
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,240
No.

540
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,640
I have turned down Fang Lie.

541
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,240
If I'm still avoiding him,

542
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,440
doesn't it mean that I didn't tell the truth?

543
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,720
I must act normal.

544
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,980
=Fang Lie=

545
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
What should I do?

546
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,280
Hello,

547
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,640
what's the matter?

548
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,800
I've heard that you went on a field trip yesterday.

549
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,520
How was it?

550
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,120
Did it go well?

551
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,200
Yes,

552
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,080
quite well.

553
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,960
What's wrong?

554
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,920
Nothing.

555
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,720
I just called to tell you

556
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
that I won't push you

557
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,680
and you don't have to avoid me.

558
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,240
And about work...

559
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,480
Fang Lie,

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I think

561
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,440
you'd better not to be so nice to me.

562
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,120
I know

563
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,160
you want us to be the same as before.

564
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
Whenever anything happened to me,

565
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,080
you were always the first who came

566
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,840
to help.

567
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,760
But...

568
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,880
But now

569
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,560
we just can't be friends.

570
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,080
I don't want your favors

571
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,840
in the name of friend.

572
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
Just treat me

573
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,560
as everyone else does.

574
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,720
What are you talking about?

575
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,560
I called for business.

576
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,640
I've let go

577
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,320
what happened yesterday.

578
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,080
You have?

579
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,960
Then I misunderstood you.

580
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
You are right.

581
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,120
We can't occupy ourselves by personal
affairs and leave aside our work.

582
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,040
Therefore,

583
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
will you still work in my department?

584
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,000
Of course.

585
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,840
Well then,

586
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,600
let me ask you as your superior.

587
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,960
What's your plan for today?

588
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
Today...

589
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,440
Oh,

590
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,160
I haven't met the client who is supposed to be met yesterday.

591
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,160
I probably won't be able to go to the office today.

592
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,360
That's good.

593
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,560
I'll go with you.

594
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:09,920
Ah?

595
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,480
Hello,

596
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,400
Fang Lie?

597
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,760
Aren't we right back to the start?

598
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,080
Ms. Chai.

599
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,160
Ms. Chai.

600
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,320
If someone I don't want to meet

601
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,520
insists on meeting me

602
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,040
and is about to meet me soon,

603
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,800
what should I do?

604
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
What should I do,

605
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,760
Ms. Chai?

606
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
Am I the guy you don't want to meet?

607
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,080
What are you doing here?

608
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
You haven't explained our issue.

609
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,480
What to be explained?

610
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,680
I just don't want to have anything to do with you.

611
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,440
I want to be left alone.

612
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Is it because of Fang Lie?

613
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,040
Ah?

614
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,720
What did you say?

615
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,320
I don't understand

616
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,240
what you mean.

617
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,660
=Fang Lie=

618
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,680
I'm going to work.

619
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,360
See you.

620
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,040
It happens that

621
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm going to do an employee observation.

622
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,480
I've decided it's you.

623
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,160
You...

624
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,240
Hey.

625
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,560
What is he doing here?

626
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,600
I...

627
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,320
He....

628
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,840
Is this the client you are meeting?

629
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,680
No. He...

630
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,600
Well...

631
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,520
I'm her superior

632
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,560
and it's normal that I meet her.

633
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,680
But you,

634
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,080
you are the president.

635
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,800
Is it necessary to waste your time on an employee?

636
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,160
I don't have to report to a subordinate

637
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,880
whom I waste my time on.

638
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,280
Come here.

639
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,000
You...

640
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,920
Xiaoqi.

641
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,160
What are you doing?

642
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,480
Fang Lie!

643
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,440
Leng!

644
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,520
Enough!

645
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,960
I'm working.

646
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,280
Could you show some respect?

647
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,920
You do your job.

648
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm only observing.

649
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,400
Aren't you going to meet a client?

650
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,160
Let's go.

651
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,080
Client?

652
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,160
I have to make a call.

653
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,600
Please wait a minute.

654
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,760
I'm calling the client.

655
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,320
Wait.

656
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,920
I was trying to avoid Fang Lie when I told him about the client.

657
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,800
What should I do now?

658
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,320
Let me

659
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,120
think of some ways to calm them down.

660
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,160
And then

661
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,240
I'll look for opportunities to make them retreat voluntarily.

662
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,760
I have only to escape.

663
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,920
Good idea.

664
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,560
Well,

665
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,560
I've made the appointment.

666
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,280
Let's go.

667
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:49,880
Eh,

668
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,240
wait.

669
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
I'd like to talk about the work with you.

670
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,360
Ride on my car.

671
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,400
Wait.

672
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,840
I'll ride too.

673
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
Is the client difficult?

674
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,480
No.

675
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,280
Why?

676
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,960
You look quite troubled.

677
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,160
Are we getting in your way?

678
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,080
No...

679
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,560
A bit perhaps.

680
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,720
So,

681
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,040
could you please stop following me?

682
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,120
-No. -No.

683
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
I can't leave you

684
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,000
with Fang Lie.

685
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,560
I can't leave you with Xiaoqi.

686
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,880
I'll accompany Xiaoqi anyway.

687
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,680
All right.

688
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,880
I know

689
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,400
you use work as an excuse to haunt me.

690
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,480
You've made the decision.

691
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,680
Do not regret later.

692
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,600
What are you going to do?

693
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,120
Turn left at the crossing.

694
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,840
Stop there.

695
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,080
OK.

696
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,400
No problem, eh?

697
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,320
No problem to defeat you.

698
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,440
Well,

699
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm sorry to say

700
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,960
that the client has asked to play tennis.

701
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,760
I want to learn and practice first.

702
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,240
Could you teach me how to play?

703
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,920
Is it necessary to meet such a client?

704
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,400
I'll teach you.

705
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,520
My brother

706
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,480
has just recovered

707
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,720
and is not suitable to do any sport.

708
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,840
I'll do it.

709
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,440
Wait.

710
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,360
The wound is no big deal.

711
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,840
I'll do it.

712
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,040
Wait.

713
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
If you don't mind,

714
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,680
you can teach me together.

715
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
Let's see.

716
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,840
Let me show you what tennis is.

717
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,560
Go on.

718
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,400
Fang Lie!

719
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,440
Are you alright?

720
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,520
Did I do it wrong?

721
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,480
No.

722
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,840
I wasn't focused.

723
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,360
Again.

724
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
You can't even hold the racket.

725
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,080
Watch and learn.

726
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,880
Good.

727
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,600
I got it.

728
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,560
I got it.

729
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,800
I got it.

730
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,560
Make way.

731
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,840
Are you feeling alright?

732
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,280
I can't.

733
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,200
I can't.

734
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,320
Really?

735
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,640
It's been only two hours

736
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,480
and you are exhausted?

737
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,880
I've not yet warmed up.

738
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Come on. Let's go on.

739
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,680
Xiaoqi,

740
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,640
you are absolutely professional.

741
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,480
Are you making fun of us?

742
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,040
No.

743
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,560
It's my first time.

744
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,960
How about we play something else?

745
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,480
Basketball?

746
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,760
Football?

747
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,160
Or sumo?

748
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,360
High jump?

749
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,560
Choose one.

750
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,600
Where is your client?

751
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,520
When will he arrive?

752
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,800
He should be

753
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,720
here in three hours.

754
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,320
Mr. Liu.

755
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,360
Excuse me.

756
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,960
I've got to take this.

757
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,840
OK.

758
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
Do you want so much to get rid of us?

759
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,040
Since you know it,

760
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,000
why are you here?

761
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:26,760
Let's go.

762
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,880
Xiaoqi.

763
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,680
Are you alright?

764
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,840
How are you feeling?

765
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,880
Silly you.

766
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,120
You shouldn't have played if you are wounded.

767
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,320
I just want to make it difficult for you so you will back off.

768
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,840
You should have gone home.

769
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,240
No.

770
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,520
Why not?

771
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,560
I can't give you to him.

772
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,020
Ever since I met you,

773
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,660
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

774
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,900
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

775
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
only you.

776
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,140
We're out of reach

777
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,580
but appreciate each other.

778
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,400
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

779
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,460
The yearning invades

780
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,980
and lurks in my mind.

781
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:47,380
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

782
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,500
I'm getting addicted to it

783
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,820
and my sense is shielded.

784
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:01,500
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

785
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,780
Put the hottest heart

786
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,140
in this cold body.

787
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,460
I'm looking at you,

788
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,700
and my love has nowhere to go.

789
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
Ever since I met you,

790
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,300
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

791
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,980
Every day is a new memory

792
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,140
which is only be about you and me.

793
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,340
I can't lie to myself anymore.

794
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,260
Please give me the courage to believe.

795
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,300
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

796
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,180
only you.

797
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Even everything becomes silent,

798
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,540
I still have you.
