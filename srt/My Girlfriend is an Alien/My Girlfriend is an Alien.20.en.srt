1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,540
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 20

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,120
I love you.

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,320
I can do this.

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,120
Please.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,800
Let me save him.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm begging you.

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
Let me save him.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
I'd even stay here

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,080
just to save him.

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Let me save him.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,600
For once.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,960
Please.

30
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,320
Xiaoqi.

31
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,680
What happened?

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,200
Nothing.

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,120
Xiaoqi.

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's get out.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Wake up.

36
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Wake up.

37
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,280
Fang Leng.

38
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,480
Feeling better?

39
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,160
Xiaoqi.

40
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,360
Xiaoqi.

41
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,400
You've woken up, Xiaoqi.

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,800
Are you okay?

43
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,280
Hum.

44
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,280
Where is Fang Leng?

45
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,520
How is he?

46
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
We just came back from the hospital.

47
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,760
Have you forgotten?

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
You should go back and keep him company.

49
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll get going.

50
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Wait.

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
When my brother recovers

52
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,640
and things settle down,

53
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,360
I will tell you something.

54
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,320
What is it?

55
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,240
You'll know when the time comes.

56
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Go in.

57
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll watch you.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Wake up.

59
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,920
Please.

60
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,520
I can choose not to go back.

61
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,480
I love you.

62
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,880
Fang Lie.

63
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,560
Brother.

64
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,280
You are awake.

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
How do you feel?

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,040
Do you feel uncomfortable?

67
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Are you okay?

68
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,000
Feeling better?

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,400
Fang Lie.

70
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't touch him.

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,520
You'll crush him.

72
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,520
Now that you are awake, I will inform the doctor.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,400
Right.

74
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,120
I should call our father

75
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,200
and tell him about this.

76
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,040
Wait.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,480
Where is she?

78
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,480
Huh?

79
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,400
Who?

80
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,960
Where is Xiaoqi?

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
I remember I was with her

82
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,960
when I passed out.

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,440
I don't know what happened after that.

84
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,320
Do you have any idea how badly you were wounded?

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,920
You were dying when you were sent to the hospital.

86
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
Dad, mom, Jiang Xue and I.

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
We all came.

88
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,480
We waited so long for the doctor to bring you back to life.

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,360
And you are still thinking about Xiaoqi?

90
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,520
Leng.

91
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,640
Do you still love her?

92
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,440
Did anything happen to Fang Leng?

93
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,480
Hello?

94
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
How is Fang Leng?

95
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,160
He...

96
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,080
Did something bad happen to him?

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,840
My brother is fine.

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
Don't worry.

99
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Good.

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
Are you coming to the hospital to check on him?

101
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,080
No.

102
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
Knowing he's fine is enough.

103
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,560
I won't bother him anymore.

104
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
There's something

105
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know whether I should tell you.

106
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,200
What is it?

107
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
My brother...

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,520
You...

109
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,440
My brother...

110
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm leaving.

111
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,600
What did you say?

112
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,440
The ties between me, Fang Leng

113
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,800
and everything else here

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,240
have been severed.

115
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,600
So,

116
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,400
I won't stay any longer.

117
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,400
Goodbye.

118
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,240
What's wrong?

119
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
Mr. Fang is alright.

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
However,

121
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,680
he seems to be recovering too fast.

122
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,320
Do you feel anything unusual?

123
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,960
Not for now.

124
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,680
I heard someone calling me during my coma.

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,160
Did anyone

126
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,040
come to visit me last night?

127
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,000
Right.

128
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,040
Lie stayed here with you last night.

129
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
Perhaps that boy's sincere

130
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
calling

131
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
brought you back.

132
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,800
Am I right, Shida?

133
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,920
There's no such coincidence.

134
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,200
We should thank the doctor

135
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,640
for Fang Leng regaining consciousness.

136
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
This lady speaks

137
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
with sense.

138
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,680
People in danger

139
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
need spiritual support.

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,280
Surely, Mr. Fang

141
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,560
has great concern for someone.

142
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,920
That's why

143
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,200
he woke up.

144
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,360
It shows

145
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,960
how close Mr. Fang and his brother are.

146
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,960
Yes.

147
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
Well then,

148
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
we will stop bothering him.

149
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,800
Have a good rest.

150
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,040
Thank you, doctor.

151
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
Let's go.

152
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
I need to talk

153
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
to Fang Leng.

154
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,160
Oh.

155
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,120
How do you feel now?

156
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm sorry, dad,

157
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,680
for worrying you.

158
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
It's not your fault.

159
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,160
It's my fault.

160
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
I shouldn't have spoiled you.

161
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,200
For all these years,

162
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
I kept in mind the fact that your mother died young.

163
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,600
No matter what you did out there,

164
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,680
I always turned a blind eye.

165
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,400
But this time...

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
Dad, my coma

167
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,800
has nothing to do with others.

168
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,280
I didn't even bring her up.

169
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't hasten to protect her.

170
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,720
There's a shard in your heart.

171
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
Maybe it will...

172
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,760
What I'm saying is

173
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
you should consider

174
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,000
starting a family before you grow old.

175
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,480
What do you mean?

176
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,200
Before you passed out,

177
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,720
I had talked to Ms. Jiang.

178
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
In terms of personality and background,

179
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,320
she's the most suitable wife for you.

180
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Besides,

181
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,040
she can take care of you

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,840
in daily life.

183
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,320
So?

184
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
What is your point?

185
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm no longer young.

186
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,360
I can't take up more problems from you.

187
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,960
In short,

188
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,600
you need to be engaged to Ms. Jiang

189
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,960
after the hospital discharges you.

190
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
Dad, I died once.

191
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you know what I was thinking

192
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
during my coma?

193
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,640
I wasn't thinking about the Fang family

194
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,440
or my career.

195
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
I was thinking about myself.

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,080
For all these years,

197
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
I lived for other people.

198
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
I never thought about

199
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,400
what I really wanted.

200
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,360
But this time,

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,040
I really know

202
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,440
what I want.

203
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,400
You can't be telling me that

204
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,240
you want that woman, can you?

205
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm telling you.

206
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,600
I want to stop living for other people.

207
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,320
Go back and rest.

208
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,960
I wish to be alone.

209
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,640
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

210
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm not ready.

211
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,200
Come on.

212
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
I'll come back someday.

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
What about Fang Leng?

214
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,120
He's still in the hospital.

215
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,720
Are you leaving him behind?

216
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,000
He...

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,400
He'll be fine.

218
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,360
He'll be happy about my departure.

219
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,040
Xiaoqi.

220
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,040
Are you in there?

221
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Xiaoqi.

222
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,040
She's here!

223
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
She's here!

224
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,680
Stop knocking. She's here.

225
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,120
Great. Go for it.

226
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,640
Xiaoqi.

227
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,040
Don't try to persuade me.

228
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
I have made up my mind.

229
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,320
Just think me as the little prince.

230
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,880
I've returned to my home planet.

231
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,120
Why?

232
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,320
I know you feel guilty about

233
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,880
hurting my brother.

234
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,120
But you don't have to give up the whole Earth for him.

235
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
I wish.

236
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,840
If only I can leave Earth.

237
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,760
I shouldn't have stayed here in the first place.

238
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
I used to have hope.

239
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,160
Now,

240
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,160
I don't even have that anymore.

241
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,160
Do you mean my brother

242
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,160
by hope?

243
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,240
Pretty much.

244
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,800
He carries my hope anyway.

245
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,760
What about me?

246
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Don't I have

247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,560
a place in your heart?

248
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,880
I don't have a heart.

249
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
You know that.

250
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,400
Though you are my friend,

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,720
I won't stay for you.

252
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
I have made up my mind.

253
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,400
Go.

254
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,800
Xue.

255
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,920
Uncle.

256
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
Get in the car. I want to talk to you.

257
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,120
Okay.

258
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,360
Uncle.

259
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,560
Hasn't Fang Leng woken up?

260
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,720
Is he alright now?

261
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,480
He's fine.

262
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,920
However,

263
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,720
you'd better not see him these days.

264
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,280
Why?

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
Did he say something

266
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
to you?

267
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,480
It doesn't matter to you

268
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,240
what he said

269
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,360
or thought.

270
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,160
The point is,

271
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,960
I recognize you as my daughter-in-law.

272
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,800
He just woke up.

273
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,560
His mind is addled.

274
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,360
If you see him now,

275
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,800
things may go against our will.

276
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Wait a while.

277
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,760
I will make him accept you.

278
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,240
I know.

279
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,280
It's very hard to

280
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,960
change his mind.

281
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,680
Don't worry though, uncle.

282
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,320
I believe that

283
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,280
Fang Leng will come back to me.

284
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,200
After he recovers,

285
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,080
I will talk to him.

286
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,320
Xue,

287
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
if you regret,

288
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
I won't force you.

289
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
I never do anything I will regret.

290
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,520
Thank you for what happened today.

291
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,880
I'll get going.

292
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,520
Assistant Han.

293
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,400
Assistant Han.

294
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,040
Assistant Han.

295
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,600
He's busy

296
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,160
working at the company right now.

297
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,640
You should

298
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,080
rest to recuperate in the hospital.

299
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,760
It's been a day.

300
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,560
Why is nobody here to visit me?

301
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,440
What are you talking about?

302
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,200
What, I don't count as a person?

303
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,320
No.

304
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
It's just that we blocked

305
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,520
the news of your illness.

306
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,040
We didn't tell the company or media.

307
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,520
So...

308
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,560
I'm referring to other people,

309
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
such as my ex-girlfriend.

310
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,120
You mean

311
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,280
Xiaoqi, right?

312
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,680
She didn't come.

313
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:03,960
Here.

314
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,830
(Xiaoqi)

315
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,440
Hello.

316
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,880
Xiaoqi.

317
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Where are you?

318
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm at home.

319
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,960
Why are you

320
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,200
calling me at this late hour?

321
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,520
I...

322
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,480
I need to

323
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,320
talk to you.

324
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,360
Tell her to visit you.

325
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,240
You are the reason why I'm hospitalized.

326
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,720
Shouldn't you compensate me?

327
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,440
Got it.

328
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,360
Why did she hang up?

329
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,320
You should have told Xiaoqi to visit you.

330
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,720
You...

331
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,160
Why did you ask her to compensate you?

332
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
You told me to ask.

333
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,920
Make another call.

334
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,800
Tell her to visit you.

335
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
(Domestic remittance)

336
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,760
Hello?

337
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,000
I have transferred the compensation to your company account.

338
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,520
Remember to check your account.

339
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,920
What do you mean?

340
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,400
Are you trying to silence me with money?

341
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,480
What else can I do?

342
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,960
Don't forget that

343
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
I extorted lots of money from your father.

344
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,240
I can use some of the money to compensate you

345
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
and still have enough to spend for the rest of my life.

346
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,080
My dad...

347
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
Did he make things difficult for you?

348
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,720
I heard from the doctor that you sent me to the hospital.

349
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,080
When you saw my father,

350
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,560
did he scold you?

351
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,760
No.

352
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,800
I ignored him.

353
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,440
I entrusted you to the doctor and left.

354
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,640
Good.

355
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,880
Xiaoqi.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
What else do you need?

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
My illness is not your fault.

358
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,000
I have given much thought

359
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
to our relationship.

360
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
If you have time...

361
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,360
I don't have time.

362
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,080
What did you say?

363
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,720
I'm busy.

364
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't have time to keep you company in the hospital.

365
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,480
I don't have time to care about you.

366
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,440
From now on,

367
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,560
we should stop contacting each other.

368
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,880
Got to go.

369
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,320
Goodbye.

370
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,880
What did Xiaoqi say?

371
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
She said she won't come to me.

372
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,640
Go out.

373
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
I wish to be alone.

374
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,800
Okay.

375
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,240
It seems I can only offer you so much help.

376
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,560
I'll get going.

377
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,640
I just remembered.

378
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,160
When I came to visit you last night,

379
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,800
I saw Xiaoqi leaving your ward.

380
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,440
She was extremely weak.

381
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
Fang Lie held her in his arms as he took her out.

382
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,560
I knew it.

383
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,800
I heard her calling me.

384
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,360
Perhaps,

385
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,320
she has a reason

386
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,200
that she can't tell.

387
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,280
Doctor Zhang,

388
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,760
do me a favor.

389
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,240
Ask Xiaoqi to come

390
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,840
to the hospital in your name.

391
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,720
I don't want to keep speculating.

392
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,320
Okay.

393
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,120
Did you have to drink so much?

394
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,880
What's that about?

395
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Be careful.

396
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,920
Here.

397
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,520
Come here.

398
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,560
Slowly.

399
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Lie.

400
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,000
Tell me.

401
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,400
Why did you drink so much

402
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,120
liquor tonight?

403
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,560
One more question.

404
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,280
Who are you seeing?

405
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,040
Lie.

406
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,320
Mom.

407
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
What if dad is leaving you?

408
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,640
Why would you ask that?

409
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,760
What,

410
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,920
your dad has a mistress?

411
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,080
No.

412
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,080
I just want to know

413
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,680
how to keep someone at your side.

414
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,480
The most important thing is

415
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,000
to think for yourself.

416
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,480
You know what.

417
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,920
your father has

418
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,200
arranged Fang Leng's marriage.

419
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,080
If he marries Jiang Xue,

420
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,520
his strength will be doubled,

421
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,200
and you won't have a place

422
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,280
in the Fang family.

423
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
I'm thinking that

424
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,720
maybe

425
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,640
you should get a girlfriend too.

426
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,360
Mom.

427
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,400
You have finally smartened up.

428
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,920
What I'm saying is

429
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,680
you need to have a girlfriend

430
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,280
who is better than Jiang Xue

431
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,400
in every way.

432
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,640
And you must marry her

433
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,440
before they can get married.

434
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,680
First of all,

435
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
you will have a home.

436
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,000
What's more,

437
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,960
you will have career support.

438
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,160
It's killing two birds with one stone.

439
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,640
Yes.

440
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,000
I must not lose to my brother again.

441
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,680
Good.

442
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,640
I will start finding girls for you tomorrow.

443
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,040
Good boy.

444
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,000
Go to bed early.

445
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,000
I will get you back.

446
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
I will.

447
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,520
Ms. Chai.

448
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,240
I'm going.

449
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,840
Go.

450
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,560
There's no lack of waitresses in this restaurant.

451
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,760
I'll recruit a few tomorrow.

452
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,000
Ms. Chai.

453
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,240
Ms. Chai.

454
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,520
You're so heartless.

455
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,480
Leaving all of a sudden.

456
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,200
I've grown used to your presence.

457
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
Why?

458
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Ms. Chai, don't be like this.

459
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,320
You are making me reluctant to leave.

460
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,840
Ms. Chai.

461
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,040
Don't cry.

462
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,480
It's not like I won't come back.

463
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,280
I'll come back to visit you.

464
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,720
Then promise me

465
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
you would come back often.

466
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,200
I'll save the room upstairs for you.

467
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,080
This place will always be your home,

468
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,240
you know?

469
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,320
Stop crying.

470
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,960
Go now.

471
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,800
Delay no more, or I will regret and stop you.

472
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,200
I'm going then.

473
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,760
There's no way to keep a grown-up maiden at home.

474
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,560
Is everything normal?

475
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,440
They are normal.

476
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,240
You are recovering.

477
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,080
Write this down.

478
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,120
It's okay.

479
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,560
Go on. Go on.

480
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,560
Speak.

481
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,040
I don't want you to die of silence.

482
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,360
Promise me that

483
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,560
you won't be too emotional.

484
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,800
The thing is,

485
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,640
Xiaoqi might be leaving.

486
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,400
What do you mean?

487
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,920
I tried to tell her to come to the hospital today.

488
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,120
But I can't reach her on the phone.

489
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,440
Then I called the restaurant.

490
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,760
The owner said she was leaving

491
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,560
today.

492
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,720
Handle the discharge procedure for me.

493
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,160
You're not healthy enough to leave the hospital.

494
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,040
Assistant Han.

495
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,160
Pick me up at the hospital.

496
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,880
Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang.

497
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,400
You promised you won't be emotional.

498
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,200
Mr. Fang,

499
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,040
your heart is just starting to heal...

500
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,040
Where is she?

501
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,440
Has she left the restaurant?

502
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,360
Ah.

503
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,040
I'll ask right away.

504
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,040
(Chai Jie)

505
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,120
No one is answering.

506
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,600
Contact Fang Lie.

507
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,000
Huh?

508
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,840
Fang Lie knows she's leaving.

509
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Maybe he can make her stay.

510
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,460
=Assistant Han=

511
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,960
Hello?

512
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,880
Are you with Xiaoqi?

513
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,080
No.

514
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,360
Did she leave for real?

515
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,960
You got up so early.

516
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,640
Sit down.

517
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,880
Eat breakfast before going out for work.

518
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,720
I'll skip breakfast.

519
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,080
I need to leave and handle an urgent affair.

520
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,560
What's so urgent

521
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,560
that makes you rush?

522
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,320
I can't explain it quickly.

523
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,240
Mom.

524
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,360
Where is your bank card?

525
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,760
What do you need money for?

526
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
My client is going to another city.

527
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
I might need to go with him.

528
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,840
Give me some money to cover my traveling expenses.

529
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,680
Please, mom.

530
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,160
Take the money from my handbag.

531
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,000
Alright.

532
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,600
Mom,

533
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,040
as I follow someone to another city,

534
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,760
you must take care of yourself.

535
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,360
I love you.

536
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,800
Mom.

537
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:48,880
Dad.

538
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,400
I love you too.

539
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,920
Got to go.

540
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:37,960
Thank you.

541
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,280
Driver, hold on.

542
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,060
=Fang Lie=

543
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,480
Start the car, please.

544
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,520
What is this driver's problem?

545
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,120
Heck.

546
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,480
A real lunatic.

547
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,880
Are you crazy?

548
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,840
You have not yet recovered.

549
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,040
Do you know how dangerous that was?

550
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,600
Don't come close.

551
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,880
What are you doing?

552
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,200
Don't come close.

553
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,280
What are you doing?

554
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,480
I said don't come close.

555
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,520
Aren't you leaving? What's there to fear?

556
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
You caused such harm to me

557
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,640
without giving me an explanation.

558
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,240
You think I'll let you leave?

559
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,320
I already gave you the money to cover the medical expenses.

560
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,000
What else do you want?

561
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,760
I'm not talking about this.

562
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,920
I'm talking about our past.

563
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,440
Our past?

564
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,680
What is wrong with it?

565
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,080
You bothered me,

566
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,120
lied to me,

567
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,840
led me to misunderstandings,

568
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,440
and made me feel guilty.

569
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,320
I knew

570
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,760
I shouldn't have come close to you,

571
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,240
but I fell into your trap again and again.

572
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,320
I even fell in love with you.

573
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,080
I...

574
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,280
I didn't mean it.

575
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,560
I didn't know your love would send you to the hospital.

576
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,680
I want you to take responsibility for me.

577
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,080
Why should I take responsibility?

578
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,160
I'm telling you,

579
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,240
you can take my life, but not my money.

580
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,240
I won't give you

581
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,000
the rest of my money.

582
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,080
Then give yourself to me as compensation.

583
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,560
Don't come close.

584
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,240
What are you doing?

585
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,480
This is blackmail.

586
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,880
Do you know I waited for you?

587
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,280
Do you know I worried that you would leave

588
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,200
and my family would make things difficult for you?

589
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,480
When I was in a coma yesterday,

590
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,360
I even dreamed about you...

591
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,080
You shouting that you loved me.

592
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,360
I didn't say that.

593
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,080
Then why don't you look at me?

594
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,920
Look at me.

595
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,240
Tell me you have been faking your feelings from the start.

596
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,040
Tell me

597
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
you never loved me.

598
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,560
Say it.

599
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,920
I don't love you.

600
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,760
I have been faking my feelings from the start.

601
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,120
I approached you

602
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,800
to seduce you,

603
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
to take my possession back

604
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,000
from you.

605
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,720
But now,

606
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,920
you have destroyed my only possession.

607
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,920
I hate you.

608
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,560
I don't want to see you.

609
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,080
Alright?

610
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,360
What if I tell you I love you?

611
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,080
I know you used me.

612
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
But I still love you, Xiaoqi.

613
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,240
You...

614
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,800
What are you babbling about?

615
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,720
Don't you always hate me?

What's wrong?

628
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,960
Did I hurt you?

629
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,840
I'm sorry.

630
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,400
Where do you hurt?

631
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,760
Huh?

632
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,720
Are you okay?

633
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,680
What happened?

634
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
I didn't mean it.

635
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,720
Assistant Han.

636
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
This place is far from the hospital.

637
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,760
Call the doctor now

638
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
and tell them to wait at Fang Leng's home.

639
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,600
Got it.

640
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,560
Are you okay?

641
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,760
Where do you hurt? Tell me.

642
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,320
Are you alright?

643
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
I didn't mean it.

644
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,240
I...

645
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,240
Fang Leng left the hospital

646
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
for you.

647
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,280
As you see,

648
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,200
your doing has

649
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,760
aggravated his wound.

650
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,680
Don't you think you should

651
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,240
come with him

652
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,400
in sending him back?

653
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,160
Got it.

654
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,480
Support him for me.

655
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,320
No problem.

656
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,480
Driver.

657
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm not leaving.

658
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,000
Please unload my luggage.

659
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,520
Thank you.

660
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,800
Slowly.

661
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,000
Are you okay?

662
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,400
Huh?

663
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,760
What?

664
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
Fang Leng left the hospital?

665
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Yes.

666
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,720
Mr. Fang seemed to have an urgent affair to handle.

667
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,720
He left early this morning.

668
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,400
Thank you.

669
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:11,880
Here.

670
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,240
How are you?

671
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,320
Be careful.

672
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,720
Are you okay?

673
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,640
Is your condition still serious?

674
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,600
Still feeling a little pain.

675
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,240
I should be fine after resting for a while.

676
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,120
What to do then?

677
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,080
How about

678
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
we go back to the hospital?

679
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,400
Alright?

680
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,440
No.

681
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,800
No one would

682
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,920
take care of me in the hospital.

683
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,720
There are many documents for me to sign at the company.

684
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,440
I need to get back.

685
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,000
Cut the crap.

686
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,400
You mustn't do that.

687
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,960
I caused your wound.

688
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,080
I'm sorry.

689
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,040
It's nothing.

690
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,560
How about...

691
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,560
How about

692
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,520
I stay and take care of you?

693
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:56,840
Alright?

694
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,800
I'm a little thirsty.

695
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,120
May I have some water?

696
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,600
Okay.

697
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,280
I'll pour water for you.

698
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,800
Why are you here?

699
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,840
I...

700
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,960
Where is Fang Leng?

701
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,080
Where is he?

702
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,280
He...

703
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,360
Chai Xiaoqi.

704
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,920
What are you trying to do this time?

705
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,320
What are you doing?

706
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,520
I don't owe you anything.

707
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,880
Don't talk to me like that.

708
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Ms. Jiang, what do you need?

709
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,120
You guys can talk.

710
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,040
I'll get going.

711
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,040
What are you doing?

712
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,920
What is the meaning of this?

713
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,120
Xiaoqi.

714
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,640
I need to talk to Ms. Jiang.

715
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Stay here. Don't go away.

716
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,520
Why?

717
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,600
You think

718
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,480
I'm even inferior

719
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,320
to Chai Xiaoqi?

720
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,560
She is inferior to you.

721
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,280
You said it earlier.

722
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,640
We are too alike.

723
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
We have the same kind of family

724
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,800
and the same kind of mindset.

725
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Every time I see you,

726
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,400
I feel like seeing myself.

727
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,240
Us being together

728
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,000
would be a success.

729
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,560
Isn't success good?

730
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,240
It's good.

731
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,720
I just don't like it.

732
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,360
I've wanted to

733
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,280
say this to you.

734
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,640
I have used you

735
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,480
from the start.

736
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,440
I have used your identity

737
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,520
and your capability.

738
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,840
It felt like we were doing business.

739
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,280
We always

740
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,160
assessed each other's value.

741
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,120
Do you wish to

742
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,920
be a tool forever?

743
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,200
It's okay.

744
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,240
I don't mind you using me.

745
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,160
You know what,

746
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:51,960
I said the same thing

747
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,840
to Xiaoqi today.

748
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,880
We've been a wrong match since the beginning.

749
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I don't want to keep making this mistake.

750
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,000
What did you say?

751
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,440
Form the beginning?

752
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,000
You love her, right?

753
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,240
You love her so much that

754
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,160
you'd give up your career?

755
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,000
I led a life too cold.

756
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,920
Now,

757
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,560
I no longer wish to lead a cold life.

758
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,040
Good.

759
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,520
Hope you won't regret it.

760
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,240
Is everything alright

761
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,680
between you and Jiang Xue?

762
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,680
We are fine.

763
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,160
I just told her about

764
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
our relationship.

765
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,480
What kind of relationship

766
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
do we have?

767
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,160
A long time ago,

768
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,960
I started to visit you.

769
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:06,920
I drove you to

770
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,640
your workplace.

771
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,640
When you got off work,

772
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,800
I picked you up.

773
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,840
I gave you flowers in the morning.

774
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,320
I had dinner with you at night.

775
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,280
I doted on you like you were a princess.

776
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,160
What are you talking about?

777
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,960
I used to look at you

778
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,080
for a whole day.

779
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,000
I commended your gentleness.

780
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,360
You were the apple of my eye.

781
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,200
I didn't want to

782
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,440
see anyone except you.

783
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,720
What kind of relationship do you think we have?

784
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,620
Ever since I met you,

785
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,300
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

786
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,700
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

787
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,580
only you.

788
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,780
We're out of reach

789
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,100
but appreciate each other.

790
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:25,900
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

791
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,940
The yearning invades

792
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,500
and lurks in my mind.

793
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:40,060
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

794
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,140
I'm getting addicted to it

795
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,460
and my sense is shielded.

796
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:54,260
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

797
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,420
Put the hottest heart

798
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,740
in this cold body.

799
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,100
I'm looking at you,

800
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,260
and my love has nowhere to go.

801
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,500
Ever since I met you,

802
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,420
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

803
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,700
Every day is a new memory

804
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,740
which is only be about you and me.

805
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,980
I can't lie to myself anymore.

806
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,820
Please give me the courage to believe.

807
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,740
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

808
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,660
only you.

809
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,780
Even everything becomes silent,

810
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,900
I still have you.
