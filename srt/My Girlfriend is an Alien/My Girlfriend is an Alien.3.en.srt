1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 3

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,700
What do you want to do?

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,960
Don't go.

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,280
Don't go to hospital.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,760
Please.

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,080
Why is the earth so cold?

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
OK.

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
According to

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,360
the material,

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
the character "lie" means warmth.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,180
I've met so many people.

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
It seems that

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,320
you're the warmest.

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,320
Where is Xiaoqi?

32
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,640
Alas.

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,920
They two

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,320
have...

35
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
Why are you here?

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,040
Where is Fang Lie?

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,720
You should answer the question.

38
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,680
How did you lure Fang Lie here?

39
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,440
How did you

40
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,920
make yourself that cold last night?

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,400
I...

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,100
I went to the freezer yesterday to get something

43
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,660
and I was freezing.

44
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,200
Freezing.

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
I talked nonsense.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
Sorry.

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
Don't take it seriously.

48
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,400
You said you froze in the freezer?

49
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,360
Yes. I suffered from frostbite, and...

50
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,800
So...

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
Where are my gloves?

52
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,800
I see.

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,280
I will not pursue the matter of Fang Lie any more.

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,100
Let me warn you for the last time.

55
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,600
Stay away from him.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,940
You're not from the same class as him.

57
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,480
So what?

58
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
We're even from different planets.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,380
Stupid human.

60
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Mr. Fang, come often when you are free.

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
You are always welcomed.

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
Who wants him to come?

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,960
Xiaoqi,

64
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
you worked hard last night.

65
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,520
What would you like to eat?

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,920
Order whatever you want on the menu today.

67
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,760
You don't have to pay.

68
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
It's my treat.

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Here you are.

70
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
Anyway, we're going to be rich.

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,080
Be rich?

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
Why?

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
My masterpiece.

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Overbearing president and takeout delivery girl

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,300
-slept together in the warehouse. -Hands!

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,460
Why could his hands touch me?

77
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
Why was he not afraid of the low temperature of my body?

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
Once this big news goes public,

79
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,320
everybody will know you!

80
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,120
No, you can't publish this.

81
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,040
What are you doing?

82
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,520
Why did you delete it?

83
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,440
You stupid girl.

84
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,640
You were only one step away from
marrying into a rich and powerful family.

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,440
Well.

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,400
Leng.

87
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,780
I don't look into the matter that

88
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,760
you beat the security guard and escaped yesterday.

89
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
But business is business.

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,520
Give me an explanation.

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,440
What can I explain?

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,740
I'm locked in the room every day.

93
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,280
It's good that I can still draw.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,600
Fang Lie,

95
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,500
if you go on like this,

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,680
I have to suspend the art exhibition.

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,960
Do what you like.

98
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,940
The world is so big.

99
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,840
I want to go wandering.

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,400
You can get out of here.

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,720
Leng,

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,880
I know you have spent a lot of time and efforts

103
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,220
on my art exhibition,

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,440
but when I think about my paintings

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,760
being sold at marked prices,

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
I feel very sad.

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,920
It defiles my dream as an artist.

108
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,040
Amateurs talk about art.

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,640
Artists talk about money.

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
You're an art lover at best,

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,360
so you talk about your dreams all day long.

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,840
No, Leng,

113
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,240
you can doubt my character,

114
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,640
but you can't doubt my paintings.

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,920
You know, I am the painter

116
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,520
who won a prize in Paris.

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,320
If you have any doubt about my works,

118
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,080
please refer to the one that brought me fame,

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,320
"Huayin".

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,320
You haven't forgotten that woman?

121
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
What?

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
"Huayin" stood out

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,380
by virtue of the vivid fog.

124
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
But what you really want to express is

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,480
the daisy in the corner.

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
If I remember correctly,

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,480
the daisy represents hidden love.

128
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,880
When did you see it?

129
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,640
It's not important.

130
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
What is important is,

131
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,840
you either keep your relationship

132
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
with that woman

133
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
and continue to create,

134
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,560
or forget everything

135
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,640
and restart your work and life.

136
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,560
And

137
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
stop playing with the delivery girl's affections.

138
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,940
After all, such a simple-minded girl

139
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,160
will do crazy things

140
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,000
once she is serious.

141
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,640
Leng,

142
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
do you think it's appropriate for you to tell me this?

143
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,500
You know,

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,120
you have dated many disreputable girls.

145
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,000
Say that again.

146
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,400
Is there anything wrong with what I said?

147
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,200
Take him away.

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Leng.

149
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,400
Stop.

150
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,960
Stop.

151
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,240
Miss.

152
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
Miss, who are you looking for?

153
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,820
I want to meet Fang Leng.

154
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,800
Sorry, Mr. Fang is busy now.

155
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,960
If you want to meet him,

156
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,880
advance appointment is required.

157
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,800
Thank you.

158
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
It seems that I can only use my own way.

159
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,920
I am kidnapped.

160
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,800
Call the police.

161
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Call the police.

162
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,380
When I become the boss,

163
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
I'll give you a promotion and a salary raise.

164
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,300
Leng, doesn't your heart hurt

165
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,260
to treat me like this?

166
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,460
Since you want to realize your stupid dream,

167
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,680
you have to pay the price.

168
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,520
Here you are.

169
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,680
Yeah.

170
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Good.

171
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,620
Although I may get frozen again,

172
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,560
I have to verify

173
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,800
whether he's special.

174
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,600
Come over.

175
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,720
I have to check

176
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
whether you are from our planet.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,740
Do you

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,520
want to fight with me?

179
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
Xiaoqi, leave.

180
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
You can't defeat him.

181
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,280
He's got taekwondo black belt.

182
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,400
Even I can't defeat him.

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,400
Fang Lie.

184
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,000
You can't go.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,480
Fang Lie.

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,920
You can't go.

187
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,400
-Fang Lie. -You can't go.

188
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,140
I haven't checked.

189
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,000
Is it enough?

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,260
No. I haven't checked.

191
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,280
Let me check.

192
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,580
Just one night has passed.

193
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,840
Do you want to get close to Fang Lie that much?

194
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,100
Do you want to help him

195
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,640
or hurt him?

196
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,500
As expected,

197
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,760
as long as he touches me,

198
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,320
I can't use my super power.

199
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,120
Answer me.

200
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,420
I'm looking for you.

201
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,400
Look for me?

202
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,480
Do you have a feeling that you
and I are the same kind of people?

203
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,440
I am

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,560
like you?

205
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,660
I think about a lot of possibilities.

206
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,780
You

207
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,380
may be an agent

208
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,600
Capetown Planet sent to the earth.

209
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,980
Or

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,780
you must have something to do with the annunciator,

211
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,540
so you have so many strange characteristics.

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,820
Which one?

213
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,120
Do you want to hear the truth?

214
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Listen.

215
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,380
I think

216
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,520
you're out of your mind.

217
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
You always live in your own world

218
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,040
and say something that no one can understand.

219
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
Don't you say you're an alien?

220
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
Then go back to your planet.

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
You are not welcome on earth.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It seems that the people on earth don't like me.

223
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,100
But why do I feel

224
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,720
he's like me?

225
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,100
But my companion was not accustomed

226
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,040
to the climate here and fainted.

227
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
And Fang Leng

228
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,660
is still at large

229
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,820
and lives freely on earth.

230
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm pissed off.

231
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,720
Wake up.

232
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,440
Wake up.

233
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Is Fang Lie still here?

234
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,600
Mr. Fang, I have sent someone to follow Fang Lie.

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,800
Mr. Fang,

236
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,040
you don't look very well.

237
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,760
The meeting in the afternoon...

238
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm fine.

239
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
Pass me the meeting materials.

240
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,320
OK.

241
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,280
Assistant Han,

242
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,640
what is this?

243
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,360
Well.

244
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,200
This document has been in your office.

245
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,080
It's impossible for outsiders to enter.

246
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,000
Inform the security department

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,720
to blacklist Chai Xiaoqi.

248
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't let her in again.

249
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,080
OK.

250
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,640
Mr. Fang,

251
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,220
the itinerary of several special guests

252
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,000
has been reported.

253
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,000
Filner will also come to China.

254
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,100
I remember

255
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,600
the reason why he refused to attend our art exhibition

256
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,860
is that he has to meet a very important friend.

257
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,660
You attend the afternoon meeting on my behalf.

258
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,460
I'd like to meet

259
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,180
Filner's friend.

260
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,280
OK.

261
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,680
Poor little Fang Lie.

262
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,200
I don't know where Fang Leng locks him again.

263
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Sir,

264
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,120
here is your takeout.

265
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,960
What?

266
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,200
Put it at the door?

267
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,720
OK.

268
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,120
Remember to give me five-star praise.

269
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,080
Xiaoqi.

270
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,800
Prince.

271
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,280
Come in.

272
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,660
Aren't you afraid that

273
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,820
Fang Leng will find you hiding here?

274
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,760
The most dangerous place

275
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,000
is the safest place.

276
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,140
Don't move.

277
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,940
Right.

278
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,120
Now that you're hiding,

279
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
why do you still draw?

280
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,080
Because I like painting.

281
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,600
I draw due to myself, not Fang Leng.

282
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,000
No matter what happened to me

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,880
and how bad my mood is,

284
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,280
as long as I draw a painting,

285
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,760
I'll be in a better mood.

286
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
You know,

287
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,000
I rarely draw portraits.

288
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Last time I drew was in middle school.

289
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,440
Who was that?

290
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,280
Just an ordinary friend.

291
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,320
My humble house

292
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,160
is honored by your presence.

293
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,000
You let me come here on purpose.

294
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,100
What are you talking about?

295
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,200
Since we last met,

296
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,420
we never met again.

297
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,000
But I remember

298
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,440
you once said you would visit me.

299
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,740
So, you used Filner to get me here.

300
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,840
Looks like you found it out.

301
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,480
I just don't like

302
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
people forget what they said to me.

303
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,660
I heard

304
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,720
Filner's access to Fang Lie's works

305
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,520
was due to the introduction of a Chinese curator.

306
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't know if it's you.

307
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,560
You're well-informed.

308
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,520
Why did you help Fang Lie?

309
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,960
Nothing.

310
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,840
It's rare to see such a talented Chinese painter.

311
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,820
We lived in a foreign country.

312
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,200
Of course I had to help.

313
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
But Filner is said to be

314
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,000
a man of principle.

315
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,420
I'm afraid it's still hard to persuade him

316
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,360
with Fang Lie's current works.

317
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,760
Fang Lie's works are not as good as before.

318
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,760
Although it seems impossible,

319
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,600
we can take actions privately...

320
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,840
You know what to do?

321
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,320
The so-called artists

322
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,220
and rules in the world

323
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,140
are just gimmicks.

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,240
There's always a way

325
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,580
to move the people and break the rules.

326
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,800
Miss Jiang, I didn't expect that
your idea was the same as mine.

327
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
If you can do it,

328
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
I will reward you generously.

329
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,960
Just call me Jiang Xue.

330
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,160
If it's done,

331
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,200
I'll get

332
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,280
what I deserve from you.

333
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
Do we know each other?

334
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,880
Do you like this old-fashioned way of chatting?

335
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,000
Rest assured.

336
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm not one of your many girlfriends.

337
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,040
Or I would be the first one to stand up

338
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,080
and get even with you

339
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,040
on the day of forced marriage.

340
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Done.

341
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,320
Let me see.

342
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
Magic mirror,

343
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
tell Xiaoqi

344
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,220
who is the most beautiful girl in the world.

345
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,360
What do you think?

346
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,640
Do you like it?

347
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,800
Your eyes.

348
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,360
Your mouth.

349
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
Wait a minute.

350
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,800
I have to make this part perfect.

351
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,740
It's called peach blossom on the lips.

352
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,220
You always say something sweet

353
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,140
to make girls happy.

354
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,840
Happiness is the most important thing.

355
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,560
Ms. Zhou,

356
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,260
are you satisfied with the strength?

357
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,120
Stop that.

358
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,560
Don't keep me guessing.

359
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,720
Tell me what you want.

360
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,540
Would you please activate my credit card?

361
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
I've been so poor recently.

362
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,320
Really?

363
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,480
OK.

364
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,240
You agree?

365
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,400
I'll activate your card tomorrow.

366
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Forget the art exhibition.

367
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
Go to the company.

368
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,040
Well,

369
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,920
this is between me and my brother.

370
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
You and my dad have promised not to participate.

371
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
Can I not participate?

372
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,840
If you still muddle along like this,

373
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,200
Fang Leng will fully take control of the company.

374
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,360
Mom,

375
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,680
do you watch too many TV plays?

376
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
But

377
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,680
I really don't want to hold this art exhibition.

378
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,400
My brother and I have different ideas.

379
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,800
Really?

380
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,720
Son,

381
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,880
you can use your card tomorrow.

382
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,720
Good. Mom.

383
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,920
My mom is the best in the world.

384
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,120
Son.

385
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,120
What?

386
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,680
The girl is Fang Leng's date?

387
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,440
Yes.

388
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Jiang Xue

389
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,200
is indeed the only daughter of the Jiang family.

390
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,020
But the strange thing is,

391
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,120
last time they met,

392
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,520
it seemed that they didn't know each other.

393
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,560
But given that picture,

394
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,160
they met before.

395
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,440
Even if they're not friends,

396
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
they shouldn't be strangers.

397
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,800
Well,

398
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,480
there must be something wrong with Jiang Xue.

399
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,840
I have an idea.

400
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,880
Find a chance

401
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,840
and let me meet her.

402
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,280
OK.

403
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,560
I'll think of a way.

404
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,400
I didn't find younger master Fang Lie anywhere.

405
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,240
I didn't expect him to go back

406
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,720
and leave a painting.

407
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,160
Fang Lie never drew portraits.

408
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,460
I didn't expect that Chai Xiaoqi was so charming.

409
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,000
Mr. Fang,

410
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,840
you can tell that it's Xiaoqi?

411
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,760
To my benefactor,

412
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,120
Xiaoqi.

413
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,280
Let's

414
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
talk with Xiaoqi.

415
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,440
It seems that

416
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,160
she cares about Fang Lie.

417
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
From tomorrow,

418
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
order their lunch

419
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
and ask Xiaoqi to deliver.

420
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,920
With

421
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,880
hundreds of takeouts,

422
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,560
she won't have time to contact Fang Lie.

423
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,980
OK.

424
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,920
By the way,

425
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,680
how about the guests

426
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,800
in the charge of Jiang Xue?

427
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,680
They have contacted us one after another.

428
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
It's under negotiation.

429
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,420
Good.

430
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
Be careful.

431
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,360
OK.

432
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,920
Xiaoqi, listen,

433
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,080
these big boxes

434
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,160
are for employees.

435
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,640
This is particularly important.

436
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,160
This is a special meal for Mr. Fang.

437
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Do you know?

438
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,660
You must meet

439
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,580
Mr. Fang today.

440
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,920
Or you'll go for nothing.

441
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,640
Got it?

442
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,620
Yes.

443
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,880
My God.

444
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,700
How can I deliver like this?

445
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,600
Mr. Fang is the super VIP of our restaurant.

446
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,880
It's normal that he has some special requirements.

447
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,760
You have to deliver it to him

448
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,680
and watch him finish his meal.

449
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,240
Got it?

450
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,280
Yes.

451
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,320
I'll complete the task.

452
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,360
Wait.

453
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Where are you going?

454
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,240
Deliver the takeouts.

455
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,400
How do you get there?

456
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Walk.

457
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,600
Come on.

458
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,920
Look.

459
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,200
I've specially prepared
an electrically-operated vehicle for you.

460
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,280
I don't usually

461
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,440
offer it.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,680
Come here.

463
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,060
This time

464
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,440
is our super VIP's order.

465
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,280
This is especially important.

466
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,800
Protect it with your life.

467
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
Stay with it.

468
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,440
If you ruin it,

469
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,280
don't bother to come back.

470
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,840
Got it?

471
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,560
Go.

472
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,400
What's going on?

473
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,040
My God.

474
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,640
Excuse me.

475
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,440
Excuse me.

476
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,280
Sorry.

477
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,760
Excuse me.

478
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
Excuse me.

479
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,320
Sorry.

480
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,680
Excuse me.

481
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,080
What's going on?

482
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,880
Sorry.

483
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,180
Who opened the well?

484
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,400
What a wicked deed it was!

485
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,320
What to do?

486
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,040
You can leave.

487
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,800
OK. OK.

488
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,040
Jessie,

489
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,000
contact the canteen.

490
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,640
Let them continue to work.

491
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,320
OK.

492
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
What about our lunch?

493
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll talk with their restaurant myself.

494
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,760
OK.

495
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,640
Why does she stop there for more than half an hour?

496
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,880
The delivery person is one meter away from you.

497
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,120
Xiaoqi.

498
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,200
Who?

499
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,560
Who is calling me?

500
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,800
You've come just at the right moment.

501
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,320
I have protected your takeout.

502
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,800
My hands get dirty.

503
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,640
Take it.

504
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Remember to give me five-star praise.

505
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,920
Come up.

506
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,240
I'll take you to the hospital.

507
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,920
This guy

508
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,200
is not as bad as I thought.

509
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,760
Come up.

510
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,040
What're you thinking about?

511
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,120
No need to go to hospital.

512
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,920
I'm not hurt.

513
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,260
It was the vehicle

514
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,960
and those takeouts that hurt.

515
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,420
The delivery person is 0 meter away from you.

516
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,620
So clumsy.

517
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,360
You just delivered takeouts.

518
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,640
Well.

519
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,120
It was

520
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,580
really an accident.

521
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,080
I promise

522
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,900
that's not going to happen next time.

523
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,200
Don't bother.

524
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
I've stopped ordering.

525
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,600
Why?

526
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,200
I still have 15 minutes left.

527
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,820
Do you think you can deliver these takeouts

528
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,420
to our company in 15 minutes?

529
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,080
Of course.

530
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,400
If it weren't for this vehicle,

531
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,980
I had enough time to deliver these things, OK?

532
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,180
Don't you think you should take a shower now?

533
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,200
It's disgraceful of you to look like this.

534
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,880
It's better than losing my job.

535
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,300
Come over.

536
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,660
Come over.

537
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,940
Wait.

538
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,480
Where are we going?

539
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,600
Well.

540
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,940
Mr. Fang, I still have work to do.

541
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,440
I have to deliver the takeouts.

542
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
If you want to keep your job,

543
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,180
just be obedient.

544
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,760
No resistance

545
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,480
and no confrontation.

546
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,980
Mr. Fang, just tell us

547
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,060
what clothes you need.

548
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,680
It is not me

549
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,400
but her.

550
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,360
Sorry.

551
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
I just came up from the sewer.

552
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,960
I am smelly.

553
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,880
I have to leave.

554
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
Mr. Fang.

555
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,260
I...

556
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,900
This one.

557
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,300
OK.

558
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,980
And this one.

559
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,900
OK.

560
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,160
And this one.

561
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,260
OK.

562
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,780
By the way,

563
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,460
where is the nearest bathroom?

564
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,740
It's late.

565
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,460
I don't have time to take a shower.

566
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,260
I have to deliver takeouts.

567
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,000
Mr. Fang, please let me deliver the takeouts.

568
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,580
Where?

569
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,140
Follow me, please.

570
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,740
Mr. Fang,

571
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,320
this is the apartment for our staff.

572
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,740
No one will disturb you.

573
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
Mr. Fang, we're leaving.

574
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,680
Wait.

575
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,780
I'd like to change those garments to extra small ones.

576
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,440
And the dress should have a button.

577
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,520
The white garments can be left here.

578
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,120
But,

579
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,580
you haven't tried them on yet.

580
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,100
Do as she said.

581
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,720
Mr. Fang,

582
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,780
how about I'm going to help them?

583
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm going to help them.

584
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,300
Are you trying to escape?

585
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,100
I think you want the hard way.

586
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,380
Boss Fang,

587
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
I have only five minutes left.

588
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,700
Even you forgive my being late,

589
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,580
the system will record it.

590
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,460
Can you shut up?

591
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,960
Do you forget the smelly water in the ditch?

592
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,160
I...

593
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,880
I...

594
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,200
Come.

595
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,360
It's really too late.

596
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,360
I beg...

597
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,440
Clean yourself now.

598
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,120
I...

599
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:40,920
Oh, no.

600
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,480
My takeouts.

601
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,720
Xiaoqi.

602
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,680
You...

603
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,060
Why can you move?

604
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,700
It's really you.

605
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,480
I... I don't know.

606
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,960
What? What are you talking about?

607
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,800
It's not me.

608
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
I... I don't know.

609
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,420
It's too late to play the fool now.

610
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,680
Tell me what's going on.

611
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,840
Is this my hallucination or reality?

612
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,500
Tell me.

613
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,400
Xiaoqi.

614
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,600
UFO.

615
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,760
Help!

616
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,200
Sorry.

617
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
What do you want to do to me?

618
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,480
Were you here all the time?

619
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,200
Of course.

620
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,320
How come?

621
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,120
Do not change the subject.

622
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,760
Tell me honestly.

623
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,280
Do you want to do something to me?

624
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,280
I can't tell you clearly.

625
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,060
I'm tired. I'm going back.

626
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,480
Wait.

627
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,520
You peeked at me in the shower.

628
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,440
Do you want to let it go so easily?

629
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,960
Didn't you peek at me in the shower

630
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,300
when you went to my home?

631
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,680
I... I didn't mean to.

632
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,080
I just peeked at you. So what?

633
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,160
This is different.

634
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,040
What do you want?

635
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,020
Continue our lunch plan,

636
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,460
and I will forgive you.

637
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,560
Wait.

638
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,680
Do you agree?

639
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,440
Listen up.

640
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,800
Do not tell anyone

641
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,920
about what happened today.

642
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,500
I'm giving you the car downstairs

643
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,160
as an apology.

644
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
Drive that car to deliver takeouts.

645
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,340
What's this?

646
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,480
I heard you were hallucinating,

647
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,160
but I didn't expect

648
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,440
it deteriorated so seriously.

649
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,900
Do you have any solution?

650
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,040
It depends on what kind of solution you want.

651
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,800
A radical cure.

652
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,400
I don't even know the pathogeny.

653
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,040
How to cure it?

654
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,760
Suggestion.

655
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,880
There are two suggestions.

656
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,680
First,

657
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,900
ignore it

658
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,000
and continue your life.

659
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,820
Control your emotions

660
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,060
and do not be affected by hallucinations.

661
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,720
Second,

662
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,520
accept it.

663
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,500
Hallucinations

664
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,180
are just one manifestation of your amnesia,

665
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,060
a part of you.

666
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,460
You need to learn to find patterns in your hallucinations

667
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,720
and find a solution.

668
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,240
In my hallucinations,

669
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,700
the woman named Xiaoqi always appears,

670
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,860
and I feel

671
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,020
we have met before.

672
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,400
See?

673
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,400
Maybe

674
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,720
she

675
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,780
is the special girl for you.

676
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,200
I don't know if this feeling is real,

677
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,580
because I met another woman

678
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,020
who is very similar to me.

679
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,000
And I'm very familiar with her.

680
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,940
But when I checked my memory bank,

681
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
I found we didn't have any connection before.

682
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,200
Between these two women,

683
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,400
one represents your reality,

684
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,620
and the other represents your subconscious.

685
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,420
No matter you're choosing to live in reality

686
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,860
or you're adapting to the hallucinations,

687
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,380
you have to find a lifestyle

688
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,140
that fits you.

689
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,680
It depends on what you choose.

690
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,280
It's obvious.

691
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,880
I won't allow myself to

692
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,940
become a mad psycho.

693
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,800
This one.

694
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,760
OK.

695
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,520
-And this one. -OK.

696
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,200
And this one.

697
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,640
OK.

698
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,660
In fact, Fang Leng

699
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,680
is not so bad.

700
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,460
I scared him with super power.

701
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,300
It seems it's a bit inappropriate.

702
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,120
Kubri.

703
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,700
Put me under the sun.

704
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,680
I need to let the poisonous wine out sooner.

705
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
Do you feel better?

706
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,440
I still feel dizzy.

707
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,600
It was my fault.

708
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Those male models in the night club
were really outrageous.

709
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,420
They even fed wine to a turtle.

710
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,740
The men on the earth

711
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,640
are all so bad.

712
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,920
Not really.

713
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,400
In fact,

714
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,080
there are some good men,

715
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
for example, Fang Lie

716
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,480
and Fang Leng.

717
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,360
What did you say?

718
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,820
My voltage is coming up again.

719
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,960
Kubri.

720
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,560
Kubri.

721
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,100
I... I seem to get stuck again.

722
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,540
-Xiaoqi, you have to control yourself. -Kubri.

723
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,180
On this planet,

724
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,640
the more handsome a man looks,
the more dangerous he is gonna be.

725
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,680
Do not let them know you're an alien.

726
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,860
Otherwise, you'll follow in my...

727
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,440
Kubri. Kubri.

728
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Xiaoqi.

729
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,100
Who are you talking to?

730
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,520
No one.

731
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,380
Ms. Chai,

732
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,080
are you going on a long trip?

733
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,120
No.

734
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,240
You don't have many garments,

735
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,000
so I found some for you.

736
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,540
I spent much money on dressing

737
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,200
when I was in love back then.

738
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,040
But your figure

739
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
may be very different from mine.

740
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,240
Try them on.

741
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,160
Ms. Chai,

742
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,600
you're really the most...

743
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,720
I refuse

744
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,920
sugar-coated bullets.

745
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,840
If you really want to thank me,

746
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,320
do a good job in takeout delivery from tomorrow.

747
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
You should make Mr. Fang

748
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,120
feel our sincerity

749
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,400
from the heart to the body.

750
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,960
No problem.

751
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,720
Go to try the clothes on.

752
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,420
Mr. Fang, these are the drawings

753
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,140
Fang Lie has sold when he was studying abroad.

754
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
If we put them in this exhibition,

755
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,160
there will be much less pressure

756
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,560
on the works later.

757
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,320
It's pretty good.

758
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,680
But even I haven't seen these works before.

759
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
How did you find them?

760
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,520
It should be attributed to Miss Jiang Xue.

761
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,880
Jiang Xue?

762
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,040
Besides,

763
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,360
she has invited several exhibition curators

764
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,680
to perfect this art exhibition.

765
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,420
Jiang Xue

766
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,360
is really complex.

767
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,160
Make an appointment with her for me.

768
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,520
She has just handed over the work with
the colleagues from the Public Relations Department.

769
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,720
If you want to see her,

770
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,880
I'll let her leave a little later.

771
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,120
OK.

772
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,900
I can meet her after the video meeting today.

773
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,440
Mr. Fang will be here soon.

774
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
You two have a tacit understanding.

775
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,680
I heard you also participate in the art exhibition.

776
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
I just do a little help.

777
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,840
I didn't expect that you know art exhibition quite well.

778
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Did you know

779
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,640
Fang Lie before?

780
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,560
Fang Lie?

781
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Fang Leng's brother?

782
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,680
Yes.

783
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,560
No.

784
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,580
What about Fang Leng?

785
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,840
Did you know Fang Leng

786
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,120
before the blind date?

787
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,400
Uncle Kang, are you kidding me?

788
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,120
If I knew him,

789
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,880
I wouldn't have hit his car.

790
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,800
What's wrong with you?

791
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,560
I feel dizzy.

792
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,320
Sorry.

793
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,600
I drove too fast

794
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,760
and didn't control the speed.

795
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,520
But rest assured.

796
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,960
After delivering the takeouts,

797
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
you don't need to work anymore today.

798
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,640
Great.

799
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,080
Wait.

800
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,000
Why do you come here?

801
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,480
Right.

802
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,080
Xiaoqi,

803
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
put these down first.

804
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,240
Now first take

805
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,240
Mr. Fang's takeout over

806
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,020
and give him in person.

807
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,640
Do you get it?

808
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,280
It doesn't matter. I'm strong.

809
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,040
I'll first send this to the staff canteen.

810
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,800
Come back.

811
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,120
Are you silly?

812
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,160
Don't you see that?

813
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,160
These female employees all wear wrapped skirts,

814
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
twisting their buttocks.

815
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,400
In my opinion,

816
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,840
they must be eager to

817
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,140
hook Mr. Fang.

818
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,040
I didn't expect

819
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,760
you, a takeout delivery girl,

820
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,360
would have picked the advantage.

821
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,320
Pick?

822
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,260
I didn't pick anything, Ms. Chai.

823
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,080
I mean this.

824
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,640
Though Mr. Fang is a bit fickle in love,

825
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,640
he's quite generous to his girlfriends.

826
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,480
He gave you a car.

827
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,720
He's obviously chasing you.

828
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,200
Chase me?

829
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,920
No.

830
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,240
I have been into someone.

831
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,680
I'm going to return the key to him.

832
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,760
Finish your work first.

833
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,000
Finish the work and then handle your personal affair.

834
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,960
Keep smiling.

835
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,000
What about the Commerce Department ?

836
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,440
When do you start

837
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,640
your own projects?

838
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,340
When can they be completed?

839
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,480
What's the progress now?

840
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,300
Who is responsible for the handover?

841
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,760
Tell me.

842
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,520
Mr. Fang,

843
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,800
it's time for lunch.

844
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,800
Please sign on the takeout menu.

845
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,480
Get out.

846
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,840
I put it here and leave.

847
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,680
And,

848
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,280
can you not chase me any more?

849
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
You like me so much,

850
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
which will bother me very much.

851
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,600
Do you have eyes?

852
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,960
Don't you see I'm working?

853
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,880
No, I don't.

854
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,000
And what did you say just now?

855
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,680
I like you?

856
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,400
Yes.

857
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I drove your car to deliver takeouts today,

858
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,060
and everyone said you are chasing me.

859
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,660
They're blind,

860
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,820
but don't you know what's happening here?

861
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,300
So, you don't like me?

862
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,480
Listen carefully.

863
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,220
Whether in reality or hallucination,

864
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't even want to see you.

865
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,280
Then I can be relieved.

866
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,140
Otherwise, it'll really bother me.

867
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,120
In order not to bother you,

868
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,960
from today on,

869
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,080
you don't need to send lunch to me any more.

870
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,920
Please leave as soon

871
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,880
as you see me from the distance.

872
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,960
OK.

873
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,240
Finish your lunch quickly

874
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,160
in case I have to come back for the box

875
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,080
and see you again.

876
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,420
I told you I don't want to eat now.

877
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,080
When I finish it later,

878
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,480
I'll let Assistant Han send it back.

879
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,360
What are you doing?

880
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,180
Ms. Chai have told me that

881
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,700
we should show the service quality of our restaurant

882
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,660
through every single job, no matter how small it is.

883
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,780
Though this may be my last job,

884
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,380
I'll finish it with all my strength nevertheless.

885
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,260
-I told you I don't want to eat. -It's dropping on your suit.

886
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,140
Ever since I met you,

887
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,820
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

888
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,220
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

889
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,100
only you.

890
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,300
We're out of reach

891
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,620
but appreciate each other.

892
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:06,420
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

893
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,460
The yearning invades

894
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,020
and lurks in my mind.

895
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:20,580
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

896
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,660
I'm getting addicted to it

897
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,980
and my sense is shielded.

898
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,780
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

899
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,940
Put the hottest heart

900
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,260
in this cold body.

901
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,620
I'm looking at you,

902
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,780
and my love has nowhere to go.

903
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,020
Ever since I met you,

904
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,940
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

905
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,220
Every day is a new memory

906
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,260
which is only be about you and me.

907
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,500
I can't lie to myself anymore.

908
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,340
Please give me the courage to believe.

909
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,260
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

910
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,180
only you.

911
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,300
Even everything becomes silent,

912
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,420
I still have you.
