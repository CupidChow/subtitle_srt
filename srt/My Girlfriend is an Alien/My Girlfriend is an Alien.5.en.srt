1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 5

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,800
Are you all right?

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
I was hospitalized because I was allergic.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,900
It has nothing to do with her.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,440
You...

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,340
You...

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,860
Why did you come?

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
Who advises you to ask those reporters to come?

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,000
I...

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
Do you know? If I didn't come today,

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,700
you would be abused badly.

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,990
Could you use your brain?

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,420
Could you take good care of yourself?

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
But you came.

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,960
Do you know

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,120
I had been waiting for you yesterday?

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,990
I thought you hated me again.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,990
I thought you were really not willing to help me.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,220
Why are the earthlings so strange?

37
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,700
Why do you always lie to me?

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
You made me happy

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,680
and disappointed alternately.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
I worried something bad would happen to you.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,400
I worried you would be poisoned to death.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,000
Why do you always affect me?

This...

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,480
Is this rain?

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,720
It rains.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
It rains.

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,380
Fang Leng.

63
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,620
Fang Leng.

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,520
Don't you like rain?

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,720
This is the first time I have seen rain on the earth.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
Did I meet you before?

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,920
Fang Leng.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,880
Fang Leng.

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,160
Fang Leng, what's wrong?

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,680
What's wrong?

71
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,200
What's wrong?

72
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,040
Why?

73
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,690
What why?

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
Why do you look so pale?

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Are you sick again?

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,440
Why do I still remember you?

77
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,080
Mr. Fang.

78
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,280
Mr. Fang.

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,840
Are you all right?

80
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,480
Help me contact Doctor Zhang.

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,180
Let Doctor Zhang come to
Mr. Fang's home as soon as possible.

82
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,560
What?

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,800
I got it.

84
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,920
Doctor Zhang is out.

85
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,840
He will be back

86
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,960
tomorrow at the soonest.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
Were you already attacked by amnesia?

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,760
Then...

89
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,680
Have Xiaoqi found this?

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,120
No.

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,680
Do you remember

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Xiaoqi?

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Yes, I do.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,960
I remember everything about Xiaoqi.

95
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Assistant Han,

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
I seem to have recovered from my amnesia.

97
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
Great.

98
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,640
Does it

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,040
have anything to do

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
with Xiaoqi?

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,480
When you had amnesia,

102
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,840
what happened?

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Did you feel

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,040
anything wrong?

105
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,240
Besides Xiaoqi,

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,640
I can't think of any other reason.

107
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,320
Future Mrs. Fang,

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
you are awake.

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,120
You had a long day yesterday.

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,160
Did you sleep well last night?

111
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
Did you have a dream?

112
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
Come on.

113
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,160
Have a glass of warm water.

114
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,120
Here you are.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,840
Ms. Chai,

116
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,560
when did you come back?

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,700
When I saw the news on the Internet

118
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,800
that you and Mr. Fang clarified the rumor

119
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,280
and embraced passionately,

120
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,900
I came back without stop.

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,990
I decorated here again.

122
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,080
We can open the restaurant again

123
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,200
very soon.

124
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,680
Does the decoration you said

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,240
refer to these photos?

126
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,120
No.

127
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,560
In your eyes,

128
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,160
these are ordinary photos,

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,880
but they are shining bank notes

130
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
in my eyes.

131
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,990
With these photos that

132
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,240
you and Mr. Fang embrace passionately,

133
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
our restaurant

134
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,880
will soon become famous online.

135
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,400
Xiaoqi,

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,160
in my most difficult times,

137
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,640
you helped me

138
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,200
and my restaurant.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,600
I will never forget your kindness.

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,280
From today on,

141
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,320
as long as I have meat to eat,

142
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,300
you will have meat soup to drink.

143
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,860
It sounds a bit strange.

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
Don't be touched.

145
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll do what I say.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,960
Hum.

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,920
We've got a customer.

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,120
Welcome.

149
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,800
Mr. Fang,

150
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,160
you come early in the morning.

151
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Come in, please.

152
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,190
Ms. Chai said you can eat anything

153
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,200
here free of charge in the future.

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,380
Did you sleep well last night?

155
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,860
I slept quite well.

156
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,840
Have you had breakfast?

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,360
I was busy preparing food for you.

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
I haven't had breakfast yet.

159
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,750
I feel hungry.

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
Do you have any plan for today?

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Be the waitress.

162
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,760
That's good.

163
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,240
If you don't need any help,

164
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I will...

165
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,560
What happened between us yesterday?

166
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,520
Yesterday, you took me to the seaside

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
and hugged me.

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,640
Seaside?

169
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
I don't mean these only,

170
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,120
but some things that would have influence on me.

171
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,520
For example...

172
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,840
For example, something changes

173
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,160
me a lot.

174
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,160
What do you mean?

175
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,660
What did I do to you?

176
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,400
Sorry.

177
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,390
This chair is a bit dirty.

178
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,400
I'll clean it.

179
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,860
Sorry. Go on. Go on.

180
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,320
What happened in rain yesterday?

181
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Or did anything happen

182
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,680
that changed me?

183
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
No.

184
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
Have you changed?

185
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,600
Forget it.

186
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,360
Maybe it has nothing to do with you.

187
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,600
Are you leaving?

188
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,840
Take care.

189
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,820
Welcome to come again.

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
What's going on?

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,380
Hello, dad.

192
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,160
My father often mentioned you

193
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,880
and said he'd come to visit you some day.

194
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,560
Good.

195
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,240
Good.

196
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,640
Mrs. Fang is more and more beautiful.

197
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,200
Really?

198
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,120
You're good at keeping young.

199
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,680
You're back.

200
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,520
Xue came here

201
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,480
early this morning.

202
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,320
She has been waiting for you.

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,780
Who is this?

204
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
Fang Leng, what do you mean?

205
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,740
I just said it out of anger.

206
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,880
Do you take it seriously?

207
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Xue, what happened?

208
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Mr. and Mrs. Fang, I'm sorry.

209
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,480
Fang Leng and I quarreled the day before yesterday.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,560
Being angry,

211
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,520
I said

212
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,760
we shouldn't meet again

213
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
and we would pretend

214
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,400
not to know each other before others.

215
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Well, do you take it seriously?

216
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,000
Fang Leng,

217
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Xue is a girl.

218
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,880
You should talk peacefully to her.

219
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,120
How could you do that?

220
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,480
Sorry.

221
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,120
It doesn't matter.

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Dad,

223
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
we're going back.

224
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,240
Okay.

225
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
Drive carefully.

226
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,540
See you, Mr. and Mrs. Fang.

227
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,860
Mr. Fang and Mrs. Fang are watching us.

228
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,320
So did I get the official recognition?

229
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,700
Just now you said we quarrelled.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,400
If we didn't quarrel,

231
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,640
why would you not know me?

232
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Will you lose your memory

233
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,320
overnight?

234
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,400
=Assistant Han=

235
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,640
Assistant Han,

236
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm going to find Doctor Zhang.

237
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,360
Send me all the information about

238
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,760
Jiang Xue in my memory bank.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,500
Okay.

240
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,720
This photo was exposed to

241
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
the social networking website

242
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,120
when Jiang Xue met you for the first time.

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,560
Have a look. Do you know her?

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,560
No.

245
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,360
What about this one?

246
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,280
I don't know.

247
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,600
This is the female customer

248
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,000
you met last week.

249
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,280
This is the office girl

250
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
in your Secretariat.

251
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,640
Now try your best to recall

252
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,560
all your recent experiences.

253
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Do you remember other girls

254
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
besides Xiaoqi?

255
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,700
Only her.

256
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,920
There's only one explanation.

257
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,450
She's the one.

258
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,640
What do you mean?

259
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,120
I asked you

260
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,000
to date

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
different girls

262
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,520
only to let you set up a close relationship

263
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,160
to compensate the harm your mother left on you.

264
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,520
We failed before,

265
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,040
but this time,

266
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,400
I believe Xiaoqi

267
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
can surely help you.

268
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Do you want me to have a relationship with her?

269
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,560
Hum.

270
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,320
Well.

271
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,800
You can't forget her.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,640
It means

273
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,160
she is special to you.

274
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,800
I don't know the reason,

275
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
but for now,

276
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
she's the only person

277
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,960
who can possibly heal you.

278
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Think it over.

279
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
I finally don't need to deliver takeouts.

280
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,480
I feel so happy.

281
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,240
Well,

282
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,600
Ms. Chai gave me so much money at a time

283
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,100
and asked me to go out to enjoy life.

284
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,960
Kubri,

285
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,480
do I become

286
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,640
a rich person now?

287
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,600
Yes.

288
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,480
In our home planet,

289
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,840
you were a poor and lousy low species

290
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,560
with weak super power and without a boyfriend.

291
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,300
Unexpectedly, you become so popular on the earth.

292
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
This is my first income.

293
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,520
Well,

294
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,600
what should I buy

295
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,800
with the money?

296
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,320
The most common ways of spending
for women on the earth are

297
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,340
buying clothes...

298
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:40,880
Buying clothes.

299
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,840
Buying shoes.

300
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,820
Buying shoes.

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Buying bags.

302
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
Buying cosmetics.

303
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,500
Cosmetics.

304
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,360
Buying food.

305
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,080
Food?

306
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,080
This is

307
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,680
for Fang Leng.

308
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,920
About the one looking like Fang Lie,

309
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
I'll keep it.

310
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Hello?

311
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,640
I got paid,

312
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,320
and bought you a small gift.

313
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm coming to your company soon.

314
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,120
Do you have time?

315
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,100
No, I don't.

316
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,740
Next time.

317
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,760
Xiaoqi?

318
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,250
Xiaoqi?

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,620
Xiaoqi?

320
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,000
Did anything bad happen to her?

321
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,640
Do you know how to ride?

322
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,990
Why do you come?

323
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,180
Are you all right?

324
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm fine.

325
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,820
How did you find me?

326
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,280
You said you were close to my company.

327
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,840
I heard the sound of brake from your phone

328
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,720
and thought you had an accident.

329
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,560
You didn't answer the call.

330
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,090
What's going on?

331
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,100
My phone was broken just now.

332
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,680
I didn't expect

333
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,560
you care so much about me.

334
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,920
You're a good friend.

335
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,940
Oh, right. This is a gift for you.

336
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,580
Why is it so ugly?

337
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,720
Then give it back to me.

338
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,990
Give it back to me.

339
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,080
Who's this?

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,950
It's none of your business.

341
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,600
Give it back to me.

342
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,400
I don't want to give it to you. Give it back...

343
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,000
=Assistant Han=

344
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:18,860
Hello!

345
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,190
Mr. Fang, something wrong with Filner.

346
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,480
What happened?

347
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,920
Filner arrived early.

348
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,720
And...

349
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,200
And what?

350
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,440
Mrs. Fang came to meet him.

351
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,260
Hello, Mr. Filner.

352
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,840
I come to meet you

353
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
on behalf of my son Fang Lie.

354
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,500
Glad to meet you, Mrs. Fang.

355
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,860
Where's Fang Lie, please?

356
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,080
He won't come.

357
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,760
I'll get straight to the point today.

358
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,860
My son doesn't want to hold this art exhibition actually.

359
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,160
It is his brother's will.

360
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
I came here today

361
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,040
to let you stay out of this.

362
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,880
Please don't misunderstand,

363
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,480
Mr. Filner.

364
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,600
Mr. Fang is on the way.

365
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,760
Mr. Filner. Mr. Filner...

366
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
How to do?

367
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,520
Won't there be something wrong
with Fang Lie's art exhibition?

368
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
It's my fault. I delayed you.

369
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,800
It has nothing to do with you.

370
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,690
This is my mistake.

371
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,340
You go back on your own.

372
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,040
Be careful.

373
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,440
Hey.

374
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,560
Okay, I get it.

375
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,080
Thanks.

376
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,080
What did he say?

377
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,680
Filner didn't even answer my call.

378
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,240
He let his assistant to tell you one thing.

379
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,720
He asked,

380
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,390
"Does Fang Lie sincerely want to hold this art exhibition?"

381
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,720
I may help you think of some other way.

382
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,320
No need.

383
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,360
You've helped me a lot.

384
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,440
Jiang Xue,

385
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,040
thank you.

386
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,000
I haven't heard you call me that for a long time.

387
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,480
If you really want to thank me,

388
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,400
do not pretend not to know me before others

389
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
in the future.

390
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,200
Believe me.

391
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,280
I want to remember you more than you do.

392
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,760
In fact, I...

393
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,640
I have something to handle.

394
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,560
I'll thank you personally another day.

395
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,790
In fact, I've long known your secret.

396
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,100
Mr. Fang, how do you plan to handle it?

397
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,400
I have no idea.

398
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,340
In the past, I thought I could use any way

399
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,700
as long as it was good for Lie.

400
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,920
I didn't care even it was against his personal will.

401
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,680
But I really got stuck by Filner's question.

402
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,320
What did he ask?

403
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,420
He wants to know Lie's will.

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,100
Do you think people can really be forced?

405
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,320
Ordinary people may be forced,

406
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,590
but it's really hard to force Fang Lie.

407
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Perhaps.

408
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,880
Sometimes, it's hard for me to control myself.

409
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,990
She's not an important person,

410
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,560
but I put down the most important work to look for her.

411
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,280
Don't go back to the company.

412
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
Let's go to find Lie.

413
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,200
Okay.

414
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,720
Leng, aren't you going to meet Filner?

415
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,700
Why do you come here?

416
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,400
Let's talk inside.

417
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,860
I have to ask you about one thing again in person.

418
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,600
What happened, Leng?

419
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,140
If you are given another chance to choose,

420
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
are you willing to hold this art exhibition?

421
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,250
Are you all right, Leng?

422
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,060
You let me listen to you just now.

423
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,790
Why did you suddenly ask how I think?

424
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,460
Filner has terminated the contract.

425
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
Now only you can save it.

426
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,840
I know you have long been fed up with my arrangements.

427
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,880
So I'll give you the right to choose this time.

428
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,920
If you really want to give up,
I won't interfere with you again.

429
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,790
What if I don't want to give up?

430
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,990
Since childhood, you have won me in all aspects,

431
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,080
like study, career and love.

432
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
This time, you rarely give up.

433
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,960
I want to win you once.

434
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,960
Okay.

435
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,400
Three days.

436
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,240
I'll give you three days.

437
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,650
In these days,

438
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,390
you have to finish a painting that you really want to draw.

439
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,960
After you finish it, I'll take you to meet Filner in person.

440
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,300
You haven't gone back yet.

441
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,350
I messed up your work, so I can't go back securely.

442
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,520
How's it going?

443
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,140
It doesn't go well.

444
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,200
The art exhibition may be canceled.

445
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,720
Well.

446
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
You were late because of me.

447
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,220
No, I can't let him misunderstand you.

448
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,280
-I'm going to explain it to him. -No need.

449
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,800
This has nothing to do with you.

450
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,240
It was my own problem.

451
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,400
That's the way you are.

452
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,990
You always like to struggle alone.

453
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,990
You act like this when you are sick or at work.

454
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,680
Can you believe others once?

455
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,560
Believe you?

456
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,360
Yes.

457
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,680
Believe me.

458
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,560
As long as I see Filner,
I'm sure I can let him listen to me.

459
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,640
Okay.

460
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
I'll believe you once.

461
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,990
Mr. Fang, Filner will eat here tonight.

462
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,360
He'll fly to Paris early tomorrow morning.

463
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,380
What are we waiting for?

464
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm going to find him now.

465
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,850
Don't be impulsive.

466
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,060
Haven't you heard of a saying?

467
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,820
You may retain someone, but you can't keep his heart stay.

468
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,360
The affection can be cultivated.

469
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,520
We should first make him stay.

470
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,940
And, I've looked into it.

471
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,540
The restaurant has great security work.

472
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,560
Especially, during the meal,

473
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,200
no one is allowed to go into the private room to disturb.

474
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,960
I'm afraid we can't meet Filner today.

475
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,360
It doesn't matter.

476
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,560
I have an idea.

477
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,880
This way, please.

478
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Are you sure Filner is in that room?

479
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,640
Assistant Han won't be wrong.

480
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,720
After I count to three, we'll go inside directly.

481
00:23:51,640 --> 00:24:02,300
One. Two. Three.

482
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,240
Go inside.

483
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,380
What?

484
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,220
Go inside quickly.

485
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,480
It's getting late. Hurry up.

486
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,300
Come on.

487
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Okay.

488
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,540
This way, please.

489
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,760
Where are they?

490
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,240
Who are you?

491
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,840
Sorry to disturb you.

492
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
I made an appointment with you.

493
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,160
Who allowed you to come in?

494
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,940
You are too rude!

495
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,020
Please get out now!

496
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,400
Waitress!

497
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,660
It seems you are the one who's rude.

498
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,180
You promised to meet him before,

499
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,280
but you broke the appointment without reason.

500
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320
Now he comes to find you again sincerely.

501
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,760
Is that the way you treat a guest?

502
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,200
Who are you?

503
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,740
I'm Mr. Fang Leng's friend.

504
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,200
Even if you want to drive us out,

505
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,260
please let him finish his words first, okay?

506
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,840
Otherwise, I will keep pestering you.

507
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,760
Mr. Fang, I'm really sorry
for breaking the appointment before,

508
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,820
but I'm afraid I can't participate in this art exhibition.

509
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,600
You got me wrong, Mr. Filner.

510
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,220
I came to meet you today

511
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,080
not to persuade you to participate in the art exhibition.

512
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm coming to see you off.

513
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,680
Do you know what you are saying?

514
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,780
We came to persuade him.

515
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,160
Why did you say you're seeing him off?

516
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,520
You told me that.

517
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,620
Even we can't retain his heart, we may make him stay.

518
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,680
Mr. Filner, though our partnership has broken down,

519
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,500
we're friends after all.

520
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,400
A friend is leaving.

521
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,240
It's normal for me to see you off as the host.

522
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,820
Mr. Fang, thank you. I broke the contract.

523
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,360
We won't talk about work today. We'll just see you off.

524
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,440
Mr. Fang, you're so tolerant.

525
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,480
Please.

526
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,370
What the hell are you doing?

527
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Are you a good drinker?

528
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,760
No one in the whole universe can make me drunk.

529
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,680
Help me get him drunk.

530
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,620
Come on.

531
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,280
Mr. Filner, let's drink another toast.

532
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,480
What's wrong?

533
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,240
Oh, no.

534
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,520
When I drink,

535
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,140
the electromagnetic field inside my body is chaotic again.

536
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,040
Don't move.

537
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,360
Mr. Filner, I wonder why

538
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,200
you refuse to participate in this art exhibition.

539
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,320
You're very sincere and long-sighted,

540
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,020
but some things can't be forced.

541
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,180
I don't follow.

542
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,960
Mr. Fang Lie doesn't want to hold
this art exhibition, does he?

543
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Not really.

544
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,360
I've always thought that you're a man who respects artists.

545
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,200
But if you just take artists as tools that can be manipulated,

546
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,560
it'll go against my original purpose.

547
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,560
If I take him as a tool,

548
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,940
I should at least have my purpose.

549
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,820
What do you think I want to get?

550
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Though we can make money by art,

551
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,660
the artwork market of China is really too risky.

552
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,560
We'll spend more than what we earn to invest in this way.

553
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,800
If I do it for a good reputation,

554
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,740
I can totally hold a charity.

555
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,640
Why should I take great pains to force my brother to do it?

556
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,100
I don't know what you heard or what you misunderstood.

557
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,160
I come here to tell you

558
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm holding this art exhibition for my younger brother only.

559
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,480
I hope he can realize his dream.

560
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,880
What you said makes sense,

561
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,860
but I'm going back tomorrow,
and many trips can't be changed.

562
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,540
We'd better cooperate next time.

563
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:47,960
Okay.

564
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,580
See you tomorrow.

565
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,240
It ends finally.

566
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,980
He'll definitely sleep through the night.

567
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,360
Is that right?

568
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,800
Yes.

569
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,820
What's wrong?

570
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Are you all right?

571
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,800
You liar.

572
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,460
You said no one could make you drunk in the universe.

573
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,720
You can't drink as much as I do.

574
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,240
-I'm the best drinker on the earth. -Okay.

575
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,560
I'm the best...

576
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
Okay. Taxi.

577
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
-I'm the best... -Okay, you're the best. You're the best.

578
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,720
Taxi.

579
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,560
You're so heavy.

580
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,400
Sleep.

581
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,560
Don't go, okay?

582
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,560
Please look at me again.

583
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,520
Mom, please look at me again.

584
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,040
This is just a nightmare.

585
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,640
Fang Leng.

586
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,900
Fang Leng.

587
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,560
Fang Leng.

588
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,200
I don't know what you've been through,
but it doesn't matter.

589
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
I'll always be at your side.

590
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,720
Are you all right?

591
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,040
Did anything happen between us last night?

592
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,560
Mr. Fang.

593
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,460
What did you say just now?

594
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,720
Why are you here?

595
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,880
You vomited up last night,

596
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,960
and Xiaoqi asked me to come to clean up.

597
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,160
Well. I just washed your suit.

598
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,980
Where's Xiaoqi?

599
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,120
She...

600
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,460
It's time for breakfast.

601
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,320
Come to have breakfast.

602
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,800
Morning.

603
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,920
Morning.

604
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,480
It's time for breakfast.

605
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,960
Look.

606
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,880
These are Chinese food, and those are Western food.

607
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,100
Sit down to enjoy it.

608
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,320
You made so much food alone?

609
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,400
Yes.

610
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm a takeout girl.

611
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,840
I poured all these out box by box.

612
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,520
Am I virtuous?

613
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,740
Do you feel better after a sleep?

614
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,080
You don't look good.

615
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,620
What's wrong?

616
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,820
Let me have a look.

617
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,500
Can you be a little reserved?

618
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,860
Am I not reserved?

619
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,600
Do you know

620
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,100
it's very dangerous to

621
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,560
spend a night at a drunk man's home?

622
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,120
Ah?

623
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,600
Is it dangerous?

624
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,720
You...

625
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,600
Well, Mr. Fang,

626
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
I have got a piece of good news.

627
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,080
Go ahead.

628
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,600
I just received the message that

629
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,340
Filner changed his schedule

630
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,960
and booked an air ticket for two days later.

631
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,800
Really?

632
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,680
Great! Great!

633
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,820
Next, it'll all depend on what Fang Lie does.

634
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,420
He'll surely do it well.

635
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,180
I'm in such a good mood.

636
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,760
Who's that?

637
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,520
I haven't finished it yet.

638
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,220
For talented Fang Lie.

639
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,400
By Xiaoqi.

640
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,460
Xiaoqi.

641
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,320
Xiaoqi.

642
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,100
=625=

643
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,760
Xiaoqi.

644
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,560
Why do you come out?

645
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,400
If I don't come out,

646
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,060
my snail girl will run away.

647
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,100
Thank you.

648
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,800
My pleasure.

649
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,040
I'll take you to a good place.

650
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,720
Where?

651
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled.

652
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,600
Can I really be the first one to see it?

653
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,220
Of course.

654
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,480
Where's the painting?

655
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,800
I'm joking.

656
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,160
I haven't finished it yet.

657
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,120
Fang Lie.

658
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,300
It is said that one's inspiration may dry up.

659
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,100
I didn't expect my inspiration
would dry up at this young age.

660
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,280
It's not true.

661
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,840
When I first met you, you were singing on the stage,

662
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,200
shining like a prince.

663
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,520
That was caused by the stage projector.

664
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,680
It's specially for cheating girls like you.

665
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,920
I don't care.

666
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,880
I don't care.

667
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,380
I just believe you

668
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,020
without principles, conditions and bottom line.

669
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,000
You'd better believe my brother instead of me.

670
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,480
Without him supporting behind, I really can't stick to it.

671
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,520
Your brother and you are two different persons.

672
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,280
You can't be compared.

673
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,320
Actually, I've always had nothing I really wanted to do.

674
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,820
Drawing is my personal hobby.

675
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,640
I casually told my brother that

676
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,080
I wanted to hold an art exhibition.

677
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,160
After saying that, I already forgot it,
but he took it seriously.

678
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,200
In fact, I wanted to tell him long ago that

679
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm just a good-for-nothing,

680
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,920
but they made efforts to bring me to this position.

681
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,640
Just like the one you saw on the stage,

682
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,280
I am shone by follow spotlight and appear to be brilliant.

683
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,820
Actually, everyone is good-for-nothing.

684
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
For example, when some want to be good to you,

685
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,960
help you and appreciate you,

686
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,280
you will also help them and be good to them.

687
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,720
At this time, even a good-for-nothing will shine.

688
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
And, if you insist saying you're a good-for-nothing,

689
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,240
you are the most handsome

690
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,120
and good-looking good-for-nothing on the earth.

691
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,300
The most handsome and good-looking good-for-nothing.

692
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
You're such a good comfort.

693
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,120
I know.

694
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,700
What do you know?

695
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,140
I know what I am going to draw.

696
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,240
Thank you.

697
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,060
When you come again next time, you'll see my painting.

698
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm going.

699
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,780
Really?

700
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,460
That's all for today's meeting.

701
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,480
Go back for work.

702
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,580
Is there anything else you are not clear?

703
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,100
Our relationship is a bit unclear.

704
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,040
Here you come.

705
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,940
I heard that Filner stayed temporarily.

706
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,740
The art exhibition can continue.

707
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,560
But if you don't thank me in time, I'll take more from you.

708
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
I will thank you definitely.

709
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,160
Do you have time after work?

710
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,020
I can have time.

711
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,340
I invite you for a meal.

712
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,740
I'll pick you up later.

713
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,680
Okay.

714
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,040
See you later.

715
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,920
See you later.

716
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,800
Mr. Fang.

717
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,060
Assistant Han, I'll have a private appreciation banquet later.

718
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,040
Arrange it for me.

719
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,800
What are your requirements for the restaurant?

720
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I need to come back

721
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,240
to have a transnational video meeting at night.

722
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,500
Pick a nearby restaurant.

723
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Why here?

724
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,300
It's based on your requirements.

725
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,320
Isn't that Mr. Fang's car?

726
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,160
Xiaoqi, come out to welcome...

727
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,020
Xiaoqi.

728
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,560
Xiaoqi.

729
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,280
Who do you want me to welcome?

730
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Stand well.

731
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,520
You're so young.

732
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,120
Why don't you dress yourself up?

733
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,160
You don't have a sense of competition at all.

734
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,240
Am I not so good?

735
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,400
Can I become a fairy after dressing up?

736
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,660
Fairy.

737
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,120
This is the restaurant and the takeout delivery girl

738
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,580
you guaranteed last time?

739
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,640
Hum.

740
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,920
Where do we sit?

741
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,000
Anywhere is fine.

742
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,180
Please come with me.

743
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,840
We've already prepared couple seats for you.

744
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,280
This way, please.

745
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,920
This way, please. This way, please.

746
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,160
It's quite good.

747
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,240
Hum.

748
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
Great.

749
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,440
Order please.

750
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,220
Just order dishes you like.

751
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,400
-Lady first. -I'll like all dishes you order.

752
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,220
I don't know what you like.

753
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,000
I like what you like.

754
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,900
Don't bother.

755
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,180
Our restaurant has prepared the lovers set for you.

756
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,360
I promise you'll be satisfied.

757
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,280
Forget it.

758
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,760
It's mainly because this is the first time

759
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,740
that such a beautiful girl has come here.

760
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,200
As the assistant manager,

761
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,700
I sincerely hope you

762
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,360
can take a photo together

763
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,540
to publicize our restaurant.

764
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,040
What do you think?

765
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,960
Okay.

766
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,120
We'd like the lovers set you said.

767
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,480
Wait a moment, please.

768
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,240
Good. I have faith in you.

769
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,780
Xiaoqi.

770
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,680
What?

771
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,540
Girl, are you a fool?

772
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,680
How could you take them to the position

773
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,160
where is so suitable for a date?

774
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,320
But, don't you think

775
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,160
only such a good position

776
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,840
can match such a beautiful girl?

777
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,240
I find that if one is foolish enough,

778
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,760
even the boiled duck can fly away.

779
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,540
Duck?

780
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,520
Is there old duck soup in the kitchen today?

781
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,120
Where's my hypotensor?

782
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,460
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

783
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,960
Just be willful.

784
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,280
Well, as you picked me up,

785
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,000
I prepared a small gift for you.

786
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,240
What's this?

787
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,360
This used to be my favorite milk tea.

788
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,660
Have a taste.

789
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,100
Perhaps you also drank it before.

790
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,160
Excuse me.

791
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,480
This is our chef's flagship dessert.

792
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,800
This half heart is yours, and this half heart is yours.

793
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
I don't like dessert.

794
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,280
Thanks.

795
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,740
We don't need other services.

796
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,640
I see. I see.

797
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,280
It is like this.

798
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,040
Our restaurant is doing an activity.

799
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,260
If you share your meal to the Moments with a photo,

800
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,560
we'll send you couple dolls.

801
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,000
This is of limited edition.

802
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,760
It's only for the couples
who look most like husband and wife.

803
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,360
So cute.

804
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,320
We don't need it.

805
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,040
It's such a lovely doll.

806
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,360
How could you make it dirty?

807
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,320
I hate you.

808
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,160
There are only two ones in the restaurant.

809
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,200
I'm going to send one to someone.

810
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,800
Send it to someone?

811
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,960
How dare you?

812
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,280
What's wrong?

813
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,940
My suit is dirty.

814
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,560
I'm going to get changed.

815
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,040
It's strange.

816
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,060
Mr. Fang.

817
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,300
Boss, are all your couple dolls here?

818
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,400
Yes.

819
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,300
I want them all.

820
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,400
Pack them all.

821
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,440
Okay. Okay.

822
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,800
What are you doing?

823
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,020
You don't like dolls, do you?

824
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,660
I know what you want to do.

825
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,760
You want to send these dolls to Fang Lie, right?

826
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,540
He's focusing on drawing now.

827
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,080
If you dare disturb him with this,

828
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,140
I'll cut your hands.

829
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,160
Please make it clear.

830
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,840
You're dating such a beautiful girl now.

831
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,340
If you run wild and act like this, you'll scare her away.

832
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,040
Do you know?

833
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,440
I don't need you to worry about it.

834
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,660
Ever since I met you,

835
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

836
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,740
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

837
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,620
only you.

838
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,820
We're out of reach

839
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,140
but appreciate each other.

840
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,940
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

841
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,980
The yearning invades

842
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,540
and lurks in my mind.

843
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:23,100
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

844
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,180
I'm getting addicted to it

845
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,500
and my sense is shielded.

846
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:37,300
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

847
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,460
Put the hottest heart

848
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,780
in this cold body.

849
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,140
I'm looking at you,

850
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,300
and my love has nowhere to go.

851
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,540
Ever since I met you,

852
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,460
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

853
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,740
Every day is a new memory

854
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,780
which is only be about you and me.

855
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,020
I can't lie to myself anymore.

856
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,860
Please give me the courage to believe.

857
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,780
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

858
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,700
only you.

859
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,820
Even everything becomes silent,

860
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,940
I still have you.
