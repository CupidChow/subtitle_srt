1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 14

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
I think what I'm looking for is on you.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,120
Just let me...

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,360
Here you are.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,120
I don't mean your coat,

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,320
but your body.

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,640
Stop.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,040
Mr. Fang,

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
she is just kidding.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Don't be angry.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll explain it

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
to you later.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Get off.

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,360
Don't be so angry.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,760
I just want you to do me a favor.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,600
It's really important to me.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,480
From now on,

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,400
you are no longer my girlfriend.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,360
Get off.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
OK.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,600
Xiaoqi.

39
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:09,760
Mr. Fang,

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,360
here is far away from her home.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
It's dangerous

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,480
to leave her alone.

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,760
Don't order

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,640
me like this, okay?

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,120
I...

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,960
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,320
Stingy.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,920
You really leave me here alone.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,520
Where is it here?

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,440
Stingy.

51
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,880
Nasty Fang Leng.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Look at it carefully.

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,080
Are you sure you did nothing

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,520
to her before the heavy rain?

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,400
No.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,840
She is just my ex-girlfriend.

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
Is it she so important to me?

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,800
No.

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Last time when it rained,

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
she was the only woman you remembered.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
Theoretically,

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,440
it should happen again.

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,640
How about

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
asking Miss Chai here?

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Maybe we can ask her why.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:14,920
No.

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240
No matter what method she used last time,

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
I just don't want to let her

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
mess around anymore.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,160
What's more,

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,800
I just

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,600
hate her now,

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,760
so

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,400
I will never turn to her for help.

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,200
I know

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
it's hard for you to restore

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,080
the emotional pattern before you lost your memory,

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
but now only she can help you.

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,960
Don't be so emotional.

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,360
You need treatment.

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
She acted without sense of propriety

82
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,000
to me in broad daylight.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
I'll never turn to

84
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
a rude woman for help.

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
How strange it is!

86
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,560
After waking up,

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,480
you've just seen her twice.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
Why do you

89
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
hate her so much?

90
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Is it...

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,280
What?

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,640
I just guess it.

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,440
I think you were born with

94
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,000
a strong feeling for her.

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
Before losing your memory,

96
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,600
you liked her very much,

97
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
but after losing your memory,

98
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
you hate her very much.

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,360
Psychologically,

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
we call it

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
the subconscious of self-protection.

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,720
For fear that you may love her,

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
you forget her on purpose.

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,120
Doctor Zhang,

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
are you kidding me?

106
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
I said that I guessed it.

107
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
You are abnormal.

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Certainly,

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,080
I'll deal with you in an abnormal way.

110
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,640
Right?

111
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,640
Next,

112
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,640
I think, step by step...

113
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:32,960
Stop.

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
That's all for the consultation today.

115
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
Do you think that

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
Mr. Fang has changed?

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,400
Yes.

118
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
He is who he was a few months ago.

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,280
He is serious

120
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,920
and cold to us

121
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,920
and seems to have no feelings.

122
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Since Miss Chai was here,

123
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Mr. Fang became more easy-going.

124
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
No matter how angry he was,

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,960
he would not hurt others at will.

126
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,320
However, today

127
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,240
I saw it personally that

128
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,880
he left her on the highway alone.

129
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
He is almost the same

130
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
as he was

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
before Miss Chai was here.

132
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
I think

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
he has forgotten

134
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Xiaoqi

135
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,680
and the changes she made to him.

136
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,880
We have tried hard to give him the touch of human.

137
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
I won't let him become what he was.

138
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
You mean...

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Turn to Xiaoqi for help.

140
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
She is the key.

141
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,080
Only she can help him now.

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,200
I agree.

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
The long-distance teleportation

144
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
almost kills me.

145
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,400
I hate Fang Leng.

146
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,280
Doctor Zhang,

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
why are you here?

148
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm here

149
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,880
and I know that

150
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
Fang Leng left you behind halfway on the road.

151
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,440
You just met him, right?

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,040
He is inconsistent and crazy.

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,160
There must be something wrong with him.

154
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,080
Yes.

155
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Something really goes wrong with him,

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,280
but he isn't as abnormal as you said.

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,720
Well,

158
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,240
you've helped him for a long time.

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
In fact, you should be

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,440
informed of something.

161
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,160
Let's

162
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,200
talk in details.

163
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,160
What?

164
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,760
You said...

165
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,440
Relax,

166
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,400
or others may know it.

167
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,640
But

168
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,320
I...

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,200
No.

170
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,480
Fang Leng...

171
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,600
But,

172
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,560
but

173
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
why does he get it?

174
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,920
He never told me before.

175
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
He

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,120
puffs himself up at his own cost.

177
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,320
Think about it.

178
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
He may choose to kill himself

179
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,400
than to let you know his illness

180
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,120
as he likes you.

181
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,640
But he doesn't like me.

182
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,720
He just comes to me for treatment, right?

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Well,

184
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,160
You two are

185
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,760
really made for each other.

186
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,040
Let's move on.

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,320
Think about it.

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
Did he get any stimulation

189
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,680
before losing his memory?

190
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,080
Stimulation?

191
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,320
I remember it.

192
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
Before it rained...

193
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,800
Sir,

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,880
it is like this.

195
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,920
We made this cake

196
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,880
as the new snack here today.

197
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
Would you like to try it for free?

198
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,920
By the way,

199
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
it has a special name

200
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,360
called

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,240
"you're so handsome."

202
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Thanks.

203
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,080
Why do you hit me?

204
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,920
You're really strange.

205
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Never mind. Let's go on.

206
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,800
Before it rained,

207
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
I wanted to move him

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
by seducing him,

209
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,600
but I failed.

210
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Later Fang Lie kissed me,

211
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
so Fang Leng left.

212
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,400
What?

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
Fang Lie kissed you.

214
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,280
But he did that to help me.

215
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,600
It shouldn't

216
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,640
affect Fang Leng.

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,960
I see.

218
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Fang Leng forgot you

219
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,640
out of self-protection.

220
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,440
Did anything go wrong with you two?

221
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,400
Well,

222
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
all things between us

223
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,080
went wrong.

224
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,040
He didn't allow me to resign

225
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
and tortured me.

226
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,240
Besides,

227
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
he transferred me to Fang Lie's department.

228
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,600
If you didn't tell me that he is ill,

229
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,720
I may doubt that I'm going insane.

230
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,560
That's it.

231
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
He was attracted by you,

232
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
so he didn't forget you.

233
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,880
Instinctively, he doesn't want to forget you.

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,720
But it's different this time.

235
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,240
You hurt him.

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,640
Out of self-protection,

237
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,040
he forgets you intentionally.

238
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
You mean

239
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
I caused

240
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
his memory loss.

241
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,640
I guess that.

242
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Now

243
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,480
what's most important is to make him remember it.

244
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,120
I strongly feel it that

245
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,680
as long as he can remember you,

246
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,720
his illness

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
may be cured this time.

248
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
How to get him restore his memory?

249
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't worry.

250
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
Assistant Han is looking for a way.

251
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,080
Mr. Fang,

252
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,280
this is the data from your memory bank.

253
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
Those important have been sorted out.

254
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,600
This was the first time when Xiaoqi went to your home.

255
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,500
=Hard disk read failure=

256
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,200
Impossible.

257
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
It's impossible to delete

258
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
the data in the memory bank.

259
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,880
Change another one.

260
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,340
=Chai Xiaoqi=

261
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,140
=Hard disk read failure=

262
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,000
How about the rest?

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,000
Have they been deleted?

264
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,600
No.

265
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,360
I checked other data

266
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
before screening

267
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,440
and found no problem.

268
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Why are those about Xiaoqi gone?

269
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Are you sure that before losing my memory,

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
I didn't delete her deliberately as I hated her?

271
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,160
That's impossible.

272
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,200
You really cared about her.

273
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,880
Fine.

274
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Even if the data are still here,

275
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,680
I don't have the patience to get to know her.

276
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,640
If I want to know her,

277
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,880
I'll go to myself.

278
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,680
Check others data first.

279
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,680
Yes.

280
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,260
=Chai Xiaoqi=

281
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,840
Well.

282
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,440
The boss lady isn't here.

283
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
Why are you here?

284
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,120
I come to see you

285
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,000
as your boyfriend.

286
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,560
No.

287
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,000
He didn't say that before.

288
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,160
Yes,

289
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,880
you used to

290
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,840
come to see me a lot,

291
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,760
right?

292
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,800
I know,

293
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
but I did

294
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
more for you, right?

295
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,840
You sent me to the company

296
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
and sent me back

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,040
after work every day.

298
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,480
Every morning,

299
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,720
you prepared a big bunch of flowers for me.

300
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,080
You took me to dinner every evening

301
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
as if I was a princess.

302
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,720
We really loved each other

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,240
and never quarreled.

304
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,880
Do you know

305
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
why I liked you so much?

306
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,920
Sure,

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
because I'm beautiful.

308
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,560
You used to

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,520
watch me all day long.

310
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,040
You said I was tender

311
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,320
and really loved me dearly.

312
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,120
You said

313
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,720
you wanted to spend

314
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,960
your whole life with nobody except me,

315
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
and even if I had nothing,

316
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,040
you still wanted to be with me.

317
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,640
Do you

318
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
remember it?

319
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,760
Let the past be past.

320
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,160
I want to put an end to it now.

321
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,680
Why?

322
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,560
No reason.

323
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,920
As long as you agree to break up with me,

324
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,800
I can promise you anything.

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
So

326
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
you liked me so much,

327
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,320
but you don't want to be with me now

328
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
even if you get another chance,

329
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,440
right?

330
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,640
Yes.

331
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,040
That's what you really feel about me.

332
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,680
So you just

333
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,360
took advantage of me.

334
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,840
What do you mean?

335
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,240
Nothing.

336
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,600
Anyway,

337
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I won't break up with you.

338
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,280
Why?

339
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Haven't you given me up yet?

340
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,720
I just want to be with you.

341
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,680
So what?

342
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Miss Chai,

343
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,760
what do you want,

344
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,480
money,

345
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,760
status

346
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,560
or anything else?

347
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
As long as I can promise you,

348
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll satisfy you.

349
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,280
You keep bothering me

350
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,400
for a certain purpose, right?

351
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,160
You know what?

352
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,640
You are just as self-centered,

353
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,560
arrogant,

354
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,080
and cold blooded

355
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,960
as who you were

356
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,760
when I just knew you.

357
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
You don't care about others' feelings at all.

358
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,840
But even if you've changed,

359
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
I still want to be with you,

360
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,840
because you're so annoying.

361
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,520
The more annoying you are,

362
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,600
the more eager I am to change you.

363
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,920
Miss Chai,

364
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,520
don't overestimate yourself.

365
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm not going to change

366
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,520
because of you.

367
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
Come on.

368
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,080
Have a try.

369
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm not here to argue with you today.

370
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,680
Think about what I said carefully.

371
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,440
I hope you'll agree

372
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
after thinking it for 3 days.

373
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,960
Without you,

374
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,280
I won't get my annunciator.

375
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm sure I can restore

376
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,520
your memory with stimulation.

377
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,480
Mr. Fang,

378
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,160
this is the takeaway for you.

379
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,800
Stop her.

380
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
Wait.

381
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,680
Look at me

382
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
and what I wear.

383
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,800
Can you

384
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,960
remember anything?

385
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,440
What are you up to?

386
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,360
Then wait a second.

387
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,560
How about this one?

388
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,960
I fed you

389
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,600
this congee back then.

390
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,400
Do you remember it?

391
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,160
How much?

392
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,600
You remember it.

393
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
This is just 38.5 yuan.

394
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,040
But I don't want you to pay for it,

395
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,520
I just want...

396
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
I mean how much I should pay

397
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
to make you break up with me.

398
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,600
I don't want to see you again.

399
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,080
Well.

400
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:39,920
Do,

401
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,000
do you

402
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,280
really feel nothing?

403
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,640
Drive her away.

404
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,040
Fang Leng.

405
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,680
Fang Leng.

406
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,400
Listen to me.

407
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,800
Miss Chai,

408
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
you're disturbing our boss.

409
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,120
It won't help.

410
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,200
Please go back.

411
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,640
I have to think about other solutions.

412
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,400
I need something more stimulating

413
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,000
to restore his memory.

414
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,240
What are you doing?

415
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,680
Freeze.

416
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
I'm just trying to help you.

417
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,720
What?

418
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,680
What are you doing to help me?

419
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,000
What do you want to do?

420
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,040
What are you doing?

421
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,280
Well.

422
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,440
Wear it.

423
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
What's going on?

424
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,640
What do you want to do?

425
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,320
Why doesn't it work?

426
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,760
Are you all right?

427
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,080
Wake up.

428
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,760
Fang Leng.

429
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,120
My God.

430
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,040
I was wrong.

431
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,480
Fang Leng.

432
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
I just want to save you.

433
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
How could this happen?

434
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,520
Fang Leng,

435
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,640
can you hear me?

436
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,240
Fang Leng,

437
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,160
wake up.

438
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,840
You are alright.

439
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,360
You said you wanted to help me.

440
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,960
What does it mean?

441
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,120
I,

442
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,520
I know you have amnesia.

443
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,920
Who told you that?

444
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,400
You told me.

445
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
You said you were ill

446
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,760
and wanted me to help you.

447
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Do you forget it?

448
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,360
You said I was the only one you remember.

449
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
Were you my girlfriend?

450
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,600
Tell me.

451
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,120
Have I ever loved you?

452
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,360
No.

453
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,320
You never love me.

454
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,080
You never drive me to and from work.

455
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
You neither said I was beautiful

456
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,560
nor loved me dearly.

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,520
I,

458
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,720
I am just a tool

459
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,440
for treating your illness.

460
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,760
You didn't feel

461
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,600
anything about me

462
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,240
like now.

463
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah,

464
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
I should have guessed that

465
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
you are a liar.

466
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I lied to you

467
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,320
but I...

468
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,400
Since that you helped me,

469
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,480
I forgive you.

470
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,760
Go.

471
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,920
We are quit.

472
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
No.

473
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
You owe me something.

474
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,560
OK.

475
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,320
As long as you can give up,

476
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll give you anything.

477
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,560
But

478
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
it's in your heart.

479
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,440
Are you crazy?

480
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,600
Falling

481
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
in love with me again, OK?

482
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,360
I promise

483
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,440
I'll go when I get it.

484
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,080
Are you out of your mind?

485
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
I can drive you away now.

486
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,880
I mean it.

487
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,280
It's really in your heart.

488
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,360
I don't know what happened between us,

489
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,280
but now

490
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,400
I'd rather never remember you.

491
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,880
Get out.

492
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,200
-Director Fang. -Director Fang.

493
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,040
Where is Xiaoqi?

494
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,640
She asked for leave

495
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,480
and didn't come today.

496
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,800
Why?

497
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,720
I don't know.

498
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,520
Is it because I kissed her,

499
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
she didn't want to see me?

500
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,560
No.

501
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,120
She said she didn't mind it.

502
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,040
Does anything else go wrong with her?

503
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,800
Sorry.

504
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,320
The subscriber you dialed is not...

505
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,640
Hello.

506
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,800
Do you ask me to meet

507
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
here to irritate me deliberately?

508
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,240
A painter who doesn't paint can still appreciate paintings.

509
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,360
Besides,

510
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,880
here was your favorite place.

511
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,640
Come on.

512
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,400
What for?

513
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
I heard that

514
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,760
Fang Leng transferred

515
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,840
Chai Xiaoqi to your department.

516
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,040
How did you know that?

517
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
I also know that

518
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,560
she has a lot to do with him.

519
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,320
You knew it,

520
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,160
but you kept it from me.

521
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,680
It's none of my business.

522
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,800
I don't care.

523
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,920
Besides,

524
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,120
even if I tell you

525
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,440
I can't help you.

526
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,280
I know

527
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,320
you didn't want to make me sad

528
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
and wanted to protect me,

529
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,440
right?

530
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,600
Fang Lie,

531
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,000
fire her, OK?

532
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,200
Last time when you exposed her stealing of the sapphire,

533
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,280
I covered it for you.

534
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,040
Now she has made no mistake.

535
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,960
Why do you ask me to fire her?

536
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,160
In terms of qualification and ability,

537
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
she shouldn't work in your company.

538
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,400
What's more,

539
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,360
we don't know her background.

540
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
What if she bothers Fang Leng again?

541
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
She's not the one as you think.

542
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,440
And

543
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,400
she broke up with him.

544
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
Don't embarrass her.

545
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,520
You're not me.

546
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,960
You won't know how I feel.

547
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
I was going to be with Fang Leng.

548
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,680
If it wasn't for her,

549
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,680
he wouldn't have refused me suddenly.

550
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,120
It's been so...

551
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,720
I just

552
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,200
deal with her

553
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
as she dealt with me.

554
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,040
If he likes you,

555
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
things won't be what it is now.

556
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,200
You mean,

557
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,000
you think

558
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,080
I am the third party

559
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,640
who destroys his feelings,

560
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,040
right?

561
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,800
I didn't mean that.

562
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,800
As you're worried about her,

563
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll arrange a new job

564
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,800
for her at once.

565
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,680
I promise

566
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I won't hurt her

567
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,080
as long as she leaves Fang Leng.

568
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,280
I won't hurt anyone innocent

569
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,160
for personal reasons.

570
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,520
Why are you here?

571
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,920
As you were absent from work,

572
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,400
certainly I am here to ask you why as your boss.

573
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,240
Tell me.

574
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,400
What did you do today?

575
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,040
Well.

576
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,920
I helped someone I shouldn't help

577
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,920
and did a lot of wrong things I shouldn't do.

578
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,680
I wonder

579
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,040
if I should stay here.

580
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,880
When I didn't keep an eye on you,

581
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,280
you went to Leng again.

582
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,360
When I get what belongs to me,

583
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
I won't meet him again.

584
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,440
What is it?

585
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,560
I can help you.

586
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,800
You don't know it.

587
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,800
It is in an important part of his body.

588
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,600
We may hurt him if we get it by force.

589
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,000
Let's talk about it

590
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,080
when he doesn't hate me.

591
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,280
I didn't expect that this is wine.

592
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,320
Love makes people blind.

593
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,400
You focus on him, so much so that

594
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
you can't even tell the wine bottle before you.

595
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,560
Actually,

596
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,720
I am so happy

597
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,800
to see

598
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,800
what he is now.

599
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,320
What is he now?

600
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,840
He forgets me,

601
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,400
but that's great.

602
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,640
In this case, I don't worry that

603
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,480
he'll be upset when I go home.

604
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,520
So I can return to

605
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,480
my planet without anxiety.

606
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,160
Great.

607
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,520
Do you get drunk

608
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,280
and have an alien dream?

609
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,000
I hope we can

610
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,480
return to our home planet earlier.

611
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:03,960
Cheers.

612
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,280
Assistant Han,

613
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,000
inform the Personnel Department

614
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,280
to fire Chai Xiaoqi.

615
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,680
Why?

616
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,520
You brought her personally.

617
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
Give her a severance package in the name of the company

618
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,720
as compensation for her.

619
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,160
Make sure it is enough for her future life.

620
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,320
Don't mention her to me again.

621
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,880
But...

622
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,520
I told you

623
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,480
not to mention her again.

624
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
Who are you talking about?

625
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,080
Unexpectedly, you're here.

626
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,920
No.

627
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,320
I've been waiting for you this morning.

628
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,800
What's wrong with all of you?

629
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,000
Why all of you

630
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,800
want to fire Xiaoqi?

631
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,680
Who else wants to fire her?

632
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,200
A woman

633
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,080
like you.

634
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:54,920
Well,

635
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,240
Leng,

636
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,120
did she offend you so that

637
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,840
you hate her so much?

638
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,560
I don't think I should

639
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,080
report to you to fire her.

640
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
She is working in my department now.

641
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Without my consent,

642
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,720
nobody can fire her.

643
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,880
Do you like her?

644
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,120
Yes.

645
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,680
I'll keep her here

646
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,480
to see her every day.

647
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,840
If I can't see her,

648
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,840
I'll quit.

649
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,840
Anyway,

650
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm useless.

651
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,960
If you fire her,

652
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,120
I'll leave the company.

653
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,560
OK.

654
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,000
Do you agree, Leng?

655
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,880
I mean I can also fire you.

656
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,800
As you may give up your career for her,

657
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,440
it'll make no difference whether you are here or not.

658
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,400
When you make a decision, send me your resignation letter.

659
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,160
Leng. Leng.

660
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,000
Leng.

661
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,480
Sister.

662
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,280
What's the matter?

663
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,320
Why do you want to see me urgently?

664
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Recently,

665
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
Fang Leng doesn't get along well with Chai Xiaoqi.

666
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,160
They loved each other a lot, right?

667
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,680
I don't know what happened.

668
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,560
But according to the Personnel Department,

669
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,480
he wants to fire her,

670
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,480
but Fang Lie still refuses to sign.

671
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,720
They have come to a deadlock.

672
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,920
Why is Fang Lie involved?

673
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,240
Will it bring him trouble?

674
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,360
As long as the Chairman is there,

675
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,040
Fang Lie will be alright.

676
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,760
But

677
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,560
it's a chance for us.

678
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,960
You want to

679
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,800
attack Fang Leng

680
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,080
with it?

681
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm sure

682
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,360
Chai Xiaoqi knows

683
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,680
some secrets of Fang Leng.

684
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,760
If they really break off,

685
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
we may ask Chai Xiaoqi

686
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,440
for the secrets.

687
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,440
No.

688
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Shida forbids me from

689
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,680
interfering in Fang Leng's business.

690
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,280
If things go wrong,

691
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
it may bring trouble to us.

692
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,320
We won't do it ourselves.

693
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,680
Don't forget that

694
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,120
Fang Leng is the focus of tabloids.

695
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,880
As long as the reporter has a few words,

696
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,920
it'll become sensational.

697
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,640
Take the chance

698
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,360
and expose it.

699
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,240
Abandon his subordinate and girlfriend.

700
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Certainly it'll catch people's eyes.

701
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,040
Good morning.

702
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,000
What's wrong?

703
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,840
You look confusing.

704
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,440
When I was swiping my employee card,

705
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
I found it was invalid.

706
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
The security guard told me

707
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,480
it happened when I was fired.

708
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
No.

709
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
You won't be fired.

710
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,160
Use mine first.

711
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,080
What would you do then?

712
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Swipe my face.

713
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,920
They all know me.

714
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,800
Never mind.

715
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,680
I can get in without a card.

716
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
The plan hasn't been finished yet.

717
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,520
Make it with me.

718
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
We went to Mr. Sun some days ago,

719
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,840
and he has sent the samples.

720
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,240
Check them with me.

721
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,600
OK.

722
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,320
The plan

723
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,160
will be reviewed in a few days.

724
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,800
This is my first project.

725
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
Finish it with me, OK?

726
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,640
Don't worry.

727
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,040
Although I have been hit a bit,

728
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,280
I will still work hard.

729
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,360
Don't forget that

730
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm

731
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,520
an invincible little devil in the universe.

732
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,640
OK.

733
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:29,880
See you.

734
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,920
Come in, please.

735
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,000
Mr. Fang,

736
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,360
tea for you.

737
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
We haven't seen each other for a few days.

738
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,920
Do you still remember me?

739
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,960
Miss Jiang, you're kidding me.

740
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,400
I'm afraid I can't have

741
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
the milk tea you gave me.

742
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,200
You must be very busy these days.

743
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,440
I heard that

744
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,280
you were bothered by Xiaoqi.

745
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,800
You know it.

746
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,080
Don't forget that

747
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,440
you used to tell me everything.

748
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,920
Let alone Xiaoqi,

749
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,040
perhaps

750
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,280
I know your top secret.

751
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,880
I have a lot of secrets.

752
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,000
I wonder which one you mean.

753
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,400
The one that

754
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
none of your girlfriends

755
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,920
would accept except me.

756
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,320
I knew you had amnesia

757
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,280
and

758
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,040
have been covering for you.

759
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
You forgot me when I first

760
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,120
visited your family,

761
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,240
so I helped you out before your mom.

762
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,200
Do you still remember it?

763
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,080
How did you know that?

764
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,880
I just want to tell you,

765
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,360
you don't need to guard against me all the time.

766
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,520
I'd like to

767
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,960
help you.

768
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,840
Just accept it without concern.

769
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,800
Help me?

770
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,640
For example, Xiaoqi.

771
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,280
If you need it,

772
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,920
I can help you get rid of her.

773
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,740
=Assistant Han=

774
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,880
That's all.

775
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,920
See you.

776
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,760
Mr. Fang, don't forget me.

777
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:51,960
What's up?

778
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,840
Mr. Fang,

779
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,120
someone reveals that

780
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,800
you've broken up with Miss Chai.

781
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,640
It was reported by a network media.

782
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,000
I just sent the photos to your iPad.

783
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,200
Who published the photos?

784
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
They were taken

785
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,160
when you helped Miss Chai.

786
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,600
But your relationship has never been made public.

787
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,240
How do the media know the breakup?

788
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,080
Where is Chai Xiaoqi now?

789
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,120
In the company, perhaps.

790
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,880
Well.

791
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,760
Put it here.

792
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,960
Here are the samples.

793
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,480
But I know little about perfume.

794
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,120
How to combine it with planning?

795
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,520
It's easy.

796
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,000
People use perfume

797
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
to find the one who is

798
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,600
most attractive to them.

799
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
As long as we can find out

800
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,160
the fragrance that stimulates hormones most,

801
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,720
our perfume will be successful.

802
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,440
Xiaoqi,

803
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,120
I didn't notice that

804
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,720
you're quite resourceful.

805
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,600
But how can you tell which bottle

806
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
of perfume can stimulate hormones?

807
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
Because my nose works.

808
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,640
This one.

809
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,520
OK.

810
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,040
Our perfume will be

811
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
called Hormone.

812
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,560
And with my design,

813
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,520
it'll be impressive.

814
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,440
Yes.

815
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,920
Can I have 3 minutes?

816
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,040
I have something to talk to her.

817
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,320
No.

818
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,960
Leng,

819
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
I told you

820
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
not to fire her.

821
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
That's not what I'm talking about.

822
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,280
Go out first.

823
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,520
Fang Lie,

824
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,640
don't worry.

825
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,120
I need no protection.

826
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,200
I am not afraid of him.

827
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,120
Well.

828
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,360
Have you decided yet?

829
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,560
When can I have it?

830
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,000
What exactly do you want?

831
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,760
That's why you threaten me.

832
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,080
You're doing something beyond your ability.

833
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,000
I threaten you?

834
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,520
What does that mean?

835
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,640
You expose

836
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,640
our breakup, right?

837
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
Don't talk nonsense.

838
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,800
I might be mischievous.

839
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
I won't do that to hurt you.

840
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,440
Don't regard me as a monster.

841
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,560
I won't believe you.

842
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,240
I really did nothing.

843
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,160
Listen carefully.

844
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,440
From today on,

845
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,560
you're not allowed to

846
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,040
say anything about me.

847
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,320
Do you understand?

848
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,720
What,

849
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,360
what a fool!

850
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,080
A nasty earthling!

851
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,040
Narcissistic!

852
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,840
Are there any public activities for me in the following days?

853
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,840
No.

854
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,320
Should I arrange it now?

855
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,280
As soon as possible.

856
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,840
Before it's cooked up by the media,

857
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,680
I have to clarify personally.

858
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,600
I see.

859
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,200
Xiaoqi,

860
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,120
hello.

861
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,400
Just in time. Watch the news.

862
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,600
I'm too tired to watch it.

863
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,240
No.

864
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,880
It's about Fang Leng.

865
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,400
Come here.

866
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,280
Here comes the scandal of the famous playboy Fang Leng again.

867
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,320
He was linked to a subordinate in his company.

868
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,320
They had fell in love for a long time,

869
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,960
but they broke up recently.

870
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
Fang Lang dumped another

871
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,400
girl besides those ex-girlfriends.

872
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,160
Here are our findings.

873
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,680
Reporters now are really

874
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,080
good at making up a story.

875
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,320
They're calling the false the true.

876
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,080
It's true.

877
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,280
What?

878
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,680
You two really broke up.

879
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,320
It is reported that

880
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,920
Fang Leng will attend a charity banquet tomorrow.

881
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,960
We'll bring you more information

882
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,720
through our webcast by then.

883
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,480
You're back at last.

884
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,560
I need food.

885
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,680
What are you doing?

886
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,920
You don't need to dress yourself up in the evening.

887
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,640
Fang Leng is going to refute the rumor tomorrow.

888
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,600
I have to help him.

889
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,320
Come on.

890
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,600
He hasn't given the annunciator back to you.

891
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,320
Don't help him.

892
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,680
Are you out of your mind?

893
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,440
The scandal is related to both of us.

894
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,960
Even though I don't do that for him,

895
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
I do that for myself, OK?

896
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,400
Thank you very much.

897
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,680
OK. I'll talk to you later.

898
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,360
Why are you here?

899
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,080
Hearing that you're going to clarify the scandal,

900
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,320
I'm here to help you.

901
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,120
Help me?

902
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,760
What are you going to do?

903
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,000
As your gossip girl,

904
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,960
as long as I explain clearly our relationship,

905
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
the rumor will be gone, right?

906
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,760
Aren't you keeping bothering me.

907
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
Why help me for no reason?

908
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,080
Maybe you forget it.

909
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,280
When our restaurant was in trouble,

910
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,800
you helped us.

911
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,520
Now as you're in trouble,

912
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,240
I won't just look on unconcerned.

913
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,040
Don't get me wrong.

914
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,920
I just don't want to owe you.

915
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,880
Besides,

916
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,880
I also want to clarify the relationship.

917
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,920
I don't want to be connected with you.

918
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,560
I'm late.

919
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,440
Have you been waiting long?

920
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,880
Let's go.

921
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,120
Wait.

922
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,320
You really don't need my help?

923
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,880
Go back.

924
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,200
Well,

925
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,560
she is here for you.

926
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,880
It's improper to refuse her.

927
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,360
Miss Chai,

928
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
do you mind

929
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
joining us?

930
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,040
There are too many reporters in it.

931
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,720
I don't want to get her involved?

932
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,320
Yes,

933
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,560
I'm tied up.

934
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
The reporters came for the scandal.

935
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,400
Don't you want to

936
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
explain it for Fang Leng?

937
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,720
After all,

938
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,520
you caused it.

939
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,760
I said that

940
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,000
it had nothing to do with her.

941
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,160
OK.

942
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,600
I will explain our relationship clearly.

943
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,940
=Charitable Banquet=

944
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,240
Mr. Fang. Here is Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang.

945
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,200
Here is Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang.

946
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,320
Mr. Fang,

947
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,680
was your subordinate really your girlfriend?

948
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,280
Who is this girl by your side?

949
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,000
I'll never personally connect to

950
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,920
anyone I work with.

951
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,560
We are close friends.

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,640
This time I just come

953
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,800
as his female companion,

954
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,040
while Miss Chai

955
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,080
as a subordinate with us.

956
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,200
I think

957
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,160
what she says will be more persuasive.

958
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,160
Excuse me.

959
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,480
Is what she just said true?

960
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,120
Are you just a subordinate of Mr. Fang?

961
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
What's your relationship with him?

962
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,760
Yes, please tell us.

963
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,320
Please explain it.

964
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
I had a lot of contact

965
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,600
with Mr. Fang

966
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,560
as his former secretary.

967
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,440
We often

968
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,400
worked together,

969
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,600
so we were misunderstood.

970
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,360
Excuse me, Miss Chai.

971
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
You were a delivery girl.

972
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,520
Can you tell us

973
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,480
how you joined F Group?

974
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,760
Yes, Miss Chai.

975
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,640
Can you tell us

976
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,960
how you joined F Group?

977
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,640
Explain the whole story.

978
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,480
Please explain it to us.

979
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,160
I...

980
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,560
Miss Chai, say something more.

981
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,800
Miss Chai, please explain it.

982
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,240
It's me.

983
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,580
It's me.

984
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,540
Ever since I met you,

985
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

986
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

987
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,500
only you.

988
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,700
We're out of reach

989
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,020
but appreciate each other.

990
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:33,820
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

991
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,860
The yearning invades

992
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,420
and lurks in my mind.

993
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:47,980
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

994
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,060
I'm getting addicted to it

995
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,380
and my sense is shielded.

996
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:02,180
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

997
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,340
Put the hottest heart

998
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,660
in this cold body.

999
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,020
I'm looking at you,

1000
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,180
and my love has nowhere to go.

1001
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,420
Ever since I met you,

1002
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

1003
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,620
Every day is a new memory

1004
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,660
which is only be about you and me.

1005
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,900
I can't lie to myself anymore.

1006
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,740
Please give me the courage to believe.

1007
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,660
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

1008
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,580
only you.

1009
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,700
Even everything becomes silent,

1010
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,820
I still have you.
