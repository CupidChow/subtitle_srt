1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 1

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,760
Recently, the Panstar Telescope of the University of Hawaii

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,840
observed a UFO visiting the solar system

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,760
while searching for near-earth objects

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,080
for NASA.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,600
It is the first celestial body observed by humans

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,200
and confirmed to be from outside the solar system.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,880
Mr. Fang,

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,200
there is a chance of heavy rain tonight.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,320
You must come back right now.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,160
Got it.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,640
Scientists speculate that

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
the UFO might come from

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
a binary system outside the solar system.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,600
Planetary scientists from
the University of Toronto, Canada,

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,640
including Evan Jackson, studied...

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,880
An earthling.

35
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,320
What a taste of hormone!

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
Control your hand!

37
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,640
Mr. Fang,

38
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
let me check you up.

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
From your car accident last week until now,

40
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
we have almost done all the inspections,

41
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,160
but still haven't found out what is wrong.

42
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Didn't you say there is a shadow on my chest before?

43
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,400
Can you confirm the diagnosis?

44
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
No abnormalities have been detected for the moment.

45
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,840
We suspect it is hematocele.

46
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Mr. Fang,

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
do you remember anything else back then?

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,320
Except for crashing into a coma,

49
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,840
I can't recall anything.

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
No impression at all?

51
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,000
Did it rain that day?

52
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,160
Yes.

53
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,200
It did rain.

54
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,760
I see.

55
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,640
You maybe go back now.

56
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
I will inform you at any time if necessary.

57
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Then get more rest!

58
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,540
=Wang Jianguo from China, Earth.
The system has initiated Chinese program.=

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
Hello, Uncle Wang Jianguo!

60
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,840
I get lost on earth.

61
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,360
Now I am drawn by earth gravity,

62
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
so I can't go back home.

63
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Is this the northern hemisphere?

64
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
Help!

65
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Earthlings are too lukewarm.

66
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
What's this?

67
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,940
Don't throw me away, Xiaoqi.

68
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,040
It's me.

69
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,080
I'm your personal secretary, Kubri.

70
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
Kubri.

71
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,160
How come you become like this?

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
It's all because you went to save that earthling,

73
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,200
then I fell into the river with you.

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,280
Now my brain nucleus is eaten by this turtle,

75
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,000
so I can only contact you by manipulating this turtle.

76
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm talking to you with low-frequency sound waves.

77
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Only you can hear me.

78
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,680
You have been lying in the river for seven solar days.

79
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
Now the spacecraft has left.

80
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,520
We are completely left behind.

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
It's okay.

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I can contact the headquarters with the annunciator.

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,360
Where is my annunciator?

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,480
Screwed!

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I lost my annunciator.

86
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,920
It maybe

87
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
with the man I saved.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
Do you still remember

89
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
what that man looks like?

90
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
I can't exactly recall his face.

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
But I remember

92
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,440
his figure.

93
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,320
Dear master,

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,680
it's sunny today.

95
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,020
Thirty degrees Celsius.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
The air humidity is 40%.

97
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,400
In the upcoming week,

98
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
there is no cooling or rain.

99
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Clothing Index:

100
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,280
Mr. Fang.

101
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Grade 4

102
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,680
Something happened to the company.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,680
Go ahead.

104
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
Your ex-girlfriends

105
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
came to the company and made troubles.

106
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,120
Ex

107
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,760
girlfriends?

108
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,280
I've asked about it.

109
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
This is an organized

110
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
and planned marriage-forcing event.

111
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
The girlfriends you abandoned before,

112
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,180
no, I mean

113
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
the girlfriends who you broke up with

114
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,040
called a lot of media together

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
and wanted to hold a live news conference

116
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
in our company.

117
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,120
Anyway,

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
you mustn't go to the company today.

119
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
After all, you just had a car accident.

120
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,720
Ask the Security Section to dispatch more bodyguards.

121
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,940
I'll be right there.

122
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,440
Mr. Fang, Mr. Fang.

123
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,760
Our atmosphere here is really warm.

124
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
And the brides are also very excited.

125
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
Dear audiences who are still watching the live streaming,

126
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,840
today's leading man,

127
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
Fang Leng, the eldest son of Fang Shida,

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,000
finally shows up.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Photographer,

130
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,280
turn the lens towards Mr. Fang now.

131
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,800
Mr. Fang.

132
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,240
Mr. Fang.

133
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,840
What do you think of today's marriage-forcing event?

134
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Thanks for your attention, friends from the press.

135
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,160
Using love for entertainment

136
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,720
is indeed the most unbearable behavior in the world.

137
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,520
But, in the end, love is a matter just between two people.

138
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,760
Call the brides up.

139
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,280
But, Mr. Fang...

140
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,900
Don't worry.

141
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
I'll let them give up.

142
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,960
Mr. Fang,

143
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
since we had dinner together last time,

144
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,520
you have acted like you don't remember me.

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,320
Sunny,

146
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
time is tight.

147
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
From now on,

148
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,320
all you need to do is listen to us.

149
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,440
Sunny,

150
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
with a real name Sun Yanli,

151
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,640
fledgling domestic model,

152
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,120
met Mr. Fang at last year's charity dinner.

153
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,040
How do you know such information?

154
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
F Group

155
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
owns top domestic internet companies.

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
We can find out

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,280
what we want for sure.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,280
This ticket

159
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,160
can take you directly to Paris

160
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,080
to take part in the shooting
of new products for VOGUE magazine.

161
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,520
Whether you can become an international supermodel

162
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,000
depends on whether you can seize this opportunity.

163
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
I think you know what I mean.

164
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,760
I see.

165
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Sorry for the trouble.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,560
Next.

168
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,200
Such a good company

169
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
is messed up like this.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,840
Excuse me, dear brides,

171
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,920
about the topic that Mr. Fang's a playboy,

172
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,040
do you have any news to share with us?

173
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,520
Who said Mr. Fang's a playboy?

174
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,640
Mr. Fang is right.

175
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,480
Love is always a matter between two people.

176
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
It should not be used for entertainment.

177
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,120
I hope the media

178
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,800
can respect our personal privacy.

179
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
What's going on?

180
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
-No idea. -How come?

181
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,480
Let's go. Thank you.

182
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,840
Don't leave.

183
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,480
Any more bride?

184
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,080
No.

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,760
Mr. Fang,

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
this is the data that just have been calculated.

187
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,840
Your heterosexual amnesia attack

188
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
almost coincides with thunderstorms.

189
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,400
Mr. Fang,

190
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,160
shall we keep looking for new girlfriends for you?

191
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,600
No need.

192
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,840
Help me contact Dr. Zhang.

193
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,800
Okay.

194
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,480
Well,

195
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
how is

196
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,240
the result of the car accident going?

197
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,200
There was only you at the scene,

198
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,040
so no other losses were caused.

199
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,880
But,

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,880
there is one more thing you need to look at.

201
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
When you were in coma,

202
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,480
you held the blue stone in your hand.

203
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,720
I figured it should be very important to you,

204
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
so I put it away for you.

205
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Do you still have any impression on it?

206
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,400
This is not mine.

207
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Take it to the Scientific Research Department

208
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,840
and ask them to investigate the origin of the stone.

209
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,920
Okay.

210
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Xiaoqi,

211
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,680
you didn't resist

212
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,320
the temptation of the earthling's chest muscles

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,400
and left the spacecraft to save him.

214
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,080
People on the earth say that
dangers come with amorousness.

215
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,360
And you get me into trouble too.

216
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
All right.

217
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
Don't you see I am working on it?

218
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
You must think carefully.

219
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,000
Think hard.

220
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,400
Details, right, details.

221
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
Draw all the details

222
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
you saw about that earthling.

223
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,760
Draw every detail.

224
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,800
Finished!

225
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,680
What do you think?

226
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,560
Pick me up.

227
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,160
What?

228
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
Pick me up to look at it.

229
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
I am a turtle now.

230
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,240
Oh,

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,280
I forgot it.

232
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,720
Look!

233
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,120
What do you think?

234
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,720
With a picture like this,

235
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
how can we find him?

236
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,760
I did not see his face clearly.

237
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,280
We are just looking for a man!

238
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,000
The earth lacks a lot of things

239
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,800
but it never lacks men with two legs.

240
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's go.

241
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,840
According to my scan of the earthlings,

242
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,280
we have to go to a place first.

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,720
This dress looks so good.

244
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,200
Do I look like an earthling?

245
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,360
The Earth Survival Manual clearly states that

246
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,040
we need to resist the corruption of
the lower civilizations of the earth

247
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
on our Capetown people.

248
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,120
Instead of refusing them

249
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
you actually put them on.

250
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,720
I am pretending to be an earthling

251
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
so as to find the annunciator.

252
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,520
I have decided.

253
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,640
I will go out in this dress.

254
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
No.

255
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,640
The data says

256
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,200
clothes like this can only be worn
when people get married.

257
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,840
What does "get married" mean?

258
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,280
Mating.

259
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,360
Earthlings are still using
very low-level reproduction methods.

260
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,320
They are different from us.

261
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,640
We reproduce just by logging in the gene sharing system.

262
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,000
If I can go out in such beautiful dress,

263
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,440
it's okay to get married with someone.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,920
I am going to wear this.

265
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
No, no, you can't wear it.

266
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,440
Do I look beautiful?

267
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,080
Thief!

268
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,280
Catch the thief!

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,680
Who is the thief?

270
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,760
It's you!

271
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Earth has not entered the sharing society yet .

272
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,720
They have to exchange everything with currency.

273
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Urgent situation.

274
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,320
Leave here by teleportation quickly.

275
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,080
I...

276
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,120
Thief, don't run!

277
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
Stop!

278
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,600
Stop!

279
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,680
Don't run.

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
Cars

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
will

282
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
explode.

283
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
Stop!

284
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,280
Don't run!

285
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Catch her! She is the thief.

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
Bye.

287
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,160
Don't run.

288
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
Stop there.

289
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,360
Generally speaking,

290
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,320
original family does affect a person's life,

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,640
especially in terms of sexual relations.

292
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Your situation is more complicated than common people.

293
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,840
Your mother passed away in a heavy rain.

294
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,160
This matter

295
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,080
has a very big impact on

296
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,400
your subconsciousness.

297
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Out of self-protection,

298
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,120
every time it rains,

299
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
you will forget all the girls you have known recently.

300
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
We can either call it heterosexual amnesia

301
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,160
or neuroses,

302
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,120
but in the final analysis,

303
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,240
you can't break through that psychological shadow.

304
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,640
In addition to amnesia,

305
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,920
do I have hallucinations?

306
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,440
For example,

307
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,680
like suddenly feel that time and space stop.

308
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,120
Clinically,

309
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,840
there are no similar symptoms.

310
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,480
Is it possible that you have

311
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
too much work pressure recently?

312
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,520
Thanks to you,

313
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,040
I dealt with dozens of brides today.

314
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,560
You can't blame this on me.

315
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,360
When we were in school,

316
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
you concealed this deliberately.

317
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
I have never regretted concealing it all these years.

318
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Right. Right.

319
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
Mr. Fang, you has always been consolidating step by step,

320
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
and enduring hardships.

321
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Under the eyes of your stepmother,

322
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,760
you became the president of F Group.

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
However,

324
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,440
what's urgent is

325
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,000
you need to cure your illness quickly.

326
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
You mustn't let them have something on you.

327
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
It's good you know everything.

328
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,800
Prescribe me quickly.

329
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Don't talk nonsense.

330
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,640
We are holding an opening carnival party tonight.

331
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,880
You can experience the tropical desert,

332
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,400
and see muscular man here.

333
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,000
Xiaoqi,

334
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,200
don't we have a deal to look for that earthling?

335
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,960
I am looking for him now.

336
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,320
Hey,

337
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,680
Xiaoqi, wake up.

338
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,200
Do you smell anything?

339
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,520
Smell what?

340
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,880
The smell of hormones.

341
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,800
At that time the earthling

342
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
used this smell to

343
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,920
cheat me off the spacecraft to save him.

344
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,040
You know?

345
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,000
Testosterone.

346
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
Testosterone is

347
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
Level 10 psychedelic in Capetown star.

348
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,200
It's a kind of banned drug, Xiaoqi.

349
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't help myself.

350
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,480
Not you.

351
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,040
Not you, either.

352
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
None of you are that man.

353
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Come on.

354
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,680
Drink it.

355
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,960
Then we are him.

356
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,760
Really?

357
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Drink it.

358
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,080
Then we are him.

359
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,640
Cheers!

360
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,440
Xiaoqi.

361
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,360
Xiaoqi.

362
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
The Earth Survival Manual emphasizes that

363
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
alcohol is psychedelic.

364
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,680
Don't drink it.

365
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,760
What should I do?

366
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,080
I have already drunk it.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Now I am not only a little dizzy,

368
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,760
but also a bit of excited.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
You have a little turtle with you.

370
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,160
So cute.

371
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,720
Let us see it.

372
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,680
Kubri.

373
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
Who did this?

374
00:20:59,560 --> 00:20:59,960
Who?

375
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,400
Who?

376
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,160
You, you make me up.

377
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,760
You guys,

378
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,400
don't go.

379
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,640
Kubri.

380
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,600

Brother,

393
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,600
I, I am painting in the studio.

394
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,040
Today, I mainly combine

395
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,560
the style of Impressionism and Fauvism

396
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,000
together.

397
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,280
Why do I hear the sound of music?

398
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,000
No...

399
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,280
I'm playing some light music to get inspiration.

400
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
Brother, you don't have to come to see me.

401
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
I will go to bed soon.

402
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,200
See you tomorrow, brother.

403
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Stop knocking.

404
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,480
Han, Brother Han.

405
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,120
Excuse me, Miss.

406
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,040
Would you please pay the bill first?

407
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,520
Your total consumption is

408
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
48,965.

409
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,600
Could you pay the bill?

410
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,680
What do you mean?

411
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,400
You ordered two bottles of red wine,
each fifteen thousand yuan.

412
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Plus,

413
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
you ordered all these male models we have.

414
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
So the total consumption is 48,965.

415
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,040
Would you please pay the bill first?

416
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
I don't have money.

417
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,200
Whose daughter is she?

418
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
I remember Jack Ma only has a son.

419
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,120
Wang Sicong doesn't a have sister, either.

420
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
Is she an illegitimate daughter?

421
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,120
Whatever.

422
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,840
She spends so extravagantly.

423
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,440
She must be a rare commodity.

424
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Miss,

425
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
you're awake.

426
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,960
I specially prepared breakfast for you.

427
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,680
You must be hungry.

428
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,200
Who are you?

429
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,840
Where am I?

430
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm the boss lady here.

431
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
Just call me Ms. Chai.

432
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,480
Don't you remember?

433
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,400
Last night,

434
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,000
you attended our party here.

435
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,280
You had a great time.

436
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,560
Then it was too late.

437
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
I was afraid it's dangerous for you to go out alone.

438
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,520
So I let you stay here.

439
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,080
Thank you,

440
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,680
earthling.

441
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,800
Earthling.

442
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,880
I didn't expect you are so humorous.

443
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,360
Miss,

444
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,240
you are from a decent family, right?

445
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,960
What do you mean by that?

446
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,480
Don't be humble with me.

447
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,480
Look, you dress like a little princess.

448
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,080
Your family must be rich.

449
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I don't have mom and dad.

450
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Huh?

451
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,160
Are you an orphan?

452
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
I am not an orphan.

453
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Children in our planet

454
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
are all reproduced from the Gene Pool.

455
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,240
We have long been out of

456
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,720
this low-level sexual reproduction on earth.

457
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
Does this girl have a mental problem?

458
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,400
Then I'm seeking trouble for myself.

459
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,560
Those are not important.

460
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,160
You just tell me

461
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,280
what your name is

462
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,320
and where your home is.

463
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,360
My name is Gilisika Qiusuo Laka Laka No.7.

464
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
You must be joking.

465
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,120
Is it a bit long?

466
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,640
You can call me Xiaoqi.
(Qi means seven in Chinese.)

467
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
Thank you, earthling.

468
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,480
I have important matters to do, so I'm taking off.

469
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
Stop.

470
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,280
Do you know that you had consumption here?

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,920
You had consumption here last night.

472
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,840
You ordered a bunch of male models.

473
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,760
Don't you remember?

474
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,720
You touched them one by one.

475
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,080
The bill,

476
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
plus accommodation fee,

477
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,680
utility and cleaning fees.

478
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
Together, it's at least 200,000.

479
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I'll give you 20% discount.

480
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,520
Then it's 120,000.

481
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,320
Give me the money.

482
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,040
I don't have any money.

483
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,840
What?

484
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,520
You don't have money?

485
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,920
Are you kidding me?

486
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
You dress so well.

487
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,960
And you wear such an expensive watch.

488
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
You tell me you don't have money?

489
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,520
Do you like this watch?

490
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,040
Here you are.

491
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,640
Just this watch.

492
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,080
It's far from enough.

493
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,800
Give me the money.

494
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
Oh, lord!

495
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,400
Why am I so hapless?

496
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
I held such a big party.

497
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,560
For whom?

498
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,480
For myself?

499
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,440
I did it for everyone.

500
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,840
You touched, you had fun,

501
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
and you drank.

502
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,920
I paid all the bill.

503
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
You don't give me money.

504
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,920
Why? What did I do this for?

505
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,760
I do not want to live anymore.

506
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,080
The data says

507
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,160
earthlings' tears represent sadness.

508
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,080
Ms. Chai,

509
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,480
Ms. Chai, don't cry, don't cry.

510
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
You want me to pay off the debt, right?

511
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
As long as you don't cry,

512
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,920
whatever you want me to do,

513
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,760
I will do it.

514
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,800
Okay.

515
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
Deal.

516
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,980
=An Lian.=

517
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,080
How is it going?

518
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,680
Do you remember the food delivery rules well?

519
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,360
Don't worry.

520
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
My memory is very good.

521
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,800
It should be called in your words

522
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
"gifted with an extraordinary memory".

523
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,120
Come on,

524
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,160
you are a bone head.

525
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,760
You can't even remember your own name.

526
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I remember it.

527
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,440
My name is Gilisika Qiusuo Laka Laka No.7.

528
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,320
Stop it.

529
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
I'm begging you

530
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,440
never to introduce yourself like this again.

531
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,080
Others will think you have mental problems.

532
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,560
How about this?

533
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
We are kind of destined to meet each other.

534
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,760
You can have my surname from now on.

535
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,960
My surname is Chai.

536
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,320
Then your name is Chai Xiaoqi.

537
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
Chai Xiaoqi.

538
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
Chai Xiaoqi.

539
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,840
Nice. Nice.

540
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Friendship is one thing. Employment relationship is another.

541
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,360
I do things on a business basis.

542
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,320
Rest assured,

543
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,560
as long as my I have something to eat,

544
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
I won't leave you starved.

545
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
There are good people on earth!

546
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
I don't want sugar bullets.

547
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,000
Go to work.

548
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm leaving.

549
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Mr. Fang,

550
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,240
Lie has promised to focus all his attention on painting.

551
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,520
If we just drop by like this,

552
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,360
will we disturb him?

553
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,400
The art exhibition is about to open.

554
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,080
He can't be indulgent any longer.

555
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,040
Did you send someone to lock him up?

556
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,640
Sure.

557
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,200
I can ensure even a fly can't get in there.

558
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,200
Car!

559
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
Assistant Han,

560
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,520
did you see someone there just now?

561
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
No, I didn't.

562
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
You can't go in there right now.

563
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,120
No.

564
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,080
Our boss lady said that

565
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,160
I must hand things in to the customer

566
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,280
and get a five-star praise. Then my job is done.

567
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,360
I said no.

568
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,520
What is the fuss?

569
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,400
Our boss lady...

570
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,360
Prince.

571
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,720
I just ordered a takeaway.

572
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
Couldn't you give me a break?

573
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
Be cautious. I'll go to Mr. Fang and

574
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,680
report him that you abuse artist.

575
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,400
Look!

576
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
A little girl was bullied by you like this.

577
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,440
Come on in.

578
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,600
Let me see if you have been hurt by them.

579
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,320
You look more handsome during the day

580
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
than at night.

581
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,280
At night?

582
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,120
You went to see me play yesterday?

583
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,640
Yes.

584
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
I hardly perform and you saw me.

585
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
What a coincidence!

586
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Yeah.

587
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,360
My name is Fang Lie.

588
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,200
My name is Gilisika...

589
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,840
My name is Xiaoqi.

590
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
We are friends from now on.

591
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,080
Your business is my business.

592
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,520
My business is your business.

593
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,200
Now, take off your clothes.

594
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,960
What?

595
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Take off...

596
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,400
Don't you see?

597
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,880
I am illegally imprisoned.

598
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,400
Only you can help me escape by crafty scheme.

599
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,840
Escape by crafty scheme?

600
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,840
I mean

601
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,240
I put on your clothes

602
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,880
and get out of here.

603
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,600
Why do they imprison you?

604
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,960
Are you a bad guy?

605
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,680
Of course not.

606
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,760
That unscrupulous businessman
locked me up to paint here.

607
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
Does he think art is like a tap?

608
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,120
The artworks will rush out immediately
like water once you turn it on?

609
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,200
Art is the surge of inspiration.

610
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,960
It's the burst of emotion.

611
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,200
It's something transcendent to this world.

612
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,280
Why are you still looking handsome even when
you are bringing out the facts and reasons?

613
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,920
Just tell me.

614
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,400
How can I help you?

615
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,120
Easy. I put on your clothes and get out of here.

616
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,800
Then you

617
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,680
pretend to be me and stay here.

618
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,880
Don't worry.

619
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,080
That unscrupulous businessman only embarrasses me.

620
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,880
This won't get you in trouble.

621
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,920
Okay.

622
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,120
Mr. Fang.

623
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
The art exhibition will start next month.

624
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Prepare your artwork well

625
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,880
and then you can go on vacation.

626
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,680
Have I met you before?

627
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,440
Don't cotton up to me.

628
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
I don't know any bad guy like you.

629
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,200
You illegally imprisoned an artist.

630
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
Where is Fang Lie?

631
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,840
I will not tell you.

632
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
Don't come near me.

633
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,560
Don't come near me.

634
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,760
If you come any closer, I will scare
you to death with super power.

635
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,360
It's weird? Why can't I use it?

636
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,040
Can you stop doing stupid things?

637
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,160
I won't embarrass you.

638
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,360
Just tell me where Fang Lie is.

639
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,840
Mr. Fang,

640
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
what happened?

641
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Who is she?

642
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,440
Mr. Fang, be careful.

643
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,280
Let her go.

644
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,520
The monk can run away, but the temple won't.

645
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,520
Find her,

646
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,440
then we can find Fang Lie.

647
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,520
Ms. Chai.

648
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,160
Ms. Chai.

649
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,800
Sorry,

650
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,840
I lost the jumper...

651
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
How come it's back?

652
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,240
A handsome guy just gave it back to you.

653
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,680
He came.

654
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,880
He really came for me.

655
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,120
Oh, right.

656
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,480
He also left you a business card here.

657
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,160
He said tonight

658
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,080
he would be waiting for you at this top restaurant.

659
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,880
Xiaoqi,

660
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,040
you just started to work.

661
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,360
How come you have already fooled around with a customer?

662
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,320
I...

663
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,680
I just...

664
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,360
I am praising you.

665
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,520
What I need is someone like you

666
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
who can quickly get on well with customer.

667
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,440
You know?

668
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,480
Ms. Chai, how much take-outs do we still have?

669
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,120
I want to finish my job early and get off work early.

670
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,400
You still have strength to take delivery?

671
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Of course.

672
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm full of energy now.

673
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,960
Xiaoqi,

674
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,680
you are really a rare commodity!

675
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,840
I'm going upstairs then.

676
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,000
=An Lian=

677
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
Ms. Chai, I am back.

678
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,120
Ms. Chai.

679
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,840
Ms. Chai.

680
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
Stop shouting.

681
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,240
I have booked the whole restaurant.

682
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,160
You only need to serve me.

683
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,720
Chai Xiaoqi,

684
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,080
the big boss asked you to stay.

685
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,800
How can you refuse him?

686
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,000
Go back now.

687
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,960
But Ms. Chai,

688
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,880
I have already got off work.

689
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,440
What do you mean?

690
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,920
Can't you work overtime?

691
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,200
How can you be so selfish?

692
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,680
Can't you think about others?

693
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,600
Can't you think about me?

694
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,960
Or the shop?

695
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,560
Do you have to meet your...

696
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,040
Okay, I'll work overtime.

697
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,200
Overtime.

698
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,680
Overtime.

699
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,520
It's always okay for me to work overtime.

700
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,240
Working overtime makes me happy.

701
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,600
Working overtime makes me glad.

702
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,360
I love extra work.

703
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,440
Yeah!

704
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,440
Yeah!

705
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,440
Dear customer,

706
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
all the dishes are on the menu.

707
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,240
You may have a look.

708
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,880
No, thanks.

709
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,640
I want all the dishes

710
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,120
you sent to the hotel today.

711
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,400
Chef.

712
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,880
They have been dismissed by me.

713
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,920
How about this?

714
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,880
You cook them.

715
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,640
You can also prepare a share for yourself.

716
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,720
When you're full,

717
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,000
take me to see Fang Lie,

718
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,080
the person you let go today.

719
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,160
Sorry,

720
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,040
our restaurant doesn't offer outsourcing service.

721
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,480
And as for me,

722
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,640
I can only deliver take-outs.

723
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,520
I can't cook them.

724
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,640
If you are not satisfied,

725
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,920
you may go to another restaurant.

726
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,040
Boss lady.

727
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,040
Okay, I'll cook them.

728
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,120
Who can't cook?

729
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,080
You just wait.

730
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
I will cook them for you.

731
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,400
Cooking makes me happy.

732
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
Unscrupulous businessman,

733
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,720
almost the same as Jinkela's stone.

734
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,160
Stiff and stink.

735
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,960
Wait a moment. It will be ready soon.

736
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
What is this?

737
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,160
Things on earth are weird.

738
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,920
Kubri. Kubri.

739
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,520
Help me check the information.

740
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,400
Kubri.

741
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,960
I just fed you some wine.

742
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You couldn't even talk?

743
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,440
Forget it. I'll figure it out.

744
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Next add...

745
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,360
Add...

746
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,440
What's wrong?

747
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,240
What are you doing?

748
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,560
I am cooking.

749
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,720
Bring me a fire extinguisher.

750
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,040
What does it look like?

751
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
Are you stupid?

752
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,760
I...

753
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,760
It turns out you are the person I am looking for.

754
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,160
What did you say?

755
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,240
Do not come near.

756
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm serious.

757
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,160
Your hormones are so strong.

758
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,040
I feel like I'm going to crash.

759
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,600
Can you speak like a human?

760
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,500
♪Ever since I met you,♪

761
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,940
♪I've just wanted to forget all the past.♪

762
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,220
♪Every day is a new memory...♪

763
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,380
Ever since I met you,

764
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,060
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

765
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,460
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

766
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,340
only you.

767
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,540
We're out of reach

768
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,860
but appreciate each other.

769
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,660
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

770
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,700
The yearning invades

771
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,260
and lurks in my mind.

772
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:38,820
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

773
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm getting addicted to it

774
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,220
and my sense is shielded.

775
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,020
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

776
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,180
Put the hottest heart

777
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,500
in this cold body.

778
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,860
I'm looking at you,

779
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,020
and my love has nowhere to go.

780
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,260
Ever since I met you,

781
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,180
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

782
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,460
Every day is a new memory

783
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
which is only be about you and me.

784
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,740
I can't lie to myself anymore.

785
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,580
Please give me the courage to believe.

786
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,500
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

787
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,420
only you.

788
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,540
Even everything becomes silent,

789
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,660
I still have you.
