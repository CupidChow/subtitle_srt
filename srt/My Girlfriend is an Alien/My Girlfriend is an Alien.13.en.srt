1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 13

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,120
It's so windy.

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,320
Why doesn't it react?

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,680
What do you want to do?

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,720
Don't be mischievous.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,200
Sit well.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm not mischievous.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,200
I just want to go back home.

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm tired of rejoicing too soon again and again.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,520
You don't rejoice too soon.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,520
After the typhoon,

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,160
I'll drive you back.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,200
What are you writing?

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,320
Name.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,720
Everyone has his own name,

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
so every perfume also has its own name.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,640
The names of some perfumes

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
show the characters of people.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Know people by smelling their perfumes.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,240
Very accurate.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,160
You can have a try when you have a chance.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,280
Fang Lie,

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,520
pack things up

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,040
and take the samples back to our company.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Let's go back early today.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
I can only get some sample the day after tomorrow.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,400
How about

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,320
you going back first?

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,720
I won't allow you to stay with Xiaoqi alone.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
What do you mean?

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,080
Mr. Sun,

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
I think only the smell

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
of old vinegar

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,760
suits my brother.

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,680
We won't know it until we have a try.

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you trying to do?

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Know people by smelling their perfumes.

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm serious.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Do you dare do it?

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,880
OK.

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
These are different perfume samples.

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Smell them

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
and give me the test papers of perfumes you like.

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,600
If you think

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
these experimental products are good,

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,160
I'll promote them as the new products of our company.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,520
It's not time to talk about the work.

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,000
You spoil our pleasure.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,960
It's your fault.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
I spoil your pleasure,

68
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,920
or you'll be excluded from our company?

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
These are the new products of this year.

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,240
How do you feel the smell?

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,760
It smells good.

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,320
It smells sweet.

73
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,000
This is suitable to be used in summer.

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,760
Leng.

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,280
Cloying.

76
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,840
How about the second bottle?

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,800
It smells like the forest.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,640
It smells like pine.

79
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,600
It smells very fresh and cool.

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
You're right.

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,760
Leng, smell this.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,760
Astringent.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,240
These two bottles of perfumes are not creative.

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,520
Do you have a more special one?

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,280
How about this bottle?

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
It smells very strange.

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,760
It smells like the plain boiled water rather than perfume.

88
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
Its smell is so light.

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,240
Do you have its sample?

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,680
This is my collection.

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,440
It happened to rain when I made it,

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,240
and the moisture of this sample was influenced,

93
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,640
so I can't estimate

94
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,160
some dose data anymore.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,160
Mr. Sun,

96
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,280
we have smelt perfumes,

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,880
so now it's your turn to explain it.

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,560
From Mr. Fang's choice,

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,760
it's hard to draw a conclusion.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,680
However,

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,680
the choices of Xiaoqi

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,600
and Fang Lie

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
are very similar.

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,400
Both of you are enthusiastic, generous

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,480
rich in sentiment

106
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
and possess a remarkable talent for art.

107
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
Yeah.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,320
Xiaoqi and I have a tacit understanding,

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
but my brother has nothing in common with us.

110
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,520
How about you going back first?

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,320
We will leave

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
two days after the new products are made.

113
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
You can ask Xiaoqi

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
whether she is willing to stay here with you.

115
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,520
I...

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,520
I...

117
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,560
I want to stay here with Fang Lie.

118
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,680
You said that you wanted to go back home just now.

119
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Because...

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
She wanted to go back home when staying with you,

121
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
but she is so happy that she doesn't want to go back home

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
when staying with me.

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,360
Am I right, Xiaoqi?

124
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Now the eye of typhoon is here,

125
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,640
and the weather will get worse again some time later,

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,880
so you must go back with me.

127
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,560
We won't go back.

128
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,920
Let's go.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,760
Where will we go?

130
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,760
Now we leave,

131
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
so my brother must be very angry.

132
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

133
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,560
He must be very angry with me,

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
but I can't

135
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,480
tell him the truth.

136
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
You can tell me.

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
I can accept everything.

138
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
In fact,

139
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,160
I've been

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,280
looking for

141
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,920
a familiar magnetic induction.

142
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,840
I found it

143
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
from Fang Leng yesterday,

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
but I only found it once.

145
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,000
I understand.

146
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,920
Both of us are in love by feeling,

147
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,480
but feeling

148
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,520
may disappear in a flash.

149
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,400
Disappear in a flash?

150
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
It only appeared in a flash.

151
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,560
It's too unforgettable.

152
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
You're like a thorn in my heart.

153
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
It's so painful.

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
I feel so bad.

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
I can't even breathe.

156
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,880
Heartbeat.

157
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
Heartbeat?

158
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I think of something.

159
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
His heart beat very fast that day.

160
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
Heart beat fast?

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,720
My brother?

162
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,280
Yeah.

163
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,240
His heart beat very fast,

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,680
as if his heart would jump out.

165
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,600
Impossible.

166
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,840
Because the typhoon was fierce?

167
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,920
No.

168
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,120
You took me here,

169
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
so he was angry?

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
If my brother is angry with me, his heart won't beat fast,

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
but he will beat me directly instead.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,960
In your opinion,

173
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,280
how to make one's heart beat fast?

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,360
I suddenly have a horrible idea.

175
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,520
What's it?

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,200
My brother

177
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,920
may fall in love with you.

178
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,000
Only when a man meets the girl he likes

179
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,320
can his heart beat fast.

180
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
Impossible.

181
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,880
He is so mean to me.

182
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,200
It's impossible.

183
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,240
You're right.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,680
As a lady killer,

185
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,960
my brother doesn't probably

186
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,640
fall in love with you.

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh, no.

188
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,760
My brother drives to chase us?

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,560
Get rid of him.

190
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,800
Hurry up.

191
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
Please get off the car, princess.

192
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the milk tea shop that I specially find for you.

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,360
I think

194
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
we should call Fang Leng.

195
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
No.

196
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
I risk my life to buy the time

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,040
for our date.

198
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Don't let me down.

199
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,760
Let's go.

200
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,200
The desserts of this shop taste very good.

201
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Are you a couple?

202
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,720
We...

203
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,560
No, we're not.

204
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
Today we prepare special gifts for couples.

205
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,800
Our shopkeeper secretly makes some desserts

206
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,440
which is the most delicious food in the universe.

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,000
The most delicious food in the universe?

208
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,800
Where are they?

209
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,760
Go in, please.

210
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,920
As long as you write your names

211
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,000
on this Eternal Love Wall,

212
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,680
you can get the gift for free.

213
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,240
Let me write it. Let me write it.

214
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,680
Thank you.

215
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,240
You really can give up everything

216
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
for something to eat.

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,760
Don't be amazed.

218
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
Anyway, nobody knows us.

219
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,440
We've finished. We've finished.

220
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Waitress!

221
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,760
=Xiaoqi and Fang Lie=

222
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,480
Please wait a moment.

223
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,480
Your dessert will be served soon.

224
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,760
OK.

225
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
We can't only eat the dessert.

226
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
I know there is

227
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,720
quite a good milk tea shop nearby.

228
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Wait for me for a while here.

229
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll be back after buying milk tea.

230
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,200
OK.

231
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,880
I like you forever.

232
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,160
Fang Lie,

233
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,640
I've bought the dessert.

234
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,400
Where are you?

235
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm still waiting in a queue.

236
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,440
Come back now.

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't like milk tea very much.

238
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,160
You don't like it,

239
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,920
but someone likes.

240
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
If my brother goes back today,

241
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,360
I can ask him to take the milk tea to my friend.

242
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,480
Friend?

243
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,800
Who?

244
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,440
Fang Leng?

245
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,920
Fang Leng leaves you alone again?

246
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,520
No. No.

247
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,040
He,

248
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,280
he goes to...

249
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,040
Congratulations.

250
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,280
You're the 9,999th couple of our shop,

251
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,360
so we prepare a gift for you.

252
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
Miss,

253
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,080
just now

254
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,800
you came with another man.

255
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,760
Which one on earth

256
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,120
is your boyfriend?

257
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,880
Do you want to get our gifts by cheating?

258
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,600
No. No. No.

259
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,840
Just now you misunderstood me.

260
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
This is my real boyfriend.

261
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
This is my real boyfriend.

262
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,480
Really?

263
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Yes. Yes.

264
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,920
Explain to me.

265
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Explain what?

266
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,080
Precisely...

267
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
The waitress told me that

268
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
I can get something delicious after I write it.

269
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
I wanted to get the gift,

270
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,160
so I wrote it.

271
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
This is your souvenir.

272
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,160
A pair of couple electronic watches.

273
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,760
No need.

274
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,480
Just treat us

275
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,040
as the 9,998th couple

276
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,960
and give this gift

277
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
to the next couple.

278
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,600
OK.

279
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,640
Please sign your names here.

280
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,320
Why do you sign it on my hand?

281
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,840
To prevent you from forgetting your identity.

282
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,640
After all, you promised to

283
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,560
be my girlfriend.

284
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,380
=Fang Leng=

285
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,160
Stretch out your hand.

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Now you also

287
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
belong to me.

288
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,040
Please remember your identity.

289
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,420
=Fang Leng and Xiaoqi=

290
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
You can keep it as a souvenir.

291
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Just paste it here.

292
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,080
Miss,

293
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,760
sorry for bothering you.

294
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
Please remember her appearance.

295
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,280
If she comes to your shop

296
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,200
with other men again in the future,

297
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,480
please call me.

298
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
I'll reward you with a lot of money.

299
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,080
Thank you.

300
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,160
OK, thank you.

301
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,080
Jiang Xue?

302
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,000
Jiang Xue.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,880
What?

304
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,400
You exposed the sapphire case?

305
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,760
I just wanted to remind your brother out of kindness
that there was a hidden traitor in your company,

306
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,120
but I didn't expect that

307
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,000
he didn't hold Chai Xiaoqi responsible for it

308
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,880
but asked someone to investigate who exposed it.

309
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,760
Now I'm exposed.

310
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,480
Fang Lie,

311
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
only you can help me this time.

312
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,480
How could you do such a thing?

313
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,200
Don't talk about it.

314
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,120
Tell me

315
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,160
how I should help you.

316
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,840
It's very easy.

317
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,480
That investigation report

318
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,720
has been put in the office of Fang Leng.

319
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
I just need to take it back

320
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,440
before your brother comes back.

321
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,360
My brother just upgraded the security system of his office,

322
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,400
and we can only enter his office with his fingerprint,

323
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,360
so you...

324
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:50,920
Yes,

325
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,720
I want you to get the fingerprint of your brother for me.

326
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,960
I can't cheat my brother.

327
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,240
Fang Lie,

328
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,680
I've liked your brother for so many years,

329
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
so I can't fail because of this thing.

330
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,520
Jiang Xue,

331
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,040
do you know?

332
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
Now I'm very strange to you.

333
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm still who I was.

334
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,440
I indeed exposed that

335
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,360
Chai Xiaoqi was a thief,

336
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
and it was a fact.

337
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,560
I didn't frame her.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,520
Fang Lie,

339
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
you just do me a favor,

340
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,800
as if,

341
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,880
as if you bought milk tea

342
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,680
for me in the past.

343
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,720
No matter how far the shop was,

344
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,280
you would go to buy it for me,

345
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,320
right?

346
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,640
Yes,

347
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
I want you to get the fingerprint of your brother for me.

348
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,320
Oh.

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,880
What happens?

350
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,560
Let me see. Let me see.

351
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:01,760
It's not serious.

352
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,760
Let me see.

353
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,880
You bleed.

354
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,400
It's not serious.

355
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,080
Does it hurt?

356
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,760
It's not serious.

357
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,400
Let me dress it for you.

358
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,600
Let's go.

359
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,880
It's really not serious.

360
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,560
No.

361
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,400
Otherwise, it'll be affected by bacteria later.

362
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,760
Hurry up.

363
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:11,840
Go.

364
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,880
It's really not serious.

365
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,120
Listen to me. Hurry up.

366
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,760
Sit here.

367
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,160
I've told you that

368
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,960
it's not serious.

369
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,000
Listen to me.

370
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,440
Take these medicines.

371
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,520
I just hurt my finger.

372
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,160
Is it necessary to take medicines?

373
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,320
You must listen to me.

374
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
The data shows that

375
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,760
once the surface of human skin breaks,

376
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,280
bacteria will enter your body.

377
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,160
You can't...

378
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Such small injury

379
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,840
is not as horrible as the look in my brother's eyes.

380
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,360
His eyes looked very horrible.

381
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,200
You're right.

382
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,880
Whenever he looks at me,

383
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,320
he seems to kill me.

384
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,960
You just went to the dessert shop,

385
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,440
but I think that your attitude towards him changes. Why?

386
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,840
In my opinion,

387
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,880
even if Fang Leng is faithless,

388
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
he seems

389
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
special to me.

390
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,840
His heart beat fast for me that day,

391
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,080
which makes me feel that

392
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,640
he seems to really like me.

393
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,600
Don't be foolish.

394
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,960
He was just impulsive back then.

395
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,880
Listen to me.

396
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
You must keep cool

397
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
and can't fall in love with him in advance.

398
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,840
Otherwise...

399
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,240
And then?

400
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,360
Otherwise,

401
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,240
you will get hurt

402
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,760
and be strange to yourself.

403
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Men are often impulsive.

404
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,320
It's not related to love.

405
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,480
If he was really impulsive back then,

406
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,480
it'll,

407
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,440
it'll be good,

408
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,520
because I won't need to make a choice.

409
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,040
But if

410
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,920
he is serious...

411
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,840
Are you a fool?

412
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
If he is serious,

413
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,560
he won't give you up.

414
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
If a man likes a woman,

415
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,880
the woman will feel it.

416
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,360
Do you feel it?

417
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,400
What should I feel?

418
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,720
I can feel

419
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,000
the electric current soon.

420
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,080
If it's infeasible,

421
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
I can also touch the water.

422
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,120
Take these medicines.

423
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,840
Hurry up.

424
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,080
As if you bought milk tea

425
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,960
for me in the past.

426
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,600
No matter how far the shop was,

427
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
you would go to buy it for me,

428
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,160
right?

429
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,200
Leng,

430
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,880
here you are.

431
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,600
I'm not thirsty.

432
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
No, you must drink it.

433
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,400
Leng,

434
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,080
it stands for my apology.

435
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
Just now I shouldn't go out with Xiaoqi.

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,080
You refused to take medicines,

437
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,360
and I didn't dress it for you, either.

438
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
Why did you run here?

439
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,200
Hurry up.

440
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,160
Hurry up.

441
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,240
Leng, sorry.

442
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,400
What's wrong with him?

443
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,360
I wonder what you

444
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
chatted about inside just now.

445
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,240
Nothing special.

446
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,080
The thing about love.

447
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,480
Tell me in detail.

448
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Did you express your love to me

449
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,080
on the day of typhoon?

450
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
Your heart beat very fast that day.

451
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,640
In fact,

452
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,720
for you,

453
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm a little...

454
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,960
So he bickered with me

455
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,840
for this thing?

456
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,280
I don't know.

457
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,880
Are you sure

458
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,360
the reason why your heart beat fast is not that

459
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,520
you like me?

460
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Is it the right time

461
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,880
to talk about this thing now?

462
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Yes.

463
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,320
Anyway, only we're here now.

464
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,400
Can you tell me

465
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,600
how I can make your heart beat fast?

466
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,760
Sometimes I really doubt

467
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,240
whether you have a heart or not.

468
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,440
I've given the thing to the man that you dispatched here.

469
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
Why are both of them out

470
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
without telling me?

471
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,640
Well,

472
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,720
have you stopped to have a rest?

473
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Sorry for bothering you.

474
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,160
It doesn't matter.

475
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,520
It's rare that here is noisy.

476
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
So here is.

477
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,920
Why is it so hard to know human feelings?

478
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,240
It's too difficult

479
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
to make one's heart beat.

480
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,640
The one you mentioned is Fang Leng?

481
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,880
How do you know it?

482
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,160
I see.

483
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,480
You can know people by smelling their perfumes.

484
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,920
Those words you said about Fang Lie and me are very accurate.

485
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,280
In fact,

486
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,800
it's easy

487
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,120
to make one's heart beat fast.

488
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,880
Here you are.

489
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,680
This...

490
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,080
Is, isn't it Fang Leng's favorite perfume?

491
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,960
You said that you only had a bottle

492
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
and it's your collection.

493
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,760
It's indeed the only one,

494
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
so it should

495
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,600
be given to the one who needs it most.

496
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,160
In fact,

497
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,560
it's not difficult

498
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,840
to make one's heart beat fast.

499
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,800
It's the most exciting

500
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,760
to smell

501
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,080
the one you like.

502
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,640
So I should

503
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,200
seduce him?

504
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Seduce him.

505
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,520
How can I seduce him?

506
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
Hi.

507
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
Fang Leng.

508
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,560
Fang Leng. Fang Leng.

509
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,480
I like you.

510
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
I like you.

511
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,560
Love you.

512
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,240
Like you very much. Like you very much. Like you very much.

513
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,200
How can I seduce him?

514
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,920
Oh, no.

515
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,600
Moving lover's prattle.

516
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,880
I don't like this world,

517
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,520
but I...

518
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,520
I don't like this world,

519
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,680
but I like you.

520
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,480
I like you most

521
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,640
among all the similar scenery.

522
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,520
It sounds very boring.

523
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,720
You have something on your face.

524
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,440
Do you know what it is?

525
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,840
Handsomeness.

526
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,320
Is the washing room available?

527
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll go out soon.

528
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,120
Seduce him. Seduce him.

529
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,080
Smile. Smile.

530
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Handsomeness. Handsomeness.

531
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,160
How can I seduce him?

532
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,760
Can this perfume really make one's heart beat fast?

533
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,560
Try it.

534
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,400
So good.

535
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
If I love you,

536
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,040
I won't wind upon you like a trumpet creeper

537
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,640
and show off myself by your height.

538
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,640
Won't absolutely show off myself by your height.

539
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,960
Those pistils and trees...

540
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,640
It turns out that you're in the car.

541
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,000
So embarrassing.

542
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,080
It's useless to do these

543
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
for making my brother like you.

544
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
So what should I do?

545
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,840
Jealous.

546
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,440
It, it is not true.

547
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,880
Fang Leng!

548
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,320
Fang Leng!

549
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,840
My brother will be mad at this time.

550
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,240
I hope that you won't behave like her.

551
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,640
Fang Leng!

552
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,480
Fang Leng!

553
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,240
Listen to my explanation.

554
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,840
Do you see Xiaoqi?

555
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Now you think of me, the knife stone?

556
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,400
I've searched her everywhere,

557
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,920
but I fail to find her.

558
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,960
She is missing?

559
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,200
Xiaoqi!

560
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,160
Xiaoqi!

561
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,240
Xiaoqi!

562
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,800
Sorry,

563
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,840
it's unable to be connected now.

564
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,480
Please redial later.

565
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,680
Well,

566
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,360
do you find her?

567
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,360
It's strange.

568
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,640
Where could she go?

569
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,240
Well,

570
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,160
what do you mean?

571
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,600
You must do it deliberately.

572
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,520
I just wanted you to care her.

573
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Even if I care her,

574
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,960
she always asks you for help at crucial time.

575
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,840
Because your capriciousness

576
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,680
and inconstancy

577
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,760
make her lack a sense of security.

578
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,760
Leng,

579
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,760
why do you always hurt the women who like you?

580
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,000
She likes me?

581
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,600
Yeah.

582
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,640
She indeed likes you

583
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,360
but not me.

584
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,760
You're foolish.

585
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,400
Xiaoqi.

586
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,360
Xiaoqi, you will suffer from frostbite in this way.

587
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,760
Let me go to find Fang Leng for you.

588
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,720
No,

589
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,480
you can't.

590
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,760
Don't go to find them.

591
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
I'll scare them.

592
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,160
I'll get better

593
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,040
after tonight.

594
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,320
What's wrong with you?

595
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,840
Don't touch me.

596
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,720
Don't touch me.

597
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,920
Leave me alone.

598
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,120
Why are you so cold?

599
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:26,960
Don't touch me.

600
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,360
I drive you to the hospital.

601
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,120
I can't go to the hospital.

602
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,280
Don't drive me to the hospital.

603
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,680
It'll be useless.

604
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,760
My disease is inborn.

605
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,800
Inborn?

606
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,720
I...

607
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
Drive me to a place

608
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,960
where nobody can find me.

609
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
I don't want to scare others.

610
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,960
OK.

611
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,200
Xiaoqi.

612
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,800
Xiaoqi.

613
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,080
Mr. Fang,

614
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,240
I've turned on the heating in this room.

615
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,480
This is the thick clothes you want.

616
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,360
OK.

617
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,520
Dress her for me.

618
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,280
OK.

619
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,520
No. No.

620
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,880
Others can't touch me.

621
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,280
Otherwise, it'll be more serious.

622
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,760
Don't worry.

623
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,880
Here is very safe.

624
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,640
You can go out now.

625
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,560
OK.

626
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,640
If you don't want to tell me about it,

627
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,200
I won't ask you.

628
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
My skin

629
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,000
is different from others'.

630
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,640
Once others touch me,

631
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
I may feel cold like this.

632
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,680
I don't know

633
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,680
why Fang Lie...

634
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,680
If so,

635
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,640
why can I touch you?

636
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
I don't know it, either.

637
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,400
Although your name is Fang Leng (cold),

638
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,120
for me,

639
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
you're warmer

640
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,800
than all the heating in this room.

641
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,680
Maybe

642
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,880
there is something

643
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,560
that is very important to me in your heart.

644
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
Does Fang Leng lose his heart to me?

645
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,320
I also always wait for someone,

646
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,000
who can make me remember forever,

647
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,840
just like

648
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
you always wait for someone

649
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,760
who can warm you forever.

650
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,800
You're afraid of it?

651
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,120
How do you feel?

652
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,360
When it rained,

653
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,400
I always thought

654
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,120
I was cursed by the God,

655
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,360
but now I have different thought.

656
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
I think rain is a gift.

657
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,080
After the rain stops,

658
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,320
let's be together at ease.

659
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,800
I don't want to go home.

660
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,120
I want my mom.

661
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,360
Mom!

662
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,440
Mom, wake up.

663
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Mom, wake up.

664
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,860
=Unlocked!=

665
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,200
Miss Jiang,

666
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,360
now you can

667
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,680
delete anything that

668
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,160
you don't want him to remember at will.

669
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,240
This timely rain

670
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,080
must be a gift that the God presents to me.

671
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,200
What's wrong?

672
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,160
Who are you?

673
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
Are you blind?

674
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,840
You put me on the bed last night.

675
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,880
Did it rain last night?

676
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,960
Yeah.

677
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,520
You gently put me on the bed

678
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,360
and always warmed me last night,

679
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,760
but why are you so cold now?

680
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,000
What,

681
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,640
what happened

682
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,480
between us?

683
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,720
Last night

684
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,400
you put me on the bed

685
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,360
and stretched

686
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,120
my body for me.

687
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,920
Then we watched it raining.

688
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
On the bed, we...

689
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,000
Stop talking. Stop talking.

690
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,240
Go out.

691
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,120
Go out!

692
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,480
Why are you so cold?

693
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,040
My annunciator.

694
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,440
When can you

695
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,920
hug me again

696
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,120
as you did last night?

697
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,680
Go out.

698
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,800
No.

699
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,880
I can't miss this chance.

700
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,960
I'll be gentle.

701
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,560
Don't worry.

702
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,520
Fang Leng!

703
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,240
Fang Leng!

704
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:11,880
Fang Leng!

705
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,720
Fang Leng!

706
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,000
Assistant Han...

707
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,480
Fang Leng!

708
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,040
I lose some memories

709
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,040
and even stay with a strange woman.

710
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,000
Why does he become like this?

711
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,840
What happened?

712
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,520
It's strange.

713
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,120
Fang Lie.

714
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,480
Wake up.

715
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,920
You've come downstairs.

716
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Why do you sleep here?

717
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,400
I had driven here last night,

718
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,560
but I was so sleepy that I fell asleep when waiting for you.

719
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,640
Sorry.

720
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,800
I shouldn't

721
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,920
kiss you yesterday.

722
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
In order to apologize to me,

723
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,120
you slept here all night?

724
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,760
I just worried about you.

725
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,440
After all, you stayed with my brother.

726
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:01,880
Well,

727
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,600
did anything happen to you last night?

728
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,080
Don't worry.

729
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,280
He didn't bully me.

730
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,480
But I think

731
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,200
something is a little strange.

732
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,600
What did he do?

733
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,640
He looked at me

734
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,960
like a stranger.

735
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,280
Why can a man

736
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,720
become so strange after a night?

737
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,640
I know.

738
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,720
Sometimes a man treats a girl as a friend,

739
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,720
but he...

740
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
And then?

741
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,840
I go back to sleep.

742
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,560
I have to go back to catch up on sleep.

743
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,200
We should go back together.

744
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,280
I can't wait.

745
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,480
You can ask my brother to give you a ride.

746
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,320
I need to calm down alone.

747
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,000
Take care.

748
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,480
Both of them are strange.

749
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,720
Drive now.

750
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,440
Don't Lie and Xiaoqi

751
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
go back with you?

752
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,280
Who?

753
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,840
Fang Lie and Chai Xiaoqi.

754
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
You came here for picking them up.

755
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,480
I remember to pick Fang Lie up,

756
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,400
but who is Miss Chai that

757
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,120
you mentioned?

758
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:32,840
Do you

759
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,080
forget her?

760
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,040
So, is she

761
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,640
the strange woman you mentioned?

762
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,880
-Xiaoqi. -Assistant Han.

763
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,000
Fang Lie drove back alone.

764
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,960
Can I go back with you?

765
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,760
-No. -OK.

766
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,240
Mr. Fang,

767
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,600
now I can't explain to you in detail,

768
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,240
but Xiaoqi

769
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,480
is Miss Chai.

770
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
She is your girlfriend

771
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,200
and very important to you.

772
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,920
If you want to overcome this difficulty safely,

773
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,280
you can't leave her here.

774
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,120
Suit yourself.

775
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
Here is very spacious.

776
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,120
Is here comfortable?

777
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,760
Here seems very comfortable, too.

778
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,520
What are you doing?

779
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,440
Don't misunderstand.

780
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,600
I don't want to touch you.

781
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,480
This...

782
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,080
Miss Chai,

783
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,920
I know you're my girlfriend,

784
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,680
but please don't get close to me.

785
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,280
I don't like a profligate woman.

786
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,640
You can scold me,

787
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,840
but you can't treat me as a profligate.

788
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,800
If you don't have my annunciator,

789
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,840
I don't want to get close to you.

790
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,560
What did you say?

791
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
Anyway, there is no any outsider here.

792
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,320
Just tell you the truth.

793
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,000
I think what I'm looking for is on you.

794
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,960
Here you are.

795
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,880
I don't mean your coat,

796
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,800
but your body.

797
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,280
Stop.

798
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,640
Mr. Fang,

799
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,640
she is just kidding.

800
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,680
Don't be angry.

801
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,880
I'll explain it to you later.

802
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,520
Get off.

803
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,640
Don't be so angry.

804
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,200
I just want you to do me a favor.

805
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,320
It's really important to me.

806
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,880
From now on,

807
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,840
you are no longer my girlfriend.

808
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,980
Ever since I met you,

809
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,660
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

810
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,060
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

811
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,940
only you.

812
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,140
We're out of reach

813
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,460
but appreciate each other.

814
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,260
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

815
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,300
The yearning invades

816
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,860
and lurks in my mind.

817
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:20,420
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

818
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,500
I'm getting addicted to it

819
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,820
and my sense is shielded.

820
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:34,620
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

821
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,780
Put the hottest heart

822
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,100
in this cold body.

823
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,460
I'm looking at you,

824
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,620
and my love has nowhere to go.

825
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,860
Ever since I met you,

826
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,780
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

827
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,060
Every day is a new memory

828
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,100
which is only be about you and me.

829
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,340
I can't lie to myself anymore.

830
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,180
Please give me the courage to believe.

831
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,100
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

832
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,020
only you.

833
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,140
Even everything becomes silent,

834
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,260
I still have you.
