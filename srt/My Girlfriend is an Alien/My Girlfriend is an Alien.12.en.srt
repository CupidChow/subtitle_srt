1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 12

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,520
Ms. Chai,

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm gonna be late.

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't prepare breakfast for me.

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
Xiaoqi.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,280
How are you?

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
How's work going?

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,320
Not really.

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,800
What is it

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
you want to see me about?

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,360
You worked for Fang Leng.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,720
When you're in trouble,

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,640
of course I'll have to concern myself with it.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,040
I heard you were exposed

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,680
as the thief who stole the sapphire.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
That's my own business.

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,920
You don't need to worry.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
Miss Chai, you misunderstood.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not worrying about you

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,120
but Fang Leng.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
We're a couple approved by both of our families.

39
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,160
So no matter what happens,

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
we'll prosper or suffer losses together.

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
When someone around him is in trouble,

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,720
can I walk away from it?

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,200
Did you

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
decide to be together?

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,040
It's not decided by us

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,080
but our identities.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,600
You don't know it well.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,040
I have met Fang Leng's father.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,480
He's very satisfied with me.

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,680
Certainly,

51
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,480
Fang Leng had many girlfriends before.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,600
Perhaps

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,200
he also have one now.

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
But I think they're just a tool for him to relieve loneliness.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm here today to

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
request you to help him.

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,040
How can I help him?

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
You're his secretary.

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,000
Now your scandal has been exposed.

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,160
It's okay that Fang Leng image is damaged.

61
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
But if he keeps a thief around him,

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
how do you think his staff will talk about him

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
and what outsiders will think of him?

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,080
I'm not a thief.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,880
That sapphire...

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,800
I'm not here to criticize you.

67
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,000
I just want to warn you.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
Fang Leng and I are different

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,920
from people like you.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You can make mistakes

71
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,040
and be talked about.

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,080
But he and I

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,120
are being watched with a magnifier all the time.

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,120
We can't make mistakes.

75
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,480
Even when people around us do wrong,

76
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
we'll be in trouble, too.

77
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,480
Do you know

78
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
how badly you've affected Fang Leng

79
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,080
by stealing the sapphire?

80
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,240
Even if I made a mistake,

81
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
what has that got to do with Fang Leng?

82
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,920
I won't drag him down,

83
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,280
okay?

84
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,240
Do you know

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
how important the sapphire project is?

86
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,200
Without it,

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,080
how will Fang Leng's rivals attack him?

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Are you clear about these things?

89
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,520
Even in this mess,

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
he still kept you around him

91
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,000
and took the blame for you.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,080
Do you still think

93
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,240
it has nothing to do with him?

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,960
Are you asking me

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
to leave the company?

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
If you care about Fang Leng.

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,240
Alright.

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,760
I've said all of the things you should know.

99
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Please think about it carefully,

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,560
Miss Chai.

101
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,640
Honey,

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
did she upset you?

103
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm off, Ms. Chai.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,920
What are you doing?

105
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,040
You arrived at a good moment.

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,080
Were you the last to leave yesterday?

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,480
Yes. What's up?

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,440
Did you touch the work report

109
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,440
I put on my desk?

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,680
No.

111
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
I had been sleeping here last night.

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
I didn't do anything.

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,920
That's weird.

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I've worked here for such a long time

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
and I have never lost anything.

116
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,480
Why did that happen

117
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,280
after you came here?

118
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
Even if you can't write anything out,

119
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
you shouldn't have taken my report, should you?

120
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
What do I take it for?

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Besides,

122
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,440
what's a work report?

123
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,280
Stop pretending.

124
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,320
You have a record.

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
You even dared to steal the sapphire.

126
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
Of course you'll steal other things.

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,720
You...

128
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,360
Xiaoqi,

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
she didn't mean it.

130
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,400
She's saying that

131
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,320
your desks are close to each other.

132
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,760
Just let her look for it.

133
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,960
Yes.

134
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,880
We're colleagues.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
Don't hurt the harmony among us.

136
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,240
It's my place.

137
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
Why should I let her rummage in it?

138
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Apologize to me.

139
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,280
Mr. Fang,

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,880
someone disclosed that

141
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,240
Xiaoqi stole

142
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,360
the sapphire.

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,880
Who did it?

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
The Technology Department tracked a website.

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,360
It may be some nosy reporter.

146
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
But they haven't found

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,800
who did it exactly.

148
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,640
It has happened already.

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,200
We can't solve the problem even if we find that out.

150
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,360
Has Xiaoqi known about it?

151
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,480
She should have.

152
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm to blame.

153
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,160
I didn't hear the news until last night.

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,480
Xiaoqi must have been

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
given a hard time.

156
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,040
Shall I ask her to take some time off?

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,320
In the next few days,

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,240
the employees will certainly...

159
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,840
As long as I'm here,

160
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,360
no one will dare to hurt her.

161
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Ask someone to delete the post

162
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,840
and make an announcement

163
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,160
in the name of the company.

164
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,040
Tell people this rumor is groundless

165
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,960
and calm things down.

166
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't worry.

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,040
I'll handle it.

168
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,160
What did you say?

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,160
I said

170
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
you slandered me.

171
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,280
Apologize to me.

172
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,680
I slandered you?

173
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,560
Didn't you steal the sapphire?

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
We all know it

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
and Mr. Fang has suspended you.

176
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
Don't think I'm afraid of you.

177
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
You're just a delivery person.

178
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,760
So what?

179
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
Can you have takeaways without delivery people?

180
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Besides, even though I began as a delivery person,

181
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm an employee here, too.

182
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm as useful as you.

183
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
Why should I leave?

184
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,440
You...

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,560
Who asked you to leave?

186
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,720
Mr. Fang.

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,760
Mr. Fang.

188
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,320
What's going on?

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
She said her report was lost

190
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
and I took it.

191
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,360
I didn't do that this time.

192
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,680
You'll see if you check the surveillance system.

193
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,880
There's no need to check it.

194
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
Last night we left here together.

195
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
I can testify for you.

196
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,320
In addition,

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,280
I lost

198
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,280
the sapphire myself.

199
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,360
It doesn't concern you.

200
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you have any other questions?

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,080
But...

202
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,200
Shut up.

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
You can apologize to her now.

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,120
Sorry.

205
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
I shouldn't have misunderstood you.

206
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,640
You did it for the first time.

207
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,960
I'll let you get away with it.

208
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,560
But from today on,

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,000
none of you

210
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,920
is allowed to suspect your colleagues for no reason.

211
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,640
Even if they're of humble birth,

212
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,680
have a low level of degree

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
or their backgrounds are different from yours,

214
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,400
you're not allowed to discriminate against them.

215
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Understand?

216
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,520
Yes.

217
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,240
Understand?

218
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Yes!

219
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,160
Come with me.

220
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,080
Why didn't you

221
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
tell me about the post earlier?

222
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
It's my own problem.

223
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,640
Why do I tell others?

224
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,160
Besides,

225
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
what's the use of telling you?

226
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,120
You'll only harm yourself

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,520
if you help me.

228
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,800
What are you talking about?

229
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,840
Nothing.

230
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,680
Anyway,

231
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
thank you for helping me just now.

232
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,680
From now on,

233
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
you'd better not get entangled with me.

234
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,120
You're my girlfriend.

235
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Why don't you let me help you?

236
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,280
I'm not.

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,480
You said it yourself.

238
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,880
You don't need me anymore.

239
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,880
If

240
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm not your girlfriend,

241
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,080
will you still help me?

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,160
I said I didn't need you

243
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,880
but it doesn't mean we're over.

244
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
Do you really want to get rid of me?

245
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,520
For you,

246
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm just a tool.

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,800
Now the tool wants to be through with you.

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,800
Someone better will be waiting for you.

249
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,400
You don't have to be so serious.

250
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,320
You want to leave me, don't you?

251
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
You don't need me

252
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,960
to cure you.

253
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,680
I was your secretary

254
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,440
and you suspended me.

255
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I only make trouble for you.

256
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
You don't need me at all.

257
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,120
You let me stay

258
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,960
just for an agreement.

259
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Now it's terminated.

260
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
We're both free.

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,800
I don't need to be guilty

262
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
and you don't need to help me.

263
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,360
Let's just mind our own business.

264
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,440
Listen carefully.

265
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,000
Without my permission,

266
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,280
you won't be free

267
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,360
and our agreement is still valid.

268
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,640
You're mine.

269
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,840
Don't even think about breaking up with me.

270
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,560
But I just don't

271
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,520
want to be your girlfriend anymore.

272
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,960
I want to leave.

273
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm fed up with the acting.

274
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it because of Fang Lie?

275
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm breaking up with you.

276
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,880
What has it got to do with Fang Lie?

277
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,240
If I guess correctly,

278
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
Fang Lie has known about the post.

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
That day he rushed upstairs

280
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,680
as if the sky was falling

281
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
and pulled you away in front of everyone.

282
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,440
Does that have nothing to do with him?

283
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,800
When you ran into a problem,

284
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,040
he was the first person you turned to

285
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,080
and also the first to help you.

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
Does that have nothing to do with him?

287
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,520
You would rather turn to him

288
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,680
than tell me about it.

289
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Does that have nothing to do with him?

290
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Yes,

291
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
I'd rather turn to Fang Lie.

292
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,680
At least

293
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,360
I don't think I owe him anything.

294
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:02,960
Get out.

295
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,600
Goodbye.

296
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,800
Chairman.

297
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:20,960
Sister.

298
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,880
You caught us at a good moment.

299
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
We're going for a walk.

300
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,800
Join us.

301
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,800
I hurried here

302
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,960
without telling you.

303
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,920
I can wait for a while.

304
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,080
I'll say it when you're back.

305
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,200
No.

306
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,640
Now that you hurried here,

307
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
something must have happened in the company.

308
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,000
It seems that recently Mr. Fang ran into some problems

309
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,600
so I want to consult you.

310
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,800
What has he done again?

311
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:44,920
Shall I

312
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,960
go out?

313
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,240
You said you didn't want me to

314
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,560
interfere in Fang Leng's affairs.

315
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,400
Alright,

316
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,600
we're a family.

317
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,120
No one needs to make himself scarce.

318
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,680
Say it.

319
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,640
Chairman,

320
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,280
do you remember

321
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,320
Mr. Fang's girlfriend who is a delivery person?

322
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,680
I haven't given them the nod.

323
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,920
What kind of girlfriend is she?

324
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:01,920
What has she done?

325
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,400
Some time ago,

326
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,720
Mr. Fang appointed her as his secretary.

327
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,200
Somehow,

328
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,680
she stole the sample of a project.

329
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,480
The whole project has fallen through

330
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
and the employees are

331
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,360
all gossiping about Mr. Fang.

332
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,800
Someone even argued with her today.

333
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
This is outrageous.

334
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,760
Alright,

335
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,880
calm down.

336
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,440
What's wrong with you?

337
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,240
If Fang Leng gets into trouble,

338
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,520
just help him keep things under control.

339
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,760
What's the use of talking about it here?

340
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Really.

341
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,600
Alright, don't be angry.

342
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,240
He's just trying to help Fang Leng.

343
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,160
I did help him.

344
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,920
But you know

345
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,320
what Mr. Fang is like.

346
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,720
He won't pay any attention to what I say.

347
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,720
So I think...

348
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Ask him to come here right now.

349
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,920
Yes.

350
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,160
I have told you.

351
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,840
I promised Fang Lie that I wouldn't

352
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,400
make things difficult for Fang Leng again.

353
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,000
Why did you

354
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,080
stir up trouble again?

355
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,520
I didn't stir up trouble.

356
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,320
Fang Leng dug himself into a hole.

357
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,680
Besides,

358
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
can you take what

359
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,600
Lie said seriously?

360
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,640
If we don't pull Fang Leng down,

361
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,240
when can Lie get high in the company?

362
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,480
You want to see me?

363
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,440
Do you have anything to say?

364
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
Someone must have reported it to you.

365
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Why did you ask me?

366
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Because I want to give you a chance.

367
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
You promised me

368
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,160
you wouldn't allow those women

369
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
around you to make a scene again.

370
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,800
But what happened?

371
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,880
Is that your way to repay my trust?

372
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,360
I didn't break my promise.

373
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,440
Someone libeled Xiaoqi.

374
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,400
I won't let it go at that

375
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,680
before I clear up the rumor for her.

376
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,480
I don't care if it's a rumor.

377
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,640
You employed that woman as your secretary

378
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
and set tongues wagging.

379
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,720
Aren't you disgracing yourself?

380
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,800
Just because I put her in that position,

381
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,240
she was attacked by so many people.

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,000
I didn't want to fail you

383
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,560
so I had always kept our relationship secret.

384
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,200
Xiaoqi never had a complaint about it.

385
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
But I'm a man.

386
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,080
She was attacked by so many people today.

387
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,680
Do you think

388
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I should let it go unchecked?

389
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
You shouldn't have

390
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,040
been with women like her.

391
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,200
If you don't shape up now

392
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,160
and even disregard

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
the company for her,

394
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,080
I won't keep out of it.

395
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,840
What if I agree to make her leave?

396
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I'll transfer her from the Secretary Department.

397
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,280
From today on,

398
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,600
I guarantee that she won't

399
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,280
harm anything of the company.

400
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Can you leave her alone?

401
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
Now that you've realized your mistake,

402
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,520
I won't nag you again.

403
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,240
But I still need to warn you.

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,640
One day you'll have to

405
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,480
break all your links with that woman.

406
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,480
When that happens,

407
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,000
I wish it'd be our own decision.

408
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,960
Xiaoqi.

409
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,120
Xiaoqi!

410
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,720
Shush.

411
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,920
Don't talk to me.

412
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm doing calculations.

413
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,360
Stop calculating.

414
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,720
The salary Fang Leng pays you is the highest in the industry.

415
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,280
It's three times as mush as the pay of a delivery person.

416
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
You can't quit and leave him.

417
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,720
But I had a row with him.

418
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,520
If I go back to the company again,

419
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,280
won't it show that

420
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,320
I have no dignity?

421
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,040
Dignity?

422
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,040
What's that?

423
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,080
Can it bring you money?

424
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,160
Can it pay for you to check out cute guys?

425
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,000
Is your dignity more important

426
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,520
or your beautiful life on earth?

427
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,520
It seems money is indeed more important.

428
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,600
There you are.

429
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,680
If you can't even bear a few words

430
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
of Jiang Xue and leave,

431
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,000
can you be promising

432
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,040
in another company?

433
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,160
I demand that

434
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
you stay in F Group.

435
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,680
Actually

436
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,520
it's not because of Jiang Xue that I want to leave.

437
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,680
What's the reason, then?

438
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
Even without Jiang Xue

439
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
or the sapphire,

440
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
my relationship with him is still fake.

441
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
We'll split up sooner or later.

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,080
Besides,

443
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
I'm afraid if I keep delaying,

444
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,880
it'll be harder for me to leave him.

445
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,760
Anyway,

446
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
I can't go on like this with him anymore.

447
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,320
I must leave him.

448
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,000
Chai Xiaoqi

449
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
must have done something wrong.

450
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Why would she be

451
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,200
transferred from

452
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,160
the secretary's office?

453
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,080
Go, go, go.

454
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,480
The Notice of Personnel Dispatch
in the President's Secretary Room.

455
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,720
The president's secretary...

456
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,240
the former president's secretary,
Chai Xiaoqi, will be transferred to

457
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,840
the Project Development Department.

458
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
What?

459
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,720
Why did you transfer me to Fang Lie's...

460
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,680
You came at a good moment.

461
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
This is your new superior,

462
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,880
the director of the Project Development Department, Fang Lie.

463
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
You can take her away now.

464
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,800
Why should I go?

465
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,240
Leng.

466
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,840
Say something first.

467
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,320
I'll cooperate with you.

468
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,880
Why could you transfer me

469
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,720
without my permission?

470
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,480
Did I say I was staying here?

471
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,360
Yes,

472
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,440
Xiaoqi is a person

473
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,440
but not an object.

474
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,440
You can't throw her away.

475
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,440
Remember?

476
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,600
You've signed a labor contract

477
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,000
to work here for several years.

478
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
If you're not staying here,

479
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,360
where do you want to go?

480
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,880
As for you,

481
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,240
since you entered the company,

482
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,320
you haven't made any achievements.

483
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,320
Now you even

484
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,520
refused to obey your superior.

485
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,280
Do you believe

486
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,360
I can transfer you

487
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,240
to the building site anytime?

488
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,160
Don't do that, Leng.

489
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm not strongly against it

490
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
but it's just a little bit sudden.

491
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,520
You have to ask for Xiaoqi's opinion, don't you?

492
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,360
Yes.

493
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,760
You must respect me.

494
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,800
Don't respect you enough?

495
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,400
You said

496
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,920
everything would be fine as long as I let Fang Lie help you.

497
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
Did I do wrong by granting your wish?

498
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,760
But that doesn't mean

499
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
I have to work in his department.

500
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,360
I don't want to see you.

501
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,400
Why can't you approve of me quitting?

502
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes.

503
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,840
Why?

504
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,640
You want to quit?

505
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,480
Why don't you just work in my department?

506
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,760
I want to work with you but...

507
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,320
Alright,

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
now that no one has a problem with it,

509
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,640
let's settle it.

510
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,960
Go and work with Fang Lie.

511
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,840
As long as you don't give me any trouble,

512
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,280
I'll increase your salary

513
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,160
and bonus separately.

514
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,280
But I...

515
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:47,960
Three times.

516
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,600
Three times.

517
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay, stop calculating.

518
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,920
Don't go too far.

519
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,640
Okay, Leng.

520
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,120
We'll see you around.

521
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,360
Let's go.

522
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
I did something undignified just now, didn't I?

523
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,240
I don't know why you're giving up my Leng.

524
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
But I'm glad that

525
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,320
you're gonna work in my department.

526
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,880
Fine.

527
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,960
I just don't want to see him.

528
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
I can always avoid him.

529
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,040
Sure you can.

530
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,160
As long as I can make money,

531
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,200
I can justifiably sacrifice something,

532
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,480
right?

533
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,040
Yes.

534
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,520
Yes.

535
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,600
I decide that

536
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
from now on,

537
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll be free from human emotions.

538
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
I will pursue money

539
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,040
and get rich!

540
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,040
What are we going to do now?

541
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,080
Come with me.

542
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,360
I'll make you rich.

543
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,120
Let's go.

544
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,280
Do you need my help?

545
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,000
No, thanks.

546
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,280
I found them.

547
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
What are they?

548
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,080
The job you want.

549
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,080
These are

550
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,400
the most pressing development plans of our company.

551
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,240
In total...

552
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,280
I don't know how many of them.

553
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,280
Just casually sign them for me.

554
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,720
But

555
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm just a common employee.

556
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,920
I can't make this kind of decision

557
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,760
for you, can I?

558
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,960
Why don't you read them first?

559
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
My head aches every time I read them.

560
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,920
I'm a director in name only.

561
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,160
Look at them.

562
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,720
They're still doing fine without me.

563
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,880
Therefore,

564
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,440
just casually sign them for me

565
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,840
and go through the motions.

566
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,240
Okay.

567
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,440
Got it.

568
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,200
Here you are.

569
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,880
What's this?

570
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,280
My signature.

571
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Practise it more often when you're free.

572
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,560
Then you can

573
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,320
sign for me in the future.

574
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,440
Okay.

575
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,320
Don't worry.

576
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
This is my first job in your department.

577
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,120
I will make you satisfied.

578
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay. Good.

579
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,000
Go.

580
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,640
It's time for games.

581
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,320
Here.

582
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,760
Waitress.

583
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,880
Yes, madam.

584
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,760
Assistant Han said

585
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,440
you wanted to see me about work.

586
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Your milk tea, sir.

587
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,200
If I hadn't said that,

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,320
would you have agreed to see me?

589
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
I've heard what happened

590
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,080
in your company.

591
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,040
It must be a headache for you.

592
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,680
If you just want to chat,

593
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm afraid I don't have the time.

594
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,080
Isn't it normal

595
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,040
to ask your friends out

596
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,080
and chat with them

597
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,000
when they feel down?

598
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,600
Don't tell me

599
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,720
you don't even have the time to feel down.

600
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,280
Are we that close?

601
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
Do you have any close friends, then?

602
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,560
Actually we're the same.

603
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,440
We had always been the best students

604
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,520
who had few friends in our classes.

605
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,440
When we finally graduated

606
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,080
and started to work,

607
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,200
we still didn't know how to be friends with others.

608
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,000
Every time I'm tired,

609
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,680
I'll think,

610
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,120
"If only someone could keep me company."

611
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,800
Therefore,

612
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,160
when I heard what happened in your company,

613
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,640
I thought,

614
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,120
"He also needs company very much, doesn't he?"

615
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,920
Sometimes

616
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,560
I think we seem to

617
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,880
have known each other before.

618
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,600
Have you ever seen me before?

619
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,320
Perhaps it's because we're similar in too many things,

620
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,160
such as origins,

621
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,880
experiences

622
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,920
and even taste.

623
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,680
Jiang Xue,

624
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,800
thank you.

625
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,840
No problem.

626
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,480
You can repay me

627
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,080
next time I want to drink.

628
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,360
Okay.

629
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,280
Fang Lie.

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
Fang Lie.

631
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,000
Fang...

632
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,160
Fang Leng.

633
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
It's okay.

634
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,680
I'm just tired.

635
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
Fang Lie.

636
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,480
Have you finished signing

637
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:36,840
these documents?

638
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,480
Yep.

639
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,280
Good job.

640
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,360
Let's go

641
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
and attend the project meeting.

642
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,480
But you haven't read it yet.

643
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,760
Won't that cause problems?

644
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,880
That's why I asked you to go with me.

645
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,560
With a friend there,

646
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,040
I'll be calmer when they tell me off.

647
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,880
Besides,

648
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,880
you've read it, haven't you?

649
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,640
Let's go.

650
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,240
That's plausible.

651
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,600
I don't know either.

652
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,160
Today we'll discuss

653
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,080
the development plans for the next quarter

654
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,560
that the Project Development Department just submitted.

655
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,400
You have all

656
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
read these several plans before.

657
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,440
The first one

658
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,800
is the perfume project Director Fang Lie proposed.

659
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,600
Mr. Fang,

660
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,040
something is wrong with this plan.

661
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,480
Hasn't it been discarded before?

662
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,640
Yes. Why is it here again?

663
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,640
Yes,

664
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,960
it has been rejected when we considered it

665
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,200
for the first time.

666
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,160
Director Fang,

667
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,560
why is it here again?

668
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,080
I... I have no idea.

669
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,320
Director Fang,

670
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
how could you

671
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
sign a plan that had been discarded?

672
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,280
Won't this...

673
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
won't it cause disorder?

674
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,520
Yes.

675
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,400
It's outrageous.

676
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,760
It's really outrageous.

677
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,400
Enough!

678
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,040
Director Fang,

679
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,880
give us an explanation.

680
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm sorry, Leng.

681
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,600
I just entered the company.

682
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,800
There are some things I...

683
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm your colleague

684
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,840
but not your Brother Leng in the company.

685
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,560
The plans submitted to the top executives

686
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,280
can all be found in the minutes.

687
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,240
Haven't you checked them

688
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,880
when you were considering it?

689
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,640
I was too busy.

690
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,440
It's my fault.

691
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
I got it wrong.

692
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,560
Fang Lie...

693
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,240
Director Fang asked me to sort out the documents.

694
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
I muddled them up

695
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,680
and gave the plan which had been discarded to him.

696
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,520
I'm sorry.

697
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,080
What's wrong with you?

698
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
You're just an employee.

699
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,240
How could you jerk us around?

700
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,080
You think the company is your backyard?

701
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,920
Even if you didn't know it,

702
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,880
you've signed here

703
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,080
and it means

704
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,720
you've approved of this plan.

705
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,840
You must have your reasons.

706
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Tell us.

707
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,640
I think

708
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,840
this plan is full of ideas.

709
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,720
It's very... very artistic.

710
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,200
Yes, art.

711
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,440
That's what I like about it.

712
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,680
Mr. Fang,

713
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,640
if you let me work on this plan,

714
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,960
I will definitely do it well.

715
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,120
Okay.

716
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,520
I can give you a chance.

717
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,240
Mr. Fang, how can you do that?

718
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,560
It has been discarded before

719
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,320
and now we have to deal with it again.

720
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,000
You'd better

721
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,040
hand in a convincing plan within a week.

722
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,080
If you pass,

723
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,960
we'll forgive you for your mistake.

724
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
But if you fail,

725
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,320
you and your subordinate will be downgraded together.

726
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,560
How can he do that?

727
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Isn't he messing things up?

728
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,640
I'm over.

729
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,120
My fault. My fault.

730
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,960
It's not that serious, is it?

731
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,080
We'll just be downgraded at worst.

732
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,200
You don't know.

733
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,320
My Leng will really downgrade us.

734
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,840
He's so heartless.

735
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
We'll be banished to the building site and labor there.

736
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,080
Really?

737
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,640
It's my fault.

738
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

739
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,480
I've got it.

740
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,880
Go to a place with me.

741
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,680
Where?

742
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,360
Do you have to be so happy?

743
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,840
We can go for a ride

744
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,480
every day if you like.

745
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,160
You said we had to work on the plan today.

746
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,160
Why did you suddenly want a ride?

747
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
We don't have to do that in the company.

748
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,560
I met a perfume master when I was a painter before.

749
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,720
We'll do a research at his place first

750
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,080
and decide

751
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,520
how to write the plan after that.

752
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,320
That makes sense.

753
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
You're always unreliable

754
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,120
but you're quite conscientious when working.

755
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,160
Only you will trust me so much.

756
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,320
What did you say?

757
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I said that master lived on an island

758
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,160
and we would have to go there by boat later.

759
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,240
You got it.

760
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,600
Assistant Han,

761
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,640
Xiaoqi and I are going to an island to do a research.

762
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,880
Okay.

763
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,800
I see.

764
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,840
Mr. Fang,

765
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,280
Fang Lie put out to sea with Xiaoqi.

766
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,200
He said he wanted to do a research on an island.

767
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
That's okay.

768
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,440
They're not kids.

769
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,640
They'll take care of themselves.

770
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,800
But I just heard that

771
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,000
the typhoon had hit the islands nearby.

772
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,320
I expect that

773
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,960
the boats have all been canceled.

774
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,400
Stop the car.

775
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,600
Get out of the car.

776
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,200
Ask the crossing to prepare a boat.

777
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,720
I'll take them back.

778
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,120
Mr. Fang, you'll be in danger.

779
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,680
Besides, most likely it'll rain.

780
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,080
What if you lose your memory again?

781
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
I won't let Xiaoqi be in danger.

782
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,040
As well as Fang Lie.

783
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,740
=Xiaoqi=

784
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,500
=Assistant Han=

785
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,360
Assistant Han,

786
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,160
how come her location is gone?

787
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,280
Perhaps it's because of the weather.

788
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,320
The Technology Department is dealing with it.

789
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,500
=Xiaoqi=

790
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,520
Answer your phone!

791
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,560
Are you sure that master lives here?

792
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,480
I've just seen him a few times.

793
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,280
It seems it wasn't here that I met him before.

794
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,680
What do we do?

795
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,480
We can't search the whole wood, can we?

796
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,000
The weather was fine just now.

797
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,720
Why is it suddenly blowing?

798
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,720
Why don't you

799
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,480
go and hide under that tree?

800
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,840
I'll look for him

801
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,600
and pick you up later.

802
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
Be careful.

803
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,300
Go.

804
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,820
Oh my god!

805
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
Come back.

806
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,080
It'll freeze me to death.

807
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,640
Why does it say "No Service"?

808
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,360
Aren't you cold?

809
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,640
Yes.

810
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,520
Give me your hands.

811
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,920
What are you doing here?

812
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,160
No.

813
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,440
Why would you look for me?

814
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,720
It's cold and remote here.

815
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,680
Because I worried about you.

816
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,600
Why didn't you take care of yourself?

817
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,320
I've let you go.

818
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,560
Why don't you let me give up?

819
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
Why do you always make mistakes?

820
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,040
Why do you make me worry all the time?

821
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,080
You're like a thorn in my heart.

822
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
It's so painful.

823
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
I feel so bad.

824
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,640
I can't even breathe.

825
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,960
Why is the annunciator...

826
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Wasn't it destroyed?

827
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,520
Why is it here?

828
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,680
What are you talking about?

829
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh boy!

830
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,920
I finally found you.

831
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,600
Hey!

832
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,080
Here is it.

833
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
It took me a long time to find it.

834
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,680
What are you doing?

835
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,080
He just dumped you.

836
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,800
How can you be so shameless?

837
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,800
You don't know.

838
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,880
He's got the scent of Capetown Planet all over him.

839
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
You've come a long way.

840
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,440
Come on in, please.

841
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
This is my workroom.

842
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,520
The bedrooms are inside.

843
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,440
There's only one guest room.

844
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,120
Miss,

845
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,320
if you don't mind,

846
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,120
what about sleeping with my daughter?

847
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,120
I'll sleep with him.

848
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,680
You are such a bad girl.

849
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,440
No.

850
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,960
I...

851
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,040
I'll sleep with my Leng, too.

852
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,160
Let's sleep together, then.

853
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,320
Come here. Come here.

854
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,200
Come and sleep with me.

855
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
Come on.

856
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
Quickly.

857
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,000
Go there.

858
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,640
Hey, what are you doing?

859
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,000
Weird.

860
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,800
Why is there no sound at all?

861
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,600
I've clearly heard the signal.

862
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,800
What are you doing?

863
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,840
Let's get to sleep.

864
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,400
Hey!

865
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,520
What?

866
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,800
Can't you let me sleep?

867
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,360
You're my friend.

868
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,440
I can't watch you walking towards the abyss.

869
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,440
No. Go away.

870
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,440
Go back to your bed.

871
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,720
No.

872
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,960
Don't force me, Fang Lie.

873
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,160
I would rather die.

874
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,480
Go away.

875
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,480
My waist.

876
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,880
My waist.

877
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,080
Shut up your mouths!

878
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,920
Or I'll throw you out of the window.

879
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
He's so handsome even when he's sleeping.

880
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,920
Wait.

881
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,720
I gotta take the annunciator out quickly.

882
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,480
Do I have to take off his shirt?

883
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,440
Leng! Leng! Leng!

884
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,640
Wake up.

885
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,880
Leng!

886
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,440
Leng!

887
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,520
you did it on purpose, didn't you?

888
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,560
Morning.

889
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,720
I want to ask you a question.

890
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,520
Is there

891
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,880
something special on your heart,

892
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,320
such as a little chip that gives out light?

893
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,120
Is there?

894
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,640
Is there a little chip there?

895
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,920
Yes or no?

896
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,160
Yes or no?

897
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,320
Hello?

898
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,520
Spit it out

899
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,680
and speak clearly.

900
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,800
I just wonder

901
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,680
if there is...

902
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,600
a little chip in your body?

903
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,360
No.

904
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
How's that possible?

905
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,360
I've heard it.

906
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,160
What did you hear?

907
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,040
A signal.

908
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,640
It's a sound wave of a low frequency.

909
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,240
You can't hear it.

910
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,480
Anyway, I'm sure

911
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,280
that extremely important thing is in your body.

912
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,720
Is that the reason why you peeped into my shirt

913
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,000
in the midnight?

914
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,560
How did you know that?

915
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,880
Now I understand

916
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,120
what you said yesterday.

917
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,080
I won't turn you down

918
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,560
but sometimes you can't go too far.

919
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,240
Understand?

920
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,280
I'm talking something serious with you.

921
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,400
What's the reason?

922
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,160
Where did I go wrong?

923
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,480
Didn't you say you wanted to eat breakfast?

924
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,200
This is urgent

925
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,360
and much more important than breakfast.

926
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,000
Let's get out of the car. Come on.

927
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Let's get out. Come on.

928
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,600
I beg you. Let's get out of the car.

929
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,720
Here. Here.

930
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,320
What are you going to do?

931
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,880
Come on. Come on. Come on.

932
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,520
Let's repeat what we did yesterday.

933
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm not playing

934
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,160
this kind of boring game with you.

935
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,480
It's not a boring game.

936
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,360
I've waited for its response

937
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,960
for a long time.

938
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,880
Do you know that kind of feeling?

939
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
The thing you've been waiting for

940
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,440
and looking for

941
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,160
finally gave you a signal.

942
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,040
You won't understand that.

943
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,520
It's like your life is full of hopes again.

944
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,080
You've waited for that day for a long time?

945
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,760
I've waited for ages.

946
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,200
I mistook something else as it before.

947
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,840
I cheated you

948
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,120
and harmed the company for it.

949
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,560
I even thought it was gone.

950
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,680
Although you let me off,

951
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,240
I still feel sorry about it.

952
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,640
I won't punish you for a past event.

953
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,880
I only care about the present.

954
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,960
That's great.

955
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,760
So please do as I say, will you?

956
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,920
What did you say there yesterday?

957
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,680
One of them must have started up the annunciator.

958
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,120
Say them again.

959
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,160
Xiaoqi,

960
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,560
some things are said to be remembered

961
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,040
but not to be joked about.

962
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm not joking.

963
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,160
I really didn't hear what you said.

964
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,280
You really don't remember them?

965
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,600
Why did you hug me yesterday?

966
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,440
I

967
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
hugged you

968
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
because

969
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,280
the wind was too strong

970
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,560
and I was cold.

971
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,920
Can you say them again?

972
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,480
It doesn't matter, does it?

973
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:24,880
Yes, it does.

974
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,360
Hey,

975
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,160
Fang Leng.

976
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,040
Wait for me. Where are you going?

977
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,280
Xiaoqi.

978
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,400
They went to buy breakfast.

979
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,840
But

980
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,240
a typhoon is coming today, isn't it?

981
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,000
It's still far from here.

982
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,440
You can walk around.

983
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,960
Okay. Thank you for letting us stay over.

984
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,120
Were these all made by you?

985
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,600
Yes.

986
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,880
You can pick some and give them to your friends.

987
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,120
It has a slight scent.

988
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,920
It's refreshing.

989
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,880
Is it Sicilian orange blossom?

990
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,200
You are good.

991
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,440
How come I also

992
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,040
smelt something bitter?

993
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,040
Guess what I added to it.

994
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,440
Don't be frustrated.

995
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,520
I can give you some tips.

996
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,280
No, thanks.

997
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,960
It's daisy.

998
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,040
How did you know that?

999
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,800
I thought I had covered its smell perfectly.

1000
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,000
Because it's the smell of love.

1001
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,840
Is it safe here?

1002
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,840
I care about that more than you do.

1003
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
What is it you have to tell me face to face?

1004
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,920
There's something

1005
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,800
I want to share with you.

1006
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
You have entered Fang Leng's memory bank?

1007
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,400
These are not all.

1008
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,480
There are also sound recordings.

1009
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,160
Would you like to listen to them?

1010
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,920
There's no need.

1011
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
What's the most important in cooperation is trust.

1012
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,880
I didn't expect you could get access to it so quickly.

1013
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,200
Everything will be alright now.

1014
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,360
No matter what Chai Xiaoqi does,

1015
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,440
as long as I make some clicks,

1016
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,920
Fang Leng's memories of her will be all gone.

1017
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,080
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

1018
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,720
Temporarily that can't happen.

1019
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,120
What do you mean?

1020
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,920
Fang Leng is protecting all of the documents

1021
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,560
about Chai Xiaoqi with special permissions.

1022
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,680
I only broke through some of them.

1023
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,680
The rest are protected by their core technologies.

1024
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm afraid I can't handle it

1025
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,480
without the computer at Fang Leng's office.

1026
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,680
How can we possibly get there?

1027
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,880
After his office was upgraded,

1028
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,320
no one can enter it without his fingerprint.

1029
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,480
Do you have any solutions?

1030
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,320
No.

1031
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,480
I spent so much money

1032
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,440
and these copies are what I got.

1033
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,000
Are you fooling me?

1034
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,320
If you're not satisfied,

1035
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,360
you can change me at all times.

1036
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,480
Wait.

1037
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm dizzy.

1038
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,080
Don't be like that.

1039
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,080
The wind was too strong that day

1040
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,440
so I didn't hear what you said.

1041
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,560
The wind.

1042
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,040
The wind!

1043
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,680
It's the wind! It's the wind!

1044
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,440
I just remembered.

1045
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,200
It's the wind.

1046
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,280
It's the wind! The wind!

1047
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,160
Can you not block my view of the mirror?

1048
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,360
Can you open the window?

1049
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
What do you want to do again?

1050
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,720
You're driving too fast.

1051
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,520
I'm a bit dizzy

1052
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,360
and breathless.

1053
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,720
Open the window and let me catch my breath.

1054
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,540
Ever since I met you,

1055
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

1056
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

1057
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,500
only you.

1058
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,700
We're out of reach

1059
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,020
but appreciate each other.

1060
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:27,820
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

1061
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,860
The yearning invades

1062
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,420
and lurks in my mind.

1063
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,980
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

1064
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,060
I'm getting addicted to it

1065
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,380
and my sense is shielded.

1066
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:56,180
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

1067
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,340
Put the hottest heart

1068
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,660
in this cold body.

1069
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,020
I'm looking at you,

1070
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,180
and my love has nowhere to go.

1071
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,420
Ever since I met you,

1072
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

1073
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,620
Every day is a new memory

1074
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,660
which is only be about you and me.

1075
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,900
I can't lie to myself anymore.

1076
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,740
Please give me the courage to believe.

1077
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,660
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

1078
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,580
only you.

1079
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,700
Even everything becomes silent,

1080
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,820
I still have you.
