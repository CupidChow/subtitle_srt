1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 19

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
I can't get out alone.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,880
If I did,

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,160
I would be the one frightened.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,400
I'd rather stay here with you

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,720
than get out alone

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,200
and taste the horror of losing you.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
You have forgotten me.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,080
How can you lose me?

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,360
Yes.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,640
In my eyes,

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
you are insignificant.

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,040
But it's weird.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,640
Every time I think of someone bullying you,

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
I will get mad.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
If I were Fang Lie,

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,120
I would have returned

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
all the insults they gave you.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
But I am Fang Leng

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,760
and I can't do what I want.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,840
I can only watch you

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
from afar, saying nothing.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,640
You...

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
You still care about me?

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,800
What do you think?

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,760
Thank you.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Xiaoqi.

45
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,240
Xiaoqi.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Xiaoqi.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,240
Xiaoqi.

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,200
Xiaoqi.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,600
Xiaoqi.

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,320
Leng.

51
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
I heard Xiaoqi was injured.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,920
How is she now?

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
She should be fine.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,680
Just need some rest.

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,880
Glad to know she's okay.

56
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,560
Where is she?

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,400
I will take her back.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,400
She's resting now.

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,480
Don't disturb her.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,640
Leng.

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,680
I wish to ask you a favor.

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,800
What?

63
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
Got into trouble again?

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,200
I love her.

65
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,600
Can you stay away from her?

66
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,600
You think love is something to joke about?

67
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,160
I'm not joking.

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,720
I did pretend Xiaoqi's boyfriend

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,360
to provoke you before.

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,840
I admit that

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
I treated Xiaoqi as a friend at first.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,480
But now, I truly want to protect her.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
You have hurt her so much.

74
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Leave her alone, can you?

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,400
It's between me and her.

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,800
So I'm begging you.

77
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
I grew up losing everything to you.

78
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,720
No matter what I do,

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
no matter what I have,

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
as long as you like,

81
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840
I will never have that thing.

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,240
Only this.

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,920
Please give me Xiaoqi.

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,960
Fang Lie.

85
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,400
What brought you here?

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,120
Nothing.

87
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:12,960
Come with me.

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:13,840
Hey.

89
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,640
Don't touch my hand.

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,320
Unhand her!

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,520
Xiaoqi is a human being.

92
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,080
She has a mind of her own.

93
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,400
You think I can decide her feelings?

94
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,360
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,720
Give what?

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,680
Don't listen to him.

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,200
Come with me.

98
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:30,920
Hey.

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,560
Stop!

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Geez.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
What are you quarreling about?

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Can't you talk it out?

103
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,480
Fine.

104
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Answer me.

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,840
Fang Leng and I.

106
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,000
Which one is your choice?

107
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
My choice?

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
Are you two quarreling again?

109
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
Will you go with him

110
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,520
or stay with me?

111
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
Hmm...

112
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,440
Chai Xiaoqi.

113
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Think twice about your answer.

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,720
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

115
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,800
Thank you for taking care of me.

116
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,360
Hey...

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,680
What?

118
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,720
Hate to leave my brother?

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Stop talking about your brother.

120
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
He's my jinx.

121
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
I almost made him lose his life

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
during the elevator accident.

123
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,800
Luckily, it ended well after a scare.

124
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,440
You are great.

125
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,760
You even got into something

126
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,800
as serious as the elevator accident.

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,680
As for my brother...

128
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,800
Look, he's here.

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,880
Where is he?

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I was kidding.

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Look.

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,880
The sky has not fallen.

133
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
The earth has not sunken.

134
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,680
No accident has happened.

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,280
Eh?

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,880
Really.

137
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,320
Call your brother a few more times.

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,640
Fang Leng.

139
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,120
Fang Leng.

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,640
Wow.

141
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,880
Nothing is happening.

142
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,840
It's a miracle.

143
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Silly.

144
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,840
Nothing is happening right now.

145
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,360
And nothing will happen in the future.

146
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
I'll take you away from my brother.

147
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
I'll make you forget him completely.

148
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,600
Forget him?

149
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,840
You still care about me?

150
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,720
What do you think?

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
I can't forget him.

152
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,040
You said it.

153
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,400
The more you want to forget a person,

154
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,720
the better you remember that person.

155
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
In the elevator,

156
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,000
he gave up the chance to escape and stayed with me.

157
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
I think, at that moment,

158
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,160
I learned how to control myself.

159
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
The doctor told me that

160
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
when someone accepted me

161
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
and cared about me,

162
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,600
I'd learn to control

163
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
and accept myself.

164
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,640
He cares about you.

165
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,720
What about you?

166
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Do you care about him?

167
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
I always believed

168
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,840
I was a heartless person,

169
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,720
and I shed tears

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,640
and lost control

171
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
only because my system malfunctioned.

172
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,440
But later, I found that

173
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,760
my system did not malfunction.

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,480
My reactions were normal

175
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,520
for a lover.

176
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,000
I think I love him.

177
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
If you love him,

178
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,240
why come out with me?

179
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,920
Why aren't you with him?

180
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,880
My love

181
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
only concerns me, doesn't it?

182
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,520
Sometimes, one's love

183
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
is one's own business.

184
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
But that's hard.

185
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,800
There are various types of human feelings.

186
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
To avoid the hurt,

187
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,800
you should try

188
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,640
to like me.

189
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
I like you.

190
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
I've been fond of you since I saw you for the first time.

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
I wouldn't have helped you otherwise.

192
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,360
That's not what I'm talking about.

193
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,000
I hope you will

194
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,960
lose control for me someday.

195
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,600
I'd rather not.

196
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,840
Just to keep this planet peaceful and safe.

197
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,160
Here are the photos and videos of

198
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,160
Fang Leng and Chai Xiaoqi.

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,800
What are you going to do?

200
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,080
He asked me to save my own skin.

201
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,600
The best way to save my own skin

202
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,800
is to destroy the thing he wants.

203
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
In coping with Fang Leng,

204
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,200
you have become a little maturer.

205
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
I won't err twice on the same thing.

206
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,960
Uncle.

207
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,280
Xue.

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,760
What brought you here?

209
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,920
Where is Fang Leng? Didn't he come with you?

210
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,240
He...

211
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,400
Uncle.

212
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,040
I need to talk to you.

213
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,680
This little punk.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,760
He's impenitent.

215
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
It has provoked much discussion.

216
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,160
My father intended to

217
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,280
come and visit you.

218
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,280
But I feared there would be a misunderstanding. So I stopped him.

219
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,240
I know

220
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,000
Fang Leng is a little loose in relationships.

221
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,520
But I thought my love

222
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,440
will bring him to his senses.

223
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
I didn't expect

224
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,240
this to be the end.

225
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
I raised this brat wrong.

226
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,080
And Chai Xiaoqi

227
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,000
deceived me.

228
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,360
I underestimated Ms. Chai.

229
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't worry.

230
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,240
Good always prevails over evil.

231
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
She won't be able to

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,560
play her petty tricks soon.

233
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,240
Uncle.

234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
What are you...

235
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
Now you've told me all this,

236
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
you must have recognized me as a father.

237
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,960
Don't worry.

238
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,280
I will make Fang Leng handle this matter

239
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,160
in a way that satisfies you and your family.

240
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,720
Thank you, Uncle.

241
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,980
=Certificate of Honor. Due to your support to our charity,
Miss. Chai Xiaoqi is honored as the Love Ambassador.=

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why are you here?

243
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
You made the donation.

244
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,520
Have you forgotten?

245
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh...

246
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
It's the donation I made at the mall.

247
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,000
They thank me for it.

248
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,600
This is nice.

249
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,920
Forget it.

250
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,480
We should stop feeling awkward.

251
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,320
I know you took me to your home

252
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,200
out of kindness yesterday.

253
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,200
Thank you.

254
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,880
However,

255
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,680
I want to say

256
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,240
I won't cause you trouble anymore.

257
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,120
You want to draw a line between us?

258
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
We can't keep acting like we're enemies.

259
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
I've come around to certain things.

260
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,320
Anyway,

261
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,920
it's enough to have the experience.

262
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,440
Getting it or not doesn't matter.

263
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,440
Am I right?

264
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,000
Hold on.

265
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,240
Thank you for what happened yesterday.

266
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm forgiving you

267
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,840
for scolding me at the company.

268
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:53,760
Hey.

269
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,240
Eat this,

270
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,760
and let us make up.

271
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,440
Thank you.

272
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,960
Then,

273
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,680
I'm going upstairs.

274
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
Go back.

275
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,720
What brought you here?

276
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,920
Didn't you say you were having

277
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,240
sleep problems these days?

278
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,280
I warmed a cup of milk for you. It'll help you sleep.

279
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,320
Thanks.

280
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,960
What is this?

281
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,080
Xiaoqi.

282
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,920
You often told me you were an alien.

283
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,320
But, you know what,

284
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,840
there are three things

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,880
you can't lie about on Earth.

286
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,440
They are sneezing,

287
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,400
poverty,

288
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,840
and love.

289
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,960
You went all out for Fang Leng some time ago.

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,640
I saw it with my eyes.

291
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,960
How come you're giving up now?

292
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I just can't hide anything from you.

293
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,160
What can I do except giving up?

294
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,920
He's with Jiang Xue now.

295
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,200
Besides,

296
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,800
Fang Leng and I

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,480
have no future anyway.

298
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,080
You need to fight for your future.

299
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,040
Moreover,

300
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
I think there's something strange

301
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,880
about him and Jiang Xue.

302
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,480
What is strange?

303
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
Have you ever seen a couple

304
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,760
that only exists in media reports?

305
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Jiang Xue is the only one

306
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,000
who publicizes their relationship.

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,360
Right?

308
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,200
But Fang Leng didn't deny their relationship.

309
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,400
He also didn't admit their relationship.

310
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,800
Did he say

311
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
he and Jiang Xue were lovers?

312
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
Yeah.

313
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,480
Think about it.

314
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,480
Have they ever

315
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,360
interacted intimately?

316
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,760
Like holding hands

317
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
and touching waists.

318
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
I guess...

319
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,760
They've never done those things.

320
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,400
That's it.

321
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,560
From my experience, I can tell

322
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
they probably aren't really lovers.

323
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,320
Besides,

324
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
Fang Leng looks more interested

325
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
in you than in Jiang Xue.

326
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,120
Otherwise,

327
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,000
why would he visit you late at night?

328
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,840
To give me this.

329
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,080
He could have asked his assistant to send it here.

330
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,600
Well then,

331
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
why did he come?

332
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,000
Xiaoqi.

333
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,200
Do you know

334
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,320
What's the biggest difference between

335
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Fang Leng and Fang Lie?

336
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,440
Every time Fang Lie sent you back,

337
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,720
he left just after seeing you enter the house.

338
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Fang Leng is different.

339
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,720
He always watched the light in your room upstairs turn on

340
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,200
and walked away slowly after that.

341
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,640
Then...

342
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,600
He...

343
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,960
He...

344
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,720
cares about me?

345
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,320
It's a habit.

346
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,480
A habit of love.

347
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,080
Memories fade sometimes.

348
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
But the feeling of love

349
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,040
can't be feigned.

350
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,160
I hope you

351
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,440
will stop evading Fang Leng.

352
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,920
Go and talk it out with him.

353
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,080
But...

354
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,040
But if he's

355
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,840
really dating Jiang Xue,

356
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,240
I'd disturb them

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
by doing that.

358
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,520
Stop thinking too much.

359
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
Don't be overcautious.

360
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,680
If you like Fang Leng very much,

361
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,360
you must grasp him.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,840
I used to be too reserved

363
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
to lost many great opportunities.

364
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,360
It's the reason why I'm still single.

365
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,440
Xiaoqi.

366
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,720
I don't want you to repeat my mistakes.

367
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,840
I think

368
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,160
I've plucked up some courage.

369
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,760
You should have done that sooner.

370
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,520
Starting from tomorrow,

371
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,520
you'll go to work openly

372
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,720
and talk it out with Fang Leng.

373
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,920
I will.

374
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,280
That's more like

375
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,160
my lovely little Xiaoqi.

376
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,440
Here.

377
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,120
Drink the milk.

378
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
And have a good sleep.

379
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,240
Chairman, welcome.

380
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,360
Where is Fang Leng?

381
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,760
Eh...

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
Mr. Fang

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,720
is busy with his private affairs.

384
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
His work...

385
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,400
Tell me to see me in the office.

386
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,080
Yes.

387
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,520
Dad.

388
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,200
What brought you here?

389
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,120
If I don't come now,

390
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,200
my reputation built over the last decades

391
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,360
would be ruined by you.

392
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,320
I don't know what you have heard,

393
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,960
but my conscience is clear

394
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
and I have never done anything

395
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,440
to the company's disadvantage.

396
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm not going to argue with you.

397
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,560
Just get ready

398
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,640
and come with me to the Jiang family tonight.

399
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,720
Why are we going to the Jiang family?

400
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,280
To apologize.

401
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,400
You know very well

402
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
how you have treated Jiang Xue.

403
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,920
I have talked to Jiang Yuntao over the phone.

404
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
You're giving him an explanation.

405
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,240
There's nothing to explain.

406
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Jiang Xue isn't some random woman.

407
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,000
She's the only heir of Jiang's Group.

408
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,880
What does that

409
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,760
have to do with me?

410
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,200
I see Chai Xiaoqi has

411
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,960
bewitched you.

412
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,320
You have no vision.

413
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,920
I broke up Chai Xiaoqi a long time ago.

414
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:13,880
Humph.

415
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
You think I know nothing

416
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,840
just because I'm not at the company.

417
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
Is this how you broke up with her?

418
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
Dad, what do you want?

419
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,800
I said

420
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,480
we are going to apologize to the Jiang family.

421
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,240
Cooperate with me

422
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
or I'll solve the problem

423
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,840
in my way.

424
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,880
Okay.

425
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,440
I'll explain the whole thing to Mr. Jiang.

426
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,760
But before we get going,

427
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,600
I need to make this clear to you.

428
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,960
No matter what is my relationship with Jiang Xue,

429
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,080
it's my private life.

430
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
Please don't mix my private life

431
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,120
with the company's interests.

432
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,240
Fang Leng.

433
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,120
You should know your place.

434
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,360
I know my place, and it's why

435
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,400
I hate to see what happened to my mother happen to another one.

436
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,200
If you didn't focus on your career

437
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,320
and ignore your family,

438
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,920
our family of three wouldn't

439
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,280
come to this point.

440
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,200
Dad.

441
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,560
I don't want a life like yours.

442
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:19,840
Really.

443
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,520
There are people waiting for me in the conference room.

444
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,800
I'll get going.

445
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,600
Ms. Chai, I'll get going.

446
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
Hold on, Xiaoqi.

447
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,880
Come here.

448
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,320
Take this.

449
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,400
What is this?

450
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
Boxed lunch.

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,240
Wow.

452
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,120
Ms. Chai, you're being so nice to me.

453
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
It's not for you.

454
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,800
It's for Fang Leng.

455
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,320
Aren't you going to see him?

456
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,520
But...

457
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,400
Isn't this inappropriate?

458
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,520
It is not.

459
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,000
You said

460
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,800
he saved you in the elevator.

461
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,280
Think this as

462
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,920
paying him back for saving you.

463
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,040
Oh.

464
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Alright. I'm going.

465
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,560
Xiaoqi.

466
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Huh?

467
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,360
Fighting.

468
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,360
A wonderful day

469
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
has begun.

470
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,040
What's the matter?

471
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,760
I suddenly feel so nervous.

472
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,720
Fang Leng.

473
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,120
I'm coming in.

474
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I will come in.

475
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,280
I...

476
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,480
Chair...

477
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,240
Chairman.

478
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,680
Eh...

479
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,320
Chairman.

480
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,040
Have you had breakfast?

481
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,160
Would you like to taste our restaurant's breakfast?

482
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,840
So, this is how

483
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
you get close to Fang Leng.

484
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,400
No.

485
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,040
I came here for him

486
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,680
because

487
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,080
I have something to ask him.

488
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,720
If I'm not mistaken,

489
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,280
you promised to stop

490
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,800
bothering Fang Leng

491
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,680
when you took the money.

492
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm not bothering him.

493
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,400
Ms. Chai,

494
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
you and Fang Leng won't be together.

495
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,160
Because Fang Leng and Ms. Jiang

496
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
will be engaged soon.

497
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,680
Engaged?

498
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,920
That's right.

499
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,560
The parents have approved it.

500
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,360
I see.

501
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,080
Sorry for bothering you.

502
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,600
Excuse me.

503
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,440
Wait.

504
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,720
Do you know why I have been stopping

505
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,520
you and Fang Leng from getting together?

506
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
I know I don't deserve him.

507
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,080
It's not because I look down on your family background.

508
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm just protecting Fang Leng.

509
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,720
You and Fang Leng

510
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,160
are just like me and his mother.

511
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
We were happy together.

512
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,560
But in essence,

513
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
we are not of the same kind

514
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,360
and pursue different things.

515
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,600
The gap between you two

516
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,760
will become wider and wider.

517
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,960
To avoid hurting each other in the end,

518
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
you two had better not get together.

519
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,440
I have such experience.

520
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,760
I understand these things.

521
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Ms. Jiang Xue

522
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,320
is his real partner.

523
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,640
You know what I mean, right?

524
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,360
Xiaoqi, you are back.

525
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,000
Why didn't you

526
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
give him the boxed lunch?

527
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Ms. Chai.

528
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,680
I'm feeling so bad.

529
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,440
What's wrong?

530
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Don't be upset.

531
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,960
Come here.

532
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,040
Take a seat.

533
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,640
I...

534
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Don't be upset.

535
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,480
Tell me

536
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,800
what happened.

537
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,880
Fang Leng and Jiang Xue

538
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,280
are more than lovers.

539
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,680
They're getting married.

540
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,480
What?

541
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,520
That's outrageous.

542
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,200
I can't believe

543
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,520
that gorgeous-looking guy Fang Leng

544
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,640
is actually fickle in love.

545
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,760
It's my fault.

546
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,360
I shouldn't have told you about my lousy ideas.

547
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,560
Xiaoqi.

548
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,560
I heard that

549
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,920
travel can heal a broken heart.

550
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,240
Where do you want to go?

551
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,560
I'll fund you.

552
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,680
I want to go home.

553
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,920
I can only forget him

554
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,240
by going home.

555
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
I will delete him.

556
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,400
I will get back on my feet.

557
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,960
You're right.

558
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,840
Then tell me,

559
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,080
where is your home?

560
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
I will book airplane tickets for you.

561
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,760
I need Fang Leng to go home.

562
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,200
You want to see him again?

563
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,480
No.

564
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,960
What should I do?

565
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:29,720
I...

566
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,760
Must I make him drunk,

567
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
kidnap him and take him here?

568
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,520
Ms. Chai.

569
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,360
Do you have alcohol in your store?

570
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,320
I mean

571
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
the strong type.

572
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,480
Xiaoqi, what are you doing?

573
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,520
Don't drink.

574
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,800
Take it easy.

575
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,240
I'm not drinking my worries away.

576
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,080
Then what are you doing?

577
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Kubri,

578
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
do you miss home?

579
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,680
Of course, I do.

580
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,400
The tortoise body

581
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,840
feels nice after a while.

582
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
But it's better to live on our home planet.

583
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,200
Alright.

584
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
I will retrieve the annunciator this time

585
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,840
and get us home.

586
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,080
You're going to see Fang Leng again?

587
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,160
You've failed for so many times.

588
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,120
Ms. Chai just told me

589
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,600
habits were hard to change.

590
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,960
Fang Leng

591
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,120
has fallen for me more than once.

592
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,160
I want to make another bet.

593
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,040
On what?

594
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,960
On his love.

595
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Why are you here?

596
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,880
Hi.

597
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,320
Are you going to work?

598
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes.

599
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,080
What do you need?

600
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
Nothing, really.

601
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,880
If you are busy,

602
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,960
I'll get going.

603
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,920
Wait.

604
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,800
Why did you bring wine?

605
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,480
I...

606
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,240
Come in.

607
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,440
You...

608
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,440
You might want to tie that.

609
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,480
Why are you staring at me?

610
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,760
Shouldn't you tie it for me?

611
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,960
Then come closer.

612
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,160
Come closer.

613
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,400
You want to choke me?

614
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,720
Sorry.

615
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,120
I've never tied a tie for a man before.

616
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,800
I...

617
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,760
Sorry.

618
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
You haven't drunk any wine,

619
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,040
but you are blushing already.

620
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,640
I...

621
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,760
Maybe your house has too many plants.

622
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,560
They are taking oxygen away from me.

623
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,120
Just leave it like this.

624
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,200
Well?

625
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,720
Do I look good?

626
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,040
You look handsome.

627
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,040
So handsome that I start to envy Jiang Xue.

628
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,440
Who is more handsome, me or Fang Lie?

629
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,720
You two have different styles.

630
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,760
Can't be compared.

631
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
It's time to taste the wine.

632
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,800
Try it.

633
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,160
Well,

634
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
for the first toast,

635
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I wish you

636
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,640
sweet love.

637
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,840
Enough. Stop acting tough.

638
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm not acting tough.

639
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,080
I can do it.

640
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm not acting tough.

641
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,640
Enough.

642
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,080
It's okay.

643
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,720
Here.

644
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,720
For the second toast,

645
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
I wish you a successful career.

646
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,080
With your low alcohol tolerance,

647
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,720
you should stop drinking.

648
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,440
It's alright.

649
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,360
I'm not acting tough.

650
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm not.

651
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,800
You say I'm drunk?

652
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,880
Look,

653
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,160
I'm

654
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
walking fine.

655
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,680
Look.

656
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,480
I can even control my superpower.

657
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,840
A little wine is nothing.

658
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,920
You know what,

659
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,760
I came here

660
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,120
with a simple purpose.

661
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,840
I want you to fall for me once.

662
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
Just once.

663
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,120
Why?

664
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,520
Because you are Fang Leng.

665
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,800
You are my only hope.

666
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,640
What about Fang Lie?

667
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,520
He...

668
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,520
He means something else to me.

669
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,080
Are you drinking or not?

670
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,440
If I drink,

671
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,960
no one would drive you back.

672
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,040
I...

673
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,400
Why do you

674
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,640
always upset my plan?

675
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,200
Why do you always take advantage of me?

676
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,840
Do you know

677
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,080
how hard I tried

678
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,320
to get ready

679
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,320
to control myself

680
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,840
for this?

681
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,800
You know nothing.

682
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,800
Are you shedding tears for me?

683
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,680
He still remembers me.

684
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
Is it okay for me

685
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,200
to flatter myself by thinking

686
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,440
you once loved me?

687
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
Although humans

688
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,360
can love many people.

689
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,680
Although

690
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm just one of many people you love.

691
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Fang Leng.

692
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,000
Fang Leng.

693
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,680
Fang Leng.

694
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,560
Fang Leng.

695
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,360
Fang Leng, are you okay?

696
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,360
Fang Leng.

697
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,360
Gosh. What happened?

698
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,280
Fang Leng!

699
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,520
Fang Leng!

700
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,720
Fang Leng!

701
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,080
Doctor.

702
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,120
Will anyone come here?

703
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,680
The stretcher. The stretcher.

704
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,480
What's the patient's medical history?

705
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Was he stimulated?

706
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,160
I might have stimulated his heart.

707
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,880
Is he going to be alright?

708
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,080
The patient might need surgery.

709
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Are you his family?

710
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,760
I...

711
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,320
I'm not.

712
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,720
Find his family at once.

713
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,600
Act now or it'll be too late.

714
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:30,960
Yes.

715
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,480
Hurry.

716
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,720
Family.

717
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Where shall I find his family?

718
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,200
Family.

719
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,300
=Xiaoqi=

720
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,800
Xiaoqi?

721
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,760
Hello?

722
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,120
Xiaoqi.

723
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,720
What?

724
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,160
Hello, Dad?

725
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,680
What happened to Fang Leng?

726
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,800
I hurt him by accident.

727
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,360
How dare you bother him?

728
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,880
When will you stop hurting him?

729
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,880
Tell me!

730
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,280
How is Fang Leng?

731
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,840
Is his condition serious?

732
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,640
I'm sorry.

733
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,120
I didn't know he'd be like this.

734
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,880
I'm sorry.

735
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,480
Doctor.

736
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,880
How is Fang Leng?

737
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
We found an unknown shard

738
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,280
near the patient's heart.

739
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,880
Its special location

740
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,920
makes it hard to take out.

741
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,240
Prepare for the worst.

742
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,280
Shida.

743
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,520
Enough. Drop the act.

744
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,720
I knew you aren't nice.

745
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
The money isn't enough to satisfy you.

746
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,560
Well,

747
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,720
you want to kill Fang Leng?

748
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,560
No.

749
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,720
Fang Leng is strong.

750
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,040
Nothing bad will happen to him.

751
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,320
Get out.

752
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,080
From now on,

753
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,680
I forbid you to approach Fang Leng.

754
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,560
Get away!

755
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,000
Get away!

756
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,840
What's the matter?

757
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,440
They said

758
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,400
he could die.

759
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,920
Can you believe it?

760
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,120
I have killed him.

761
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,280
What should I do now?

762
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,280
It can't be.

763
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,120
Explain to me.

764
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,760
What really happened to my brother?

765
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,360
I...

766
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,640
I don't know.

767
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,040
I just wanted to fetch the annunciator.

768
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,120
I didn't plan to hurt him.

769
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,440
But...

770
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
But he suddenly fainted away.

771
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,000
What should I do?

772
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,920
It's okay. Stop crying.

773
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,200
Stop crying.

774
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,760
Look at me.

775
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Look at me.

776
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,840
I promise you

777
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,640
that I won't let my brother die.

778
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,600
I will find the best doctors

779
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,920
and do my best to save him.

780
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,040
It's a promise.

781
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
You hear me?

782
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
I'll save him for you.

783
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,920
Save him.

784
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
Go and help him.

785
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,640
Go.

786
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,280
Go.

787
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,640
Wait for me.

788
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,040
Okay?

789
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,360
What to do?

790
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,360
Lie.

791
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
Why are you pulling me?

792
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,640
How is my brother?

793
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,720
We don't know yet.

794
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,120
Be careful

795
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,040
in front of your father.

796
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,840
Be careful with what?

797
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,240
Fang Leng's condition is critical.

798
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,360
You will be the Fang family's only hope.

799
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,840
Fang's company

800
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,000
will be yours.

801
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
So, be careful

802
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
when you talk to your father.

803
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,560
Make him hand the company

804
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,320
over to you.

805
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,280
Mom.

806
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,040
Please.

807
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,320
Stop thinking about these things.

808
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,160
Lie.

809
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,000
Dad.

810
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,040
Hum.

811
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,960
I just talked to the hospital administration.

812
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,280
They'll send the best specialists here to help my brother.

813
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,280
Don't worry.

814
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,560
Nothing will happen to my brother.

815
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,440
Hum.

816
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Doctor.

817
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,240
How is he?

818
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,040
Mr. Fang

819
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,440
is safe for now.

820
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,560
However,

821
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,520
something feels odd to me.

822
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,040
We'll see whether he can survive after tonight.

823
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,600
What do you mean?

824
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,360
Does Fang Leng have other problems?

825
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,080
Mr. Fang's illness is caused by his car accident.

826
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
If we touch the shard,

827
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,840
his life might be endangered.

828
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,760
We can only stabilize his condition for the time being.

829
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,080
His willpower is the key

830
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,760
to regaining consciousness.

831
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,640
What are you doing?

832
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,880
I'll find her and ask

833
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,040
what she did to Fang Leng.

834
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,840
The doctor just said

835
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,080
my brother's heart problem is caused by the car accident.

836
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,200
What does it have to do with Xiaoqi?

837
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
Do you think she'll hurt my brother?

838
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,800
You are still protecting her.

839
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Are you crazy?

840
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,320
Enough.

841
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
Before Fang Leng wakes up,

842
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,080
we can't draw any conclusion.

843
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,360
Xue.

844
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,480
Your parents are waiting.

845
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,920
Go back and tell them about it.

846
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,840
Don't let them worry.

847
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,120
Yes.

848
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,280
Dad, I will see her off.

849
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,800
How is Fang Leng?

850
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,520
How dare you ask?

851
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,640
If not for you...

852
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,360
It's late.

853
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,240
You should go.

854
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,760
We'll meet again.

855
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,320
How is Fang Leng?

856
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,960
He's been rescued.

857
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:13,920
But

858
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,720
he's not yet out of danger.

859
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
We'll know whether

860
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,200
he can wake up after tonight.

861
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,720
It's my fault.

862
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,800
When my brother had that car accident,

863
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,240
we all knew he was severely injured.

864
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,680
But he acted

865
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,880
like he was alright.

866
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,000
He worked every day.

867
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,120
He was busy.

868
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,320
After a while,

869
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,320
we thought he had recovered.

870
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,360
Now, it turns out

871
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,360
he isn't as strong

872
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,120
as we thought.

873
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,120
I want to save him.

874
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,320
I have done everything I can.

875
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,800
I don't know what else I can do.

876
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,720
No.

877
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,080
I can't watch him die.

878
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,800
I have to save him.

879
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,200
What are you doing?

880
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,480
He got hurt because of me.

881
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,640
The thought of him lying there alone

882
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,560
with no one helping him,

883
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,280
saving him

884
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,400
or keeping him company

885
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,000
weighs on me

886
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,600
like a stone.

887
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,960
Fang Lie.

888
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,600
Can you take me to his ward?

889
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,000
I just want to see him for a moment.

890
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,080
Please.

891
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:21,800
Okay.

892
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:36,800
Lie.

893
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,640
Mom.

894
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:39,880
Dad.

895
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,080
It's very late.

896
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,680
Maybe you should go home.

897
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,600
Send your mother home first.

898
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,960
I know you're worried about my brother.

899
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,120
But what if

900
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,680
you fall ill for staying up?

901
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,480
Once my brother wakes up,

902
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,520
I will notify you.

903
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,520
Alright?

904
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,000
Lie is right.

905
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,600
Now Fang Leng is like this.

906
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,520
If anything happens to you,

907
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,040
the company would descend into chaos.

908
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,880
If you don't think for yourself,

909
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,600
think for the company.

910
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,600
Then, I will leave it to you.

911
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,040
You have grown up.

912
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,320
I can rely

913
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,400
on you now.

914
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,120
Don't worry.

915
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,960
I'll get going then.

916
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,080
Yes. Mom.

917
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,920
Shush.

918
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,000
You promised that

919
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,560
you'd leave after a moment.

920
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,760
Yes, I know.

921
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,120
You only have guilt about my brother.

922
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,600
And you'll give him up

923
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,240
after he wakes up, right?

924
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,560
Right.

925
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,000
When he recovers,

926
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,120
I will stop bothering him.

927
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm sorry.

928
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,320
If I knew you'd be like this,

929
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,960
I'd rather give up the annunciator.

930
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,920
You know what,

931
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,320
when they told me you were going to die,

932
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,960
I finally realized

933
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,520
how important you were.

934
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,000
The thing keeping me here

935
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,080
was not the annunciator,

936
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,440
but you.

937
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,020
Ever since I met you,

938
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,700
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

939
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,100
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

940
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,980
only you.

941
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,180
We're out of reach

942
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,500
but appreciate each other.

943
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:58,300
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

944
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,340
The yearning invades

945
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,900
and lurks in my mind.

946
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:12,460
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

947
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,540
I'm getting addicted to it

948
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,860
and my sense is shielded.

949
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:26,660
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

950
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,820
Put the hottest heart

951
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,140
in this cold body.

952
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,500
I'm looking at you,

953
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,660
and my love has nowhere to go.

954
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,900
Ever since I met you,

955
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,820
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

956
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,100
Every day is a new memory

957
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,140
which is only be about you and me.

958
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,380
I can't lie to myself anymore.

959
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,220
Please give me the courage to believe.

960
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,140
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

961
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,060
only you.

962
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,180
Even everything becomes silent,

963
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,300
I still have you.
