1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 10

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,280
Listen carefully.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,080
From today on,

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,720
I don't allow you to watch him,

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,840
smile at him,

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
or even like him.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,480
You're my girlfriend.

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
You can only watch me.

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,520
Well,

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
I, I'm leaving.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,480
This way.

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,480
Xiaoqi,

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
you're back.

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,240
I miss you so much.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,200
My cash cow is back.

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,160
Tell me.

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
How is it going on with you

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
and Fang Leng?

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,960
How did you know that?

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
You're really falling in love, right?

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
As I guessed it,

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,440
you two would fall in love easily

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,640
when staying alone in a room.

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,600
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,120
What did he

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
do to you?

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,880
Nothing.

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,320
I came back as I wanted to

46
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,600
all of a sudden.

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
It seems that

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
something happened between them.

49
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,200
Just in time.

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
I won't go to the company today.

51
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,520
I'll go to Tropical Restaurant.

52
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Mr. Fang,

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm afraid you'll be delayed.

54
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,800
Miss Jiang said

55
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
she had found the sapphire stealer.

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,120
I was going

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
to the gallery for checking the cause of the fire,

58
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
but unexpectedly,

59
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,840
I just happened to see this video.

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Chai Xiaoqi stole

61
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,040
the sapphire, right?

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,560
Miss Jiang,

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,080
can you keep

64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
these two pieces of videos

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,840
from anyone else?

66
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,040
Why?

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
The evidence is certain.

68
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,000
Will you punish her?

69
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,880
Because this is our company's business,

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,240
I don't want others to know it.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
OK.

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,800
However,

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,880
I want to remind you that

74
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
now that you don't know her background,

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,000
do stay away from her.

76
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,120
Miss Jiang,

77
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,040
this way.

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Sorry.

79
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
That's why you said

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
sorry to me.

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,480
What to do?

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,320
How to face him in the future?

83
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
You didn't take the initiative to kiss him.

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
Don't be afraid.

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Get up now

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,640
and make it clear to him.

87
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
What?

88
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Tell him you're an alien.

89
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,480
You two are different species.

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Tell him to give up.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
I won't.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,040
What's more,

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,720
he might just

94
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,480
kiss me on impulse.

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
No one can tell whether

96
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,040
he really likes me.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,360
Coming.

98
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,800
Why are you here?

99
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,360
I came with a question.

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,080
Do you want to tell me

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
anything about the sapphire?

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
You, you know that.

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
What if I don't know?

104
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
When are you going to tell me?

105
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,680
Yes,

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
I stole it

107
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,400
and lied to you.

108
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,600
So what?

109
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Why?

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,400
Because,

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,960
because I need it.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
What for?

113
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,840
For,

114
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:20,960
for...

115
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,160
For money?

116
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,480
For study?

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,560
Or give it to other companies?

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,640
I can't tell you.

119
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,120
Then I'll ask you in another way.

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,280
When did you start to target at it?

121
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,760
From the day you stole it,

122
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
someday earlier than that

123
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,480
or the moment

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
you agreed to be my girlfriend?

125
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
I really wanted to be your girlfriend.

126
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,880
I don't believe you now,

127
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,280
Xiaoqi.

128
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,280
I told you that

129
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
as long as you told me the truth,

130
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
whatever you did wrong today,

131
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
I would forgive you.

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
But why did you lie to me?

133
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,320
I didn't mean to,

134
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,360
but

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,880
I didn't dare to tell you the truth.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm afraid you know I'm a...

137
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
In this case,

138
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,640
you still try to find an excuse.

139
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,200
What I care about is that

140
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
you never explained it to me

141
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,360
rather than the fact that

142
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,200
you stole the sapphire.

143
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,240
If you really need it,

144
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,560
I can give it to you.

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
No.

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,800
I...

147
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,280
What should I say?

148
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,920
I'm such a fool.

149
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,280
Mr. Fang,

150
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,240
do you know where the sapphire is?

151
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Inform the Scientific Research Department

152
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,920
to discard the sapphire project.

153
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,920
No more investigation.

154
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,680
But...

155
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,440
I help you do what you wanted me to do.

156
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
I think Fang Leng

157
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,880
is criticizing Chai Xiaoqi now.

158
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
You misunderstood.

159
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,320
This time

160
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
you didn't help me,

161
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
but I helped you.

162
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,400
If we can't find the sapphire stealer,

163
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,480
at worst it may cause trouble in my work.

164
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,040
However, she is your rival in love.

165
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm afraid that

166
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,200
not only I, but you also want Chai Xiaoqi to leave.

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,520
Sometimes I'm afraid you may be

168
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,120
victim of your own cleverness.

169
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,120
Don't worry.

170
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,360
As you asked me

171
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,560
to keep an eye on Mr. Fang,

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll help you if you want to take charge

173
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
of the F Groups in the future.

174
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
When you achieve it,

175
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,160
keep your promise and give me

176
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
the research company.

177
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,800
Don't worry.

178
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,600
I'll keep

179
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,520
my word.

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,520
But

181
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,840
I have a question.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll speak without reserve.

183
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Why do you and Fang Leng

184
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,640
care about the sapphire so much?

185
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400
It is a unique stone

186
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,240
in the world.

187
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,880
I mean

188
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,840
Chai Xiaoqi

189
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
didn't steal it for money.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
She could get a lot of money from Mr. Fang,

191
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,480
but she stole it.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Maybe

193
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,440
she knew its value long ago.

194
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,040
An ant

195
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
will never see a gold mine.

196
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
She's out.

197
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Don't waste time on her.

198
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
But I want to find it out.

199
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,760
Don't forget that

200
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
you're under my control.

201
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
Xiaoqi,

202
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,920
you've been sitting all day.

203
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
Say something.

204
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,320
Are you hungry?

205
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,240
Let's go to dinner.

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:06,840
Well,

207
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,200
let's go to a night club.

208
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
You like handsome men best, right?

209
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,720
Kubri,

210
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
do you want to leave here?

211
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,240
I just asked you to go out, right?

212
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,200
Go now.

213
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm starving.

214
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,680
I mean I want to leave the earth.

215
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,960
How I wish I can leave

216
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,560
the earth this very moment!

217
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
If you really want to go,

218
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,440
there is a way.

219
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,160
Really?

220
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,760
Yes.

221
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,640
However,

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,800
if you leave in that way,

223
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,480
you can never come back again.

224
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,000
Kubri,

225
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,400
are you sure

226
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
I can go back

227
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
by jumping down from here?

228
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,640
Yes.

229
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,840
You were created on the home planet

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
so you have the energy from the home planet in your body.

231
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Once you're dead,

232
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,280
the signal may be sent back there

233
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,200
and then they'll

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,560
come to save you.

235
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,400
But if I'm dead,

236
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,520
why will they bother?

237
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
Our home planet is developed.

238
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,040
Maybe you can

239
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
be saved back there.

240
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,880
But what if the signal can't be sent back?

241
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,800
I don't know.

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,720
Anyway, I've searched the system

243
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,320
and found just this way.

244
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,520
No,

245
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,040
try another way so that

246
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't have to risk my life.

247
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,880
Go.

248
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm leaving.

249
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,240
Take care of yourself.

250
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,560
Xiaoqi.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,720
Xiaoqi,

252
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,040
are you still alive?

253
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,960
Wake up, Xiaoqi.

254
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,920
How long will it take to kill myself by hanging myself?

255
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,000
My neck is so sore.

256
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,360
You scared me.

257
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,600
No,

258
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
I have to try another way that will kill me quickly.

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,560
Are you sure I will be electrocuted by this electric voltage?

260
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,600
Trust me.

261
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm sure you'll be killed this time.

262
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,200
Am I killed?

263
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,640
No,

264
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,960
but the whole street is dead.

265
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,520
I'll poison myself

266
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,240
to death.

267
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,360
Well,

268
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,040
do you feel it?

269
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,120
Gosh.

270
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,760
The drugs are so bitter.

271
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,200
I seem to have digested them.

272
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,480
There seems to be only one way.

273
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,440
Xiaoqi,

274
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,120
are you sure to fast to death?

275
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,640
This is the worst way to kill yourself in the universe.

276
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,840
You haven't eaten for days.

277
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,120
I specially asked the cook

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,880
to make delicious steak for you.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
Well, try it.

280
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
Why do you tie yourself up?

281
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,400
Listen.

282
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
No matter what happen,

283
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
your health is your life.

284
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,000
Well,

285
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
try this steak.

286
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,880
It's delicious.

287
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,760
Your favorite.

288
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,000
No.

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,640
I can't.

290
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll never eat anything.

291
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
I can't.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,120
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,920
Hello, Mr. Fang.

294
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,520
Good morning, Mr. Fang.

295
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,680
I see.

296
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,920
Mr. Fang,

297
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,360
boss lady of Tropical Restaurant just called.

298
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
It has nothing to do with me.

299
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,240
Don't mention Chai Xiaoqi to me later.

300
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,280
But boss lady said that

301
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,320
Miss Chai began to fast

302
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,280
after quarreling with you.

303
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
She seems to try to kill herself for love.

304
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,800
Ms. Chai, don't try to break me down.

305
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll never eat.

306
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,000
Xiaoqi, open the door.

307
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
Don't, don't come in.

308
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,320
What are you doing in there?

309
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,080
Open the door.

310
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm busy right now.

311
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,080
Don't come in.

312
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Open the door right now.

313
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,280
Wait a minute.

314
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,600
What are you doing?

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,840
Are you hurt?

316
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm fine. Don't touch me.

317
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,720
Who tied you up?

318
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
I, well.

319
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,680
Don't untie me.

320
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,600
I will starve myself to death.

321
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,320
What else did you do besides that?

322
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
Have you taken any drugs?

323
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Throw up.

324
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,560
What are you doing?

325
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,040
Throw up.

326
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,160
Throw up now.

327
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,480
Did you throw up?

328
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,600
Xiaoqi.

329
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,440
Leave me alone.

330
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,040
My life

331
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,080
has nothing to do with you.

332
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,040
I just don't like seeing anyone dying before me.

333
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,920
I do that for my own purpose.

334
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,280
It's none of your business.

335
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,320
OK.

336
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,840
It's your business

337
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,480
how you will kill yourself.

338
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
But don't forget that

339
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,000
you are my subordinate now.

340
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,560
Before you kill yourself,

341
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,640
go to the company and resign.

342
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,480
Then you can do whatever you want.

343
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,480
And

344
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,520
kill yourself somewhere I can't see.

345
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,720
Never let me know it.

346
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,120
I don't want to waste time on you.

347
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
OK.

348
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,520
Lie,

349
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,120
finally you'll go to work.

350
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,440
I won't go easily.

351
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,400
It's all conditional.

352
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,400
OK.

353
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,040
As long as you go to work,

354
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,400
I'll promise you anything.

355
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,920
OK.

356
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,880
From today on,

357
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,240
don't interfere in

358
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,720
anything related to Leng

359
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,320
nor try to hurt him

360
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,280
and those around him.

361
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,280
You are threatening me.

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,240
I have nothing.

363
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,280
Set another fire as you like.

364
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Mind your words.

365
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,520
Don't forget that

366
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm your own mother.

367
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
That's why

368
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,200
I cover up for you.

369
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,880
No matter what you do,

370
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
I can forgive you.

371
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,440
But I'll never allow you to hurt

372
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
those I care about.

373
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm begging you,

374
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,040
mom.

375
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,320
OK,

376
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,560
I promise.

377
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,960
The chairman specially assigned

378
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,360
you the development director

379
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
of the new project.

380
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,160
You can give full play to your artistic talent

381
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,440
and take charge of

382
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,400
the project development aiming at women,

383
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,280
which is the focus in the company's future development.

384
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,920
You can arrange it.

385
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,680
I don't care.

386
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,200
These are the subordinates in your department.

387
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,360
Director Fang.

388
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,320
I have no interest.

389
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,240
Deal with them for me.

390
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,240
Where is Leng?

391
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
He is tied up now.

392
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
He'll see you later.

393
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,120
No need.

394
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,240
I'll go to him.

395
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,600
Leave me alone.

396
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,320
This is my letter of resignation.

397
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,200
All right now?

398
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,760
Your letter of resignation is rejected.

399
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,560
Why?

400
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,280
You don't want to see me, right?

401
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,760
You may not know.

402
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,440
When you joined the company,

403
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,680
you signed a five-year contract,

404
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,000
a competition agreement and a confidentiality agreement.

405
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,760
If you really want to leave,

406
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
you have to pay hundreds of thousands of damages

407
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,560
and will be charged.

408
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,200
Do you still insist on resigning?

409
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,840
Nonsense.

410
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,680
I didn't sign any contract with you.

411
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,720
OK.

412
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,120
I'll pay with my life.

413
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,080
Come on.

414
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,160
If I remember correctly,

415
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,640
you are the assistant manager of Tropical Restaurant.

416
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,520
Boss lady said

417
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
she gave you the shares.

418
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,240
How about paying

419
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,440
with your restaurant?

420
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,240
I agree on that.

421
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
You are so mean.

422
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,880
Just

423
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,440
target at me.

424
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,560
Don't get Ms. Chai involved.

425
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't hurt the restaurant and her.

426
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,120
From now on,

427
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,920
you have 24 hours to think about it.

428
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,320
Which one will you choose,

429
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,680
coming to work

430
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
or being charged together with the restaurant?

431
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,240
Is there anything else?

432
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,760
No.

433
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,560
Mr. Fang,

434
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,040
it's so cruel of you to cheat a law-ignorant

435
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,640
with a bunch of fake contracts.

436
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Wait and see.

437
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,240
She'll come to work obediently tomorrow.

438
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,920
Fang Lie,

439
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,040
why are you here

440
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,600
wearing a suit?

441
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
Let me introduce myself.

442
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm Fang lie, the new director of

443
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,160
the Project Development Department.

444
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,560
You'll work here.

445
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,160
Well,

446
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,920
do I look like Leng,

447
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,720
a business elite?

448
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,480
Come on.

449
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
He is a dressed-up beast.

450
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, forget him.

451
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,640
Go with me.

452
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,760
Where?

453
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,040
Thank you.

454
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,560
What a coincidence!

455
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
I met you as soon as

456
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,040
I joined the company.

457
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,720
Yes.

458
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,480
I didn't expect that

459
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,480
we are colleagues.

460
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,400
No.

461
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,920
We were colleagues.

462
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,640
What do you mean?

463
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
I gave Fang Leng my letter of resignation.

464
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,920
You've resigned.

465
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,200
Why?

466
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,280
Anything goes wrong between you two?

467
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,840
Besides,

468
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,160
I'm finished with him.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,920
I knew it.

470
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
Happy beginnings and sad endings always

471
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,120
come to him and those he's dated.

472
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
He's dumped them.

473
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
I didn't expect that you're no exception.

474
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,240
No.

475
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,240
He doesn't allow me to resign now.

476
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,160
I have to compensate to resign.

477
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,920
He even wants to squeeze you after breaking up.

478
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,760
He is going too far.

479
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,560
Tell me what to do now.

480
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
If I still work here,

481
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,680
I have to see him.

482
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,120
If I leave.

483
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,320
I have no money to compensate.

484
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I'll never pay with the restaurant.

485
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,520
In fact,

486
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,600
Leng

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
isn't nasty.

488
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
He is

489
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
somewhat stubborn.

490
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,360
No one can stop him

491
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
if he makes up his mind

492
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,560
to do something,

493
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,200
especially his ex-girlfriends.

494
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
I've seen him

495
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,320
breaking up with a dozen girlfriends.

496
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,440
Will he

497
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,080
do the same to me?

498
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Well,

499
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,240
don't leave.

500
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,280
I'll try to

501
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,040
transfer you to my department.

502
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,880
OK?

503
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,400
Let me think about it.

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,080
I believe that

505
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,040
as a little devil in the universe,

506
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,400
I'll defeat him.

507
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,680
No,

508
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,560
I can't compromise with him.

509
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,880
How about Ms. Chai?

510
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,400
What are you doing?

511
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,520
Go upstairs.

512
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,160
Don't order me.

513
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,080
If you want the whole company

514
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,960
to see me holding your hand to work,

515
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,000
you can try.

516
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,360
What are you doing?

517
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,040
Let go. Let go.

518
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,200
I'll go myself.

519
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,800
Follow me.

520
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,440
According to the chairman's arrangement,

521
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
Fang Lie entered successfully yesterday.

522
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,160
He wanted to see you yesterday.

523
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,320
However, you were too busy,

524
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,560
so I told him to go first.

525
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,120
Tell him no need to meet.

526
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,840
Are you

527
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,640
blaming him for giving up painting?

528
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,880
Whatever he chooses,

529
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
he made the decision by himself.

530
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,480
I won't interfere with him as much as I used to.

531
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,680
But now that he chose it,

532
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,080
he had to learn to rely on himself.

533
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:54,960
Tell him

534
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,720
to work hard.

535
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,520
I will keep an eye on him as boss.

536
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,760
I get it.

537
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,080
I don't believe that

538
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,920
you won't fire me.

539
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,800
Here you are.

540
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,000
You're so rude.

541
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,720
That's me.

542
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,840
If you don't like it, fire me.

543
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,120
Great.

544
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,200
I like employees with ideas.

545
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
When I'm done with the papers,

546
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,880
send them for me.

547
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,640
Haven't you finished yet?

548
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,280
Yes.

549
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,920
You should have told me.

550
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Send it for me.

551
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,200
And

552
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,080
Send this to those on the 60th floor.

553
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,880
And

554
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,720
return this pen to the security guard

555
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,440
from whom

556
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,200
I borrowed on the 1st floor.

557
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,120
OK.

558
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,320
After that,

559
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,280
make a cup of tea for me.

560
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Here you are.

561
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,640
Shine the shoes.

562
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,280
Why?

563
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,400
Do it yourself.

564
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Because I'm your boss,

565
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,480
so I can order you as I like.

566
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,680
Come on.

567
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,080
OK.

568
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,480
After that,

569
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,160
go to my house

570
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,480
and bring me a new suit.

571
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,280
I need to change.

572
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
You are

573
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
torturing me on purpose, right?

574
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,280
As you go against me,

575
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,040
think about the consequences.

576
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,200
If you want to kill yourself,

577
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
I won't let it happen.

578
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,400
If you want to escape,

579
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,240
I'll keep you too busy to do that.

580
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,720
If you make a face about me,

581
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,960
I think you'll

582
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,680
suffer more than I do.

583
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
You're mean.

584
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Copy the Articles of Association for 10 times,

585
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,120
so you'll know

586
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,560
how to be obedient to me.

587
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Shameless.

588
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,080
After that,

589
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,600
go downstairs and go to

590
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,480
the hospital with me by my car.

591
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,640
Well, what?

592
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,320
If you want to talk back,

593
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,320
I can make you work until midnight.

594
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,640
Do you want to try?

595
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,200
Anything else?

596
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,240
No.

597
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,160
Lunatic.

598
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,880
No wonder you have to meet the doctor.

599
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
What did you just say?

600
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,280
Have a good rest.

601
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,960
Get in.

602
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,680
Well, wait.

603
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,320
Tell me clearly

604
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
why you want me to meet the doctor.

605
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,040
Do you try to torture me again?

606
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,680
Keep what happened

607
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,000
between us

608
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,360
in your mind.

609
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,840
You helped to cheat my dad by pretending to be sick.

610
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,160
Certainly we have to continue it.

611
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,280
Do you want to be seen through by my family?

612
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,160
I see.

613
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,280
You go to the doctor under my guise.

614
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,240
Don't worry.

615
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
Certainly I'll help.

616
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,440
None of your family will find it.

617
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,960
Yes.

618
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,600
I forget that

619
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,520
you're really good at cheating.

620
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:56,840
You.

621
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,840
I won't be fuss about with a patient.

622
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,600
I, I,

623
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,040
I don't mean it.

624
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,600
If you don't want to get close to me,

625
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,240
stay away from me at the beginning,

626
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
let alone make me misunderstand.

627
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,840
Get it?

628
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,880
Stingy.

629
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,760
But next time,

630
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,680
I'll take it that you act purposely.

631
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
Not everyone is going to like you.

632
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Stingy.

633
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,400
Then why did you try to kill yourself for me?

634
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,680
Mr. Fang,

635
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,080
we'll be in the hospital soon.

636
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,320
As we get out of the car later,

637
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,800
don't stare at me.

638
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,800
Don't talk back.

639
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,120
Stay by my side

640
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,720
as if you're my girlfriend.

641
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,680
Understand?

642
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,240
Yes.

643
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,360
Well.

644
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,840
What's wrong with you?

645
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Please don't ask.

646
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,840
I,

647
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,000
I

648
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,120
have to know what happened.

649
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,280
I have to know what happened.

650
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,560
You got along well before, right?

651
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,520
What happened?

652
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
You're here for a treatment.

653
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,680
Either of you should answer me.

654
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,120
Anyway, I'm the attending doctor.

655
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,280
OK. OK.

656
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,560
I won't force you.

657
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,400
I'll prepare

658
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
a psychological test for you later.

659
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,880
If the test result is wrong,

660
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,440
it means that the direction of my previous guidance is wrong,

661
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,040
so you won't have to

662
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
embarrass each other.

663
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,600
I'll look for a cure

664
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,760
in another direction.

665
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,880
Fang Leng,

666
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,720
go to prepare

667
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,120
for it with me.

668
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,000
Go. Go.

669
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,000
Let's go.

670
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,720
What do you want to do?

671
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,560
Certainly

672
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm helping you.

673
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,480
What happened between you two?

674
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,920
You shouldn't be here now.

675
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,800
You should go shopping with her

676
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,920
and make her happy.

677
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,040
Do you think

678
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,200
I will do that?

679
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,560
So no one can help you.

680
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,800
Well,

681
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,280
I'll fix it up later

682
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,160
in the test.

683
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,400
Take chance.

684
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,520
I'm trying my best to help you.

685
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,480
No need.

686
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,120
Because of this disease,

687
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,280
I've lied to too many women.

688
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,000
I don't want to

689
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
do that to her in the end.

690
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,120
No.

691
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,160
Before the formal test begins,

692
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,080
I have to emphasize it.

693
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,440
The result of this test

694
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,600
is directly related to

695
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,560
the treatment direction of Mr. Fang Leng,

696
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,520
so please answer

697
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,600
the questions

698
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,120
carefully and seriously.

699
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,920
Don't peek at the other's answers

700
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,600
or avoid answering any questions,

701
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,600
OK?

702
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,680
Let's begin.

703
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,840
The first question.

704
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,080
What did you think about each other

705
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,240
when you first met?

706
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,080
Please answer the question.

707
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,680
Have you finished?

708
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,560
Please show me the answers.

709
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,180
=Unscrupulous merchant=

710
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,580
=Anthomaniac=

711
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,360
Well,

712
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,720
it seems that you seriously misunderstood

713
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,920
each other when you first met.

714
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,680
Never mind.

715
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,200
It's fate.

716
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,200
You're fated.

717
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,280
It wasn't a misunderstanding,

718
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,280
but a fact.

719
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,280
What's more,

720
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
it's the truth.

721
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,360
He has trapped me

722
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,680
since I joined the company.

723
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
How unscrupulous!

724
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,800
You make me do that.

725
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
I don't want

726
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,040
other promising young men be disturbed by you.

727
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,160
I'll just attracted by handsome men.

728
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,480
I'm completely immune to

729
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,760
the ordinary ones.

730
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,680
Sit down.

731
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,600
I told you to

732
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,320
cooperate with me, right?

733
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Sit down.

734
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,760
OK.

735
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,040
That's the first question.

736
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,440
Let's think about

737
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,560
something good now.

738
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Where

739
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,320
did you kiss

740
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,840
for the first time?

741
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,960
From today on,

742
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,880
I don't allow you to watch him,

743
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,640
smile at him,

744
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,680
or even like him.

745
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
You're my girlfriend.

746
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,960
You can only watch me.

747
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,840
Miss Chai,

748
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
I should remind you that

749
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,120
longtime thinking

750
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,160
may affect the accuracy.

751
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,080
OK.

752
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,480
And then

753
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
it's time to witness miracles.

754
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,640
Please show me the answers.

755
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,500
=Fang Leng's home=

756
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,020
=Storehouse=

757
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,240
Well.

758
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,400
What's going on?

759
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,760
Fang Leng,

760
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,200
do you make a mistake?

761
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,280
It's important.

762
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,240
Correct the answer.

763
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,080
I remember it clearly.

764
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,280
Don't go to the hospital, OK?

765
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,440
Just hold me like this.

766
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,200
How, how

767
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,160
shameless you are!

768
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,640
Tell me.

769
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,000
What did you do to me that day?

770
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What?

771
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:47,960
Miss Chai,

772
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,560
calm down.

773
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,800
Fang Leng

774
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
has a poor memory,

775
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,960
so he may make a mistake.

776
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,160
No.

777
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,960
She can't remember it.

778
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,560
She fainted with cold that day.

779
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,040
So you did something when I fainted.

780
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,160
I didn't.

781
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,360
You took the initiative.

782
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,240
I was too confused

783
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,840
to control myself that day.

784
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,400
Well,

785
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,680
besides kissing you,

786
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,000
did I do anything else to you?

787
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,240
I wouldn't let you do anything else.

788
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,120
It's hard to tell.

789
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,600
Stop.

790
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,400
So something

791
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,360
indescribable

792
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,080
but romantic

793
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,760
happened between you.

794
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,960
In this case,

795
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
you mean a lot to Fang Leng.

796
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,840
Miss Chai,

797
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,920
would you like to let go of the conflict,

798
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,680
accompany him

799
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,200
and heal him?

800
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,920
No.

801
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,120
I don't think he's a patient.

802
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,680
See you.

803
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,240
There are still questions.

804
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,120
Xiaoqi.

805
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,080
Assistant Han,

806
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,840
what's up?

807
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,400
Mr. Fang asked me to send you back.

808
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,840
No need.

809
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,080
It's more convenient by walking.

810
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,560
Don't stand on ceremony.

811
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,200
Thank you very much on behalf of Mr. Fang.

812
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,280
Why?

813
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,280
You came with Mr. Fang today.

814
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
He actually always

815
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,120
cares about you.

816
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,680
When there was a fire,

817
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,320
he rushed to save you no matter how dangerous it was.

818
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,600
Luckily, the fire was not big.

819
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,680
Otherwise,

820
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
we can't imagine what would have happened.

821
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,360
He attaches great importance to the company.

822
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,520
But some time ago,

823
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,120
he worked at home

824
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,800
to take better care of you.

825
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,320
He did that for the first time

826
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,000
in so many years.

827
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,080
He is changed now.

828
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,840
Really?

829
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,080
What are the changes?

830
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,800
Xiaoqi,

831
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,840
no matter what happens between you and him in the future,

832
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
you should never hurt him.

833
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,240
But I didn't.

834
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,920
Instead,

835
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,400
he always bullies me in the company.

836
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,800
By the way,

837
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,200
I saw a patient talking to a rabbit

838
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,320
when I came out of the clinic.

839
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,360
I scan him,

840
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,680
but he is alright.

841
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,600
Why does he do that?

842
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
You may not know.

843
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,400
Most of patients here,

844
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
have mental diseases.

845
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,640
Though they look normal,

846
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,600
they may be

847
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,560
too seriously ill

848
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,480
to take care of themselves.

849
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,800
Well,

850
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,240
will that happen to Fang Leng?

851
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,680
He is not so seriously ill,

852
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,680
but

853
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,000
his psychological problems

854
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,520
may be worse than that

855
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,680
of the patient.

856
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,400
The doctor said

857
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
if it wasn't cured as soon as possible,

858
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,160
things would

859
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,800
probably get worse later.

860
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,240
What are you doing back here?

861
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
It's me.

862
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,760
Miss Chai.

863
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,520
So I wonder

864
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,240
if things get worse with Fang Leng,

865
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,080
what he will like.

866
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,960
It seems that you're concerned

867
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,840
about him more than what we think.

868
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
No.

869
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,000
I'm just afraid that he can't take care of himself in the future.

870
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
He'll get too much dignity

871
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,840
to ask others for help in the future.

872
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,520
In fact,

873
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,200
the biggest problem with Fang Leng is that

874
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,400
he can't love.

875
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,520
He can't establish a close relationship with others.

876
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,480
Out of self preservation,

877
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,400
he would escape any deep feelings.

878
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,200
The inner world of human beings is so complicated.

879
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,480
Can he be cured?

880
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,040
Yes.

881
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,800
You know, he's hurt in feelings,

882
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,600
so you should heal him in feelings.

883
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,720
Make him open himself up in his feelings

884
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,560
to gain the sense of security.

885
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,920
How to make him

886
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,000
open himself up?

887
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,400
That is,

888
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,960
make him feel that he is excellent,

889
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,760
and worthy of being loved

890
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,600
and improve his self-esteem.

891
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,080
What?

892
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
In short,

893
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,000
praise him.

894
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,880
Praise him?

895
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,640
Yes,

896
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,680
praise him a lot.

897
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,360
Praise him.

898
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,800
Well.

899
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,120
Praise him a lot.

900
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,480
Stay in contact,

901
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,440
so I can send you

902
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
some information on psychotherapy.

903
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,640
OK. OK.

904
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,880
Praise him.

905
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,080
Praise him.

906
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,280
It smells so good.

907
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,920
What are you doing?

908
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,080
Well.

909
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,360
Do you smell anything?

910
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,320
Do you smell any fragrance?

911
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,680
These is the smell of salvia japonica,

912
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,680
which is of great help to our mind.

913
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,200
I mean,

914
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,200
relieving working pressure.

915
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,680
Learn a lesson from the last fire.

916
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,360
Put it out.

917
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,640
What?

918
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,520
He is really inconsistent.

919
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,640
Well, by the way,

920
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,080
what else did Doctor Zhang say?

921
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Make him feel good about himself.

922
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,000
Praise him.

923
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,960
Yes.

924
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,880
Praise him.

925
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,360
Praise him a lot.

926
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,760
You had so many meetings today.

927
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,600
How amazing you are!

928
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
I can't see the point.

929
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,920
Certainly you're amazing.

930
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,440
All of us heard it

931
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,880
when you instructed in the meetings.

932
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,000
You have a loud voice.

933
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,840
You're great.

934
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,160
If there is nothing to do, get out now.

935
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,880
Don't bother me.

936
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,720
Wait.

937
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,880
I have something to do.

938
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,120
Well,

939
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,520
I've been recommended

940
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,480
this aromatherapy for psychological trauma

941
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,120
and have learned the skill.

942
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,360
Do you want to try?

943
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,400
Who suffers psychological trauma?

944
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,600
Me.

945
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,560
I had

946
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,720
psychological trauma

947
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,040
after the big fire.

948
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,560
Just do me a favor

949
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,200
and try it.

950
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,640
It's very comfortable.

951
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,360
Come on.

952
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,160
Go over there.

953
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,680
Right.

954
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,160
Sit down.

955
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,400
Sit down.

956
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Sit down.

957
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,140
=Doctor Zhang=

958
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,920
Close your eyes.

959
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,200
Close your eyes.

960
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,400
Well,

961
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,200
adjust your breath.

962
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,080
Make yourself relax.

963
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,560
Relax after a day of exhausting work.

964
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,360
With the music,

965
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,760
feel the cells

966
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,600
in your body.

967
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,680
They are dancing and flying.

968
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,960
Open yourself up

969
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,800
gradually.

970
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,000
Relax.

971
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Well,

972
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,540
do you feel that you're opening yourself up?

973
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,860
Ever since I met you,

974
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,540
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

975
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,940
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

976
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,820
only you.

977
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,020
We're out of reach

978
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,340
but appreciate each other.

979
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:01,140
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

980
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,180
The yearning invades

981
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,740
and lurks in my mind.

982
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:15,300
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

983
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,380
I'm getting addicted to it

984
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,700
and my sense is shielded.

985
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,500
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

986
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,660
Put the hottest heart

987
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,980
in this cold body.

988
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,340
I'm looking at you,

989
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,500
and my love has nowhere to go.

990
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,740
Ever since I met you,

991
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,660
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

992
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,940
Every day is a new memory

993
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,980
which is only be about you and me.

994
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,220
I can't lie to myself anymore.

995
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,060
Please give me the courage to believe.

996
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,980
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

997
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,900
only you.

998
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,020
Even everything becomes silent,

999
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,140
I still have you.
