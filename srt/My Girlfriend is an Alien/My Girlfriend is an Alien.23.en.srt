1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 23

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Why are you here?

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,960
I was just passing by.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,400
So I came to pay you a visit.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,880
Do you have time?

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,000
Have you been very busy recently?

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
I have called you, but nobody answered.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,120
I have been a bit busy for real.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,560
However,

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
you are not here to see me, right?

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,960
Fang Leng.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,000
How has he been lately?

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,080
Not very good.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,160
Recently, his amnesia has become hot news.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
It has been quite a few days since I met him last time.

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,560
What is going on with him?

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
He is just busy.

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,080
He is facing lots of internal and external troubles.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
They are still giving him a headache.

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,320
Since you are worried about him,

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
why don't you go see him directly?

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,760
When I am supposed to see him,

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,520
I will go to see him naturally.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,040
Nonetheless,

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,200
now, he must

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,720
stay with Chai Xiaoqi all the time.

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,200
He and Xiaoqi are not in a relation expected by you.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,000
I can see that

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,520
you care about Xiaoqi more than him.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
After all, your elder brother can forget a person any time.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
By then, Xiaoqi will be hurt by him again.

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,120
You may be the man suiting her best.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
What are you implying?

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
Are you trying to make me

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,120
chase Xiaoqi and win her heart?

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
Thus, my elder brother will be yours.

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,160
If you comprehend it in this way, it will be fine.

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
At least, I have made efforts to chase Fang Leng.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,560
How about you?

57
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,160
Have you ever tried your best to win Xiaoqi's heart?

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,560
Your bag.

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,400
Your...

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,480
Mr. Fang, your...

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Assistant Han.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Go up first.

63
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,440
OK.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
This is the bag Fang Leng left in my house.

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,680
Could you please hand it to him for me?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Well,

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
you'd better hand it to him by yourself.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,080
Why?

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,800
Because

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,200
he has been in a bad mood these days.

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
If I go to see him,

72
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,320
I am afraid that he would let it out on me.

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
Therefore, it will be better if you go by yourself.

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,680
What, what is wrong with him?

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,200
Did anything happen to him?

76
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,320
I will be honest with you.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,720
Mr. Fang has been having a hard time these days.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Now,

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
he must come up with

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
a method that can satisfy everyone,

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,400
otherwise...

82
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Otherwise, what?

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,920
Anyway, stop asking me more.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,960
I can't tell you.

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
Even if I want to tell you,

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,400
I can't.

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,960
Right?

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,000
Now I have

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,120
a very important thing to do.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,440
Just go to see him by yourself.

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Han...

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,760
Come in!

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Here are the clothes left at my home by you.

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
I brought them to you.

95
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,440
Thank you!

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,560
I have been too busy.

97
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
I didn't go back home and didn't call you, either.

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,480
Have you waited for me?

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,040
No, I haven't.

100
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,160
I,

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,280
I mean that

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,200
I have been eating well,

103
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
sleeping well

104
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,000
and been very comfortable.

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,280
I didn't worry about you at all.

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,520
Glad to hear that.

107
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,600
Then I am off.

108
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,760
Wait up!

109
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,240
What is it?

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,120
I want to ask you one question.

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,520
What question?

112
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
If I am not the president of this company,

113
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,240
how will you act?

114
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
But you are.

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,880
Why do you make such an assumption?

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,760
But if I were not,

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
would you feel disappointed?

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:58,960
Yes.

119
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Why?

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Because you will be of no use for me.

121
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Think about it.

122
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
I work in this company

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
and make so much money

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,400
just because you are the boss here.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,880
If you resign,

126
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
how can I resort to your power for my own benefits?

127
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
Thinking about it, I feel disappointed.

128
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
OK. You can leave now.

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Bye-bye.

130
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
Resort to my power for her benefits?

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,520
Can she use the idiom properly?

132
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,400
Would he really resign from the company?

133
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,440
Fang Lie!

134
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,080
Just ask them

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
to deliver the documents.

136
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,640
OK.

137
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,400
What is the matter?

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,960
I am sorry.

139
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
I think you only play games in the company.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I walked in without permission.

141
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,480
What do you mean?

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,320
Why do you think I only play games in the company?

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
It is true I am only good at playing games.

144
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
However, I am a different person now.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,360
I will assume the responsibility of revitalizing the company.

146
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,360
What do you think of it?

147
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,280
Do you think I become a bit more handsome?

148
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,080
Why have you come to see me?

149
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,880
Well, right.

150
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
I want to ask you

151
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,520
whether you have heard any news or gossips

152
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,720
about Fang Leng in the company recently?

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,560
For example, he would resign and things alike.

154
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,080
Why?

155
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,120
Are you worrying that my elder brother will resign?

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,880
Since his amnesia got exposed,

157
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,840
there have been no reactions in the company.

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
I always feel that something is wrong.

159
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,320
How about

160
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,360
I take the place of my elder brother?

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,880
What do you mean?

162
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,760
My elder brother has been ill in the first place.

163
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
If he continues to stay in the company,

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,320
his illness will get worse and worse.

165
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,920
If I take his place,

166
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,160
he will set his mind at ease and rest for recuperation.

167
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,840
We will make joint efforts,

168
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,560
set up our business jointly

169
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,240
and become rich overnight.

170
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,160
How do you like my idea?

171
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,400
I promise you that

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
I will certainly do better than my elder brother.

173
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:09,840
How about it?

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,520
Will you think about it?

175
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,760
Will you throw yourself into my arms?

176
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
In such a moment,

177
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,360
how can you be in the mood for joking?

178
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,040
I am leaving.

179
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
If I am not joking...

180
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,480
It seems that I can't rely on Fang Lie.

181
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Assistant Han said the right thing.

182
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,040
If Fang Leng wants to solve the problem,

183
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,480
he must find a solution

184
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,960
that can satisfy everyone.

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,600
The ways to remain in the company.

186
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
Hello, boss lady.

187
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,120
Hello, who are you?

188
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,120
I am the worker of Youneng Cleaning Company.

189
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,200
You have booked the cockroach eradication

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,520
and sterilization service with our company.

191
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,640
I am here to give service to you.

192
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,160
I did book the service.

193
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
But you should come the day after tomorrow as scheduled.

194
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,640
Why did you come ahead of time?

195
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
Customers come first.

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
How could we keep you waiting?

197
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,640
Owner, I want to order the food.

198
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,800
OK. I'm coming.

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
I am kind of busy now.

200
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,680
Go to the kitchen first.

201
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,120
Let go of me, evil earthling!

202
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,160
You are back?

203
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,720
What is the matter with you?

204
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
I have been trying to figure out a way the whole day.

205
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,080
I am so tired.

206
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,360
Have you had your meal?

207
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Shall I order the cook to cook you some food?

208
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
I am not hungry. I will go upstairs first.

209
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
What is going on with her?

210
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,240
Ms. Chai! Ms. Chai!

211
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,960
Ms. Chai!

212
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
What are you doing?

213
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,040
Are you trying to raise the roof of my house?

214
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,840
Why are you making the jingle-jangle sound?

215
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,600
Ms. Chai,

216
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,880
have you seen my turtle?

217
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
Isn't it in your room?

218
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,640
No, it isn't.

219
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,680
I have searched my room.

220
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,400
Might it have escaped?

221
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,120
How far can a turtle go?

222
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,240
It is hard to say.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
You see, here are people coming and going every day.

224
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,720
Could it be possible that

225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
some diner has got to like it

226
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,680
and has taken it away?

227
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
It is impossible.

228
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
With me being here,

229
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
within an area covering 20 square miles,

230
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,520
people can leave things here,

231
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
but they can't take anything away.

232
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,280
Do you understand?

233
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
I am too tired today.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,880
Search for it carefully.

235
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,720
I am leaving.

236
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,480
Kubri.

237
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Kubri,

238
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,600
where have you gone?

239
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:43,920
Hello!

240
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,280
Hello, Fang Lie!

241
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,120
Are you off work?

242
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Of course not.

243
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,600
Haven't I told you that

244
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,760
I must work hard?

245
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,920
Please go to my working desk to have a check quickly.

246
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,360
I seem to have left my turtle there.

247
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
Oh, please wait a moment.

248
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,540
=Fang Leng=

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,840
Did you find it?

250
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,080
No, I didn't.

251
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:21,800
OK.

252
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,520
I must hang up.

253
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,120
I must continue looking for Kubri.

254
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,760
Where have you gone?

255
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Kubri!

256
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,240
Kubri!

257
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Kubri!

258
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,120
Kubri!

259
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,360
Kubri!

260
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,800
Kubri!

261
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,680
Kubri!

262
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,880
Where have you gone?

263
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,320
Xiaoqi!

264
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,480
You are here?

265
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,880
How is it now?

266
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,560
Did you find it?

267
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,360
No, I didn't.

268
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,720
I have searched up and down in the restaurant

269
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,800
and searched every corner of it,

270
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,880
but I couldn't find it.

271
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't worry!

272
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,560
I will search for it with you.

273
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,560
However,

274
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
where should we search?

275
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,320
Let's go over there.

276
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You go this way and I will go there.

277
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,200
Kubri!

278
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,000
Kubri!

279
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,360
Kubri!

280
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,240
Kubri!

281
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
My legs

282
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,520
got so tired.

283
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,080
Are you tired?

284
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,720
Surely I am.

285
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
What sound is that?

286
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,200
Let's go check it out.

287
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,920
Kubri!

288
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,280
Kubri!

289
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,200
Kubri!

290
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,920
Kubri!

291
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,000
Kubri!

292
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,160
Kubri!

293
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,040
It is a rat!

294
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,280
It is a rat!

295
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,760
It is a rat!

296
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Aren't you afraid?

297
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,360
It is such a lovely animal.

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,440
You are

299
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,000
a big man.

300
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Why are you afraid of it?

301
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,760
I am not afraid of it.

302
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
I just dislike it because it's too dirty.

303
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,720
It is too dirty.

304
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,280
Oh, so that's it.

305
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Here comes the rat!

306
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
It has been a long time since I saw you laughing like this.

307
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,320
Yes.

308
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,880
We have searched all places around here.

309
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,680
It is late.

310
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,520
You'd better go back.

311
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,040
It's all right.

312
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,640
I can look for it all night long with you.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
I mean that

314
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,720
as long as you want to continue looking for it,

315
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
I can accompany you

316
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
no matter how long it takes.

317
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,920
Don't bother.

318
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
We need not search farther,

319
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,520
for it is impossible for Kubri to go there.

320
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,640
Go back first.

321
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,640
I will watch the monitoring here tomorrow.

322
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,560
I should be able to find it.

323
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,920
Go back now.

324
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:11,920
I am off.

325
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,320
Please ask for my help next time, will you?

326
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,680
I am saying that

327
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
if you come across any difficulty next time,

328
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,800
you should not only think of turning to my elder brother

329
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
but also turning to me for help.

330
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,240
Fang Lie, I...

331
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
If you can't help thinking of him,

332
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,720
then

333
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,960
you can think of him three times

334
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,280
as long as you think of me once.

335
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,640
Or

336
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,120
you can think of him ten times

337
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,600
as long as you think of me once.

338
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,760
I will be satisfied only if I can have
one tenth as much of you as him.

339
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,520
I am leaving.

340
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
I am sorry, Fang Lie.

341
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,680
Ms. Chai,

342
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
you need not prepare my breakfast.

343
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,160
I will go out to look for Kubri.

344
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,160
Hello,

345
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,520
Miss Chai!

346
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,400
I guess you are anxious to find your pet, right?

347
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
How do you know?

348
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,080
Who are you?

349
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,960
Good morning, Leng!

350
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,840
So tired.

351
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:56,960
What happened?

352
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Last night, you worked overtime?

353
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
So you want to claim the credit in front of me.

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,160
Am I a person who works overtime?

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,440
Last night, I was with Xiaoqi.

356
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
I didn't come back until midnight.

357
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,480
Here is the lift. Let's take it.

358
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,760
What did you do together last night?

359
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,640
Last night, Xiaoqi lost her pet.

360
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
She called me first.

361
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,160
She thought of me first.

362
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,720
Leng,

363
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,960
what does this mean in your opinion?

364
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
This suggests that she is dependent on me.

365
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,400
She depends on me more than on you.

366
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,920
Has the pet been found?

367
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,320
Shouldn't you ask me about the progress of our relation?

368
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,840
Can't you see me as your rival in love?

369
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,400
If you don't answer,

370
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,440
I myself will go ask her.

371
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,440
Don't do that.

372
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,520
She hasn't found her turtle.

373
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,800
Don't go disturb her.

374
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,280
Well.

375
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Are you afraid that we will make progress in our relation?

376
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,000
How could it be possible?

377
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I am considering that you have been very busy recently.

378
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
You shouldn't be troubled by such a small matter.

379
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,160
Ah?

380
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,320
Elder brother,

381
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,120
here is your floor.

382
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,720
Bye-bye!

383
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,820
=Xiaoqi=

384
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,680
A colleague said he had found my pet.

385
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,200
Now I am in the Scientific Research Department.

386
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,520
I gotta go now.

387
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:27,960
Bye bye!

388
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,920
Is anyone here?

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,400
Anyone here?

390
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,920
Miss Chai.

391
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,640
Who are you?

392
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,440
It doesn't matter who I am.

393
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
What matters is

394
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,920
who you are.

395
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,960
You said you had found my turtle, right?

396
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,360
Please return it to me.

397
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,640
Don't worry.

398
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,800
We are colleagues working for the same company.

399
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,640
We should get to know each other.

400
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,080
Miss Chai,

401
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
can you tell me

402
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,360
what is this about?

403
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,520
What is this?

404
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
I can't

405
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
figure it out.

406
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,320
I don't understand.

407
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,880
Fine.

408
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
I will make you understand.

409
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,840
How come you are holding,

410
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
you are holding my item in your hand?

411
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,320
It seems that my guess is right.

412
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,920
You do have a lot of secrets.

413
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,960
Miss Chai,

414
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
let's make a deal.

415
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't have time to talk crap with you.

416
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
Return my turtle to me first.

417
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,920
Facing the one and only sapphire,

418
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
what comes to your mind first is still your pet.

419
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
I can see that

420
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,120
it is more important to you than I thought before.

421
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,240
What do you want?

422
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,720
Tell me your identity

423
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,720
and the origin of the sapphire.

424
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,400
I will free your pet.

425
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,960
Otherwise,

426
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
as long as I press it lightly,

427
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,440
your pet will explode in an instant

428
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
and can never come alive again.

429
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,160
Tell me!

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
What are your secrets on earth?

431
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,000
What should I do?

432
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,080
I couldn't exert my superpower at all.

433
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,520
Give it to me!

434
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,680
Give it to me!

435
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,080
Give it to me!

436
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,880
Ah!

437
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,560
Give it to me!

438
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,080
Ah!

439
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,240
You! Who are you?

440
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,120
Considering you have worked for our company for many years,

441
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,440
I won't hold you accountable legally.

442
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
But from today on,

443
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,520
you shall never show up before me again.

444
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,480
Get lost!

445
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Xiaoqi, are you all right?

446
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,600
I am fine.

447
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,120
Did you get hurt?

448
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,800
I am not hurt.

449
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,920
I am not hurt.

450
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Rise to your feet.

451
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,640
Are you fine?

452
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,840
Sorry!

453
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,320
I made it here late.

454
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,320
It's fine now.

455
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,760
I will handle

456
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,360
the remaining issues.

457
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,120
It is all right.

458
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,280
I am not hurt.

459
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,600
Let's go.

460
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,440
Well,

461
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,320
my turtle!

462
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,760
Kubri!

463
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,960
Kubri!

464
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Kubri! Wake up!

465
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,280
Kubri!

466
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,240
Is he hurt?

467
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,400
Should we take him to see a vet?

468
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,600
I think it's gonna be okay.

469
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Could he pass out due to shock?

470
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Kubri!

471
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,120
Kubri, can you hear me?

472
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,360
Kubri!

473
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
I am so sleepy.

474
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,980
Why did you wake me up?

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,720
Why are you sleeping at such a time?

476
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,840
Do you know I am worried about you?

477
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,280
I was caught.

478
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,480
I couldn't escape.

479
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,280
If I don't sleep, what else can I do?

480
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,640
You!

481
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,160
He is supposed to be fine.

482
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,480
He woke up.

483
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,640
Then let's go.

484
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,080
Go. Let's go.

485
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,200
Watch your step!

486
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,520
Do you feel any better?

487
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,680
Xiaoqi,

488
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,200
do you feel better now?

489
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,320
I am fine.

490
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,080
I will be fine after going back for a rest.

491
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
Why did Allen give you a hard time?

492
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,040
Did you offend him?

493
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,760
I am also in the dark.

494
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,000
Based on my understanding of him,

495
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
he couldn't be foolish enough to offend my girl.

496
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,200
Could it be that due to the previous sapphire case,

497
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,240
he has been blaming you all along?

498
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,760
Maybe.

499
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,080
However,

500
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,800
since when have I been your girl?

501
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,720
Bossy!

502
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,400
If you are not my girl,

503
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,360
are you implying that you belong to Fang Lie?

504
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,400
Nonsense!

505
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,720
I heard that

506
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,000
you asked him to help you look for Kubri last night.

507
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,120
That is because...

508
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,760
Why are you asking about this?

509
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,360
Why should I explain to you?

510
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,160
I won't tell you.

511
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,840
I will let the bygones be bygones.

512
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,280
From today on,

513
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,480
you must come to me first whatever comes your way.

514
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,320
Got it?

515
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,280
I have hands and legs.

516
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,240
Why need I resort to you two?

517
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,800
Moreover,

518
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,480
I am stronger than you two joining forces.

519
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,640
Are you strong?

520
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,800
Then why can't you protect your turtle well?

521
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,480
Are you really strong?

522
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,840
Are you looking down upon me?

523
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,480
If it had not been for the lab,

524
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,640
I would have beaten Allen up.

525
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,000
Foolish earthling!

526
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,640
They know nothing about my power.

527
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,320
Fine! You are awesome!

528
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,680
I am truly strong.

529
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,520
Fine! Impressive!

530
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,520
Foolish earthling!

531
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,280
I have been busy these days.

532
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,560
So I won't go up with you.

533
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
Take good care of yourself.

534
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,520
Oh.

535
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Remember that

536
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,800
you can only turn to me whatever happens.

537
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,360
Mm-hmm.

538
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,040
Go!

539
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
Well, thank you for what you did today!

540
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,120
Hurry up!

541
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,680
Tell me from start to finish.

542
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,800
How much information Allen has got?

543
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,760
How did he find you out?

544
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,120
Besides,

545
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,160
he didn't do anything to you, did he?

546
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,480
Have our identities been exposed?

547
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,240
Stop! Stop! Stop!

548
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,720
Can I answer your questions one by one?

549
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,240
OK. Answer them.

550
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,000
Allen didn't run into me.

551
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,480
He came to your room to have a check.

552
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,880
Then he stole me incidentally.

553
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,720
He searched my room?

554
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,160
What did he search for?

555
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,640
I don't know.

556
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,040
But I have been having the feeling that

557
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,480
he seems to have found something.

558
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,760
Yesterday he brought me back to the lab.

559
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,640
Then he began to examine me immediately.

560
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,200
It is lucky that I have pretended skillfully.

561
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,600
He didn't find out anything.

562
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,840
So he had to question you.

563
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,920
That is to say,

564
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,960
he doesn't know we are aliens yet.

565
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,240
Right?

566
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,840
Then what should we do next?

567
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Today in the lab,

568
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,920
he didn't find my hand hurt, did he?

569
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
Should I go sound him out?

570
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,720
On what?

571
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,040
On how much he knows.

572
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,880
If he knows we are aliens,

573
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,760
I will...

574
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,320
What will you do?

575
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,840
Based on your personality,

576
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,480
you surely will not kill him, right?

577
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,840
In addition,

578
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
he was just suspecting you.

579
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,000
If you come to him voluntarily,

580
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,880
he will see that you are guilty, right?

581
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,280
Right.

582
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,320
Then,

583
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,320
then I will evade him.

584
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,280
I will use my superpower less

585
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,080
and give myself away less.

586
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,360
Thus, he won't be able to find any evidence.

587
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,480
Then he won't be able to do anything to me.

588
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,080
I asked you to investigate Chai Xiaoqi

589
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,120
and didn't ask you to hurt her.

590
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Who gave you the guts?

591
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,840
Forget it!

592
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,080
You have been sacked.

593
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,520
What is the use of saying those words?

594
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,960
I can't accept the fact that

595
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,360
I have been kicked out of the company like a dog by him.

596
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,200
What else do you want to do?

597
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,040
You have caught the eyes of Fang Leng.

598
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,840
If you don't stop,

599
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,400
he will suspect me sooner or later.

600
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,920
Do you think this is the end?

601
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,920
Fang Leng fired you within reason.

602
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,560
You laid hands on a woman.

603
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,360
Is it proper?

604
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,440
Anyway,

605
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,640
just let it go at that in Chai Xiaoqi's case.

606
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,360
I will make arrangements about your job.

607
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
I will be fair with you.

608
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,320
I really didn't see it coming that

609
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,000
you are so weak.

610
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
Miss Jiang,

611
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,440
I haven't ascertained the truth about Chai Xiaoqi.

612
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,160
You just gave up so simply.

613
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
It is not that I don't want to continue looking into it,

614
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,240
but that I heard Fang Leng lost his memories,

615
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
and I didn't expect it to be so severe.

616
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,040
I am in no mood to mind Chai Xiaoqi anymore.

617
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,920
Now in your eyes, except Fang Leng,

618
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
you can see nothing else, right?

619
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,120
Stop the car!

620
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,480
Miss Jiang,

621
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,520
I won't bother you again later.

622
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,200
Take care of yourself.

623
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,240
=1.Strong athletic ability. 2.Have a good nose. 3.Good memory=

624
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,540
=4.Sharp eyes for handsome guys. 5.Not afraid of hard work=

625
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,920
Xiaoqi,

626
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,880
you didn't show up for work yesterday.

627
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,880
What have you been up to?

628
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,600
Did anything happen to you?

629
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,480
Well,

630
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,040
I went to look for Kubri yesterday.

631
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,600
I forgot to ask a leave from you.

632
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,480
Sorry!

633
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,440
Did you find him?

634
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,000
You found him in such a short time?

635
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,360
No.

636
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,200
I meant that it is great for you to find him.

637
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,600
It's great!

638
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,800
Did you have your meal?

639
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,320
Let's go have a meal.

640
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,960
No need.

641
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,320
I will go to see Fang Leng in a while.

642
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,280
I won't join you for the meal this time.

643
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,520
Why will you go to see my elder brother?

644
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
He helped me.

645
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,920
Of course I must repay him for his kindness.

646
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,520
I am leaving.

647
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,120
Bye-bye.

648
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,440
I helped you, too.

649
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,760
Why won't you come to see me?

650
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,840
Come in, please!

651
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,200
What is the matter?

652
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,160
See for yourself.

653
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,080
What is this?

654
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,280
After I came back, I thought about it long.

655
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,400
But I didn't figure out how to help you.

656
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,680
So I made a list of

657
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,120
all things I am good at.

658
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,720
See if I can be of help to you.

659
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,280
What are you doing?

660
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,120
There is something helpful indeed.

661
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,040
Which one?

662
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,720
Sharp eyes for handsome guys.

663
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,840
How about this?

664
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,600
From today onward,

665
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,760
you will move into my office

666
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
and sit opposite to me,

667
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,560
looking at me, the handsome guy every day.

668
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,200
You!

669
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,080
Do you think it is easy for me to come to you actively?

670
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,120
You laughed at me.

671
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,120
Previously,

672
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,840
I said I would refuse you.

673
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,160
While you and Fang Lie pestered me,

674
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
I also thought about evading you.

675
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,600
Nonetheless,

676
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,600
you are in trouble now.

677
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,240
I am a bit worried about you.

678
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,240
Besides, you helped me yesterday.

679
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,440
Therefore,

680
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,040
if I don't do anything to help you,

681
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,320
I may drive myself crazy.

682
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,600
Thus,

683
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,560
I came to you voluntarily.

684
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,640
Thank you!

685
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,320
Though after the company found out my amnesia,

686
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,920
they may want me to leave,

687
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,800
it is not cut and dried

688
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,200
and no one knows the final result.

689
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,280
Then what are you planning to do now?

690
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,200
I will figure out a way.

691
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,200
If I really need you by then,

692
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,280
I will go to see you.

693
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,800
Hmm.

694
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,040
Oh, by the way,

695
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,400
how has the perfume project in the charge of you

696
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,240
been progressing lately?

697
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,720
It has been abandoned.

698
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,560
Why?

699
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,440
It has been scrapped

700
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,160
for some reasons.

701
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,240
OK.

702
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,640
Go back to your business.

703
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,840
I am off.

704
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,800
You can turn to me if you need me.

705
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,840
Xiaoqi!

706
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,600
Xiaoqi!

707
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,640
I know how you can help me now.

708
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,000
Ah!

709
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,640
Miss Jiang, this way please!

710
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,760
Uncle Fang!

711
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,400
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

712
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,480
I just arrived.

713
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,640
Come on!

714
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,800
OK! Thank you!

715
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,880
You especially asked me out for a meeting.

716
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,120
You must have some important business.

717
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,520
I will be honest with you.

718
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,760
I asked you out for Fang Leng.

719
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,040
When we met last time,

720
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,480
you told me you would try to make him accept you.

721
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,200
I believed you.

722
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,520
So I didn't intervene.

723
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,240
However, such a thing suddenly happened to Fang Leng.

724
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,240
Xue,

725
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,240
if you want to give it up,

726
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,720
I won't blame you.

727
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,720
What are you saying, Uncle Fang?

728
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,560
I asked you out not for this.

729
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,040
Then what is your purpose?

730
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
I want to help Fang Leng.

731
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,120
As long as you set me up with him,

732
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,120
I believe that

733
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,800
Fang Leng will go through the difficulty for sure.

734
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,160
No, I can't.

735
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,880
You also watched the news of these days.

736
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,400
Fang Leng has contracted such an illness.

737
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,920
If I still make you be together with him,

738
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,040
it will be unfair to you.

739
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,120
I won't regret.

740
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,960
Uncle Fang,

741
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,760
when Fang Leng got admitted into the hospital last time,

742
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,360
I once said that

743
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,240
should he be ill

744
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
or get into any other trouble.

745
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,920
I would always stay by his side.

746
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,840
Now it is a time when Fang Leng

747
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,880
needs help the most.

748
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,080
I think that

749
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,160
if he gets my support,

750
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,080
all his problems will be solved.

751
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,400
What do you mean?

752
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,920
You make the call

753
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,160
to get Fang Leng to marry me immediately.

754
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,080
I think

755
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,760
whether in terms of assets or in terms of ability,

756
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,800
I will be able to help him.

757
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,440
By then, the company won't be able to fire him easily.

758
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,120
You also know that

759
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
considering the current situation of Fang Leng,

760
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,040
even if you back him as Chairman of the Board,

761
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,920
it will be hard for him to secure his post.

762
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,840
You have been taking no actions

763
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
for this reason, right?

764
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
If I join you,

765
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,480
by then, not only the company,

766
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,080
but also the power of your Fang Family

767
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,120
will be cemented.

768
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,920
Then you can lay aside all worries and rest content.

769
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,760
I didn't expect that you thought in such a far-sighted way.

770
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,280
In front of you,

771
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,400
I came up with the idea like teaching a fish to swim.

772
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,520
But Uncle Fang,

773
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,000
I really want to help Fang Leng heartily.

774
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,200
You don't want to see him sacked,

775
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,040
do you?

776
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,280
To be frank,

777
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,800
for our Fang Family, at present,

778
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,080
Fang Leng is the only person that can
shoulder the main responsibility.

779
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,680
If he has his career ruined,

780
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,080
Lie won't be able to take his place.

781
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,680
If you become the daughter-in-law of our Fang Family,

782
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
that will be a great help for us.

783
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,400
Nevertheless,

784
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,720
Fang Leng is ill.

785
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,080
You really don't mind it at all?

786
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,480
Uncle Fang,

787
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
this is the cooperation plan developed by me myself.

788
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,240
As long as Fang Leng agrees to marry me,

789
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,960
I will invest into your company right away

790
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,400
and help him remove all hindrances.

791
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,560
Though money can't stand for true heart,

792
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,120
it can represent my sincerity at least.

793
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,600
Do you agree?

794
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,760
Are you sure that you want to restart the perfume project?

795
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
Hasn't it been called to a halt?

796
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,120
Can this help you stay in the company?

797
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,560
If I can show them

798
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,040
a brand-new case planning

799
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,880
and make them remember it at first sight.

800
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
And if they let me carry it on,

801
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,680
I think they will let me stay.

802
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,720
However,

803
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,760
Fang Lie and I have conducted this project.

804
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,360
Using it,

805
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,640
can you convince them?

806
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,920
Rest assured.

807
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,920
I will replace all the contents of it.

808
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,560
By then, what laid before their eyes

809
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,880
will be a brand-new project.

810
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,160
What's more, it can help the company

811
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,440
explore a new industry.

812
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,560
Speaking from the perspective of profits,

813
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
they will give it green light.

814
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,000
Right.

815
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,080
Now you are already

816
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,240
the development personnel of my project.

817
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,840
From today on,

818
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,200
you need to work overtime here to
accompany me to finish the work.

819
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,600
I...

820
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,240
Forget it!

821
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
Anyway I have no work to do staying in my department.

822
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,960
If I tell Fang Lie I will come to help you,

823
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,080
he should give his consent to it.

824
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,760
What are you doing?

825
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,680
Ask for a leave from Fang Lie.

826
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
After all, he is my superior now.

827
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,560
You need not.

828
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,280
I will help you ask for a leave.

829
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,960
Hello!

830
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,760
I can do it by myself.

831
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Xiaoqi,

832
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,600
why have you been out for so long?

833
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,000
Did my elder brother...again?

834
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,920
Leng,

835
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,120
why are you holding Xiaoqi's mobile phone?

836
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,520
She is with me now.

837
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,880
You need not wait for her.

838
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,440
Well,

839
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,080
now it is working time.

840
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,000
Why is she at your home?

841
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,280
Didn't you say that

842
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,640
she came to you first previously?

843
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,520
She came to see me today.

844
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
As President of the company,

845
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,920
I want to borrow your employee

846
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,240
so that she can help me finish my work.

847
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,400
That's it.

848
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,280
-I gotta go. -I...

849
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,240
My elder brother has gone too far.

850
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,280
What nonsense did you say?

851
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,080
Give it to me.

852
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,920
Stop making fun of me.

853
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,400
Here it is!

854
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,120
Hurry!

855
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,200
Ah!

856
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:44,640
Come to take it.

857
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,160
Give it to me.

858
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,800
Ah!

859
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
You will make him misunderstand us by doing so.

860
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,880
What is the problem with making him misunderstand us?

861
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,880
Why can't you be with me?

862
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,440
What is it?

863
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,520
Are you angry for real?

864
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,400
No, I am not.

865
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,400
I just think that

866
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,680
it is very good to make him misunderstand us.

867
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,840
I didn't intend to give Fang Lie hope.

868
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,920
If he misunderstand that we are together,

869
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,640
he may give up on me.

870
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,960
Isn't this good?

871
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,800
How about me?

872
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,000
You don't want me to misunderstand
the relation of you and Fang Lie.

873
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,560
Does this suggest that

874
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,600
you want to give me hope?

875
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,160
You!

876
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,040
What,

877
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,640
what blind conjectures have you been lost in?

878
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,840
I helped you to repay your kindness.

879
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,320
Don't make blind conjectures.

880
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,320
Is it really so?

881
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,720
Yes.

882
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,640
Dad.

883
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,720
I got it.

884
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,800
What happened?

885
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,720
Wait for me at my home.

886
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,360
I must go out now.

887
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,280
What is the matter?

888
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,360
Dad.

889
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,200
Take a seat.

890
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,760
The time limit of one week is about to expire.

891
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,360
You didn't come to me after so long a time.

892
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,360
Do you really want to resign?

893
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,560
You got it wrong.

894
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,080
This is my own problem.

895
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
I will solve it by myself.

896
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,280
Saying this,

897
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,680
you must have figured out a way,

898
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,000
Not yet.

899
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,400
But I have come up with some thoughts.

900
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,160
If things can progress quickly...

901
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,440
So you don't have a solution.

902
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,200
Fang Leng,

903
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
get married with Jiang Xue, will you?

904
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,380
Ever since I met you,

905
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,060
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

906
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,460
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

907
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,340
only you.

908
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,540
We're out of reach

909
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,860
but appreciate each other.

910
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:07,660
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

911
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,700
The yearning invades

912
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,260
and lurks in my mind.

913
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:21,820
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

914
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,900
I'm getting addicted to it

915
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,220
and my sense is shielded.

916
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:36,020
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

917
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,180
Put the hottest heart

918
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,500
in this cold body.

919
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,860
I'm looking at you,

920
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,020
and my love has nowhere to go.

921
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,260
Ever since I met you,

922
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,180
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

923
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,460
Every day is a new memory

924
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,500
which is only be about you and me.

925
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,740
I can't lie to myself anymore.

926
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,580
Please give me the courage to believe.

927
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,500
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

928
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,420
only you.

929
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,540
Even everything becomes silent,

930
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,660
I still have you.
