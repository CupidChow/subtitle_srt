1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 18

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,280
Wait.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,920
Mr. Fang, can I help you?

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,760
If not, I'll be on my way.

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
Don't forget what you said

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
we would not meet again.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,920
No.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,240
It is said that

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
if you always say sorry to someone,

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,720
you will drift away from her.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,920
I should have said

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,160
thank you.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,120
What's the matter, Xiaoqi?

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,440
If there is nothing else,

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,720
I'll see you.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,560
Xiaoqi!

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,560
Mr. Fang.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,480
Mr. Fang,

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
we are waiting for you for the meeting.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,280
I know.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,360
OK.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,120
God!

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
How did I get here?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Director Fang.

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
Put them over there.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Eh, wait.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,880
Put them here.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
I don't want them to damage my precious cartoons.

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
So many.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,200
My poor nose.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,600
Xiaoqi!

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,360
Xiaoqi!

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Xiaoqi!

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm here.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
When did you get in here?

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,160
I...

55
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,160
I was looking for the document.

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,240
I've found it.

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,200
You should have told me.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,120
What document?

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,480
We are going to have that

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,520
project planning meeting soon.

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,880
I came for the document

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,000
for studies.

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,040
Now I've found it,

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll see you.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,040
Wait.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,360
I was about to ask for your help.

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Come here.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
Smell these samples.

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,520
I can't.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,720
I'm not quite myself now.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,280
I'll probably mess up.

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
Oh.

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,520
I got it.

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,480
You have pretended to be strong.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
I thought you had let it go.

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,440
Well then,

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,400
I'll ask them to

78
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,520
leave you alone for some days.

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,400
You can have a good rest.

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll do it myself.

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,960
Fang Lie.

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,680
Can I ask you something?

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,440
Ask.

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,440
Do you know any method

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
to delete someone from your memory?

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
Like his voice, figure, look,

87
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,000
and everything about him.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,920
Delete them all.

89
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,200
Have you heard about a pink elephant?

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,560
No.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Let's do an experiment.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm asking you not to remember

93
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,840
a pink elephant.

94
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,040
What do you remember?

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,360
A pink elephant.

96
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
Such is human emotion.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,360
The more you want to forget something,

98
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,920
the more you'll remember it.

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,640
To really forget,

100
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,200
you don't have to try.

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,400
I know who I should turn to.

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,640
Doctor Zhang.

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,840
Xiaoqi?

104
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,760
Have a seat.

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,320
Do you remember you helped

106
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,200
me to restore Fang Leng's memory?

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Not him again.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,160
I am now like a clay Buddha fording a river

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,040
and I am hardly able to save myself.

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,080
What happened?

111
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
I'd like to ask you something.

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,320
Is there any medicine

113
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
that can delete

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,080
all my memories

115
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
as Fang Leng did?

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
You two are really a perfect match.

117
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
One tried everything to recover his memory,

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
and the other to lose it.

119
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,440
OK.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Let's see.

121
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,640
Why

122
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
do you want to remove your memory?

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
It seems that

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
I have been poisoned.

125
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
Once I mention Fang Leng,

126
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
I totally lose control.

127
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,640
He seems to have become

128
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,960
a spell over me.

129
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,920
Sometimes I will

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,920
suddenly throw myself to him.

131
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Other times

132
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
I will suddenly pull myself away.

133
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
It's like he has

134
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
invaded my central system

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,720
and my consciousness

136
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,160
is no longer under my control.

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I just...

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
What you have describe

139
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
sounds common to me.

140
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
There are really such patients?

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,640
How did you cure them?

142
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,520
Them?

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,560
It's simple.

144
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
They build a relationship

145
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
and they are cured.

146
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
Doctor Zhang, could you please stop making fun of me?

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,640
I am not kidding.

148
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
Your symptoms

149
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,600
seem all clear to me.

150
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,600
They can be summarized in four words:

151
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,560
you fall for him.

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Impossible.

153
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
That's impossible.

154
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
How can I fall for him?

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Impossible.

156
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,040
I won't fall for anyone here.

157
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,720
Absolutely no.

158
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,600
You have done so much for him.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,360
You are telling me now that you don't fall for him.

160
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
What? You just do good like Lei Feng?

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,280
You two are amusing.

162
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
Neither of you knows how you feel.

163
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
I helped him

164
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,040
for my own sake.

165
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
You won't understand.

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,040
Anyway,

167
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm certainly infected

168
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,280
by a virus.

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,880
You know,

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
no virus is stronger

171
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,880
than feelings.

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,480
When you are infected,

173
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
you will imagine whoever

174
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,640
you look at is him;

175
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,400
even when he is not around,

176
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,600
you will have an illusion of him.

177
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,280
Have you had any of these symptoms lately?

178
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,720
Of course...

179
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,760
not.

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,040
Thank you.

181
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll go back,

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,440
Doctor Zhang,

183
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,360
One minute.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
The reason you lose control

185
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,920
is a lack of security.

186
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
When you find out that

187
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,840
the one you have feelings for also feels the same way,

188
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
you will not lose control anymore.

189
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,200
You will know that you deserve all this

190
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,440
and that he accepts

191
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
all of you.

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,920
Understand?

193
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,960
What are you doing here?

194
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
Looking for you.

195
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
If I can't even locate you,

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,680
Miss Jiang,

197
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,200
will you cooperate with me?

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,800
What's the matter?

199
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,200
Gossip.

200
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,960
Do you want to know it?

201
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,960
Say it.

202
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,320
Chai Xiaoqi

203
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,640
visited the Chairman.

204
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,360
I never thought she had it in her.

205
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,720
I'm afraid

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
she has more in her that we don't know.

207
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,240
Let me have a look at her data.

208
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,400
Then you will have it.

209
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,080
But

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,680
it's weird.

211
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,400
There is nothing

212
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,760
before she showed up at the Tropical Restaurant.

213
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,840
It's like

214
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,920
she just turned up from nowhere.

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,520
I guess she's got

216
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
some secret in her past.

217
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,960
You can't rely only on data.

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,720
If there is no record,

219
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,680
we still get people.

220
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,680
I can go on investigating.

221
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,560
As for you,

222
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,680
isn't it a good chance

223
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,520
that Chai Xiaoqi has blackmailed them?

224
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Mr. Fang

225
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
seems quite annoyed.

226
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,320
Chai Xiaoqi,

227
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
let me see

228
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,880
how long you can keep your secret

229
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
without protection by Fang Leng.

230
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,220
=Current assets account for a larger proportion
than credit assets in the inventory assets.=

231
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Mr. Fang,

232
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
anything wrong with the statements?

233
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,120
Assistant Han.

234
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,800
Eh?

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
I hope you will

236
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,040
tell me everything you know about one thing.

237
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,200
What thing? I'll tell whatever I know.

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,800
What happened

239
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,440
between Chai Xiaoqi and me?

240
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,880
You mean

241
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
everything?

242
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,600
You should know

243
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,680
what happened between us.

244
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,720
I do know.

245
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,000
But

246
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
it's a long story.

247
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,280
Mr. Fang,

248
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,280
haven't you asked me not to mention her?

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,360
Why do you ask about the past?

250
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,960
Nothing special.

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm curious.

252
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,160
So...

253
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
I got it.

254
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,760
You must want to recall her.

255
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,120
Right?

256
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't worry.

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
I will give you back

258
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
whatever happened between you two.

259
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,200
How about

260
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,240
I write a report?

261
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,280
What do you think?

262
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
Just look into it.

263
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
It's not so important after all.

264
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Cheers!

265
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,520
Cheers!

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,080
Hello,

267
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,040
welcome!

268
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,160
Please have a seat.

269
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,120
This is our menu.

270
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
What can I bring you?

271
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,840
125ml cola

272
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,440
blended with 30ml water.

273
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,360
Thank you.

274
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
So you want

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
cola with water?

276
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,640
No.

277
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
With 25ml water.

278
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,760
It's better for digestion

279
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,240
of sugar by human stomach.

280
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,480
In this era,

281
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,520
we may come across all kinds of weirdos.

282
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:24,960
Wait.

283
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,320
Isn't

284
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,120
Xiaoqi here?

285
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,960
She has gone to work.

286
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,880
You know Xiaoqi?

287
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,560
She used to bring me deliveries.

288
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,760
You have got familiar through deliveries?

289
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
Is it that you have fallen in love with Xiaoqi?

290
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,160
He's got a vibe similar to Fang Leng.

291
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,400
Since Xiaoqi has broken up,

292
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,160
maybe

293
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
she will like this one.

294
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Gentleman,

295
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,600
would you please tell me

296
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,160
where you work?

297
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,120
How is your income?

298
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,640
Are you a local?

299
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,600
And,

300
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
you don't have a girlfriend. Right?

301
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,760
No.

302
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Xiaoqi told me

303
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,160
that some pretty landlady takes care of her.

304
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,280
I think you must be that pretty landlady.

305
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,640
How did you figure it out?

306
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,160
Your cola with water is free.

307
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,680
On the house.

308
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,240
Thank you.

309
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,200
You and Xiaoqi are both named Chai.

310
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
So are you a relative?

311
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,120
You can say that.

312
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,680
Xiaoqi has forgotten her family name,

313
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
and so she takes mine.

314
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,400
Forgotten?

315
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,040
Does she have memory loss too?

316
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,680
Not exactly.

317
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She is a good girl

318
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,040
but her brain is a little...

319
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,920
By the way,

320
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,960
you said "too".

321
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
Has someone else lost memory too?

322
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
No.

323
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
I feel that

324
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
it must be difficult for Xiaoqi.

325
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,720
Before she met you,

326
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,040
she must have a very hard life.

327
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
You know nothing?

328
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
Xiaoqi

329
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,640
was born to a wealthy family.

330
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,680
She used to lead a good life.

331
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,800
But later

332
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,120
something happened,

333
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,200
and she's got down to this.

334
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,560
Poor girl.

335
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,640
She is

336
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,080
even more miserable than the Broke Girls.

337
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,880
Something?

338
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,360
Something happened to her family?

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,920
Yes.

340
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,920
You don't know that

341
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,920
when I first met her,

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
she was wearing famous brands.

343
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
She got this incredible temperament

344
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,040
and she was quite generous.

345
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Unfortunately,

346
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,160
she has forgotten all of it.

347
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,000
I am always wondering when

348
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
her rich parents will find her.

349
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Xiaoqi seems to live here?

350
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,280
Yes,

351
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,560
upstairs

352
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,600
with me.

353
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Your cola.

354
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,280
With water.

355
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,880
It's ready.

356
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,800
Good.

357
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,800
Into.

358
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,200
Not into.

359
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,280
Into...

360
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
Into.

361
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,560
Not into.

362
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,680
As I said,

363
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,880
it is not into.

364
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,880
Who are you not into?

365
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,520
Doing irrelevant things at work,

366
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,600
and caught red-handed by the superior.

367
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,240
Get ready for a review.

368
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,680
Look at me. I'm so miserable.

369
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,640
You are adding insult to injury.

370
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,680
Didn't you ask someone for help?

371
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,840
What?

372
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,040
It didn't work?

373
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,800
I met him.

374
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,280
But after that,

375
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,560
I've got more confused.

376
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,040
What did he say?

377
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
He said that

378
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,520
I fall for Fang Leng.

379
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,880
Isn't it obvious?

380
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
If you do not,

381
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,480
why did you become his girlfriend?

382
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,800
That was

383
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,880
a special situation.

384
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,680
We were not in a relationship as you think.

385
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Not in a relationship as I think?

386
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,720
Is it that

387
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,520
you are Brother's camouflage?

388
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
I didn't say that.

389
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,840
So you

390
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,320
have never been his real girlfriend?

391
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,240
You

392
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,760
can say that.

393
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,880
Really?

394
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
You have kept it from me for such a long time.

395
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,040
But

396
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,800
that's good.

397
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,160
Without it,

398
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,440
I would not have figured out my feelings.

399
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,520
What feelings?

400
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
It's...

401
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,640
Director.

402
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,920
Director Fang,

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the perfume approval meeting is starting now.

404
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,960
What are you doing here?

405
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,120
Approval meeting?

406
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,120
Yes.

407
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
I haven't got the sample planning ready.

408
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,920
No time for that now.

409
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,760
The management is waiting in the conference room.

410
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,800
I'll go there too.

411
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,560
What should I do then?

412
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,280
Let me pretend I've fallen ill.

413
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,040
How long will you pretend?

414
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,120
How about this?

415
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,320
You exempt me from that review,

416
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,120
and I will go to the meeting in your place.

417
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,640
You?

418
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,960
Can you make it?

419
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,680
You doubt my abilities.

420
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Don't forget

421
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,680
that I've got the sharpest nose in the whole universe.

422
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,240
Whatever perfume

423
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,880
or sample it is,

424
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,960
I can tell everything about it

425
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,200
once I put my nose on it.

426
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,200
That's great.

427
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,360
Off we go.

428
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,760
Come.

429
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,080
Let's go.

430
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,640
Mr. Fang.

431
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,640
Lie

432
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,200
will be here soon.

433
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,120
Here we go.

434
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,120
Here he is.

435
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,000
Lie,

436
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,880
this is a serious meeting.

437
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,760
What's she doing her?

438
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,560
Xiaoqi is quite serious,

439
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
and she is the presenter

440
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,640
of the planning.

441
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,520
You let her do it?

442
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,320
Lie,

443
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,040
do you know the importance of the meeting?

444
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,080
If the new product is not approved,

445
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,200
the KPI of your department will be zero.

446
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,320
At that time,

447
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,880
what will the Chairman think of you?

448
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,520
Guys,

449
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,800
Mr. Fang has a meeting later.

450
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,120
Let's not waste time.

451
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,760
OK.

452
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,120
Don't worry, Uncle.

453
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,680
I got it.

454
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,640
Go.

455
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,880
Uncle Kang was so serious.

456
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,680
What if I screw up?

457
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Don't worry.

458
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,880
It'll be fine.

459
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,840
Just talk.

460
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm here whatever happens.

461
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,680
Hello.

462
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
I will present

463
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,560
the products of the perfume planning.

464
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,720
Please give me some time.

465
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,200
This smells

466
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
like the starry sky.

467
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,160
And that one.

468
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,600
There.

469
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,520
See?

470
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,560
On that star,

471
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,720
every other star looks like a meteor.

472
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
That's how you present a product?

473
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,240
This perfume

474
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,120
smells like the starry sky at the end of June.

475
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,360
Citrus from Sicily.

476
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,880
The sweet orange is mixed with chilly grass.

477
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,440
It's like the starry sky,

478
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,000
which looks alive

479
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,160
but in fact

480
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
gives a sense of distance.

481
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,400
It smells great.

482
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,560
Doesn't it?

483
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,760
Nice.

484
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,560
I like it.

485
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,720
Good.

486
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,160
I've never experience

487
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,360
such a smell.

488
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,280
It's refreshing.

489
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,320
Enough.

490
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,840
Next.

491
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,360
It smells very strange.

492
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,920
Isn't it Fang Leng's favorite perfume?

493
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,400
This...

494
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
I can't figure out

495
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,320
this smell.

496
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,320
Director,

497
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,800
could you do this?

498
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,560
You do it.

499
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,480
No.

500
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,600
You can do it.

501
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
Come on.

502
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,640
This perfume

503
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
means a very important person

504
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
to me.

505
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,720
It's his favorite smell.

506
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,960
I have restored and improved it

507
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
and created the smell.

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,200
For the top note,

509
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,200
I use amber and elements from bushes.

510
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,560
It smells sweet

511
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
but also a little bitter.

512
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,760
For the bottom note,

513
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
I use the longevity vane.

514
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,080
It...

515
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
It means

516
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
never apart.

517
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,120
So

518
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
I have named it

519
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,960
Memory.

520
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,800
Nonsense.

521
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,360
This is a perfume designed for the market.

522
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,960
You have blended so many personal feelings in it.

523
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,920
If anything goes wrong,

524
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,080
can you bear the consequences?

525
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,200
A good commodity

526
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,960
is like an art work.

527
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,040
It has to be based on real

528
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,960
personal experience.

529
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,400
This perfume

530
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,120
is the only one with a cool mild scent.

531
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,160
It has integrated the aesthetics of the Wabi-Sabi.

532
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,840
It is

533
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,880
a high-end perfume filled with a Buddhist quality.

534
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,600
It brings people

535
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,520
a life experience

536
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,200
that seems indifferent but powerful.

537
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
I hope you can try it.

538
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,440
I assure you

539
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,480
that you have never

540
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,680
experienced this fragrance.

541
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,160
This is really good.

542
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,920
Good.

543
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Good.

544
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,960
I think it's OK.

545
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,640
We did not talk about these descriptions before.

546
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,800
I made it up.

547
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,920
You are even better.

548
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
When did you prepare the PPT?

549
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,720
Awesome.

550
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,880
We think both products smell

551
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
good.

552
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
We suggest producing some samples

553
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,760
and putting them into the market.

554
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Mr. Fang,

555
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,320
what do you say?

556
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,560
Maybe

557
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,640
there is something

558
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,040
that is very important to me in your heart.

559
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,840
Mr. Fang, what's the matter?

560
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,320
What's wrong?

561
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,640
As recommended by Mr. Li,

562
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,760
produce the new products.

563
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,600
Chai Xiaoqi,

564
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
to my office.

565
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,520
What's wrong?

566
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,080
I don't know.

567
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,800
Mr. Fang.

568
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,160
Come in.

569
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,600
About the last perfume,

570
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,560
could you report again in detail?

571
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,560
This...

572
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
This narcissist.

573
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,920
Has he remembered something?

574
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,640
Is he intentionally bullying me?

575
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,280
I seem

576
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:39,840
to be

577
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,080
in the vague about what I said just now.

578
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,280
How about

579
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
writing

580
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,880
a detailed report for you after I go back?

581
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,520
No need.

582
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,200
If you really have forgotten it,

583
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I can help you.

584
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,560
You said

585
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,920
someone very important to you

586
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,240
liked this perfume.

587
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,120
You know it already.

588
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,560
Why did you ask me?

589
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,600
That person important to you

590
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,920
has a similar taste to mine.

591
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
You can invite him to the company.

592
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,840
I want to hire him.

593
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,800
This...

594
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,400
This is unnecessary.

595
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,920
You are different from him in one thing.

596
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,280
That one

597
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
values affections.

598
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,960
Sometimes he may

599
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
even let his emotions affect his work.

600
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,040
But you

601
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
have the vision of the big picture

602
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,880
and will never allow that happen.

603
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,520
Right?

604
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,880
Values affections.

605
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,880
So

606
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,160
you like someone like that.

607
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
You've got a visitor.

608
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,200
Mr. Fang,

609
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm done with the reporting.

610
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll go now.

611
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,400
No.

612
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,640
Miss Jiang,

613
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,320
I've got business here.

614
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
Could we talk later?

615
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm right on time.

616
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,720
I've got business to talk with you.

617
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,840
It's about the Chairman.

618
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,240
Look.

619
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,400
It's time for dinner anyway.

620
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
Let's have dinner and a talk.

621
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,080
Xiaoqi,

622
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,440
come with us.

623
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,240
I don't think so.

624
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,960
You go.

625
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm Fang Lie's people.

626
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,360
It's not good that I get off earlier.

627
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,640
You are Fang Lie's.

628
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,440
Ask Fang Lie to my office.

629
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,840
Brother,

630
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm picking Xiaoqi up.

631
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,320
What are you doing here?

632
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,640
I'm taking your brother for dinner.

633
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,560
I'd like to invite Xiaoqi.

634
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,000
Will you let her go with us?

635
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,400
Yes.

636
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,600
Of course.

637
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,960
Thank you then.

638
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
No worry anymore?

639
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,200
But

640
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,560
you are going to have something nice to eat.

641
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,480
Why not invite me?

642
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't have things to do? What do you do there?

643
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,440
Brother has a new girl.

644
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
But she has not

645
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
treated me to a dinner.

646
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,680
That's enough, Fang Lie.

647
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,720
OK, I'll stop there.

648
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Let's go to dinner.

649
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's go.

650
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,960
Let's go.

651
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,320
Jiang Xue invited me.

652
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,200
It's clearly a trap.

653
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,920
I asked you to help refuse it.

654
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,600
You pushed me into it.

655
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,600
Don't worry. I'm here.

656
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,720
Jiang Xue won't do anything to you.

657
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,960
But you know

658
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,080
I don't want to see Fang Leng.

659
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,680
If you really want to come out of the lost love,

660
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,160
to witness their intimacy

661
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,800
is necessary.

662
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,920
It takes poison to fight poison.

663
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,960
That makes sense.

664
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Sit down.

665
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,080
For your health,

666
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,640
I've changed it to black tea.

667
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,640
Thanks.

668
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,560
Come.

669
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,160
It's hot in here.

670
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,760
Xiaoqi,

671
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,480
come.

672
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,120
Let me help you take this off.

673
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,520
Don't be naughty.

674
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Come.

675
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,560
I was bothered

676
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,600
by something for a long time.

677
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,560
Seeing Xiaoqi and Fang Lie like that,

678
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,200
I've finally figured it out.

679
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,880
What have you figured out?

680
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,520
Considering her financial status now,

681
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
Xiaoqi does not have to work anymore.

682
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,480
It turns out that

683
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,560
she stays with the company

684
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,200
because of you.

685
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,680
Xiaoqi's financial status?

686
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,480
What? She's rich?

687
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,320
Stop it.

688
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,320
Let's order.

689
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,680
You don't know it?

690
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,160
After the break-up with Fang Leng,

691
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,080
Xiaoqi visited the Chairman

692
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,680
and got a huge sum of break-up compensation.

693
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,280
Impossible.

694
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,720
She's not like that.

695
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,480
It's nothing wrong.

696
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,480
Xiaoqi is smart

697
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,080
and knows how to make quick money.

698
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,880
Look.

699
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,960
She just broke up with the elder brother,

700
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,680
and she is with the younger one now.

701
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,560
Ordinary people are not as smart as that.

702
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,560
-Enough. -You are lying.

703
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,880
Yes.

704
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,080
I took money from the Chairman.

705
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,280
But what's between Fang Lie and me

706
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,680
is absolutely not what you think.

707
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,360
If you intend to make it difficult for me with that,

708
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,200
I'm sorry

709
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,560
that I don't have time for this game of yours.

710
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,440
Bon appetite.

711
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,760
See you.

712
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,040
Xiaoqi.

713
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,680
Wait for me.

714
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,080
Xiaoqi, wait.

715
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,040
Xiaoqi.

716
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,520
Xiaoqi, wait.

717
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,840
I'm a swindler.

718
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,040
Why did you leave with me?

719
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,360
I left

720
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
to congratulate you.

721
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,440
Congratulate me?

722
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,280
Of course.

723
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,200
My parents are of the most cunning business people.

724
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,480
Ever since I was a kid,

725
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,520
I've been the only one

726
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,600
who can get money from them.

727
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,520
To my surprise,

728
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,920
you've made it too.

729
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,480
Don't you think

730
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,240
I am a money worshiper?

731
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,480
Of course not.

732
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
If you are,

733
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,760
I must become rich

734
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,680
so that you can worship me.

735
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,080
You are so kind.

736
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
The truth is

737
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I didn't want the money.

738
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,120
I was about to explain it to you.

739
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,560
No need.

740
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,120
I know Jiang Xue's

741
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,800
tricks better than anyone else.

742
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,720
You know her well?

743
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,200
You can say that.

744
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,320
She and my brother

745
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,800
are similar.

746
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,640
Neither will concede.

747
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,000
People like you and me

748
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,800
had better to stay out of their games.

749
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,400
It's not worth it.

750
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,080
Let's go.

751
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,760
OK.

752
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
I will try to restrain myself.

753
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,200
Xiaoqi,

754
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,280
has it ever occurred to you

755
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
that you can change your life

756
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,680
now that you are rich.

757
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,840
Change...

758
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Change my life?

759
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,480
Buy stuff.

760
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm taking you to the shopping mall tomorrow.

761
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,160
Bags cure all.

762
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,840
Bags?

763
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
A great sense of accomplishment

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
by bullying Chai Xiaoqi?

765
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,800
I just feel you are not well treated.

766
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,760
What does she take you?

767
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,840
A long-term meal coupon?

768
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,520
It's between her and me.

769
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
There is no need of your interference.

770
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,840
You are my boyfriend.

771
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Of course I can interfere with your business.

772
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,040
Boyfriend?

773
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,760
When will you stop

774
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,960
this game?

775
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,160
I did consider making up for you.

776
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,600
But based on what you did today,

777
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,760
I don't think you are worth it.

778
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,000
Is it all because of Chai Xiaoqi?

779
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,520
Don't bring up this name to me.

780
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,600
She does not have anything to do with me.

781
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,720
Even less with you.

782
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,760
I'll see you.

783
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,120
Don't leave.

784
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,400
Fang Leng,

785
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,960
I had been searching for a long time

786
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,760
before returning to you again.

787
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
I don't want us to do it like we did in the past.

788
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,840
You have never missed a single target in investment banking.

789
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,320
You don't have to have your first with me.

790
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,040
I've had enough.

791
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,200
What will make you happy?

792
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,520
You know it better than I do.

793
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,480
This one.

794
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,800
This one.

795
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,320
And this one.

796
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,960
This.

797
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,880
Pack them all.

798
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,040
Yes.

799
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,680
All these eye shadows, powders,

800
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,280
facial cleansers, makeup removers and makeups,

801
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,920
pack them all.

802
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,520
This one.

803
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,760
Except this green one,

804
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,840
pack all the others.

805
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,640
Yes.

806
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:32,800
And this one.

807
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,060

808

815
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,760
What's the matter, Xiaoqi?

816
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,800
You don't look happy.

817
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,400
Not happy

818
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,640
about what we have bought?

819
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
Not that.

820
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,440
There is a jewelry store.

821
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,760
Let's buy you a big diamond.

822
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,400
No.

823
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,400
People say there is no ever-lasting love

824
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,880
but there is an ever-lasting diamond.

825
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,560
Let's go.

826
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,120
No.

827
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,280
A diamond is nothing but an elemental crystal

828
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,160
composed of carbon.

829
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
And about these bags,

830
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,040
however delicate they look,

831
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,400
they still can't change my life.

832
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,840
And these cosmetics,

833
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,160
However beautiful I look

834
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,320
with them on my face,

835
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,840
if no one appreciate it,

836
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,240
I don't feel

837
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,200
very happy.

838
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,080
Xiaoqi,

839
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,880
what on earth will make you happy?

840
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,240
Return them all.

841
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,760
I don't want the money.

842
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,080
There is a donation box

843
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,200
in the store.

844
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,720
Donate it all.

845
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,160
Please.

846
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,200
Donate it.

847
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,600
Donate?

848
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:08,960
Eh?

849
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,920
Donate it?

850
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,000
So many... and...

851
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,520
Is Mr. Fang here?

852
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,080
No.

853
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,920
No?

854
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,200
No.

855
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,680
He's not here.

856
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,480
Not here.

857
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,840
Ah.

858
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,560
One second.

859
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,160
Wait.

860
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,360
You first.

861
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,240
Up you go.

862
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,960
Up you go.

863
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,640
That was close.

864
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,160
Eh?

865
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,800
Where are you going?

866
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,600
Get in.

867
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,040
Why are you avoiding me?

868
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,120
Eh?

869
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,480
The elevator was loaded.

870
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,600
So can you get closer now?

871
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,640
Oh.

872
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,680
Am I scary?

873
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,640
Eh,

874
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,280
no.

875
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,680
In front of Jiang Xue yesterday,

876
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,000
why didn't you treat me

877
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,120
like you always do?

878
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,640
I wanted to

879
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,880
but I didn't want to expose you.

880
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,840
Don't worry about me.

881
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
I really want to keep you at arm's length.

882
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Every girl I break up with

883
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,680
will happily leave me alone

884
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,040
as long as they get what they want.

885
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
Why are you not like them?

886
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,000
Why do I feel like falling ill

887
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,000
once I get close to you?

888
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
I am the one who falls ill.

889
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
Dare you look at me?

890
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,000
Why not? I've got nothing to lose.

891
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,800
I would never ever

892
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,280
fall for a girl like you.

893
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,080
I'm going to find out from your eyes

894
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,800
all about our past,

895
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,240
all good times

896
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,280
and bad times.

897
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,560
I want to know them all.

898
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,920
Don't get close to me.

899
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,600
I can't control myself when you get close.

900
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,680
Ah!

901
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,360
Are you alright, Xiaoqi?

902
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,640
Don't get close!

903
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,680
It's worse this time.

904
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,560
What's happening to me?

905
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,720
Are you alright?

906
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,040
Don't get close.

907
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,880
Please!

908
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Find your way out now.

909
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
I can't control it for long.

910
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,440
The car is going to fall.

911
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,360
Find your way out!

912
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,160
Mr. Fang.

913
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,800
We are trapped in the elevator.

914
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,960
Find out the cause.

915
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,160
The techs are working on it.

916
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,560
Please hold on.

917
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,760
We'll fix it soon.

918
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,560
Do you have elevator phobia?

919
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,080
No.

920
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,960
Don't come close.

921
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't come close.

922
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,000
Don't come close.

923
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Here, take this.

924
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,040
Don't come close please.

925
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,840
Don't do this, Xiaoqi.

926
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,600
I am a disaster.

927
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll get you killed.

928
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,320
Even if you are my disaster,

929
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,160
I will be your savior.

930
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,640
I will not die here.

931
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,040
Nor will you, Xiaoqi.

932
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,000
It's weird.

933
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,640
The safety switch has been turned on,

934
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,120
and the relay has been put in operation.

935
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,840
Why doesn't it work?

936
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,480
Hurry. It's about their lives.

937
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,320
Hurry.

938
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,000
OK.

939
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,800
Try other safety switches.

940
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Get out now.

941
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,400
We'll get out together.

942
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,000
Get out now.

943
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,440
Come.

944
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,960
No.

945
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,280
I can't hold it long.

946
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,680
Get out.

947
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,280
Nonsense.

948
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,600
Stand up.

949
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:22,960
Let's get out.

950
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,400
Don't touch me.

951
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,960
Stand up.

952
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,360
Don't touch me.

953
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,240
Leave me alone.

954
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,720
Get out now!

955
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,320
Get out.

956
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,680
Mr. Fang.

957
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,160
Let's go together.

958
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,560
Mr. Fang!

959
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,200
Get out.

960
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,920
Mr. Fang,

961
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
come out, Mr. Fang.

962
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,640
Get out!

963
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,080
Mr. Fang!

964
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,240
Out!

965
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,560
Mr. Fang!

966
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,480
Mr. Fang!

967
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,080
I told you to get out,

968
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm using a lot of energy now.

969
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,240
It's hardly possible to open it again.

970
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,280
Why didn't you get out?

971
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,560
Because I know you are frightened.

972
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,960
I can't get out alone.

973
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,240
If I did,

974
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
I would be the one frightened.

975
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,680
I'd rather stay here with you

976
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,160
than get out alone

977
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,560
and taste the horror of losing you.

978
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,080
You have forgotten me.

979
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,560
How can you lose me?

980
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,840
Yes.

981
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,040
In my eyes,

982
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,960
you are insignificant.

983
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,360
But it's weird.

984
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,880
Every time I think of someone bullying you,

985
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,520
I will get mad.

986
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
If I were Fang Lie,

987
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,480
I would have returned

988
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,560
all the insults they gave you.

989
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,920
But I am Fang Leng

990
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,120
and I can't do what I want.

991
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,200
I can only watch you

992
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,000
from afar, saying nothing.

993
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,800
You...

994
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,200
Do you still care for me?

995
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,540
Ever since I met you,

996
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

997
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

998
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,500
only you.

999
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,700
We're out of reach

1000
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,020
but appreciate each other.

1001
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:35,820
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

1002
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,860
The yearning invades

1003
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,420
and lurks in my mind.

1004
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:49,980
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

1005
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,060
I'm getting addicted to it

1006
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,380
and my sense is shielded.

1007
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:04,180
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

1008
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,340
Put the hottest heart

1009
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,660
in this cold body.

1010
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,020
I'm looking at you,

1011
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,180
and my love has nowhere to go.

1012
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,420
Ever since I met you,

1013
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

1014
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,620
Every day is a new memory

1015
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,660
which is only be about you and me.

1016
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,900
I can't lie to myself anymore.

1017
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,740
Please give me the courage to believe.

1018
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,660
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

1019
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,580
only you.

1020
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,700
Even everything becomes silent,

1021
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,820
I still have you.
