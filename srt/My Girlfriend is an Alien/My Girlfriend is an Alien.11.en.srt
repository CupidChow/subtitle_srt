1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 11

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,200
Close your eyes.

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
Close your eyes.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,880
Right,

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,600
let's adjust our breathing

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,560
and relax.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,120
Relax our tired bodies after a busy day.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
With the music

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
imagine that the cells.

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,040
Imagine that the cells in your body

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,080
are dancing and flying.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,720
Slowly

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
open yourself.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,480
Relax.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,080
How's that?

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,920
Do you feel yourself being opened?

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Before I'm opened,

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,620
can you take your hands

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,940
off my chest?

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,100
I... I didn't mean it.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,580
Don't be so naughty again.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Did you run into some difficulties?

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,360
No, I didn't.

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Do you want to ask for leave

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
or an advance on your salary?

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,440
Can't I just wanna be nice to you?

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,920
Yesterday you cold-shouldered me

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
and today you just wanna be nice to me.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm not as gullible as Fang Lie.

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,980
What should I say?

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:54,980
Praise him.

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,700
Praise him.

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,680
Praise him highly.

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,560
Because

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,220
I want to create opportunities to be with you.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,220
Because for me,

54
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,460
you are particularly perfect,

55
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,700
handsome

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,500
and special.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,840
Are you serious?

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Yes.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,160
Are you lying to me?

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,240
I know what you're thinking.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,520
Your little tricks

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
are useless.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,140
You've known it?

64
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,520
You ingratiated yourself with me

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,920
just to make me approve your resign.

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,280
I...

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,760
Nice try.

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,160
But

69
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,520
I'd advise you to give up.

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,360
What a villain.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
What are you doing here early in the morning?

72
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,380
I want to go to work with you.

73
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,200
Let's run to the company today.

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,780
What do you think?

75
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
I read that

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,420
regular exercise

77
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,900
can reduce our serotonin.

78
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,140
Let's run to the company together

79
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,620
and it'll relieve your stress.

80
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:29,980
What do you say?

81
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,580
Haven't given up yet?

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,620
Of course not.

83
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,840
I will persist on what I've decided to do.

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,360
Let's go.

85
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,560
Okay.

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,240
You asked for it.

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,640
Whether you can catch up with me

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,540
will depend on your ability.

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,560
Hey.

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,840
Fang Leng,

91
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,520
wait for me.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,240
Fang Leng!

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,240
Fang Leng.

94
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,000
Fang Leng!

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,880
My goodness,

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,560
as an alien,

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
I couldn't even outrun an earthling.

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,280
Do you think there's nothing I can do?

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,120
What are you doing?

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
Why did you turn back?

101
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,080
There are traffic lights ahead.

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,080
Give me your hand.

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,520
What for?

104
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Aren't you afraid of nothing

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,680
except crossing the road?

106
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,420
Don't get it wrong.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,600
I just

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,200
don't want you to be hurt

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
because I'll have to take responsibility for that.

110
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,300
You want to leave that much?

111
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,440
Yes?

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,200
You've tried so hard to quit

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
so that you don't have to see me, haven't you?

114
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Why?

115
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,960
In fact,

116
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,520
my purpose is not to quit.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,480
I've forgiven you

118
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,280
for the sapphire issue.

119
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
You wanted it so much.

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
You must have your reasons.

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,680
Let's pretend that

122
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,640
it never happened.

123
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay.

124
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
So do you still insist on quitting?

125
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,320
Actually

126
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,520
I have had a reason for staying.

127
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm going to stay

128
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,060
even if you didn't say those things.

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,520
Besides,

130
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,440
I have nowhere else to go.

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,440
In addition,

132
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,840
I'm staying because I want to do something.

133
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,040
What is it?

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,560
I wanna help someone.

135
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm very

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,180
important to him.

137
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,720
Let's go.

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,480
You asked me to come here

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
just to see that?

140
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,120
Not merely that.

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Mr. Fang could even

142
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,640
cancel the sapphire case for her.

143
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,320
Do you still think she's just an ant?

144
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
I didn't expect

145
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,360
Fang Leng would let her stay.

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,480
Looks like

147
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
we can only make her leave on her own volition.

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,240
What do you mean?

149
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,280
It's time

150
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,740
to use this video.

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,360
With your ability,

152
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,560
you'll do it flawlessly, won't you?

153
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,480
Of course.

154
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,720
But if she leaves now,

155
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,700
her relationship with the sapphire will...

156
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,180
Don't mention that sapphire again.

157
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,860
I understand that

158
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,240
you care about your project.

159
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,500
But the most important now is Fang Leng.

160
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,880
If Chai Xiaoqi doesn't leave,

161
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,680
how can I get close to him?

162
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,920
Understand?

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,080
Yes.

164
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,460
=The priceless sapphire of F Group was stolen.=

165
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,860
=It's suspected to be an insider.=

166
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,240
Isn't her the president's secretary?

167
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
That seems to be true.

168
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,820
=The thief seems like the president's secretary.=

169
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
=Oh my god! How wicked she is!
Does she enter the company just for stealing sapphire?=

170
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
She's that secretary, isn't she?

171
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,280
Yes, she really is.

172
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,040
It is her.

173
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,960
Yes, it is.

174
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,840
Who is so annoying?

175
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
What brings you here?

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,580
I'm here to give you documents

177
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,380
as well as

178
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,700
to see you.

179
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,000
Did my brother send you here?

180
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,280
Did he say anything?

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,180
Does he blame me?

182
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,700
What does he blame you for?

183
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,660
He has refused to see me

184
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,460
since I entered the company.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
He must be resenting me for giving up painting

186
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,320
and colluding with my mom.

187
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,080
He won't.

188
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,540
Although he's

189
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,500
overbearing, sly,

190
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
full of mischief

191
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,640
and always tries to trap me,

192
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,500
he won't resent you

193
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,480
because of that.

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
He's not that petty.

195
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,880
Weird.

196
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,440
The other day you gnashed your teeth at him.

197
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,320
Why did you suddenly put in a good word for him?

198
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,680
Because I'm forgiving,

199
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,520
right?

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,920
Anyway, I'm trying to

201
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,800
find a solution for him now.

202
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,360
But

203
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,760
it's really tricky.

204
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,280
I see.

205
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,080
You still can't leave him.

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
However,

207
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,680
my brother's bark

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
is worse than his bite.

209
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
He seems to be

210
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,380
mad at you.

211
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,720
But underneath,

212
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,880
you have no idea how happy he is.

213
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,840
If he had been mad at you,

214
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,500
he would have sent you away.

215
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,800
Really?

216
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,480
Of course.

217
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,680
Among my countless former sisters-in-law,

218
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,160
you're the only one who's still hanging on.

219
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,560
I think

220
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
you should have a heart-to-heart talk with my brother.

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,920
You gotta know each other

222
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
even if you just want to be friends.

223
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,760
Have a heart-to-heart talk with him?

224
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,040
That's too hard.

225
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
I can't do it. I can't.

226
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,480
You have to make him open up.

227
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,760
For example,

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,840
you can take him to some good places

229
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
and let him relax.

230
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,160
Take him to relax.

231
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,360
Where can he relax?

232
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,680
I've got it.

233
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,240
There's a place

234
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,280
which can not only let him relax

235
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,540
but also fill him with excitement.

236
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,740
Where? Take me, too.

237
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,240
Take...

238
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,360
Take me, too.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,800
What?

240
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,960
Here we are.

241
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,120
This is it.

242
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,120
Oh boy.

243
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,920
Oh boy.

244
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,280
Oh boy.

245
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,160
He's great, isn't he?

246
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
Do you seriously want me to go into this kind of place?

247
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
Don't refuse it so soon.

248
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,160
I've been here before.

249
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,260
It's really nice.

250
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,480
I was very impressed

251
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
by the model show here.

252
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm going.

253
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
Don't go.

254
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,520
It was hard for me to find this place.

255
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,240
And I've booked seats in the front row.

256
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't go.

257
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
I won't repeat myself.

258
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Okay.

259
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,160
I won't force you.

260
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,000
Go.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,680
I'll go in myself.

262
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,760
You think I'll let you stay here alone?

263
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Fine.

264
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,520
Let go of me.

265
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll go back with you.

266
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,800
You'll behave?

267
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,360
Yes.

268
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,840
Let's go.

269
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,400
Okay.

270
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,720
Hey!

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,160
Here, here, here.

272
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,360
Give this to your manager.

273
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,680
Cancel all of the activities

274
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
of models tonight,

275
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,000
whether male or female.

276
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,180
I'll take the consequences.

277
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,300
Yes, sir.

278
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,160
Chill out.

279
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,600
It's so dark here.

280
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
No one will recognize you.

281
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,080
Let's just be a normal couple

282
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,120
and relax.

283
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,280
We'll drink

284
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,100
and appreciate those cute guys.

285
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,000
How enjoyable that is.

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,920
Do you think normal couples

287
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,840
will come to watch this?

288
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,640
It's coming. It's coming.

289
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,640
The model show.

290
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
It'll begin right away.

291
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,480
They're super fit,

292
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,040
just like you.

293
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,360
I nearly mistook them for you.

294
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

295
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm sorry to inform you that

296
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
today's show has been canceled.

297
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,560
In order to make up for it,

298
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,660
we'll give away a tray of fruits to every table.

299
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,760
We hope you'll forgive us.

300
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,600
Thank you.

301
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,240
How could you cancel it?

302
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,800
How could they cancel it?

303
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,280
Let's go.

304
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,400
No.

305
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,760
They're not performing.

306
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,000
I will.

307
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,200
Hey.

308
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,640
Hey!

309
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,280
What are you gonna do?

310
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,120
Hello, everyone.

311
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,480
I have a boyfriend.

312
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,120
He's an earthling.

313
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,720
By accident,

314
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,120
we became a couple.

315
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,440
Perhaps one day,

316
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
I'll leave him

317
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,280
and perhaps

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
he'll forget me.

319
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,600
But at least now

320
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,040
we're still together.

321
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to heal him and help him.

322
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
So now

323
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,160
I want to sing a song for him.

324
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,400
Its name is

325
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
In A Dream.

326
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,360
I flied to the outer space

327
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,080
and fell into a pink dream.

328
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,680
Your smiling eyes are glistening.

329
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,040
Like meteors shooting across the sky,

330
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,280
you lit up my dream.

331
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,200
My dream.

332
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,920
Like those shiny stars,

333
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,880
even if I'm falling into the black hole,

334
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,160
I won't move a little bit.

335
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,000
How can I travel a light year

336
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,080
and meet you in the Galaxy?

337
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,480
I...

338
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,720
I don't wanna wake up

339
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,840
because I'm afraid you'll be gone.

340
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,520
I'm here every second

341
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,720
and I'm not gonna leave.

342
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,200
I don't wanna wake up

343
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
because I'm afraid you'll run away.

344
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,040
I love you deeply every minute

345
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,320
and I'm not gonna leave.

346
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,640
I'm here every second

347
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,600
and I'm not gonna leave.

348
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't wanna come down from the sky

349
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,520
because I'm afraid you'll run away.

350
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,080
I love you deeply every minute

351
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,840
and I'm not gonna leave.

352
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,640
I flied to the outer space

353
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,360
and fell into a pink dream.

354
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,680
I don't wanna wake up

355
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,800
because I'm afraid you'll be gone.

356
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,480
I'm here every second

357
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,680
and I'm not gonna leave.

358
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't wanna come down from the sky

359
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
because I'm afraid you'll run away.

360
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,840
I love you deeply every minute

361
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,120
and I'm not gonna leave.

362
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,560
I flied to the outer space

363
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,280
and fell into a pink dream.

364
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,960
Bravo!

365
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,320
Bye-bye.

366
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,240
I'm not satisfied yet.

367
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,120
Sing it again,

368
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,760
will you?

369
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I like that song.

370
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,400
From today on,

371
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,560
you're not allowed to come to this kind of place again.

372
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,480
Why?

373
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,520
Isn't it nice?

374
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,560
You were like Fang Lie.

375
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,240
Fang Lie?

376
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,920
Yes.

377
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,120
When I met Fang Lie,

378
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
he was standing on the stage

379
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,520
like a little prince.

380
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,840
Though you're not as professional as him,

381
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,120
you've been quite good already.

382
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Why didn't you take him here, then?

383
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,920
Because I want to cure you.

384
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,120
Doctor Zhang said you were incapable of love.

385
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,560
I want to show you

386
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,840
what's being capable of love.

387
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Those people inside

388
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,320
can quickly fall in love with someone

389
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,680
and they're not afraid of being hurt in a relationship.

390
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Don't you

391
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
want to be like them?

392
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,920
I see.

393
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,120
You did so many things

394
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,840
just to cure me.

395
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,480
Then you'll leave me

396
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,200
and be with Fang Lie who you really like, right?

397
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
What has it got to do with Fang Lie?

398
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,080
I just...

399
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,840
I don't need your pity.

400
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,200
Yes.

401
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm a patient.

402
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,200
I even selfishly want a kind of love

403
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,920
in which even if I forget her,

404
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
she'll fall in love with me again and again.

405
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,140
She'll completely belong to me.

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,440
I thought I had found that person.

407
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
I realized that I couldn't forget her

408
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,520
and I cared so much about her.

409
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,960
I thought she was different from the others.

410
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,440
But in the end,

411
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
she still thinks of me as a patient.

412
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
I don't need your help.

413
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
Why did you pick me, then?

414
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,040
Isn't that because

415
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,440
you want me to cure you?

416
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,720
From today on,

417
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,480
I don't need you anymore.

418
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,760
He said

419
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,960
he forgave me for stealing the sapphire.

420
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,280
He also said

421
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,800
he didn't need me anymore.

422
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,520
Kubri,

423
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
do you think we've made up

424
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,960
or we're still having a spat?

425
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,800
I have a question, too.

426
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,760
Why do you care so much what he thinks?

427
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,400
I didn't care what he thinks.

428
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,280
The earthlings' brains are just too complicated

429
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,200
and I don't get it.

430
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,600
We've made up.

431
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,600
We haven't.

432
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,960
We've made up.

433
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,520
We haven't.

434
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,080
We've made up.

435
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
We...

436
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,000
We haven't.

437
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,520
We've made up!

438
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,160
Stop!

439
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,560
If you want to know what he thinks,

440
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,360
why don't you ask someone?

441
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,360
You're right.

442
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,560
Excuse me.

443
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,360
Is Assistant Han here?

444
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,960
I don't know.

445
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
There's something else...

446
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,560
Sorry. I don't know.

447
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,640
But I haven't asked you yet.

448
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
What's going on?

449
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,400
Hello, could you tell me...

450
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,920
the...

451
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,440
I have jobs to do.

452
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,960
Ask someone else.

453
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
Hey, I was wondering

454
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,600
if...

455
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,440
Sorry, I'm busy.

456
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,480
Hello.

457
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,840
Can you...

458
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
The earthlings are so strange.

459
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,800
Look more carefully.

460
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,880
I think she's the thief on the photos.

461
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,160
So do I.

462
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
She was arranged by the president to work here.

463
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,160
What if we misunderstand?

464
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,760
There's a thief in the office.

465
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,920
We gotta watch out now.

466
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,880
Yes.

467
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,520
Assistant Han,

468
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,600
from today on,

469
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,860
Chai Xiaoqi is not allowed to butt in my treatment anymore.

470
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,680
Why?

471
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,600
Moreover,

472
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
I don't allow her to be involved in

473
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,880
anything on my work

474
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,360
and my privacy again.

475
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,800
Tell her what I said.

476
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
Yes.

477
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,120
Excuse me.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,600
Excuse me.

479
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,200
It's not time to work yet.

480
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
Why is Director Fang

481
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,640
in such a hurry?

482
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,040
He doesn't care if he's late.

483
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
Characteristically,

484
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,040
he won't run so fast

485
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,920
even if the sky is falling.

486
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,800
Go and check on him.

487
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,000
Fang Lie.

488
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,520
Director,

489
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,100
what are you doing here?

490
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,560
Where were you last night?

491
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,760
You didn't answer my calls.

492
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,240
I've got things to do yesterday

493
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,040
so I put my phone on mute.

494
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,800
What's up?

495
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,840
Come with me.

496
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,100
I need to ask you something about work.

497
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,340
Just say it here.

498
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,420
I can't say it here.

499
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,580
I want to consult you in private.

500
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
What is it?

501
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,360
Don't be so mysterious.

502
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,960
Follow me.

503
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,820
What's the matter?

504
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
You're being furtive.

505
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,460
It's revealed that the sapphire was stolen.

506
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,060
Someone branded you as a thief.

507
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,460
It has spread all over the company.

508
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,120
What?

509
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,380
How did they know

510
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,460
I stole the sapphire?

511
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,240
What?

512
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
You really stole it?

513
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,760
Oh, no, I'm done.

514
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,840
What shall I do?

515
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
What shall we do?

516
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,660
What if my brother calls the police?

517
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,520
Will he call the police and have you arrested?

518
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,480
No, he won't.

519
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
He said he forgave me.

520
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,400
It's too late to say anything now.

521
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,500
How about this?

522
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,700
Come with me and hide yourself.

523
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,700
In case it becomes a major problem.

524
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,120
No.

525
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
The sapphire is mine in the first place.

526
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

527
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,880
Anyway,

528
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,440
thank you

529
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,700
for specially coming upstairs to tell me about this.

530
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,400
The sapphire is yours?

531
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
Well,

532
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,080
it's a long story.

533
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,360
I'll explain it to you

534
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,840
when I get an opportunity, okay?

535
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,840
No wonder you asked me to go to the

536
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,100
Scientific Research Department with you before.

537
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

538
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,600
I apologize.

539
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
I lied to all of you.

540
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm sorry.

541
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,800
It's okay.

542
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,840
If you had told me earlier,

543
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,000
perhaps we would have stolen it together.

544
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,760
We're both troublemakers anyway, aren't we?

545
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,600
Alright,

546
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm in a better mood now.

547
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,760
I gotta get back to work.

548
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,920
Thanks.

549
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm off.

550
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,720
You're going back just like that?

551
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,440
Whatever other people say,

552
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,780
I have to solve my own problem,

553
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,240
don't I?

554
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,440
Besides,

555
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm not a coward who

556
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,260
hides behind others when things happen.

557
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,540
Don't worry.

558
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,420
I'm off.

559
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,760
You can handle it.

560
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,240
I can handle it.

561
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,620
I'll always support you.

562
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,880
Okay. Bye-bye.

563
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,380
What were you doing just now?

564
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,460
It's a personal matter.

565
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,460
Is Fang Leng at his office now?

566
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,100
I need to talk to him.

567
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Mr. Fang

568
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,860
doesn't want to see you now.

569
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,080
He asked you to

570
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,400
stop taking part in

571
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,420
his treatment and work for the time being.

572
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,440
What?

573
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,820
Is... is he gonna fire me?

574
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,360
Don't get me wrong.

575
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,680
He just wants you to stop doing your job.

576
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,480
He didn't say he was firing you.

577
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,760
So

578
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,280
what should I do now?

579
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,480
You

580
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,640
have lots of things to do.

581
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,200
For example,

582
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,280
you can assist your colleagues

583
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,680
or

584
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,660
order takeouts for us.

585
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,420
I have no idea what's wrong with Mr. Fang, either.

586
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,100
But I think

587
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,180
you'd better not

588
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,080
piss him off now.

589
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,620
I don't want to see him either.

590
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,780
Why could she stay here?

591
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,440
She is the thief.

592
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,860
Keep gossiping.

593
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,900
I can't hear you, anyway.

594
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,420
What does he think of me now?

595
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,420
Pardon?

596
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,820
Stop pretending.

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,760
Do your work.

598
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,740
The president has suspended you.

599
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,980
Stop lording it over us.

600
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,020
Assistant Han asked you to

601
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,680
be our helper.

602
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,260
Don't kick me when I'm down.

603
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,940
Go and tell Assistant Han you don't wanna do it.

604
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,680
You're a rat everyone detests now.

605
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,820
No one will stick up for you.

606
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,320
Low-level workplace game.

607
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,880
I won't argue with you.

608
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,080
Chai Xiaoqi,

609
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,560
my clients are here.

610
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,820
Go downstairs and greet them for me.

611
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,960
Why me?

612
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,220
Otherwise, shall I do it myself?

613
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,240
Hey,

614
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,840
Chai Xiaoqi,

615
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,100
the copier is broken.

616
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,100
Go and repair it.

617
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,800
Xiaoqi,

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,080
what is this for?

619
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,400
You're an alien

620
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,980
and you're repairing this outmoded machine.

621
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,240
Aren't you ashamed?

622
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,680
You don't know.

623
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,120
What don't I know?

624
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,480
Don't you wish to be fired?

625
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,320
Grab this chance and leave.

626
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,840
I would leave

627
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,440
as I wish before.

628
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,680
But if I leave now,

629
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,520
they'll think I'm guilty about stealing the sapphire.

630
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,040
I have to

631
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,240
wait for a while if I'm leaving.

632
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,840
Got it?

633
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,160
Are you just gonna let those humans treat you like that?

634
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,860
Without Fang Leng's backing,

635
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
can you handle the sapphire by yourself?

636
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,400
Why can't I handle it?

637
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,040
At any rate, I'm an alien.

638
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,080
I won't be defeated by this group of earthlings.

639
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,560
Okay.

640
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,040
I gotta order takeouts for them now.

641
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:21,960
Let's go.

642
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,640
Have a good day.

643
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,680
You're always welcome here.

644
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,240
Excuse me,

645
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,480
ten classic set meals, please.

646
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,800
Ten classic set meals.

647
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Xiaoqi.

648
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,480
Shouldn't you be at work? Why did you come back?

649
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm back to order takeouts for my colleagues

650
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,080
and to see you.

651
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,900
You're Mr. Fang's girlfriend.

652
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,960
Why do you still do this kind of job?

653
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,960
I wanted to treat them to lunch

654
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,320
so I came here in person.

655
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,600
What I usually do

656
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,240
are all things that are especially important.

657
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,280
I won't bother about trifles of this kind.

658
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,480
You know what?

659
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,160
Recently I completed a big project

660
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,160
and everyone in the company has known about it.

661
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,880
They all have to make way for me now.

662
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,160
I'm so pleased.

663
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,120
Really?

664
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,760
That's awesome.

665
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,400
How about this?

666
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,000
In order to celebrate that,

667
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,720
I'll ask the cook to be generous with the food.

668
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,240
Wang.

669
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,380
Here are your lunch.

670
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,880
Where are they?

671
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,520
Hey, Assistant Han.

672
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,320
You asked me to order takeouts for you.

673
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,560
Why is everybody gone?

674
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,480
There was something urgent.

675
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
We're all working outside.

676
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,080
I'm sorry, Xiaoqi.

677
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,900
It's likely that we won't go back today.

678
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,760
And yes,

679
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,520
you can eat the takeouts yourself.

680
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,200
Hello. Hello.

681
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,960
Ms. Chai prepared them so meticulously.

682
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,560
I can't waste them, can I?

683
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,440
Fine, I'll eat them myself.

684
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,800
Eat them all.

685
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,500
It's awful. I'm too full.

686
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,940
This is so boring.

687
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,560
I want to work.

688
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,320
Listen,

689
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,500
the first floor downstairs,

690
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,780
the 24th floor upstairs,

691
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,940
the 10th floor in the middle,

692
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,460
and there are 3 clients.

693
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,160
Go and greet them.

694
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,040
Go, go, go.

695
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,460
Take the document to that guy.

696
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,900
You know who he is.

697
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,240
Go.

698
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,540
My toilet is broken.

699
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,500
Go and repair it.

700
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,460
Go right now.

701
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,600
And you.

702
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,780
What are you doing all day long?

703
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,900
Stop eating.

704
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,780
Focus on your work.

705
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,500
And you.

706
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,340
Is it my fault to be pretty?

707
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,260
What do you avoid me for?

708
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,900
Listen up, all of you,

709
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,220
don't exclude your colleague because she made a mistake.

710
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,920
Understood?

711
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,000
Even though the president suspended her,

712
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,840
you can't leave without her.

713
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,000
What's the matter with you?

714
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,780
You'll hurt her. Don't you know that?

715
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,060
We're sorry.

716
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,980
Please forgive us.

717
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,500
We're sorry, Xiaoqi.

718
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,640
That's more like it.

719
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,840
You must know that

720
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
she didn't mean to steal the sapphire.

721
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,200
It's unkind of you to ignore her.

722
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,000
Besides,

723
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
she's new here.

724
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,800
She only knows you little cute guys

725
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
and you abandoned her.

726
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,600
Won't she be bored to death?

727
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,760
We're sorry.

728
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,240
Okay. Okay.

729
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,440
We won't do that again.

730
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
You're right.

731
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,800
It's super boring to be alone.

732
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,680
Therefore,

733
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,500
I'd strongly advise that

734
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,560
you be nice to this colleague of yours.

735
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,240
Got it?

736
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,880
Don't ignore her.

737
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,960
Come on, clap your hands for her.

738
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
Clap your hands.

739
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,480
Yes. Clap your hands.

740
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,720
Yes, yes.

741
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,680
That's more like it.

742
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,880
Alas.

743
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,120
I'm done. I'm done.

744
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,200
Get up.

745
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,540
It's time to knock off.

746
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,600
Keep quiet.

747
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,440
I'm sleeping.

748
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,400
You'll catch a cold if you keep sleeping here.

749
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:28,960
Get up.

750
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,000
Who is talking so annoyingly

751
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,040
in the middle of the night?

752
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,320
Can you cut it out?

753
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,520
Jesus!

754
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,260
What are you doing here?

755
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,480
Don't sleep in the company.

756
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,960
Go home.

757
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,040
Who asked you to work till so late?

758
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,060
None of your business.

759
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,280
You asked me not to meddle in your affairs.

760
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,560
You stay out of mine, too.

761
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,360
It's so late already.

762
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,040
Are you going home alone?

763
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Why? Are you scared?

764
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
I'm not escorting you home.

765
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
I mean

766
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
you worked overtime

767
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,040
for the company.

768
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,340
I may as well drive you home.

769
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,520
Who worked overtime?

770
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,800
I fell asleep because I was too full.

771
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:36,960
In addition,

772
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,500
I'd like to walk alone for relaxation.

773
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,220
You don't have to drive me home.

774
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,400
I pressed the button

775
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,380
so I'll take it first.

776
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,240
Now that you don't want to see me,

777
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,400
why do you care about me?

778
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,480
Take me home.

779
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
Chinese Sauerkraut Fish.

780
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,860
I can't go home, anyway.

781
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,320
Just do it.

782
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,580
What are you doing here?

783
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,860
Do you know it's dangerous?

784
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,900
Look at the lights when you cross the road.

785
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,780
Don't rush forward rashly.

786
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,540
Keep calm.

787
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,800
It's probable that I'll spend the rest of my life on earth.

788
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,400
I should learn to go across the road, shouldn't I?

789
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,160
Just go. Don't be afraid.

790
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,520
You can do it,

791
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,560
Xiaoqi.

792
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,020
Look at the traffic light.

793
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,760
Look around.

794
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,800
Xiaoqi, Come on. Come on. Come on.

795
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,520
It's okay.

796
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,440
It's okay.

797
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,980
It's okay. You're safe.

798
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,020
Ever since I met you,

799
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,700
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

800
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,100
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

801
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,980
only you.

802
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,180
We're out of reach

803
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,500
but appreciate each other.

804
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:48,300
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

805
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,340
The yearning invades

806
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,900
and lurks in my mind.

807
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:02,460
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

808
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,540
I'm getting addicted to it

809
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,860
and my sense is shielded.

810
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:16,660
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

811
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,820
Put the hottest heart

812
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,140
in this cold body.

813
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,500
I'm looking at you,

814
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,660
and my love has nowhere to go.

815
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,900
Ever since I met you,

816
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,820
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

817
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,100
Every day is a new memory

818
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,140
which is only be about you and me.

819
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,380
I can't lie to myself anymore.

820
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,220
Please give me the courage to believe.

821
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,140
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

822
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,060
only you.

823
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,180
Even everything becomes silent,

824
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,300
I still have you.
