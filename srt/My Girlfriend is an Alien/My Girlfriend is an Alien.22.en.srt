1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,540
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 22

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,120
Do you want to get rid of us so much?

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,240
Since you know it,

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,960
why are you here?

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:36,800
Let's go.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,120
Xiaoqi.

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,920
Are you alright?

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,000
How are you feeling?

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,960
Silly you.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,120
You shouldn't have played if you are wounded.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,080
I just want to make it difficult for you so you will back off.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,680
You should have gone home.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,720
No.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,160
What no?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,320
I can't give you to him.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,360
Okay.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,160
If you insist

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,560
on making trouble,

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,120
I have to look for ways to torture you both every day.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,880
Let's see

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
how long you can hold on.

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,240
Is that how much you want to leave me?

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,640
For days

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,320
I've been thinking about the perfume plan you have made.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,920
I've been wondering

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,320
why

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,960
this perfume seems so familiar.

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,800
It's as if I knew it before.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,840
So I went to the perfumer,

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
who said this was my perfume.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,960
You were certainly thinking of me

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,200
when you made it. Right?

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,800
I don't understand it.

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,560
Why does someone who cares about me so much

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,600
suddenly want to push me away?

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,600
What on earth do you want?

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
Does it matter what I want?

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
Ever since I came here,

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,760
nothing has turned out the way I want it to be.

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,920
I detested you,

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,440
and became your girlfriend.

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,440
I want to go home

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,600
but can't

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
because of one person.

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,840
It feels like I were chasing a shadow,

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
always running

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
and running.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,360
I thought

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
I was close

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,040
to what I want,

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,520
but in the end

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,200
I only found that

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
I have lost myself.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm just a little tired.

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
I want to stop to find myself.

73
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Why do you keep pushing me?

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,440
I promise

75
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,080
I will not go after you

76
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,560
from now on.

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,760
No matter you want to be alone

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
or want to be with someone else,

79
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,240
I will no longer interfere.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
But I will wait for you.

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,360
You will come to me.

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,240
Your wound has just recovered.

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,160
How could you play tennis?

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,840
If you hurt yourself

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
and the wound relapses,

86
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,680
the Chairman will blame me.

87
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,160
I...

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,640
Let's go.

89
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,240
Xiaoqi,

90
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,160
here you are.

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
How was it going between you and Mr. Fang?

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Are you really

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,920
shifting to Fang Lie?

94
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,040
Ms. Chai,

95
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,600
if you

96
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
have made a decision to do something,

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,520
do you really

98
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,000
have to settle it?

99
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Probably.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
What?

101
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,440
Why do I feel so sad?

102
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
So sad.

103
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,440
It'll be all right tomorrow.

104
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,840
It'll be all right tomorrow.

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,880
Come in.

106
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,520
Fang Lie, you ask for me?

107
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
Was everything OK

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,920
at the court yesterday?

109
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,440
Don't I look OK?

110
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
You took off without a word

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
and didn't pick up your phone.

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,640
I thought I might have hurt you in the game.

113
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Why so much explanation?

114
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Do you worry that I misunderstand you and think you care for me?

115
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,000
If there is nothing else,

116
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,400
I'll see you.

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,240
Wait.

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,920
About the perfume planning,

119
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
you are no longer in charge.

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,840
Why?

121
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,600
I have stopped the project.

122
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,640
But we have put great effort in it

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,720
and it has been approved.

124
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Why is it stopped?

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,760
Do I have to explain every decision

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,000
to a subordinate?

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
I thought it would be fun.

128
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,120
Now I have had my fun,

129
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,480
I just want to stop it.

130
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,560
But...

131
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,040
No more.

132
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,840
I won't change my decision.

133
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,800
Leave.

134
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
He was all right yesterday.

135
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,560
He now seems a totally different person.

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Weird.

137
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,160
Still nothing about Chai Xiaoqi

138
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,720
after such a long time?

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,200
Miss Jiang,

140
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,400
you have no right to say that.

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,520
To investigate her,

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,480
I have gone through

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,120
all the camera footage of the company.

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,240
I don't think anyone is busier than I have been.

145
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,040
Just say it.

146
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,640
What have you found?

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,120
Miss Jiang,

148
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,080
do you think someone can disappear into thin air?

149
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,640
Nonsense.

150
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,080
I've sent you the material.

151
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Check it yourself.

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
It's getting more and more interesting.

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,880
Welcome to today's Gossips.

154
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,640
First of all, let's look at the breaking news.

155
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,120
The famous playboy,

156
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
Fang Leng, President of F Group

157
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
as shown behind me,

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,880
has been said to have amnesia.

159
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,480
It is yet unknown whether

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,240
it's only recent

161
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,800
or a relapse.

162
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,040
The company's stocks

163
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,920
seem to be affected

164
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
because of

165
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,400
Fang Leng's newly disclosed condition.

166
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,160
It is said that

167
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,000
the news, disclosed anonymously on the internet,

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
has been spreading quickly

169
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
and hit the headline just overnight.

170
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,400
Fang Leng's amnesia

171
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
will have huge impacts on F Group.

172
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,200
Subsidiaries of Fang Leng

173
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,680
will also face severe challenges.

174
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
It's said that he has been working
without disclosing his condition

175
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,400
in order to stay as the successor of F Group.

176
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,840
Up to now neither Fang Leng nor F Group

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,600
has given any clear comment.

178
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
We will keep you updated.

179
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
Stay tuned

180
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,160
for the latest updates from the field.

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,760
Mr. Fang,

182
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,520
please tell us

183
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,560
if you really have amnesia.

184
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,760
Mr. Fang,

185
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,680
you've been keeping such a big secret

186
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
from us for such a long time.

187
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,640
Shouldn't you

188
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,360
take the credit for

189
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
going through all the trouble?

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,720
The directors are furiously

191
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,280
waiting for your explanation.

192
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,200
Leng,

193
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,920
is it true?

194
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
It's none of your business.

195
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Get on with your work.

196
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Why have you kept it

197
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,600
from me?

198
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
You have seen the reporters outside.

199
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,800
It must be a mess in the company now.

200
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,680
How about you?

201
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,840
It doesn't matter.

202
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,080
What matters is how to pull the company together.

203
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,640
Take care of yourself.

204
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,360
What's the meaning of

205
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,080
working here?

206
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Hurry.

207
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,200
There is Mr. Fang. Hurry.

208
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,040
Hello every one...

209
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,640
Hello...

210
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,000
Fang Leng has now arrived at the company

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,040
but has not comment on the amnesia.

212
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,760
Amnesia?

213
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
Is it...

214
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,280
Amnesia!

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,760
Think about the impacts on the company.

216
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,400
Read this.

217
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,840
It's on the headline everywhere.

218
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,560
Mr. Fang,

219
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,280
How do you explain the news?

220
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,600
As the President,

221
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
how could you let it happen?

222
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,200
Please explain it.

223
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,440
Enough.

224
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,440
We don't know yet whether the news is true or not.

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
What are you so worried for?

226
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
It's a big news. How can we not be worried?

227
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Tell us

228
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,960
what on earth is going on.

229
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,120
Several years ago,

230
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,040
I was diagnosed with amnesia.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,880
It's true.

232
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I will bear all the consequences

233
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
concerning its impacts on the company.

234
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,640
How?

235
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,000
You have lost your memory

236
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,520
and you have kept it from us for so long.

237
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
Have you ever thought about the consequences?

238
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,560
That's right.

239
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Right.

240
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,240
Who knows what else

241
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,000
he is keeping from us.

242
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,560
Right.

243
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,480
How can he do this?

244
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,840
Stop it.

245
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,720
As the Chairman,

246
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
I am partly responsible for this.

247
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,720
But Mr. Fang

248
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
has not made any mistakes

249
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,760
during his term.

250
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,360
I'd suggest we give him a chance.

251
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,760
Even so,

252
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
he can't serve

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
as the President anymore.

254
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,920
What will people say

255
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,840
if we let someone with amnesia

256
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
control the company?

257
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,960
Right.

258
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,600
I'd suggest a general shareholders' meeting

259
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,840
to elect a new president.

260
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,720
Yes.

261
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
We should elect a new one.

262
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Directors,

263
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,160
calm down.

264
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,280
Let's listen to

265
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,880
Mr. Fang

266
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,800
before making a decision.

267
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Right?

268
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
I agree to elect a new president.

269
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,120
We are now surrounded by internal and external problems.

270
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,080
Considering the media

271
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,480
and internal opposition,

272
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,840
I think it can be settled

273
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,520
only if I resign.

274
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,840
When I leave the position,

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
the problem will solve itself.

276
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
But before that,

277
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,680
I'd like to ask for one week.

278
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,680
Mr. Fang,

279
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,640
do you have other unsettled matters?

280
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,320
My resignation concerns many aspects.

281
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,040
I have to hand over my work to the senior management.

282
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,000
Besides,

283
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,640
I'd like to announce

284
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,160
my resignation to the public.

285
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
Therefore, I hope you will

286
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,280
keep it confidential before the announcement.

287
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
Don't make it public.

288
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,160
OK.

289
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,720
No problem.

290
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,520
No problems with me.

291
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,000
Chairman,

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
what do you think?

293
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,160
Fine.

294
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,200
After one week,

295
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,680
come and resign.

296
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,800
If the news is true,

297
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
how bad is your condition?

298
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Is your life impacted?

299
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Not as bad as reported.

300
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,320
Don't worry about me.

301
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,200
Why didn't you tell me before?

302
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,640
Even when you walked in the meeting room,

303
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
I still believed the news was fake.

304
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,040
If you had told me,

305
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,800
it would not have gone this far.

306
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
If I had told you,

307
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,920
would you have allowed me to be the President?

308
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,320
Anyone of the Fang family

309
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,160
would rather resign

310
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,280
than be thrown out.

311
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,760
You have destroyed

312
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,720
all the work I've done in years.

313
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,840
I never thought

314
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,120
when I tell you about my condition,

315
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
what concerns you most is not me

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but your business.

317
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Fang Leng,

318
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,040
how did you become like this?

319
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,200
Do you need to know?

320
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,600
Is it related to your mother?

321
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
I remember you were unstable

322
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,000
when she left.

323
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,840
But everything became all right later.

324
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,520
How did it get to that?

325
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,120
You have been so busy with work,

326
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,200
have you cared about me?

327
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,880
Have you ever?

328
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,520
Chairman,

329
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,600
I will settle the matters of the company.

330
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
You may leave now.

331
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,720
Your heart has just recovered.

332
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,200
And now it's this farce.

333
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,360
Mr. Fang,

334
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
are you really going to

335
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
resign after one week?

336
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,880
Do you think I will give up so easily?

337
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,680
How is it?

338
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,520
Few know about Fang Leng's amnesia.

339
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,200
But he is exposed.

340
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Is it related to me?

341
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,520
Is it...

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,080
Have I given it away?

343
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Impossible.

344
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,760
Mr. Fang,

345
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,560
please sign this.

346
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
Stay for a while.

347
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,840
I...

348
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
I just want to ask you.

349
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,640
Are you alright?

350
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,120
All the others ask about the company.

351
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,200
You are the first to ask about me.

352
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,040
Well,

353
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm worried that your heart will go wrong.

354
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
Before this..

355
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
I... Well... Your heart...

Am I crazy?

370
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,360
I've absolutely gone crazy.

371
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,960
I swore not to see him again.

372
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,000
Why can't I control myself?

373
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,760
It was just a hug.

374
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
It doesn't mean anything.

375
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,120
He's got so much on his plate now

376
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,600
and will not have time for me.

377
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,560
What a mess!

378
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,840
It's stuffy down there.

379
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
I've come up for some air.

380
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,560
Ah.

381
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,920
About Leng's condition,

382
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,400
did you know it?

383
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,440
Yes.

384
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
It's reported that

385
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,400
he would forget people intimate to him.

386
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,160
Has he forgotten you?

387
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,440
Yes.

388
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,360
So was your break-up

389
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,880
related to his amnesia?

390
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,480
We were never together.

391
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,600
We pretended to be together

392
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,920
because I wanted

393
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
to help him with the condition.

394
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,000
Later I found

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,560
the thing I wanted in him.

396
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,680
To get it,

397
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,880
I went after him.

398
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,000
Does that mean

399
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,600
he is not so important to you?

400
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,600
Never mind.

401
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,520
Forget about it.

402
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,520
What matters now is

403
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,640
how to help Fang Leng.

404
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,600
Do you know what the company is going to do with him?

405
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,000
I am only a nominal director.

406
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,760
They will never let me

407
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,080
have a say in such matters.

408
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,240
But

409
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
I will do everything to help Leng.

410
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,920
I just feel it's weird.

411
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
Who would have disclosed the news?

412
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
What benefits will they get

413
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
by harming Fang Leng?

414
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,960
Mom!

415
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,320
Mom!

416
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,320
Look at the mess here.

417
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,680
What are you yelling for?

418
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,920
What if you woke up your dad?

419
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,520
What happened to dad?

420
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,280
Come here.

421
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,240
To your room.

422
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,760
Chop, chop.

423
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
Is dad alright?

424
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,520
He's fine.

425
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,360
Mom,

426
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,000
you are not involved in the news. Right?

427
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,840
Why do you mean?

428
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
If anything happens to Leng,

429
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,560
I will benefit the most.

430
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Promise me

431
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
you have not

432
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
tried to harm Leng this time.

433
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,320
How could you say that?

434
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,680
Ah?

435
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,160
If anyone hears it,

436
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,200
I would never be able to clean my name.

437
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,480
Listen.

438
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,240
I have nothing to do with that matter.

439
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,280
It's good that it was not you.

440
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,440
Mom, sit down.

441
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,400
Mom.

442
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,000
Can I ask for a favor?

443
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,840
What crappy idea are you thinking about?

444
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,040
Nothing big.

445
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,080
It's just...

446
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
If dad talks about Leng

447
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
with you again,

448
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000
please say something in his favor.

449
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,120
And tell uncle

450
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,680
to watch out for Leng

451
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,080
if anything happens at the company.

452
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,440
Lie,

453
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,560
when will you be an adult?

454
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,040
Look.

455
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,600
Your dad is furious.

456
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
Fang Leng has amnesia.

457
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,680
Even if amnesia is not a serious disease,

458
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,320
who knows what will happen

459
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,280
if it gets worse?

460
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,800
Lie,

461
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
we have to account on you alone

462
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,440
for the future of the Fang family.

463
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,680
Lie,

464
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,240
promise to make me proud.

465
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,120
OK?

466
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,080
I believe in Brother.

467
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,280
He will certainly be fine.

468
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,640
Assistant Han.

469
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,080
Eh?

470
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,800
Send me

471
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,880
all the important projects and documents

472
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,760
to be handled these days.

473
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,920
OK.

474
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,080
And

475
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,720
make an appointment with the directors.

476
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm going to persuade them

477
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
to support me in one week.

478
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,640
And the problem will be solved.

479
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,520
Yes.

480
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
So many reporters.

481
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,280
How is Fang Leng doing?

482
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,680
Doctor...

483
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,120
What's the matter?

484
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,400
Are you alright?

485
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,920
The meds.

486
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,080
OK.

487
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
Why isn't anyone with you?

488
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
There's a lot to do recently.

489
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,080
Assistant Han is busy.

490
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,000
I have to ask you to come.

491
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,880
Here. Take it now.

492
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,920
Something is wrong with your heart?

493
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Perhaps the wound has not fully recovered.

494
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

495
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,960
You don't even go to the hospital

496
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,720
for the routine examination.

497
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,360
How about this?

498
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,080
I take you to the hospital for an examination now.

499
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,280
I've got only a week.

500
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,960
I can't waste time.

501
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,440
Help me put away the documents.

502
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,560
I'll go home to read them.

503
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,200
OK.

504
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,840
Move. It's OK.

505
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,120
Mr. Fang.

506
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,960
Who are you?

507
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,360
What caused your amnesia?

508
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,080
Mr. Fang,

509
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
what's your plan now?

510
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,080
What will do with it?

511
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
I said no photos.

512
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,680
What are you doing?

513
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,520
Stop taking photos.

514
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,160
Please answer our questions.

515
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,720
Please tell us what

516
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,840
caused your amnesia.

517
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,280
Mr. Fang.

518
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,240
No photos.

519
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,120
Xiaoqi.

520
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,480
Run.

521
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,560
Run.

522
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,200
There he is.

523
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,680
Mr. Fang.

524
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,520
Are you alright?

525
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,960
Are you OK?

526
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm fine.

527
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,600
What happened just now?

528
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,240
It was as if

529
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,040
everything stopped.

530
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,480
You are sick

531
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,480
and you were hallucinating.

532
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,120
Weren't you?

533
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,800
Probably.

534
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,000
I did feel dizzy.

535
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,880
Taxi.

536
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,040
Taxi.

537
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,280
Get in the car

538
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,520
in case they come after us.

539
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,240
Let's go. Get in.

540
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,680
What?

541
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,240
Fang Leng is sick?

542
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,960
Maybe it's because of this big blow.

543
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,960
He fainted in front of the reporters.

544
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,360
Haven't you watched the news?

545
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,760
What?

546
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,480
Still worrying about him?

547
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,840
I never regret

548
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,080
whatever I do.

549
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
He made me to do it.

550
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,480
I had no choice.

551
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
That's good.

552
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
We are in the same boat.

553
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,400
I hope you will not get soft halfway

554
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,640
and betray us.

555
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,720
Got it.

556
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,080
What else for today?

557
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,280
Today

558
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
I'd like to thank you.

559
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,520
I hope in the future anything about Fang Leng...

560
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,320
It's misunderstanding.

561
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,680
There has never been a case between you and me where the one help the other.

562
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,600
We will never have anything to do with each other in the future.

563
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,760
If you don't want anyone get suspicious,

564
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,800
we'd better not meet.

565
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,040
Eh...

566
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,700
=Fang Leng=

567
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,200
A small place.

568
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,760
But your place must be surrounded by reporters now.

569
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,960
You can go home later.

570
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,000
No need.

571
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,280
I can stay here.

572
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,720
Who allows you to stay?

573
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,920
I just pity you

574
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,200
and take you in for a while.

575
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,800
What's the matter?

576
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,520
The wound in my heart has not recovered.

577
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,040
If you ask me to go home now,

578
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
what should I do when something goes wrong again?

579
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,640
What about your family?

580
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,560
It's a big deal.

581
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,600
They just leave you alone?

582
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,720
I just can't understand you humans.

583
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,760
Sometimes you seem so intimate,

584
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
while at other times you act as strangers.

585
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,600
Here. Take some water.

586
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Are you an alien?

587
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,160
You humans?

588
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,000
Aren't you one of us?

589
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,200
I...

590
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,800
I am a special human.

591
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,760
However special you are,

592
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,040
you are not half special as I am.

593
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,760
You are just sometimes confused

594
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,760
and always bring troubles.

595
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,640
Look at me.

596
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
Everyone takes me as a patient

597
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,360
with psychological problems.

598
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,000
Which one do you find more abnormal, you or me?

599
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,520
You always seem composed.

600
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,120
I didn't know you care what people think of you.

601
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,640
Since you have lost your memory,

602
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,360
you probably have forgotten

603
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,600
what we did when I stayed at your place.

604
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,120
Back then

605
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,680
we spent a night

606
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,120
at yours watching the stars.

607
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,400
You told me that

608
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,880
an alien on Earth

609
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,800
did not necessarily have to think itself as different

610
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,920
because on Earth

611
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,240
each one was different,

612
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,280
each might be alone,

613
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,480
and each might

614
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,760
feel lonely sometimes.

615
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,480
So the distinction of an alien

616
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,480
was only a little more serious

617
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,720
than that of others.

618
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,440
You are

619
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,400
sick,

620
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
but everyone forgets things.

621
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,800
People may probably forget

622
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,720
what they had for dinner one year ago

623
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,360
and will probably forget

624
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,240
about their present life

625
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,800
next year.

626
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
Everyone forgets.

627
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,240
It's just you

628
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,840
forget

629
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,760
a little bit

630
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,400
more than others.

631
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,760
What's wrong with that?

632
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,720
I never thought you would see it that way.

633
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,360
You humans

634
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,720
only know how to make a living

635
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,920
and know nothing about living.

636
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,160
Hungry?

637
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll go to the kitchen and make you something to eat.

638
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,600
I've spent too much energy.

639
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,440
Wait here.

640
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,000
Dinner is ready.

641
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,720
He must be very tired.

642
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,560
Xiaoqi.

643
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
What are you looking at?

644
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,520
My eyes are sour.

645
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,600
I'm looking at nothing.

646
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,360
Hum,

647
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,400
don't you think I don't know what you are doing.

648
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
I am looking.

649
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,480
So what?

650
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,880
There is no end to your desires
and it's never too late to go back.

651
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,200
Look at this miserable man.

652
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,320
You are still coveting his body.

653
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,240
You dirty girl.

654
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,200
I am dirty. So what?

655
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,400
Ah!

656
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,680
I'm squeezed.

657
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,080
Help!

658
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Cost of being naughty.

659
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,800
Open the door.

660
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,600
These are the documents you required yesterday.

661
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
These are clothes and meds I've brought from your place.

662
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,000
Here.

663
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,400
Thank you.

664
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,120
Won't you let me in and give me some water?

665
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,880
Xiaoqi is still...

666
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,000
Xiaoqi?

667
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,600
You are awesome,

668
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,280
romance even when you are sick.

669
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,920
What?

670
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
How about the reporters?

671
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,920
Since you brought it up,

672
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,920
the reporters

673
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,120
are still waiting at your place.

674
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,520
You are not yet well enough.

675
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,200
I'd suggest you stay away.

676
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
Book a hotel room nearby.

677
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
I have to work somewhere else.

678
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,320
I've got you

679
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,560
all the documents here.

680
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,320
Why not work here?

681
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,480
Xiaoqi can keep you company.

682
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,680
Isn't it wonderful?

683
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
What are you thinking about?

684
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,840
As a pal,

685
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,400
I can only help so much.

686
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,640
Bye.

687
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,000
Bye.

688
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Who was that?

689
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,720
It's so early.

690
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,920
Doctor Zhang brought me something.

691
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Is it so urgent?

692
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,920
You start working now?

693
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,640
You must have been very busy lately.

694
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,920
It's OK.

695
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,320
But I have to work here.

696
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,120
Why?

697
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,760
I've helped you out once.

698
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,160
You just won't go, right?

699
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,080
You...

700
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,360
What?

701
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,640
I'm changing.

702
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,720
Want to watch?

703
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Dirty.

704
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,240
Ms. Chai.

705
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Morning.

706
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
Up so early?

707
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,200
Where is Fang Leng?

708
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,720
Upstairs.

709
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,600
Still sleeping?

710
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,200
Let me ask you something.

711
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,960
Did you...

712
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,680
...do it last night?

713
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,720
What's this?

714
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,720
This is what you call gene matching.

715
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,600
Gene matching?

716
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,480
Ms. Chai,

717
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,240
what are you thinking about?

718
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,960
We didn't.

719
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
No?

720
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
It seems

721
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,720
you have not learnt enough.

722
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,520
Let me

723
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,280
teach you something later.

724
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,360
Xiaoqi,

725
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,560
listen to me.

726
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,440
At present,

727
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,160
it's the critical moment for Fang Leng.

728
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,040
His company is a mess.

729
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,440
He can't even go home.

730
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,680
Eight out of ten

731
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,160
know he is sick.

732
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,440
If this goes on,

733
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,680
he will lose everything.

734
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,560
You are his only hope.

735
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,560
Therefore,

736
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,280
you must be nice to him.

737
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,000
Do not let him burden all this on his own.

738
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Understand?

739
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,600
I've got nothing to do with him.

740
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,640
Why should I help?

741
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,240
Never mind.

742
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,720
I have just lent my room to him.

743
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,440
Tonight,

744
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm going to ask him to leave.

745
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,480
Assistant Han brought these documents.

746
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,440
Here.

747
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,480
Thanks.

748
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,280
Why didn't you have breakfast?

749
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,080
No appetite.

750
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,440
Could you please

751
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
go somewhere I can't see you.

752
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,080
Why?

753
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,520
It's my place.

754
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,320
Because you will get me distracted.

755
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,680
Get me some coffee.

756
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,400
Why am I helping you?

757
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Dinner time!

758
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,520
Where?

759
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,320
So soon.

760
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,600
Print this out.

761
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,960
Why?

762
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,640
It's soiled. How can I use it?

763
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,280
Coffee?

764
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,400
Passing documents?

765
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,960
If this goes on,

766
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm going to be domesticated by him.

767
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,360
No more of it.

768
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,360
Sister,

769
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,840
you can rest assured now.

770
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,120
Fang Leng has promised

771
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,200
to resign.

772
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,440
When the time comes,

773
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,200
he will leave.

774
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,240
No.

775
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,960
Be careful.

776
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
He may play some tricks.

777
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,080
It's only a week.

778
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,360
Can he turn everything upside down?

779
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,280
And

780
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,840
many directors have taken our side.

781
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
If Fang Leng tries anything stupid,

782
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,520
will there be any good result for him?

783
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,280
I know.

784
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,520
That's it then.

785
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,680
OK.

786
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,560
To the hotel.

787
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,520
OK.

788
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,680
The ten directors

789
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,880
have accepted our invitation.

790
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,440
Why...

791
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
I'm calling them now.

792
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,560
why isn't anyone picking up?

793
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,480
No use.

794
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,320
Someone has beaten us to it.

795
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,440
Impossible.

796
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,960
Besides us,

797
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,640
only the invited directors know it.

798
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,680
How can anyone beat us?

799
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,160
Of course someone can.

800
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,880
Someone has waited for this day since a long time ago.

801
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Thank you.

802
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,600
Directors, thank you for coming today.

803
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,520
Take care.

804
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,240
Good trip.

805
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:01,920
See you.

806
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,680
Take care.

807
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,880
When Fang Leng leaves,

808
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,200
the company will be Fang Lie's.

809
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,720
As his relative,

810
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,240
you are the one we have to count on.

811
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,400
Mr. Wang, thanks for your appreciation.

812
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
We have to help each other.

813
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,120
Come.

814
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
See you.

815
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,920
Mr. Fang, such a coincidence.

816
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,480
You are here for dinner too?

817
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,520
There's no coincidence.

818
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,880
I've come for you.

819
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,200
What for?

820
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,280
You should know

821
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,240
why I want to see you.

822
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,320
Or otherwise you would not have

823
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,000
come with all those directors.

824
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,760
Mr. Fang, don't misunderstand me.

825
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
It happens we don't have to work on the weekend.

826
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,920
I invited some friends

827
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,560
to have dinner and a little chat.

828
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,680
We were doing nothing as important as you do.

829
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,000
With all your dirty secrets,

830
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
you don't need to pretend to be decent in front of me.

831
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,520
You think you can force me to leave the company

832
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,320
if you draw the directors to your side.

833
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,320
Listen carefully.

834
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,400
Even if I leave,

835
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
it's out of my own will.

836
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,040
You don't

837
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,040
get to be my rival.

838
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,040
Who does not know how to bluff?

839
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,320
But you should wait till you are fully-fledged

840
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,160
before trying to impress others.

841
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,080
Do you think I have ignored you for years

842
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
because I am not fully-fledged?

843
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
I have let you do things unchecked,

844
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,360
because of Lie.

845
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,320
Do you think the little tricks

846
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,040
of you and Zhou Siqin

847
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,200
can be kept from me for so long?

848
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,520
If you attempt anything like this again,

849
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,600
I'll do what I should do.

850
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,280
What's more,

851
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,120
Lie belongs to Fang family,

852
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,280
not a pawn of you Zhou family.

853
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
If you ever involve him

854
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,480
in your dirty schemes again,

855
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,640
don't say I didn't warn you.

856
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,560
Mr. Fang,

857
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,320
what do we do now?

858
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,160
Now that we can't solve the problem through the directors,

859
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,600
we have to make another plan.

860
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,080
But there are only a few days

861
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,960
before the time is up.

862
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,840
Well then,

863
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,600
shall we ask the Chairman for help?

864
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,160
He hasn't done anything by far.

865
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,360
I guess

866
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,520
he is waiting for you to ask.

867
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
We can't.

868
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,920
I'd rather leave

869
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,120
than ask him for help.

870
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,440
Mr. Fang, don't be so stubborn.

871
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,600
He is your father after all.

872
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,120
If I yield to him today,

873
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,960
I will never be able to

874
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,880
protect

875
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,920
what's precious to me from him.

876
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,120
What's the use of

877
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,160
being the President then?

878
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm going to work tonight.

879
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,720
To the office.

880
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,440
Yes.

881
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,680
Did anything happen to him?

882
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,560
Why should I call him?

883
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,200
If I do,

884
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,560
it will seem to him that I want him here.

885
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
I don't want to worry about him.

886
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,440
It's good that he has left.

887
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,280
He must be busy now.

888
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,480
I'll interrupt him if I call.

889
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,360
Come back.

890
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,240
Come back now.

Ever since I met you,

904
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,900
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

905
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,300
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

906
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,180
only you.

907
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,380
We're out of reach

908
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,700
but appreciate each other.

909
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:53,500
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

910
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,540
The yearning invades

911
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,100
and lurks in my mind.

912
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,660
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

913
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,740
I'm getting addicted to it

914
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,060
and my sense is shielded.

915
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:21,860
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

916
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,020
Put the hottest heart

917
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,340
in this cold body.

918
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,700
I'm looking at you,

919
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,860
and my love has nowhere to go.

920
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,100
Ever since I met you,

921
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,020
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

922
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,300
Every day is a new memory

923
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,340
which is only be about you and me.

924
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,580
I can't lie to myself anymore.

925
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,420
Please give me the courage to believe.

926
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,340
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

927
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,260
only you.

928
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,380
Even everything becomes silent,

929
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,500
I still have you.
