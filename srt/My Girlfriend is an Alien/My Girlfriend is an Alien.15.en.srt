1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 15

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
I asked Mr. Fang to hire me.

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,160
Some time ago,

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,280
the restaurant I worked for ran into trouble.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,400
Mr. Fang helped us get out of it.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,920
In order to thank him,

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,280
I requested him to recruit me to work for F Group.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Mr. Fang once said that

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,760
as a president,

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
he would show solicitude

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,400
for every employee.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm the president.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
I should show concern for you.

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
Regard it as the company welfare.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,880
At work,

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
Mr. Fang has never flirted with me.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,680
I don't have

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,760
feelings for him, either.

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
You made me happy

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,440
and disappointed alternately.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,080
I worried something bad would happen to you.

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,600
I worried you would be poisoned to death.

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Why do you always affect me?

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
Why do you keep affecting me?

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,400
I...

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,920
All of the news

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,880
about our relationship

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,160
is fake.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,160
Listen carefully.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
From today on,

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,440
I don't allow you to watch him,

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
smile at him

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,360
or even like him.

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,280
You're my girlfriend.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,240
You can only watch me.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,560
This is all about us.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Was she telling the truth?

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,680
Is what she said true, Mr. Fang?

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Why did you help her?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Why did you help her?

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,480
Tell us about it.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,800
What did you help her for?

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,080
Miss Chai has made it clear just now.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,360
The theme of this event is charity.

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,160
I think

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
Mr. Fang's help to Miss Chai

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,960
is also a kind of charity.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
I hope you'll focus your attention

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,160
on public welfare undertakings.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Thank you.

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,720
Let's go.

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,880
It's finally over.

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,520
Thank you.

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,720
Not at all.

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
Tell Fang Leng that

73
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm off.

74
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,680
Before you were here,

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,000
Fang Leng has chosen me.

77
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,000
He knew

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
as long as I walked around here with him,

79
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
the media would turn their attention

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
from gossip about you

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,760
to our relationship,

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,920
no matter whether

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,400
it was real

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,040
or false.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,640
What do you want to say, anyway?

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,840
I could easily solve that problem

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,120
but why did I ask you to come here?

88
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,400
People like you shouldn't be on

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,920
this kind of occasion.

90
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
It's just a banquet.

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,960
I've been on lots of occasions.

92
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,320
Because I want you to remember this night.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,760
I want you to admit that

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,440
you're not connected with Fang Leng.

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,800
I also want you to remember that

96
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,080
you don't deserve Fang Leng's love at all

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,760
and he won't fall in love with you.

98
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,200
Miss Chai,

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,360
next time you try to seduce Fang Leng,

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
you'd better think about this night.

101
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
I didn't seduce him.

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,480
You...

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,120
This slap is for

104
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,080
the fact that you stole him from me.

105
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,080
Get lost.

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,440
Apologize to me!

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,280
Do you think you're still the old Chai Xiaoqi?

108
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,000
How dare you bluster here?

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Fang Leng has...

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
I don't need him to protect me.

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
I can hit you myself.

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
How dare you hit me?

113
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,560
Let go.

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,000
What's going on?

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,680
Were you hurt?

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm okay.

117
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,120
Maybe

118
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,800
Miss Chai has complaints about me.

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Nonsense!

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,640
She...

121
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,840
she hit me first.

122
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,400
Don't say anything more.

123
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don't you believe me?

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,960
She really hit me first.

125
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,440
Go and check the surveillance videos.

126
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,400
You can go home now.

127
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
It's true. Believe me.

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
She really hit me first.

129
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,880
Chai Xiaoqi,

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,920
thank you for your help today

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,640
but...

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,080
but...

133
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
your and I are not from the same world.

134
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,440
Do you understand?

135
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,120
Let's go.

136
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,600
You just want to keep away from me, don't you?

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,600
Why does he change so much after he loses his memory?

138
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
He was so nice before.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,080
Hey. Mom.

140
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,000
I've arrived.

141
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
Okay. I gotta hang up now.

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,400
Bye-bye.

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,240
Xiaoqi.

144
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,000
Fang Lie.

145
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,720
What are you doing here?

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
How come you're here, too?

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,960
It's a charitable event sponsored by my family.

148
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
They asked me to come here.

149
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,080
I...

150
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm here to handle something

151
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
and it's done now. See you.

152
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,040
What happened to your face?

153
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
It's because of the cold weather.

154
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,200
Who hit you?

155
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,720
I've hit back.

156
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
I hit even harder.

157
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Did my brother hurt you again?

158
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,320
No.

159
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,000
You got it wrong.

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,600
It wasn't your brother

161
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,960
but Jiang Xue.

162
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
I'll send for a doctor.

163
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,840
No, thanks.

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
There are so many people here.

165
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,960
I don't want to make things worse.

166
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,960
I think she didn't mean to hurt you.

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,120
She made a mistake.

169
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
What did you apologize for?

170
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
Or do you

171
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
believe what she said

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
and think I've gone too far?

173
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,280
As far as I know,

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,600
although she's a bit impulsive,

175
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,840
she won't hurt anyone,

176
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,200
let alone you.

177
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,400
I hope you won't mind

178
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,320
what happened tonight.

179
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,320
Okay.

180
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
I won't resent her.

181
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,960
But it's not for her

182
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,760
but you.

183
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,640
I'll ask someone to drive her home.

184
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,320
You still care about her,

185
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,200
don't you?

186
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,000
It has nothing to do with that.

187
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm just unaccountably

188
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,360
annoyed with her.

189
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,800
But you've forgotten her.

190
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Why would a stranger

191
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
make you feel that?

192
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,280
Perhaps it's a kind of intuition.

193
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,040
Fang Leng!

194
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,360
What's the matter?

195
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
I may sprain my ankle just now.

196
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,520
Can you stay here with me?

197
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,840
Okay.

198
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
I quarreled with Jiang Xue.

199
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,280
She slapped my face.

200
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
But it's all over.

201
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,280
Don't go in.

202
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,120
It's filled with reporters inside.

203
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
Don't make the situation worse.

204
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,720
Why did she quarrel with you?

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,800
It's because of my brother,

206
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,160
right?

207
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,840
What are you going to do?

208
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,120
I'll warn him.

209
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,960
If he wants to see someone else,

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,920
I'll ask him not to plague you again.

211
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
He didn't plague me.

212
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,160
I did it of my own accord.

213
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,800
My relationship with Fang Leng was exposed

214
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,800
and I wanted to help him explain.

215
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,920
But from now on,

216
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,640
I guess

217
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
we won't plague each other anymore.

218
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,200
Why are you leaving, then?

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,240
The party hasn't started yet.

220
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Why are you leaving first?

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,400
Because I shouldn't have come here.

222
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,520
Besides,

223
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
it has been like this already.

224
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,320
If I go back,

225
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,680
I have no idea what people will think of me.

226
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,840
Did they make you leave?

227
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm off.

228
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,840
It's not your fault.

229
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,560
Why are you leaving first?

230
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,080
You don't even know what happened.

231
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Why do you trust me so much?

232
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm here with you.

233
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,400
No one will dare to make you leave.

234
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
Go back with me.

235
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,720
What do you want to do?

236
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
We should further cooperate, Mr. Fang.

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,360
Yes.

238
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,840
Cheers.

239
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,920
Chin up and chest out.

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,560
Just think of them as tomatoes.

241
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,200
Wait and see.

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,040
I will make him regret it.

243
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,480
Okay.

244
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Bye-bye.

245
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,560
Leng,

246
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
why are you here?

247
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,120
How about you?

248
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
What are you doing here with her?

249
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
You mean Xiaoqi?

250
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,680
She's my partner.

251
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,400
It was hard for me to invite her here.

252
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,480
By the way,

253
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,120
you have something to say to my brother, don't you?

254
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,160
Say it.

255
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,880
What should I say?

256
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
You mentioned it to me before.

257
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,800
Did you forget it?

258
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,200
I didn't.

259
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
How could my brain...

260
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,800
All right. Never mind.

261
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
I know you couldn't say it.

262
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,760
I'll do that for you.

263
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,200
Leng,

264
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,520
actually Xiaoqi has wanted to

265
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,720
make it clear to you for long.

266
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,640
Although you were together before,

267
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,800
she's in a new relationship now.

268
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,640
Therefore,

269
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,480
please don't

270
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,760
trouble her again,

271
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,160
especially today.

272
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,400
There are so many

273
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
reporters here.

274
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,440
People are all gossiping about you online.

275
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,720
How can she cope with it?

276
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,360
Today

277
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,120
she had no choice

278
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
but to come and help you.

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
Otherwise, she would be so annoyed

280
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
about your old relationship.

281
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,400
She just hopes you'll shape up.

282
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
I was a bit blunt.

283
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,200
Don't be bothered about it.

284
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes,

285
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,480
those are what I wanted to say.

286
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,640
So

287
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,520
you mean

288
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
after you broke up with me,

289
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,200
you're with my brother now,

290
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,480
right?

291
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,480
Yes.

292
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,120
That's not the whole truth.

293
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,400
You're also going out with Miss Jiang, aren't you?

294
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,640
Miss Jiang and I are just business partners.

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,040
You thought wrong.

296
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,160
Sorry.

297
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,000
It's presumption on my part.

298
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,080
However,

299
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,200
Xiaoqi and I

300
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
are really boyfriend and girlfriend.

301
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
Please don't concern yourself with it.

302
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,080
Xiaoqi,

303
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,920
do you have anything else

304
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
to say to your ex?

305
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,560
No.

306
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,240
Let's go and eat something delicious, then?

307
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Why not?

308
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,200
Please.

309
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,640
I can't dance.

310
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,600
Besides,

311
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,840
Fang Leng will be watching there.

312
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,920
It's too far, isn't it?

313
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Trust me.

314
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,400
The more you care about him,

315
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,440
the more casual you'll have to be.

316
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,720
Only then can you burn him up.

317
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,760
Left foot.

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,600
Right foot.

319
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,680
Chin up.

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,480
Fang Leng,

321
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,120
what do you think of this?

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,720
Go to do your work.

323
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,680
Yes.

324
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,480
I didn't expect

325
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,320
she would make use of Fang Lie to provoke you.

326
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,760
Have they been that close before?

327
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,920
Of course not.

328
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,960
But Fang Lie is innocent.

329
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,560
He'll easily become a tool of someone.

330
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,160
How's that?

331
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
Aren't you feeling better now?

332
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Thanks.

333
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
What for?

334
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,760
You know what?

335
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,080
Every time my brother hurts others,

336
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,120
I'll unaccountably feel guilty for him.

337
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,600
Perhaps

338
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,200
it's because I'm his brother.

339
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,120
That's why you always help me,

340
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,840
right?

341
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,040
Just consider that I'm making amends to you for him.

342
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,160
Don't hate him.

343
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Actually,

344
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,040
Fang Leng didn't do anything to me.

345
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,200
He just doesn't like me.

346
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,680
I just found that

347
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,600
you cared much about Fang Leng.

348
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
I've always thought you don't like him.

349
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,000
After all,

350
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
he's the only person who supports my dream.

351
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,040
He has been silently

352
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,200
supporting me since I was a kid.

353
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,000
Although he didn't say anything,

354
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,120
I know

355
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,120
he has been protecting me.

356
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,800
What's up?

357
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,760
Does your face hurt?

358
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,440
No.

359
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,120
How long have you been here?

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,520
Since I supported your dream.

361
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,000
What do you want to do?

362
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,400
I need to talk to her.

363
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,040
I've made myself clear just now.

364
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,520
Besides,

365
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,880
you don't have to make me leave again.

366
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,800
I myself don't want to see you anymore.

367
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,120
If it's not convenient now,

368
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,920
we can meet at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

369
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
I'll send you the location.

370
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,560
Don't go.

371
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,520
I haven't agreed yet.

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,680
Hey!

373
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,560
How could he do that?

374
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,000
If you're afraid,

375
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,960
I can go with you.

376
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,600
No.

377
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,400
I'd like to see

378
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,760
what mishap can he be up to.

379
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,160
Mishap?

380
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
What do you mean?

381
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,720
I mean...

382
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,840
You wanted to say "mischief", didn't you?

383
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,760
Fang Leng.

384
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,120
Yes?

385
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,760
Are you still thinking about Chai Xiaoqi?

386
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,280
No.

387
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How's your foot?

388
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,440
It's alright.

389
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,320
Don't you want to ask

390
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
why I came to help you today?

391
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,840
I know it was presumptuous of me

392
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
to invite you there.

393
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,320
If you're afraid that

394
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
the media will misunderstand the relationship between us...

395
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,320
I don't want your apology.

396
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,200
If it had been someone else,

397
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,800
do you think I would have helped him?

398
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,320
I know

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,120
you can forget me at any time.

400
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,800
I also know that

401
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
whatever I do

402
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,760
or however hard I try,

403
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm still just

404
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,000
some data in your memory bank.

405
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,520
For you,

406
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm always a stranger.

407
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,280
Why did I ask for it?

408
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,320
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,560
I didn't know you cared so much.

410
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,640
In those days,

411
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
we were so close to each other.

412
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,360
What do you mean?

413
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Nothing.

414
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,680
My home is very near.

415
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,200
I'll go back myself.

416
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,160
Please pull over.

417
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,920
Miss Jiang!

418
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,840
Have me

419
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
known each other for long?

420
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,120
You recalled it?

421
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
Do you really want to know

422
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,400
what happened between us?

423
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,040
Tell me.

424
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't want to owe you anything.

425
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,440
Okay.

426
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,600
Tomorrow night,

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
I'll wait for you at this milk tea shop.

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,360
Remember.

429
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,720
You must show up.

430
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,960
Weird.

431
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,480
You almost killed me.

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,520
What's wrong with you, Kubri?

433
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,000
What's wrong with you?

434
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,880
You almost killed me.

435
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,520
I have said

436
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
so many hurtful things.

437
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,320
Why does Fang Leng still want to see me?

438
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,120
If I infuriate him,

439
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,720
will he remember me again?

440
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,080
You think his brain is a ball

441
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,160
and it'll work if you blow it up?

442
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,560
He's breaking up with you.

443
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,160
He's definitely going to settle things with you.

444
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,080
What should we settle?

445
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,120
You don't know.

446
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Human beings will settle things

447
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,360
before they break up.

448
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,600
They'll argue

449
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,280
and swear.

450
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,040
Some of them even burst into tears.

451
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,720
Anyway, they can't break up until they return everything

452
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,520
they owe each other.

453
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,440
I guess

454
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,760
that is probably a ceremony.

455
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
But I don't owe him anything.

456
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,400
If we're really doing that,

457
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
my annunciator is still in his body.

458
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,480
Oh, yes.

459
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
You're breaking up.

460
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
If you don't take it back,

461
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,360
you'll have no chance to do that anymore.

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,160
It's easier said than done.

463
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,400
If his heart doesn't thump,

464
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,840
how can I feel the annunciator?

465
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,680
I'll hurt him if I rush it.

466
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
But we can't keep staying here.

467
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,080
Do you think

468
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,960
Fang Leng hasn't hated you enough?

469
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,120
What should I do, then?

470
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Do you have any solutions?

471
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,080
Is there a way

472
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,280
to make his heart thump?

473
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
Ways to quicken a man's heartbeat.

474
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,800
Searching.

475
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,880
I've got it.

476
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,520
What is it?

477
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
Aphrodisiac tablets.

478
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Make his heart thump all day long.

479
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,520
Aphrodisiac tablets.

480
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,120
Why does it

481
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,800
sound so strange?

482
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,800
It's an ad that ranks first online.

483
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Colorless, tasteless and harmless.

484
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Humans won't lie in their ads, will they?

485
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,160
Fine.

486
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
Sir, here is your order.

487
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,240
Here we are.

488
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,640
Go inside.

489
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,680
Hello, do you have a reservation?

490
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm looking for Fang Leng.

491
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,880
This way, please.

492
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,160
Okay.

493
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,840
I have some important things to deal with today.

494
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,200
Don't call me again

495
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,880
before they're done.

496
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,440
Would you like to order something now?

497
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:06,920
No, thanks.

498
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,680
Wait.

499
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,720
Two glasses of water, please.

500
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,880
Thank you.

501
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,960
Okay. Wait a moment, please.

502
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,760
Say it.

503
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,120
What do you want to see me about?

504
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,360
I'll come straight to the point.

505
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,040
Are you dating Fang Lie now?

506
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,080
No.

507
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,560
What has that

508
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,200
got to do with you?

509
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,080
Let me ask you another question.

510
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
What's the purpose of your closeness

511
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
to people around me?

512
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,960
I've broken up with you.

513
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
Why can't I be close to Fang Lie?

514
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,680
He's just your brother.

515
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,120
Now that you know we're family,

516
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,800
please don't make use of him to provoke me.

517
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,080
After all,

518
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
he's different from you.

519
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,280
You're calculating and he's not.

520
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
What?

521
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
My goodness,

522
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,760
aren't you too narcissistic?

523
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
Fang Lie and I are friends.

524
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
How come I'm using him?

525
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,720
Besides,

526
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,760
I can totally provoke you myself if I want to.

527
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
What do I need Fang Lie for?

528
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,720
Miss,

529
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,440
your water.

530
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,480
Thank you.

531
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm not here to quarrel with you.

532
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,480
Say it.

533
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,160
As long as you want it

534
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,840
and I can give it to you,

535
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,160
I'll definitely satisfy you

536
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,840
on condition that

537
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
you stay away from me

538
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,040
and Fang Lie.

539
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,360
I know you just want me to leave.

540
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,560
You don't have to use Fang Lie as an excuse.

541
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,040
When I take back my thing,

542
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,960
no one can stop me from leaving.

543
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,600
What do you want to take?

544
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,160
Will you agree

545
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,200
whatever it is?

546
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,720
Of course.

547
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,200
What if it's possible that

548
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
I'll hurt you slightly?

549
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,440
It's just possible.

550
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,320
I won't really hurt you.

551
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,760
Will you still agree?

552
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,400
Yes.

553
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,400
Remember what you said.

554
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,280
I'll do it, then.

555
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,360
What do you want to do?

556
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,840
Nothing.

557
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,080
I mean

558
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,520
I will agree

559
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,480
but you have to eat something

560
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
and drink with me.

561
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,280
What do you say?

562
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,400
Really?

563
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,080
Waitress, we're ready to order.

564
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,240
Okay.

565
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,920
Thank you.

566
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,000
What would you like to order, Miss Chai?

567
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,360
Nothing.

568
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,600
They're all fine by me.

569
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,000
You... you decide.

570
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,920
It's up to you.

571
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,200
Give me this

572
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,520
and this.

573
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,400
Okay.

574
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,400
This one.

575
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,360
This one.

576
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,440
Okay.

577
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,200
And this one.

578
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,200
This one.

579
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,240
That's all.

580
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,400
That's all for me, too.

581
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,000
Okay. Just a moment, please.

582
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,520
Why don't we drink...

583
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,440
There seems to be a reporter there.

584
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,280
She's running away.

585
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,360
Where?

586
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,360
There! There! There!

587
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,040
She's there.

588
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,080
Look! Look!

589
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,800
Is that a reporter?

590
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,720
Do you have a reservation?

591
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
Yes. A table for two.

592
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,200
I didn't see anyone.

593
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,320
It has dissolved.

594
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,560
No.

595
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,720
It seems she has left just now.

596
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,760
I didn't notice that.

597
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,560
It's all right now.

598
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,080
If those reporters keep plaguing you,

599
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,320
you can tell me at all times.

600
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,320
Because I'm to blame for the gossip.

601
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,720
I want to handle it for you.

602
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,880
Okay.

603
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,840
I wish

604
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
you wouldn't be plagued by me again

605
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,040
and I hope

606
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,520
I can leave smoothly.

607
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
Why didn't you drink it?

608
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,800
Just now you said you were leaving

609
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,400
because of me?

610
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,080
Of course not.

611
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,680
Drink it first.

612
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,960
You've promised me.

613
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,160
I need to go to the bathroom.

614
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,520
Why did my heart ache when she said she was leaving?

615
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,200
Where is he?

616
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,040
Come back.

617
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,640
Did he find that I spiked his water

618
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
and escape?

619
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,680
No.

620
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,360
It's now or never.

621
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
What should I do?

622
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Who are you?

623
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,760
Is she crazy?

624
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,160
What are you doing here?

625
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,080
Don't be afraid.

626
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,280
I just want to stimulate you

627
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,040
and quicken your heartbeat.

628
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,440
This is the men's room.

629
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,400
So what?

630
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,320
Open your mouth.

631
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:05,920
Take it.

632
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,600
Stop playing around.

633
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,640
Get out of here.

634
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,000
You've promised me.

635
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,080
You'll give me whatever I want.

636
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,920
I beg you.

637
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,200
Do me a favor.

638
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,280
I'll warn you for the last time.

639
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,000
Get out right now.

640
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,600
You can't escape now, can you?

641
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,080
Take it. Take it. Take it.

642
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,960
What on earth do you want to do?

643
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,160
The drug.

644
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,320
How are you feeling?

645
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640
Did you swallow it?

646
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,160
What did you make me take?

647
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,880
Is it working?

648
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,720
Let me see.

649
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,640
Has your heartbeat quickened?

650
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,240
Has it quickened?

651
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,080
You think I don't dare to hurt you, right?

652
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,160
There they are.

653
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,040
Hey.

654
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,520
What are you doing?

655
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,400
Someone reported that

656
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,000
you did something...

657
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,440
inelegant in public places.

658
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,040
She forced me.

659
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,920
And you pressed me against the wall.

660
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,160
Otherwise, would we have been here?

661
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
You did it first.

662
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
If you had obeyed me,

663
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960
would this have happened?

664
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,080
You want me to obey you?

665
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,880
Yes.

666
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,640
Well,

667
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
our mall is strictly regulated.

668
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,400
When you were doing that in the toilet,

669
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,520
weren't you afraid you'd affect other people?

670
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,280
You're adults.

671
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,360
You should keep control of yourselves.

672
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,760
Alright,

673
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,480
just tell us.

674
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,880
What do we need to do?

675
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,920
I have things to handle.

676
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,440
No.

677
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,080
I haven't settled things with him yet.

678
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,080
You can't let him go.

679
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:55,920
How about this?

680
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,680
You can admit your mistake

681
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,200
and write an explanation.

682
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,240
And then I'll let you leave.

683
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,360
Okay.

684
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,720
If you sincerely apologize,

685
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,480
I'll forgive you.

686
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,160
Why should I apologize?

687
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,960
You said you would give me anything.

688
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,080
I wanted to make amends to you

689
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,240
but it didn't mean you could behave outrageously.

690
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,360
Why behaved outrageously?

691
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,840
Alright,

692
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
I don't have the time to watch you quarreling.

693
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,640
Why don't you talk it over

694
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,640
and then call me?

695
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,160
Well,

696
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,480
I'll apologize to you

697
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,640
for what I did in the toilet.

698
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,320
But you must

699
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,280
cooperate and do something.

700
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,040
Otherwise,

701
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm afraid I won't be able to see you again.

702
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,400
Say it.

703
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,160
What are you doing?

704
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,200
Don't dodge.

705
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,920
I haven't felt it yet.

706
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,280
Don't touch me.

707
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Don't touch me.

708
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,320
Why?

709
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,240
You want to go back on your word?

710
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,440
No.

711
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,440
I don't feel very well.

712
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,040
You'd better stay away from me.

713
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,000
You look pale.

714
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,520
Are you sick?

715
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,000
Let me check on you.

716
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Where are you going?

717
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,080
Hello?

718
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,600
How are you feeling?

719
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,680
Is there something wrong with the drug?

720
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,160
What's the drug you made me take?

721
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,560
A drug to quicken your heartbeat.

722
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,080
They say it has no side effects on the net.

723
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,320
Why would this happen?

724
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,120
I can't believe that

725
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,040
you would make me take this kind of drug

726
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,320
to seduce me.

727
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,120
That's not my purpose.

728
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,520
I just wanted to quicken your heartbeat.

729
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,120
I didn't think about anything else.

730
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,480
Why would this happen?

731
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,040
Fang Leng.

732
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:05,960
Fang Leng.

733
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,120
It's my fault.

734
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,520
If I had known you'd be like this,

735
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,720
I wouldn't have made you take the drug.

736
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,480
Wait here.

737
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,280
I'll send for a doctor.

738
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,720
Don't go.

739
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,040
Just stay here and hug me.

740
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,680
I won't go.

741
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,680
I'll call someone for help.

742
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,960
Oh, no.

743
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,480
I left all my things in the restaurant.

744
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,160
Stop touching me.

745
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,720
No.

746
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,160
I must restrain myself.

747
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,880
I must keep my distance from her.

748
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,640
Chai Xiaoqi,

749
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,680
I really hate you very much.

750
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,920
Why did you give me so much trouble

751
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,160
every time you turned up?

752
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,760
We're too different from each other.

753
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,560
Why do you fasten on me?

754
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,880
Do you know

755
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,600
I'll smoulder every time I see you?

756
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,360
I wish I could drive you far away from me.

757
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,680
I know.

758
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,200
That's why

759
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,240
I want to take back my annunciator.

760
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,040
After I leave,

761
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,080
you won't hate me so much.

762
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,520
Yes,

763
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,520
I shouldn't have softened.

764
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,240
I should have stayed away from you.

765
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,720
I must restrain myself.

766
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,640
Yes,

767
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,200
if only I had never met you.

768
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,000
If I hadn't met you,

769
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,520
I wouldn't have saved you

770
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,480
and stayed here.

771
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,280
You wouldn't have asked me to be your girlfriend

772
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,440
and protected

773
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,800
and saved me

774
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,240
time and again.

775
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
I always feel

776
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,720
we've done those things in our previous lives.

777
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,960
You're not your old self anymore.

778
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Now you always

779
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
make me think that

780
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,200
you're not real.

781
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,960
And then you will

782
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,360
make me...

783
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,820
=Fang Leng=

784
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,720
Sorry.

785
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

786
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:06,840
Sorry.

787
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,920
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

788
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,900
=Jiang Xue=

789
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,160
Hello,

790
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,320
is Fang Leng with you?

791
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,480
Mr. Fang has gone out

792
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,960
to meet Miss Chai.

793
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,360
He's not back yet.

794
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,920
Did he say what he was going to do?

795
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,440
No.

796
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
He only asked me

797
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,400
not to disturb him

798
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,480
before things were done.

799
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,200
I see.

800
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,480
If he comes back,

801
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,360
please tell him

802
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,080
I'll keep waiting for him.

803
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,520
Hello? Hello?

804
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,600
It's not burning.

805
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Is he okay now?

806
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,000
Fang Leng.

807
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,680
Fang Leng.

808
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,520
Fang Leng, wake up.

809
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,640
Actually

810
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,480
this is quite good.

811
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,640
When you're awake,

812
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,360
you'll definitely push me away.

813
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,440
But the drug must be useless now

814
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,200
and I can't make you thump again.

815
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,720
Miss,

816
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,120
it's time we closed.

817
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,440
The person I'm waiting for will be right here.

818
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,200
I want to wait a little longer,

819
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,760
can I?

820
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,000
Well,

821
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,320
okay.

822
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,040
Here you go.

823
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,920
Why are you looking at me?

824
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,880
I couldn't find Mr. Fang.

825
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,880
I guess

826
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,960
he won't come here.

827
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,720
Let me drive you home.

828
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,440
Get out.

829
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,320
You didn't know.

830
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,320
Before Mr. Fang left,

831
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,360
he told me he was going to meet you

832
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,160
and asked me to remind him.

833
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,080
If nothing special had happened,

834
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
he wouldn't have stood you up.

835
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,760
Has he asked you to remind him to meet Chai Xiaoqi?

836
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,880
No.

837
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,960
Mr. Fang arranged

838
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,800
to meet her himself.

839
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,920
I don't know where it is.

840
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,800
He needs to be reminded to meet me

841
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,480
and he needs no reminding to meet her.

842
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,520
Who do you think

843
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,400
is more important to him?

844
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
People's mind

845
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,680
is the hardest to guess

846
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,000
and control

847
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,320
in the world.

848
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,600
Miss Jiang,

849
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,640
what's the point of

850
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,280
making life difficult for yourself?

851
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,720
Get lost!

852
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,960
Take care.

853
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,240
Let her stay

854
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,920
as longer as she wants.

855
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,760
I don't believe

856
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,760
I can't defeat someone who has been forgotten by you.

857
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,640
Hello, reporter?

858
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,240
I have a piece of news to announce.

859
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,240
Fang Leng and I are in a relationship.

860
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,960
Hello, everyone.

861
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,200
The secret relationship between the famous playboy, Fang Leng,

862
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,760
and the heir to the Jiang Group, Jiang Xue,

863
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,840
has been disclosed.

864
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,480
They have formalized their relationship.

865
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,560
Jiang Xue is here.

866
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,280
Miss Jiang,

867
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,000
will you have feelings of insecurity

868
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,160
for the gossip about Mr. Fang?

869
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,080
No one can give you feelings

870
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,440
of security except yourself.

871
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,760
In fact,

872
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,560
I'm the one who should make him feel secure.

873
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,120
He kept seeing different people.

874
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,600
Isn't it all because

875
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
he hadn't met someone who could make him feel secure?

876
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,480
Could you tell us

877
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,800
if you're going to get married?

878
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,760
It all depends.

879
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,400
Temporarily we're not going to get married.

880
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,920
I hope you'll

881
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,560
give our relationship more space.

882
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,360
Thank you.

883
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,640
Could we delay you for a few more minutes?

884
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,520
Miss Jiang, say something more.

885
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,400
Miss Jiang, could I ask you a few more questions?

886
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,680
Have you found out the restaurant Mr. Fang booked yesterday?

887
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,360
Okay.

888
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,360
Chai Xiaoqi.

889
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,440
Chai Xiaoqi, get up!

890
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,840
I don't wanna get up. I don't wanna go to work.

891
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,880
I won't get up.

892
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,320
What did we do

893
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,880
last night?

894
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,760
What could we do in the dead of night

895
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,480
except sleeping?

896
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,800
You slept with your head on my shoulder.

897
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,920
My neck is aching.

898
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,320
If I remember correctly,

899
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,240
you made me take a drug, didn't you?

900
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,280
What exactly are you up to?

901
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,200
If you want money, I can give it to you.

902
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
Why did you do such a boring thing?

903
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,560
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh. no.

904
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,800
I didn't take my annunciator.

905
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,720
You were so weak

906
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,520
and your forehead kept burning.

907
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,160
I couldn't even manage to do it.

908
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,240
I'm the one who should be gloomy.

909
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,520
What did you try to do?

910
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,560
What on earth do you want to do?

911
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
I'm the one who should worry what you'll do to me.

912
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,120
What do you think I'll do to you?

913
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,000
Why are you still here?

914
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,880
He was holding onto me.

915
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,680
How could I go home?

916
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,960
How can you blame it on me?

917
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,440
Why can't I blame it on you?

918
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,000
Alright, stop quarreling.

919
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,560
Boyfriends and girlfriends now

920
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,560
are all so irritable.

921
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,320
-Shut up! -Shut up!

922
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,760
-I'm not her boyfriend! -I'm not his girlfriend!

923
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,500
Ever since I met you,

924
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,180
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

925
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,580
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

926
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,460
only you.

927
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,660
We're out of reach

928
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,980
but appreciate each other.

929
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:06,780
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

930
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,820
The yearning invades

931
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,380
and lurks in my mind.

932
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,940
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

933
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,020
I'm getting addicted to it

934
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,340
and my sense is shielded.

935
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:35,140
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

936
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,300
Put the hottest heart

937
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,620
in this cold body.

938
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,980
I'm looking at you,

939
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,140
and my love has nowhere to go.

940
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,380
Ever since I met you,

941
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,300
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

942
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,580
Every day is a new memory

943
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,620
which is only be about you and me.

944
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,860
I can't lie to myself anymore.

945
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,700
Please give me the courage to believe.

946
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

947
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,540
only you.

948
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,660
Even everything becomes silent,

949
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,780
I still have you.
