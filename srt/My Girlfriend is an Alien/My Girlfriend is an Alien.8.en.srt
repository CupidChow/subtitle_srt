1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 8

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,160
For my annunciator,

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,120
fight!

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,080
I will submit your plan

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
to Mr. Fang in the afternoon.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
As for the information we need,

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,160
you have to continue to search for it.

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
Give it to him tomorrow.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Mind your business.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Xiaoqi.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
Mr. Fang has a meeting inside.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,200
I'll take you to see him later.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,440
In addition,

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,760
you get a job here because of Mr. Fang.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,400
To avoid causing debate,

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,600
I won't introduce you to other staff.

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,320
All right.

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll stay for only a few days.

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,560
What did you say?

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Where is my seat?

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,920
Here.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Right next to me.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
To welcome your entry,

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,800
Mr. Fang made me prepare these.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
You need to get familiar with the data on the table.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Go.

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,320
Go for it.

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
Thank you, Assistant Han.

46
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,400
You are welcome.

47
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Thank you for your hard work.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,880
Thank you.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
Look forward to cooperating again.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,120
Calm down.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
Don't think about it.

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,880
I'm going to be attracted by those male hormones again.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,880
Oh my god.

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
I want to pounce on them.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,080
What to do?

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Hello.

57
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
Is there data on the table?

58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,480
Yes.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,160
What's wrong?

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,480
Just take some in.

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,520
Okay.

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,040
Come in.

63
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
How is your first day at work?

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Pretty good.

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,520
What happened?

66
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,800
What's up?

67
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,080
What's wrong with your nose?

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,120
A little cold.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm afraid of infecting it to others,

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
so I stuff them.

71
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
You are so tired.

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,440
You are worried all day.

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
I will ask Assistant Han to take you to the hospital.

74
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,280
No need. No need.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,960
It doesn't matter.

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,320
It doesn't matter.

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,160
Okay then.

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
Thank you for your hard work.

79
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
Never mind.

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
I can do more.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
For example,

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,800
I am very interested in

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,320
the work of the Scientific Research Department.

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,480
You?

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
Scientific research?

86
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,200
My dream since childhood

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,760
is to be a scientist.

88
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,400
So,

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
it's better for you to arrange

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,080
more work related to scientific research to me.

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,240
I know.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,560
I will tell Assistant Han.

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
Really?

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,720
That's great.

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,640
If there is nothing else,

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm leaving for work.

97
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,720
Wait.

98
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,640
Today is your first day at work.

99
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,920
Let me treat you to a meal.

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Meal?

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,480
Alright.

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,280
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,400
You said that we should date secretly.

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,960
You took me out like this.

105
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160
Aren't you afraid of being discovered by others?

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,520
You are my employee now.

107
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,120
It's normal that boss brings his employee to have a meal.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
Who dares to embarrass you?

109
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
I won't be polite then.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,160
Why don't you eat?

111
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,080
Why do you stare at me?

112
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,000
Fang Leng?

113
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,040
You go first.

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,080
What a coincidence!

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Miss Jiang is also here.

116
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,640
You are...

117
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,920
Xiaoqi is my employee now.

118
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,520
I just became Mr. Fang's secretary.

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,680
He brought me out for a meal.

120
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Miss Jiang, how coincident to meet you here!

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Secretary?

122
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,480
If I remember it correctly,

123
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,920
some time ago

124
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,880
you seemed to be a waiter in the restaurant.

125
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,520
Have you become Mr. Fang's secretary so soon?

126
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
No, no, no.

127
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm just his subordinate.

128
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,160
Don't misunderstand us.

129
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,480
If there is nothing else, we will go first.

130
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
Wait.

131
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,400
Just now, I came

132
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,880
via a free lift.

133
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,800
I guess it's hard

134
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,200
to take a taxi at this moment.

135
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,960
Mr. Fang.

136
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,280
Do you mind offering me a lift?

137
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,040
No.

138
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
I heard you've been busy with private affairs recently.

139
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Have you encountered any problems?

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Why did you ask so?

141
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,600
I have looked for you several times
for Fang Lie's art exhibition.

142
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
But the secretary always said you were not in the company.

143
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,640
I was worried about you.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,600
Unexpectedly,

145
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
we meet tonight.

146
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,600
Is there a problem with the art exhibition?

147
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,080
Well,

148
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,440
I can't find you if it's fine?

149
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,800
Don't forget that

150
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,480
I have been certified by your parents.

151
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,080
That day,

152
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,600
you seemed to just come to visit us.

153
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
My dad didn't mean that.

154
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I was kidding.

155
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,920
Why are you so serious?

156
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,960
Even if they want me to be your wife,

157
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,720
it's up to me.

158
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,120
What's wrong?

159
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,920
Are you OK?

160
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,160
I'm fine.

161
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
Leave her alone.

162
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
She is tough.

163
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Miss Jiang.

164
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
Do you have any other arrangements tonight?

165
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,160
No.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,360
What's up?

167
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
I have something to talk to you.

168
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,000
Alright.

169
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,520
But...

170
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,800
Never mind.

171
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,560
I'll send her back first.

172
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,240
Bye.

173
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,120
Miss Jiang.

174
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Beauty outweighs friend.

175
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,280
Since that you like her so much,

176
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,680
why do you let me pretend to be your girlfriend?

177
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
Damn man! Damn man!

178
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,000
You

179
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,680
really live in this place?

180
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,360
What's wrong?

181
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,520
Those like us

182
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,880
can only live in the rich area of luxury and dissipation life?

183
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Although this is an old community,

184
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,080
its environment is good

185
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,440
and quiet.

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,240
I can avoid my parents' nagging and surveillance.

187
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,440
Isn't it nice?

188
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Yes.

189
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,760
Previously,

190
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,560
I might underestimate you.

191
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,160
Me, too.

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,320
It's the first time for me

193
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,120
to see you having such a vivid look.

194
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Vivid?

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,080
You are realer to that employee

196
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,360
than to me.

197
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm just not used to her lively acts.

198
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,400
Please don't mind it.

199
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,280
By the way,

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,800
what do you want to talk with me?

201
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,120
I want say that

202
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
I hope you can forget the blind date.

203
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,600
Why?

204
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,480
I don't want to cheat you.

205
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,280
I don't think I will fall in love with you.

206
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,480
So I don't hope

207
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,600
you waste your feelings on this matter.

208
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,600
Sorry.

209
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Fang Leng.

210
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,440
Why?

211
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,280
Why did you say that suddenly?

212
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,560
Did something wrong

213
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,280
happen at your home?

214
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,280
Or did someone

215
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
dislike me?

216
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,920
It has nothing to do with others.

217
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,360
I think

218
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,800
I won't fall in love with you.

219
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,680
Besides feelings,

220
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,360
we have business between us.

221
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,060
=Xiaoqi=

222
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,180
=Fang Leng=

223
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,340
=Pharmacy=

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,960
Who?

225
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,080
Open the door.

226
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
It's me.

227
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,440
Why are you back?

228
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,800
I forgot this.

229
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I see you haven't slept yet.

230
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,120
Take your medicine before you sleep.

231
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
You didn't close the window when sleeping.

232
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,760
No wonder you would catch a cold.

233
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,400
Didn't you drive Jiang Xue back?

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
You two didn't contact a bit more?

235
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
You are my girlfriend.

236
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,480
How can you ask me this?

237
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,720
Isn't my relationship with you false?

238
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,640
Your relationship with her is real.

239
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,960
Rest assured.

240
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll only do what I should do.

241
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,480
I will not affect

242
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,600
your relationship with her.

243
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,720
Take care of yourself.

244
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,600
Pour water.

245
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,880
Okay.

246
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,240
You may have a cold today.

247
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
I don't know which one is good.

248
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
So I bought them all.

249
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,000
You take this first.

250
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,000
Here you are.

251
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,680
Isn't it bitter?

252
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,120
No.

253
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,000
You need to drink water.

254
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,200
My relationship with you

255
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,520
isn't false?

256
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
Why are you so good to me?

257
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,320
Am I good to you?

258
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,000
No.

259
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,400
I am afraid that your sickness

260
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,480
will influence tomorrow's arrangement.

261
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,880
What's the arrangement tomorrow?

262
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Don't stand still. Take a seat.

263
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,600
I won't sit.

264
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,880
I'll ask Assistant Han to remind you tomorrow.

265
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,840
Bye.

266
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,160
Wait a second.

267
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,040
Well,

268
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
in the future,

269
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,160
can you stop

270
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,480
treating me well?

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,760
Why?

272
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm afraid I will get used to it

273
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,520
if you treat me well.

274
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,640
Don't worry.

275
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,640
I won't let you develop this habit.

276
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,960
In addition,

277
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,600
except me,

278
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,840
don't open the door to other men casually.

279
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,200
It's unsafe.

280
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,480
Bye.

281
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,280
I just lied to him that

282
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,640
I was sick.

283
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Why does he care so much about me?

284
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,520
Kubri,

285
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
I feel so bad.

286
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,440
Are you sure you just feel bad?

287
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,240
Xiaoqi.

288
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,920
You just took the medicine he bought just now.

289
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,480
Since ancient times, handsome men have caused many disasters.

290
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
You

291
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,520
will be killed by men sooner or later.

292
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,840
Mr. Zhou from the Project Planning Department contacted us.

293
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,880
He has taken the lead

294
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,440
to sign a strategic cooperation plan.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And Mr. Li, the investor of the Sunshine Investment

296
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,920
may have some signed treaties

297
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,400
that need you to connect him by yourself.

298
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,840
Mr. Fang.

299
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,800
Li from the Project Department

300
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,120
sent a report back,

301
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,360
saying that there is a contract

302
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,080
that may require you to terminate by yourself.

303
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,400
This time,

304
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
I won't be affected by hormones.

305
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,920
Mr. Li of the Project Planning Department needs you to sign...

306
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,680
Mr. Fang.

307
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,000
What are you laughing at?

308
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,320
Did I laugh?

309
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Maybe.

310
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
Some documents of the Scientific Research Department

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,680
are not quite clear.

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,160
Go to ask them to revise it.

313
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,960
Okay.

314
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,640
Oh, by the way,

315
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,480
in the future, the data of
the Scientific Research Department will be sent by Xiaoqi.

316
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,240
She likes science.

317
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Xiaoqi.

318
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,280
Send this to the Scientific Research Department.

319
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
Scientific Research Department?

320
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,800
Work hard.

321
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,680
Mr. Fang

322
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
keeps watching you.

323
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,640
Scientific Research Department.

324
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
Stay here.

325
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,120
Help me guard outside.

326
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,760
I'm happy in vain.

327
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
It didn't mention the annunciator at all.

328
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,360
You are stupid.

329
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,520
Will humans call it annunciator?

330
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
With their technology,

331
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,640
they can't detect what it is.

332
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,920
You check it again

333
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,680
to see if there is anything suspected.

334
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,400
Yes.

335
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,080
Its composition is

336
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,640
something that doesn't exist on earth.

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,360
If it's produced massively,

338
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,480
it can become precious sapphire.

339
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,120
Sapphire?

340
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,960
That's it.

341
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,560
You've worked hard.

342
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,520
Idiot.

343
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,560
Employee's card is in another pocket.

344
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,320
Hello?

345
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,120
Is anyone here?

346
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,520
Strange.

347
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,040
Why is the magnetic field so uncomfortable?

348
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Who are you?

349
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,400
How did you get in?

350
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,240
I'm the general secretary of Mr. Fang.

351
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,360
He asked me to come

352
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,080
to send the documents.

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,520
Thank you.

354
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,760
My pleasure.

355
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,840
Wait.

356
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Well,

357
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,640
Mr. Fang also let me know about the project.

358
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,480
What project?

359
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,040
That sapphire project.

360
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,840
This way please.

361
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,280
Mr. Fang, are you going to the art exhibition now?

362
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,160
Yes.

363
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,000
It's almost starting.

364
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Did you notify Xiaoqi?

365
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,840
Not yet.

366
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,680
She just went to send documents to
the Scientific Research Department.

367
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,560
I'll look for her.

368
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,040
All right.

369
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Let me go.

370
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,640
This project has the highest

371
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,000
level of confidentiality in the company.

372
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,480
So the files are stored separately.

373
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,680
Please wait.

374
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,560
Okay.

375
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,520
Strange.

376
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,320
Why is the magnetic field here

377
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,960
different from other places?

378
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,920
Yes.

379
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,440
Here has the highest level of confidentiality in the company.

380
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,280
There are many interfering instruments.

381
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,800
Aren't you here for the first time?

382
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,480
Why do you know that the magnetic field is different?

383
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,520
I just feel like it's grim here.

384
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,000
Then I imagined

385
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,320
and guessed it.

386
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,400
Xiaoqi.

387
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,120
Xiaoqi.

388
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,040
Mr. Fang.

389
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,000
Why are you here in person?

390
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,640
I have given the documents to him.

391
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,600
What else do you want to do?

392
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,200
Fang Lie's art exhibition is about to start.

393
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,320
Come with me.

394
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,200
Let's go.

395
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,040
Let's go.

396
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,100
=Fang Lie's Oil Painting Exhibition=

397
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,400
What are you doing?

398
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,080
Nothing.

399
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,240
Go.

400
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,480
What are you watching?

401
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,640
Just take a look.

402
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,520
Hurry up.

403
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,280
I remember

404
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,480
I still have work to do.

405
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,120
I'd like to finish my work first.

406
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,320
Didn't you just go to the company?

407
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,680
What work is so urgent?

408
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,920
I...

409
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,520
Look at what they wear.

410
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,160
I wear so casually.

411
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,280
It's not suitable.

412
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,000
You are my secretary.

413
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
No need to be so formal.

414
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,000
Do you know where there is a toilet?

415
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
I don't feel well.

416
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,120
I want to go to the toilet.

417
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,000
There is a toilet upstairs.

418
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,120
I'll just go down.

419
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,760
There is a toilet upstairs.

420
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,240
No need.

421
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,040
I'll go back first.

422
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,880
Aren't you going to the toilet?

423
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,200
Come here.

424
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,080
Fang Leng.

425
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,840
Sorry.

426
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,080
Can I talk to Mr. Fang alone?

427
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,800
No problem.

428
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,120
Mr. Fang won't be so stingy, right?

429
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,560
Although we failed in the blind date,

430
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
we can't say hello to each other?

431
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,240
No.

432
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,160
Thank you for your hard work for this art exhibition.

433
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,120
As for the project bonus, I will let...

434
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,120
You are

435
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,720
always so serious.

436
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,560
I have figured it out.

437
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,080
Since that you can reject me so frankly,

438
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,840
I should thank you.

439
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,520
Don't you blame me?

440
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,640
I'm usually used to be flattered.

441
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,600
It's rare that you are willing to tell me the truth.

442
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,040
I won't blame you.

443
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,800
Thank you for understanding.

444
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,040
Miss Jiang.

445
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,840
All right.

446
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,080
We don't have to be so nervous anymore.

447
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,040
I hope you can still treat me as your friend.

448
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,360
Nice to meet you again.

449
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,560
In broad daylight,

450
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,840
they are not shameful?

451
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,880
Xiaoqi.

452
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,680
How about it?

453
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Are paintings of this artist good?

454
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Pretty good.

455
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,760
But

456
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,840
I was too hurry

457
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,720
to bring you a gift.

458
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,120
What did you say?

460
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,440
You are my sister-in-law now.

461
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
You are welcome.

462
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,560
Yes.

463
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,400
We are family.

464
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,120
Yes.

465
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,920
Congratulations.

466
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,800
Fang Lie.

467
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,080
Well,

468
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,440
how have you been lately?

469
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm fine.

470
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,360
Why did you ask me this?

471
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,640
No-nothing.

472
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,880
But...

473
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,440
Many people are always staring at my brother.

474
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,880
Staying with him,

475
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,560
you must be sure to protect yourself,

476
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,600
especially my family.

477
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,920
I know.

478
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,120
Mr. Fang.

479
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,120
Bad news.

480
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,840
The sapphire is lost.

481
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,480
Chai Xiaoqi had been there.

482
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,280
Impossible.

483
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
Only Chai Xiaoqi had been to the Scientific Research Department.

484
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,280
In addition,

485
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,120
she checked the sapphire in your name.

486
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,040
No.

487
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,640
What's wrong?

488
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,400
Stomachache.

489
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,960
I'll go to the toilet.

490
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,440
-I can't help it. I can't help it. -Xiaoqi.

491
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,280
Allen said the sapphire in the research room has been stolen.

492
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,520
Did you do it?

493
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,200
What, what are you talking about?

494
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,240
Why are you running?

495
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,480
I told you.

496
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,040
I have a stomachache.

497
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,920
I am going to the toilet.

498
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,480
Mr. Fang.

499
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,440
Let's call the police.

500
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,160
No.

501
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,600
Leng.

502
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
What's wrong?

503
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,280
I will ask you again.

504
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,240
No matter what you did,

505
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,880
I will forgive you.

506
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,840
Did you steal the sapphire?

507
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,040
Leng.

508
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,040
What did you say?

509
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,680
How could Xiaoqi steal something?

510
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,720
Answer me.

511
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,840
If something is lost,

512
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,560
let her cooperate with the inspection.

513
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,760
Mr. Fang.

514
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,440
Let Chai Xiaoqi hand in her bag.

515
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,880
I said it.

516
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,840
Don't touch her.

517
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,080
I accept the inspection.

518
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,720
Sorry.

519
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,120
Don't you want to check it?

520
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,960
Check it.

521
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,840
Sorry.

522
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,880
Xiaoqi.

523
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,920
Oh my god.

524
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,120
I was scared to death.

525
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,520
Fortunately I escaped.

526
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,680
But I can't keep it in him all the time.

527
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,760
What if he finds it out?

528
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
I still have to take it back.

529
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Sorry.

530
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
I shouldn't have doubted you.

531
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,400
I am sorry, too.

532
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,520
I shouldn't

533
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,280
have run away.

534
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,600
I shouldn't have gone to
the Scientific Research Department to see the sapphire.

535
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,360
I was wrong.

536
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:47,960
Sorry.

537
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,600
Never mind.

538
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,240
Art exhibition is about to start.

539
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Let's go down.

540
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,920
Wait a second.

541
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,920
How quiet here!

542
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,720
Stay here with me.

543
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,640
Okay?

544
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Just stay with me.

545
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
Just a little while.

546
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,440
Okay?

547
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,120
You are the best.

548
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
Fang Leng.

549
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,080
Fang Leng.

550
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,520
Why do I feel your pectoral muscles

551
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,040
become bigger again?

552
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,000
Awesome.

553
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,200
I feel your chest muscles are bigger than mine.

554
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,680
What do you want to do?

555
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
Just let me feel it again.

556
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,520
Just a moment.

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,040
This is also great.

558
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,520
Do you still have sense of shame?

559
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,240
I do.

560
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,240
Let me touch it.

561
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,520
No one will find it.

562
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
No one is here.

563
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,640
Let me touch it.

564
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Let me touch it.

565
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,800
Mr. Fang,

566
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,520
the art exhibition has be...

567
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:35,880
Be...

568
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,720
Begun.

569
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,480
Go out first.

570
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,680
I'll be there later.

571
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,520
Yes.

572
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,000
Mr. Fang.

573
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,680
Go on.

574
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,360
I saw nothing.

575
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,680
What on earth do you want to do?

576
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,280
Wait.

577
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,840
We can go out.

578
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,400
Wait a second. Wait a second.

579
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,920
Fang Leng.

580
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,920
Xiaoqi.

581
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,760
Fang Leng.

582
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm so hot.

583
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,720
I really...

584
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,720
Aren't you hot?

585
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,520
Why is it so hot?

586
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,280
Come on.

587
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,960
I help you take off your coat.

588
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,440
Wait.

589
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,160
Take it off.

590
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,760
So hot.

591
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,400
Really hot.

592
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,000
Stop.

593
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,240
It's too hot for your health.

594
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,400
It's good after taking it off.

595
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,960
Yes.

596
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,440
This hand. This hand.

597
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,800
As for chairman...

598
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,320
Hurry up.

599
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,040
Just a moment.

600
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,120
It will come out.

601
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,800
Over there...

602
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,840
Mr. Fang, you...

603
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,680
Can you be reserved a little bit?

604
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,040
Well, Mr. Fang.

605
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,640
Well.

606
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,560
No need to hurry.

607
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I will deal with the chairman first.

608
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,280
Take your time.

609
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
There is no rush.

610
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,320
Bye.

611
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,480
Yes.

612
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:28,960
No.

613
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,200
Assistant Han. Assistant Han.

614
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,200
Stretch out!

615
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,120
Do you think I dare not do something to you?

616
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,000
What are you going to do?

617
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,360
Stop testing me.

618
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,600
Wasn't it hot just now?

619
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,400
If you want to go downstairs,

620
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,040
put on it.

621
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Don't catch a cold.

622
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,320
No, Fang Leng.

623
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,200
You...

624
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,120
It can't be put on me anymore.

625
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,080
Shida.

626
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,640
Shida.

627
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,400
Fang Lie's art exhibition is about to start.

628
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,600
Why are you not ready yet?

629
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,040
Our son is waiting.

630
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,360
You investigate Fang Leng behind?

631
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
What did you say?

632
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,000
Why should I investigate him?

633
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,200
Did you think

634
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
I wouldn't find out who

635
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,960
sent an anonymous letter

636
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,720
to expose my son's illness?

637
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,400
If it were not Fang Leng's girlfriend

638
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,200
who acknowledged it,

639
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,000
he would be defamed already.

640
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
You really misunderstood me.

641
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,080
I didn't.

642
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,480
You still want to

643
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,200
lie to me?

644
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:49,800
In fact,

645
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,400
I didn't mean it.

646
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,720
I cared about Fang Leng.

647
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,920
I know what you want.

648
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,240
For Fang Lie,

649
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,760
you even go against rules

650
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
as a mother.

651
00:34:59,480 --> 00:34:59,880
All right.

652
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,160
From today on,

653
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,760
let Fang Lie

654
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,000
engage in art and hold art exhibitions.

655
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,600
Having you as his mom,

656
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,040
he will cause trouble even if he works in the company.

657
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,920
Shida, listen.

658
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,080
Shida.

659
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,400
You can't do this to your son.

660
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,200
Shida.

661
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,180
=Brother=

662
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,800
Hello, what should I do?

663
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,400
Shida learns it.

664
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,280
My son's future is gone.

665
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,800
Yes.

666
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,640
It does make sense.

667
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,720
Excuse me for a moment.

668
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,080
You are the main character tonight.

669
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
Why don't you get

670
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,080
ready to address?

671
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,480
My parents haven't come yet.

672
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,600
It can't begin.

673
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,480
Why?

674
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,440
Since my childhood,

675
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,960
only my brother wins honor to the family.

676
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,840
I just care about spending money

677
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,120
and achieve nothing.

678
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,080
Now I finally manage to hold an art exhibition.

679
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,800
I must show it to them.

680
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,240
Okay.

681
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,840
You are the boss today.

682
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,800
You decide it.

683
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,760
But speaking of your brother,

684
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,600
what's going on with him and that secretary?

685
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
I don't know.

686
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,120
Did my brother tell you anything?

687
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,040
Yes.

688
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,080
We will be friends later.

689
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:22,960
Really?

690
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,200
You gave up my brother?

691
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,600
Not at all.

692
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,360
Someday,

693
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
he will fall in love with me again.

694
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,720
Bye.

695
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,000
Lie.

696
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,360
Uncle.

697
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,960
Why are you here alone?

698
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,520
Where are my parents?

699
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,320
Your mom is ill.

700
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,280
She wants you to go back quickly.

701
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,120
Hurry up.

702
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,520
Sister.

703
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,120
I have asked Lie to leave.

704
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,800
Didn't he let Lie paint?

705
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,720
Let's ruin this exhibition

706
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,000
to end everything.

707
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,800
Don't worry.

708
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,440
I will ask someone to ruin it totally
without leaving any trace behind.

709
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,480
Okay.

710
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,920
I will be able

711
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,280
to contact my mother star soon.

712
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,000
It may be my last time tonight

713
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,040
to attend a human party.

714
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,840
Before leaving,

715
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,800
should I say goodbye to Fang Leng?

716
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,080
Suddenly I'm unwilling to leave the earth.

717
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,040
I'll go over.

718
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,720
What do you smell?

719
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,520
Don't you smell a familiar smell?

720
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,280
I think you want to smell someone you know.

721
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,040
Fang Lie has been away just now.

722
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,400
Not Fang Lie.

723
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,840
Kitchen smell.

724
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,000
Kitchen smell?

725
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,320
Yes.

726
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,800
What's up?

727
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,920
Is this a fire alarm?

728
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,080
Go.

729
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,000
Hurry up.

730
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,640
Fang Lie. Fang Lie. Fang Lie.

731
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,120
Is Fang Lie inside?

732
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,880
Fang Lie.

733
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,960
I'll go to find Fang Lie.

734
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,560
You stay here.

735
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,160
No.

736
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,520
You will be hurt.

737
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Let me go.

738
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,560
Xiaoqi.

739
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,280
Fang Leng.

740
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,920
Stop chasing them.

741
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,960
Fang Lie has left.

742
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,280
Xiaoqi is still inside.

743
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,840
You go first.

744
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,040
Fang Leng.

745
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,360
Go.

746
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,680
Fang Leng.

747
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,840
Miss Jiang, hurry up.

748
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,960
Fang Lie, are you here?

749
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,400
Fang Lie, where are you?

750
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,880
Fang Lie.

751
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,120
Fang Lie.

752
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,840
Fang Lie.

753
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,560
Fang Lie.

754
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,040
Fang Lie.

755
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,200
Fang Lie.

756
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,440
Xiaoqi.

757
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,360
Xiaoqi.

758
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,200
Wake up.

759
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,520
Save Fang Lie first.

760
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,760
Fang Lie has gone out.

761
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,200
All right.

762
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,960
I'll take you away.

763
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,200
Go.

764
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,840
Did you call the police?

765
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,560
Yes.

766
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,960
They will come soon.

767
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,160
Xiaoqi.

768
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,560
Xiaoqi.

769
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,080
Wake up. Wake up.

770
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,720
Xiaoqi. Xiaoqi.

771
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,980
Ever since I met you,

772
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,660
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

773
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,060
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

774
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,940
only you.

775
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,140
We're out of reach

776
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,460
but appreciate each other.

777
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:36,260
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

778
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,300
The yearning invades

779
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,860
and lurks in my mind.

780
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,420
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

781
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,500
I'm getting addicted to it

782
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,820
and my sense is shielded.

783
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,620
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

784
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,780
Put the hottest heart

785
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,100
in this cold body.

786
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,460
I'm looking at you,

787
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,620
and my love has nowhere to go.

788
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,860
Ever since I met you,

789
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,780
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

790
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,060
Every day is a new memory

791
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
which is only be about you and me.

792
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,340
I can't lie to myself anymore.

793
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,180
Please give me the courage to believe.

794
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,100
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

795
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,020
only you.

796
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,140
Even everything becomes silent,

797
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,260
I still have you.
