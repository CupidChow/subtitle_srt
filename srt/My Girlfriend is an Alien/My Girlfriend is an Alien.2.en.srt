1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 2

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
It turns out you are the person I am looking for.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,440
What did you say?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,560
Do not come near.

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
Your hormones are so strong.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
I feel like I'm going to crash.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
Can you speak like a human?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,560
Okay.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,320
I'll speak human words.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
The system has enabled Chinese program

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,360
and is speaking human words.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,240
Do you think it's funny?

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,360
No, it's not funny.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
Where's Fang Lie?

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,840
Fang Lie is...

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,640
Fang Lie is right in this restaurant.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Please take it.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,360
As expected.

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,000
What a shame.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,800
Dispatch some men

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,640
to the location I sent you.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Hey!

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,840
Stop!

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,200
Stop!

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
You took my annunciator

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
and want to catch my man.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,520
Do you think I can't stop you?

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,960
Fang Lie.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,240
Fang Lie.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,960
Here you come.

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,800
Come.

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,320
Sit.

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,720
Well...

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,840
No.

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
Fang Lie, leave now,

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,880
or it'll be too late.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,480
That unscrupulous profiteer is coming to catch you.

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
Leave. Leave. Leave now.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,920
Fang Leng.

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,360
Go. Go.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,280
Don't worry.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,440
He can't find this place.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,800
Come on. Sit down.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,160
No.

62
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,320
No.

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Fang Lie,

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
it'll really be too late.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,640
Please go now.

66
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Well.

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Did you

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,920
tell him where I am?

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,800
Well,

70
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,560
I didn't mean to

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,600
sell you out,

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,480
but...

73
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,600
There's no but.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
All people in the restaurant are my subordinates.

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,200
I'll know as long as

76
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,920
there's any sign of trouble.

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,680
Wow.

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,480
Hello.

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,280
I prepared

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,440
great food

81
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
as well as a show today.

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
Show?

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,880
Yes.

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,920
In fact,

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,400
I've ordered take-out many times.

86
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,200
They all treated me as a bad man.

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
If it hadn't been for you,

88
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,600
I'd be stuck in that little black house.

89
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,800
That is the way I do things.

90
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,160
I'll distinguish kindness and hatred clearly.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,920
Well,

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
cheers.

93
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,760
But do you earthlings

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
pay a debt of gratitude

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
by treating the helper to a meal?

96
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,840
It depends on how big the help is.

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
For the help between us,

98
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,640
we'll become friends

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,640
after having a meal together.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
What about the help of saving one's life?

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
It can only be paid back by marriage.

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,440
Marriage?

103
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,200
Yes.

104
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
Are you stupid?

105
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,960
No, no.

106
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,640
I don't want him to marry me.

107
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,720
Kindhearted take-out girl,

108
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,720
who else did you help

109
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,440
besides me?

110
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
No one.

111
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Not everyone is as handsome as you.

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
Interesting.

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,520
Where are you from?

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm from a very far-away place.

115
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,600
It's even farther than the stars.

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,320
Are you an alien?

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Hush.

118
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,600
How do you know?

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
Do not tell anyone else.

120
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,640
I'll also tell you something.

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,640
I'm also an alien actually.

122
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,360
Are you?

123
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,040
As expected,

124
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
such handsome man as you

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
won't be an ordinary person.

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm from Capetown Planet.

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,280
What about you?

128
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,960
Me?

129
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm from Planet 625.

130
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,520
Planet 625?

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
Where's Planet 625?

132
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
Why haven't I detected that planet?

133
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,840
Where it is?

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
My planet is too small.

135
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,320
I'll tell you about it in the future.

136
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,360
Oh.

137
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Nice to meet you

138
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
on the earth,

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,760
my friend from a friendly planet.

140
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,520
Nice to meet you,

141
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
my friend from a friendly planet.

142
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Why are you wearing gloves?

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,280
No.

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,120
The skin structure of people on our planet

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
is different from that of people on other planets.

146
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
Thus, we can't touch directly,

147
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,640
otherwise something big will happen.

148
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,680
What big thing will happen?

149
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Something big will happen to you soon.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,520
Leng,

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
why do you come?

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,400
That's the smell of this man.

153
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,160
Annunciator.

154
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,800
You guys.

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,440
I finally found you.

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,920
Why didn't you tell me

157
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
my brother had come?

158
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,220
Have you played enough?

159
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
Go home if you have played enough.

160
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm not playing.

161
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,000
I just came out to look for inspiration.

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
Look for inspiration?

163
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Take him away.

164
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,200
Fang...

165
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,520
Leng.

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:35,760
Fang Lie.

167
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,720
Fang Lie.

168
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
Let go of me. You're restricting my freedom.

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,760
I've already given you freedom.

170
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,400
According to the contract, you'll have to pay a high price.

171
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
If you don't follow the contract,

172
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,560
you can only look for freedom in jail.

173
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,600
Go.

174
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,320
Wait.

175
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,800
Let your men release Fang Lie,

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
or I will be rude to you.

177
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,720
It's so strange. Why can't I sense the annunciator?

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,560
Isn't it on him?

179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
Xiaoqi,

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,360
I didn't expect you're such a loyal friend.

181
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
Please conduct yourself with dignity.

182
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Who's she?

183
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,080
She...

184
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
She's my friend.

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,360
You even made friends with such a person.

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,600
Okay.

187
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
Keep him in my house from today on.

188
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
It isn't on his body.

189
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,960
Will the annunciator be in his home?

190
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,800
Go.

191
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,360
No, no.

192
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,640
Leng.

193
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
If you take him away,

194
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,280
take me as well.

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Do not force me to be rude to a girl.

196
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,920
No.

197
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,240
Fang Lie is my only friend.

198
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560
You can't hurt them. You can't.

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,480
Let go.

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,720
Let go.

201
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,640
Leng.

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Leng,

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Xiaoqi and I

204
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,360
think the same.

205
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,040
Hum.

206
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Leng,

207
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,200
if you don't take Xiaoqi back

208
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,360
together with me today,

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,600
I can't possibly draw anything.

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,160
Leng.

211
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,920
Let go.

212
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Do you agree?

213
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,240
Go, go, go.

214
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
Here's quite interesting.

215
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Not at all!

216
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,600
Dealing with these lifeless machines every day,

217
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,040
I almost become a machine.

218
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,280
Have you finished?

219
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,640
Fang Lie,

220
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
go to sleep in the room on the second floor.

221
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,160
Okay.

222
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,200
And you

223
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,800
sleep in the guest room.

224
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,640
No.

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,840
I will sleep together with my prince.

226
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
Fine.

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
After I got in, it doesn't matter where I sleep.

228
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
Do you know where the guest room is?

229
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
I know. I'll take you there.

230
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,520
Go.

231
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,360
Hello?

232
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,120
Mr. Fang,

233
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
Xiaoqi is of dubious background.

234
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm a bit worried.

235
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
She's just a mad woman.

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Just let her stay for a day.

237
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,200
It'll make Fang Lie stable at least.

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,160
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

239
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,160
Okay.

240
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160
As people say, it's better to sleep on bed

241
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
than travel around the universe.

242
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,680
My God.

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Earthlings are good at enjoyment.

244
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
No,

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
I came with a mission.

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,920
My annunciator.

247
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,720
Annunciator.

248
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,440
Show up, my annunciator.

249
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,400
Why can't I sense it at all?

250
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,200
It seems I can only look for it manually.

251
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
Where's the leakage of water?

252
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,640
Wow!

253
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
Wow!

254
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,280
Wow!

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,520
Who's that?

256
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,720
I couldn't find my annunciator anywhere,

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,480
and was almost found out by him.

258
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,960
Is it in his room?

259
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,760
I just haven't searched his body.

260
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,760
People should believe in themselves.

261
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,920
I'll only look for the annunciator.

262
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,640
I won't touch him at will.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,360
Tell me.

264
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,640
What did you steal?

265
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,280
I only focused on his figure that day.

266
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,400
Now it seems

267
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,920
he also has a handsome face.

268
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,720
He has bright eyes

269
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
like the aurora on Tajik Planet.

270
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,360
He has a straight nose like the snowy mountain of Mulholland.

271
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
His mouth...

272
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
What does his mouth look like?

273
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,920
Answer me.

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

275
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,280
Do not play any trick,

276
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
or I will call the police at once.

277
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,200
I didn't steal anything.

278
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
I just came to look for my annunciator.

279
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
That's really a bad lie.

280
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,120
Why is your stuff in my room?

281
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,840
You don't believe after I told you.

282
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,400
What now?

283
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,520
Search my body.

284
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,760
I'll take off my clothes to let you search.

285
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Shame on you!

286
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,240
You're shameless

287
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,920
and not cultivated.

288
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,800
I really don't know why

289
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
my brother settles on you.

290
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,880
I also have a question.

291
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
Fang Lie is such a good person.

292
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,920
Why does he have such a bad brother?

293
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
What are you doing?

294
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,880
It's strange. Why doesn't it work when he's present?

295
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
What are you doing?

296
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,160
Because you touch me,

297
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I can't perform well.

298
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,840
Let go.

299
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,280
Let go.

300
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,840
Security guard,

301
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
come up now.

302
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,320
There's a psycho in my room.

303
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,960
Let go of me.

304
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,200
Let go of me.

305
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm Fang Lie's friend.

306
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,040
If you drag me away like this,

307
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,320
how can you explain it to him?

308
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,320
Hey!

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,560
You're a woman who goes to

310
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
a strange man's room in the middle of the night.

311
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,400
If I let you stay,

312
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,520
I really can't explain it to Fang Lie.

313
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,720
You...

314
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,880
Profiteer!

315
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,760
Profiteer!

316
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,200
Let go of me.

317
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:31,960
Let go of me.

318
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,840
Take her away.

319
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,520
Profiteer!

320
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,320
I'll kick you.

321
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,600
Miss,

322
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,480
stop running wild.

323
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,160
Tell me where your home is.

324
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,880
We'll send you back and report to our boss.

325
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Don't bother.

326
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,120
I can go back on my own.

327
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,280
Mr. Fang.

328
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,960
Where's she?

329
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,400
Look for her.

330
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,880
Morning, Leng.

331
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,200
Hasn't Xiaoqi got up?

332
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,640
She has already gone back.

333
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,320
How come?

334
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,440
I haven't left yet.

335
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,600
Why would she go back?

336
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,120
I'm going to see her.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
Xiaoqi.

338
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,600
Xiaoqi.

339
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,560
Leng,

340
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,480
the quilt even hasn't been spread.

341
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,360
Did you drive her away last night?

342
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,840
It's not important.

343
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,120
What is important is that

344
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,280
you can't be with

345
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,840
such an unscrupulous woman.

346
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
Everyone can tell me so,

347
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,960
expect you.

348
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,200
Now every gossip news

349
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,120
tells about your love history.

350
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,960
Parents forced you into a marriage some time ago.

351
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,320
Do you think they will give up so easily?

352
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,840
This is my business.

353
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,360
Your top priority

354
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,520
is to seize time

355
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,600
to prepare for your art exhibition.

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't you want freedom?

357
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,360
If you are not capable enough,

358
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,840
you are not qualified to have freedom.

359
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,320
Leng,

360
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,360
what on earth did you do to Xiaoqi?

361
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
You don't want to know

362
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,440
what happened between me and her.

363
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,280
Leng.

364
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,000
What are you doing?

365
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,520
Do you take me as prisoner?

366
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,880
Younger master,

367
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,320
please do not make things difficult for us.

368
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,680
Mrs. Fang,

369
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,080
why did you ask me to

370
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,520
come here specially?

371
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,800
Shida is not home.

372
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
We're sister and brother.

373
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,760
Don't stand on ceremony.

374
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,240
Sit down.

375
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,760
Sister, it's not convenient for

376
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,880
me to contact with you usually,

377
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,560
because I'm afraid people in the company will gossip.

378
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,120
After all, I got the position of general manager

379
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,680
relying on you.

380
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,360
I know you are careful.

381
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,720
I have something to discuss with you.

382
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,320
What happened?

383
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
It's all because of Fang Leng.

384
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,080
Originally, I thought

385
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,000
Lie could work in the company

386
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,720
after he graduated.

387
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,960
I don't know what Fang Leng told him.

388
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,720
Now he only wants to hold an art exhibition.

389
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,560
I know what Fang Leng is up to.

390
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm afraid Lie will miss the best opportunity

391
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,480
to join the company if he still acts like this.

392
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,680
Well, the Fang family is a big family with huge property.

393
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,360
Now Fang Shida and Fang Leng

394
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
make decisions on all kinds of things.

395
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm afraid they'll think Lie and I

396
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,280
are really fools as I play the fool for long.

397
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,080
I heard that someone of the board of directors proposed

398
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,920
to let Fang Lie take over the position of chairman. Is that true?

399
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,880
Sister,

400
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,240
don't worry.

401
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
As long as I'm in the company,

402
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Fang Leng can't take that position.

403
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,640
Do you have an idea?

404
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,600
Hum.

405
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,400
Lose memory?

406
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,160
Do you have evidence?

407
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,280
Fang Leng is prone to suspicion.

408
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
He wouldn't leave any evidence

409
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,640
to let us find it.

410
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,400
But, as long as this woman appears,

411
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,520
we'll get evidence.

412
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,120
Miss Jiang.

413
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I haven't come back home for years.

414
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,920
I didn't expect it has changed so dramatically.

415
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,320
=Hey, I'm back.=

416
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,040
Xiaoqi, get up.

417
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,040
Ms. Chai.

418
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,320
You're quite fast.

419
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,920
I must come as fast as possible

420
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,720
as you called me.

421
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
How's it?

422
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,680
Is this room perfect?

423
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,320
Yes.

424
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,920
I'm telling you.

425
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,440
Do not break anything,

426
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,560
otherwise you'll have to pay more.

427
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,760
I got it.

428
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,600
Do I have to deliver takes-out today?

429
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,560
No hurry.

430
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
Xiaoqi,

431
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,080
you really have special skills to profit.

432
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
What do you mean?

433
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Do you know?

434
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,880
We earned much as a man booked the whole restaurant yesterday.

435
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,840
I've realized a truth.

436
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,200
To get rich,

437
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,520
the most important thing is to seize the big customers.

438
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,480
I've looked into

439
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,800
that handsome guy yesterday.

440
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,440
He seems to be the president of F Group.

441
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,680
His name is Fang Leng.

442
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,120
If you

443
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
hold this thigh tightly,

444
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
you'll be able to pay off

445
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,160
the money you owe me soon.

446
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,160
I already held his thigh yesterday.

447
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,640
You did?

448
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,160
Yes.

449
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh, my God.

450
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,720
You're great.

451
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,920
Come on. Sit down.

452
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
This is

453
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,080
a lunch agreement of our restaurant.

454
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,400
As long as Mr. Fang is willing to let his employees

455
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,960
dine in our restaurant,

456
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
I will give him a 30% discount.

457
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,600
It's very easy.

458
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
You just need to let Mr. Fang

459
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,240
sign on it.

460
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
But Ms. Chai,

461
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,560
I have so many things to do today.

462
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm going to deliver the takeaways.

463
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,240
I have to find my annunciator.

464
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
What annunciator?

465
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,120
Is my wireless network signal bad?

466
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,040
The annunciator is my key to home.

467
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,080
It is very likely to be in Fang Leng's hands.

468
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
I went to his house yesterday.

469
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
But I didn't find it.

470
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,440
You've been to his house?

471
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,360
But I was kicked out soon.

472
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,360
I think I should go again.

473
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,240
Go! Go! Go!

474
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,120
You must go.

475
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,880
Where is it exactly?

476
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,080
You can ask me.

477
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,280
I'm good at

478
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,800
looking for things in men.

479
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,120
Have you touched

480
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,440
his jacket pocket,

481
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
pant pockets,

482
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,000
shoes and socks

483
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
at the time?

484
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,800
No.

485
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Yes.

486
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,280
Ms. Chai, you are so good.

487
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I will go to touch them.

488
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,240
Come back.

489
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,160
Haven't you forgotten anything?

490
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes, yes.

491
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,160
Yes, yes.

492
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,040
You know what?

493
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,200
Whatever you are going to do,

494
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,120
remember that business is more important than private affairs.

495
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,200
Got it?

496
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,320
Yes.

497
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,440
Okay.

498
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,240
Bye.

499
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm going to make a million.

500
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,720
Morning, Mr. Fang.

501
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
Morning, Mr. Fang.

502
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,240
Mr. Fang, please.

503
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,360
You go first.

504
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,240
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

505
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
Add one more item on the agenda this morning.

506
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,040
Chairman introduced a girl who will come

507
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,160
to meet you in the company later.

508
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,320
Did you see

509
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,440
a takeaway deliver walking inside?

510
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,120
No.

511
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,800
No. Only we are here.

512
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,480
Everybody.

513
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,040
Gather in the meeting room on the ninth floor.

514
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,560
Go.

515
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
Annunciator.

516
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm coming.

517
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,720
Annunciator.

518
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,240
Where are you?

519
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,280
It's here.

520
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,960
Is there anything else?

521
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,680
No.

522
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,640
Mind your business.

523
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,680
Okay.

524
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,120
You want to come out by yourself,

525
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,600
or to be dragged out by me?

526
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,280
These two are different in nature.

527
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,320
You have three seconds.

528
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,240
One.

529
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,040
It's you.

530
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,600
Tell me.

531
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,560
What exactly do you want?

532
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,360
I come

533
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,760
mainly for three things.

534
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,840
First,

535
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,080
give me back my annunciator.

536
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,920
Annunciator again.

537
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,920
What the hell is that?

538
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,760
In your earth words,

539
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
it should be a

540
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,720
a flashy chip.

541
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,600
I have never seen it.

542
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,960
How can that be possible?

543
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,360
Think again.

544
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,120
I think

545
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,160
you can upgrade your approach

546
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,600
to get close to me.

547
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,320
What I said is real.

548
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,360
I shouldn't have saved you in the car accident that day.

549
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,400
I can't go home now.

550
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,880
And I actually saved an ungrateful man.

551
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,000
Ungrateful man.

552
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,720
You said

553
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,000
you saved me in the car accident that day?

554
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,880
Welcome.

555
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,080
Uncle Kang.

556
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
Sorry for having kept you waiting long.

557
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Miss Jiang.

558
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,240
Did your family clearly tell you

559
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
this blind date with Mr. Fang?

560
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
I surely can't decline

561
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,960
the kindness of the senior.

562
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,400
It is said that

563
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,520
you and Mrs. Fang promoted this.

564
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,280
Thank you, Uncle Kang.

565
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,040
You are welcome.

566
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,880
Of course I saved you.

567
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,440
Otherwise you would die in that car accident.

568
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,880
But,

569
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
don't pledge to marry me due to gratitude.

570
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,880
I already have someone I like in my heart.

571
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,680
Can you tell the truth?

572
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,600
No one was nearby on the accident site.

573
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
In that case,

574
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,720
if you could save me,

575
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,880
you would be a superwoman.

576
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,200
Coincidentally,

577
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,240
I'm really a superwoman.

578
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Good.

579
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,040
I can immediately notify my company's
scientific research department

580
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,080
to catch you

581
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,360
and do experiment with your genes.

582
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,400
Maybe I can win the Nobel Prize in biology.

583
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
I, I was joking.

584
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
How is it possible?

585
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,880
I am an earthling.

586
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,520
An earthling growing up eating rice.

587
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,920
The earth is terrible.

588
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,000
It seems I have to hide my identity.

589
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,320
Let go of me.

590
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
I just think your brain is bad.

591
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
I won't look into it today.

592
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,560
Go back and deliver your takeaway.

593
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,480
No.

594
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
I haven't finished it yet.

595
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,600
What did I say before?

596
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,040
Can you stop it?

597
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,720
Mr. Fang.

598
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,840
Don't move, or I will kill you.

599
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,720
Mr. Fang.

600
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
What to do?

601
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,400
I can't teleport myself now.

602
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,040
Here is the thing.

603
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,760
I can only be teased by this hooligan.

604
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,560
Chairman Jiang's daughter Jiang Xue

605
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,600
comes to meet you.

606
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,840
She's in the reception room now.

607
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,920
Tell her

608
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,840
I'm not feeling well today.

609
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,920
I'll meet her again someday.

610
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,440
Mr. Fang.

611
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,960
It's not just the chairman's intention.

612
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,280
It was also arranged by your Ms. Zhou.

613
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,960
So...

614
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640
I know

615
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,320
what I should do.

616
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,320
You don't have to think Ms. Zhou is wronged.

617
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
I will personally

618
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,680
visit the Jiang family.

619
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,280
Yes.

620
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,640
Since you said so,

621
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,000
I will go

622
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,360
to tell Miss Jiang Xue.

623
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,680
Why are you blushing?

624
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,400
Leave me alone.

625
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,200
Wait.

626
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,680
Although I don't know

627
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,720
what little chip you are talking about,

628
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,760
if you really lost something,

629
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,760
such as gems...

630
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,600
Enough.

631
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,400
I will find it in my own way.

632
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,080
Anyway, I don't want to see you anymore.

633
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Earth hooligan.

634
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
Who is the hooligan exactly?

635
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,360
Miss Jiang.

636
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,280
I'm so sorry.

637
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,320
Mr. Fang is not well today.

638
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,520
He will definitely

639
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,520
visit your house and apologize to you.

640
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,040
It's okay, Uncle Kang.

641
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
He doesn't come to meet me.

642
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,840
But I naturally have a way to meet him.

643
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Has the sapphire

644
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,560
been detected?

645
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,520
No conclusion.

646
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,440
Do you think

647
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
there may be any chip inside?

648
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,960
Chip?

649
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,400
Mr. Fang.

650
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,760
How did you say that?

651
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,040
I just heard others talking nonsense.

652
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,960
Based on the data detected now,

653
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,600
this is just a pure ore

654
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,840
without other substance.

655
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,840
How about the place of origin?

656
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,160
Can you find it out?

657
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,000
Mr. Fang.

658
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,880
Look.

659
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,560
This is the sapphire auctioned in South Africa last year.

660
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
And this.

661
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,920
This was...

662
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,880
Mr. Fang. Bad news.

663
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Would you please come to the garage?

664
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,520
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

665
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,000
I think you are too busy.

666
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,280
To meet you,

667
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,840
I just smashed your car.

668
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,600
By the way,

669
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,600
here is the repair fee.

670
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Did we

671
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
meet before?

672
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,840
No.

673
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,520
But now we meet.

674
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,440
Let me introduce myself.

675
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,280
My name is Jiang Xue.

676
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,800
Today,

677
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,840
my father and your parents

678
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,880
arranged a blind date.

679
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,080
Sorry.

680
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,760
I am not very convenient today.

681
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,240
It's okay.

682
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
I just come to complete the task.

683
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,040
All right.

684
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,840
Task completed.

685
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,920
You are straight.

686
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,920
It's the first time for me

687
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,040
to experience such a blind date.

688
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,880
Ways don't matter.

689
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
The most important is that

690
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,520
whether we can impress each other.

691
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,320
Even if it's bad.

692
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,560
Find out her information.

693
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,080
Yes.

694
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,960
One step closer to freedom.

695
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,400
I finish painting today.

696
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Give me the phone.

697
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,480
I can finally play my game.

698
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,620
=Hi, I'm back.=

699
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,580
=Hi, I'm back.=

700
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,880
You didn't even say hello when coming back.

701
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,880
Do you still respect me as your dad?

702
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,560
Enough, Shida.

703
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,680
Don't be angry.

704
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,280
Maybe Mr. Fang never saw you.

705
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
Dad, Ms. Zhou.

706
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,200
Hum.

707
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,320
Is Fang Lie back?

708
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,280
Hey, you come and ask us for him?

709
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,000
You brothers are busy with the art exhibition.

710
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,520
Who ever remembered this home?

711
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,800
The art exhibition is almost ready.

712
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,240
It can be held soon.

713
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,320
It'd better be like this.

714
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,760
You have to remember.

715
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,880
This art exhibition

716
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,160
is the last chance I gave you two brothers

717
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,560
to act at will.

718
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,200
If it fails,

719
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,360
from now on, you two brothers

720
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,320
have to manage the company down to earth.

721
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,080
You help Fang Lie prepare the art exhibition?

722
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,840
What a great brother!

723
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,120
I have seen through

724
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,560
your intention.

725
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,680
You just stop him working in the company

726
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,280
to fight for power with you.

727
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,800
I might as well tell you a little secret.

728
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,600
For so many years,

729
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
your dad has never forgiven

730
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,680
that you killed your mother.

731
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,720
Compared to you, a jinx,

732
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,320
he would prefer to hand over the position of company president

733
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,880
to Lie.

734
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,480
Since you are so frank,

735
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,720
I might as well tell you straight.

736
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,960
Whether Fang Lie works in the company

737
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,000
can't threaten me.

738
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
It's impossible now.

739
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,440
It will be even more impossible later.

740
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,960
Just like you.

741
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,920
You can never replace

742
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,080
my mother's place in my father's heart.

743
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,320
It's impossible now.

744
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,520
It will be even more impossible later.

745
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,440
Okay.

746
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,240
Let's wait and see.

747
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
Please enjoy it.

748
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Call me if needed.

749
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,940
=An Lian=

750
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,600
Chai Xiaoqi.

751
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,520
Hurry up and help me entertain guests.

752
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,040
Ms. Chai.

753
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,640
I'm in a bad mood right now.

754
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,680
Can I lie in bed?

755
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,440
No way.

756
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,160
What did you promise me today?

757
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,480
Go to get my big client Mr. Fang.

758
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,160
But until now,

759
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,440
you achieved nothing.

760
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,640
I can't find the annunciator either.

761
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,040
My only friend has dead halt.

762
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,160
I feel like I have nothing to love now.

763
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,440
Young girl,

764
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
don't always talk about this.

765
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,760
How unlucky!

766
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
Isn't that the key to home lost?

767
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,600
Find an unlocking man to help you.

768
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,080
Otherwise,

769
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,000
just wait for your family to come to you.

770
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,640
The most important thing

771
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,600
is to be happy.

772
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Think about happy things.

773
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,120
Happy things?

774
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,280
♪I still remember that year.♪

775
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,920
♪I watched you holding his hands quietly.♪

776
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,600
♪But I forgot to empathize with you.♪

777
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,200
Yeah.

778
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,720
Look how happy your laughter is.

779
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,400
Ms. Chai.

780
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,600
How come what I like

781
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,800
is always like a phantom.

782
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,280
I can see him every time.

783
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,120
But I can't touch him.

784
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,520
I have no way to own him.

785
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,560
We are not in the same world at all.

786
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,040
Xiaoqi.

787
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,880
You don't like ghosts, do you?

788
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,320
Welcome.

789
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,000
Xiaoqi.

790
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,160
I finally found you.

791
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,960
I'm not dreaming, right?

792
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,600
Come on, cheers.

793
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,160
Celebrate our reunion.

794
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,240
Sorry. I can't drink.

795
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,920
I'll take this.

796
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,240
It's okay.

797
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,520
Drinking is not good for girls.

798
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,800
I help you drink.

799
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,080
Won't beer

800
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,240
harm your health?

801
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,840
Beer harms health

802
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,000
but won't harm heart.

803
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,880
Information said

804
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,560
people on earth laugh

805
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
because of happiness

806
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,760
and shed tears because of sadness.

807
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
But why do I feel sad

808
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,280
seeing you laughing?

809
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,240
Don't think about

810
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,080
such a complicated question.

811
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,400
Come on. Eat.

812
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,840
I'm so happy to watch you eating food.

813
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,680
Then I will show you every day.

814
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,720
But

815
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,480
not everything is delicious.

816
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,960
Something that is not yours

817
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
tastes bitter.

818
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,120
Fang Lie.

819
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,800
Fang Lie.

820
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,800
Wake up.

821
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,960
Fang Lie. Wake up.

822
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,640
Fang Lie.

823
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,720
Fang Lie.

824
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,120
You come.

825
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
We should go back.

826
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,520
I don't want to go.

827
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,280
I want to stay with you.

828
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,640
If you want,

829
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,560
I don't mind.

830
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,000
Anyway, I can't find the annunciator anymore.

831
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
I can't go back home.

832
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,080
Let me fetch you a glass of water first.

833
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,360
Don't go.

834
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,080
Fang Lie.

835
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:14,920
I.

836
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,400
No.

837
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,440
Fang Lie.

838
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,360
Why are you leaving?

839
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,000
Fang Lie.

840
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,600
No.

841
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,560
Finished.

842
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,560
Frozen defense system is on.

843
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,520
What is this?

844
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,220
=King of Hell=

845
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,680
Did you locate him?

846
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,720
Yes.

847
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,040
I've already sent it to you.

848
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,900
An Lian Restaurant.

849
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,080
Hello?

850
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,600
Hello?

851
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,480
Mr. Fang, you are here.

852
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,280
Where is the guest?

853
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,840
Here is the thing.

854
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,600
Today,

855
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,320
a young and rich handsome man

856
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,560
books the entire restaurant.

857
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,200
So there are no other guests.

858
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,400
Mr. Fang, sorry.

859
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,920
The entire restaurant has been booked here,

860
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,840
so

861
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,520
it may not be convenient for you to get in.

862
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,560
My brother is inside.

863
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,880
I'm sorry.

864
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,360
Fang Lie.

865
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,720
Fang Lie.

866
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,280
Hush.

867
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,440
Is anyone else coming in?

868
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,360
Please avoid it first.

869
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,640
We have personal matters to deal with.

870
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,280
I'll let my assistant pick him up later.

871
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,320
In addition,

872
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,720
don't spread what happened today.

873
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,320
OK. OK.

874
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,240
Assistant Han.

875
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,680
Fang Lie is drunk.

876
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,480
Come over and handle it.

877
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,160
Are you OK?

878
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,760
What to do?

879
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,720
Why are you so cold?

880
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,640
Am I discovered by an earthling?

881
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,320
You have abnormal temperature now. Bear it more.

882
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,760
Don't call.

883
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,400
I make a call.

884
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,080
Don't call.

885
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,680
Call for the ambulance.

886
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,600
No, no.

887
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,720
I will take you to the hospital.

888
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,440
Stand up.

889
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,600
Why is he so warm

890
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,720
and different from other earthlings?

891
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,240
Why do I feel hot suddenly?

892
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:31,840
No.

893
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Don't go to the hospital, okay?

894
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,720
You are so warm.

895
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,880
Just hold me like this.

896
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,720
Okay?

Ever since I met you,

00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

906
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,740
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

only you.

908
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,820
We're out of reach

909
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,140
but appreciate each other.

910
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:40,940
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

911
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,980
The yearning invades

912
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,540
and lurks in my mind.

913
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:55,100
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

914
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,180
I'm getting addicted to it

915
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,500
and my sense is shielded.

916
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:09,300
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

917
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,460
Put the hottest heart

918
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,780
in this cold body.

919
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,140
I'm looking at you,

920
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,300
and my love has nowhere to go.

921
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,540
Ever since I met you,

922
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,460
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

923
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,740
Every day is a new memory

924
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,780
which is only be about you and me.

925
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,020
I can't lie to myself anymore.

926
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,860
Please give me the courage to believe.

927
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,780
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

928
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,700
only you.

929
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,820
Even everything becomes silent,

930
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,940
I still have you.
