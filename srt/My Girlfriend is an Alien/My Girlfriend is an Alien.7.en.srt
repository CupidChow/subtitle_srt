1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 7

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,480
What's this?

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,840
This is for you.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
What?

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Are you free today?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
No, I'm not free.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
What's up?

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,480
Nothing.

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,960
Wait...

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
How come he left?

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,120
Xiaoqi,

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,520
what did he tell you just now?

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,520
He just said "nothing" and left.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,680
Is there something wrong with him?

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Why are you back so soon?

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Cancel all of

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
tomorrow's appointments.

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,080
Well,

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
didn't you schedule another day with her?

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
Or just chatted with her

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
to show your concern?

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,800
Chatting with her?

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,080
Yes.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,560
Otherwise, why do we call it romantic relationship?

42
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't go back now.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,640
What's wrong again?

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,040
I mean later.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,880
Mr. Fang,

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
last night you thought about it until midnight.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,320
You only came up with this idea?

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
I will definitely let her come to me.

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,720
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,920
Mr. Fang isn't here now.

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,200
It's okay.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,160
I will just wait for him inside.

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,360
Miss Jiang.

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,440
Miss Jiang.

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,280
Why are you here?

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,120
I happened to pass by here,

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,200
and just come and visit.

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,240
By the way,

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,480
this is the arrangement of Fang Lie's art exhibition.

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,960
Everything is settled.

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,360
Have a seat.

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,360
Thank you for your hard work.

63
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,520
I didn't expect

64
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
it goes so fast.

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,200
Mr. Fang's gratitude comes fast, too.

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,480
The secretary said

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,320
you paid all the bill of the project yesterday.

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,480
Aren't you

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
afraid I will make off with money?

70
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Miss Jiang, you must be kidding.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,480
Compared with your asset,

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,760
such money is nothing.

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,520
And I

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,440
may often need to rely on you in the future.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,840
Let's leave the future things to the future.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Maybe in the future,

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
you don't bother to ask,

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,840
and I already volunteer to run errands for you.

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Oh, right,

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,280
I am free tomorrow.

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,440
You...

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Sorry, I have an appointment tomorrow.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
An appointment?

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Miss Jiang, is there anything else?

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,640
How about we make it another day?

86
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,480
No need.

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm leaving.

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,880
No, I can't be softhearted with him.

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,280
No, no.

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
What's wrong with the flowers?

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,680
Excuse me.

92
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,960
Fang Lie,

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
why do you come here?

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
Your anthomaniac boss isn't here, right?

95
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,440
She, she went out to purchase things.

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Why do you come here?

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,120
Didn't we go to the company several days ago to steal...

98
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,840
no,

99
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,040
to look for a thing.

100
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,080
But we didn't find it, right?

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,520
I come up with a good idea today.

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,720
Never mind.

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Maybe I had hallucinations last time.

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,760
That thing is gone.

105
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,120
How do you know?

106
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,400
I just feel it.

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,320
Its energy is gone.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,680
I just can't find it.

109
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,160
Don't get upset so soon.

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,400
I plan to create

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,920
a work named Lost.

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm gonna draw the thing you are looking for

113
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
and hang it out at the art exhibition.

114
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
Then the whole world will know what we are looking for.

115
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,520
We're bound to find it by this way.

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
You seem to make good sense.

117
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600
How do we do that?

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
First you need to tell me

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
what it looks like.

120
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,120
It looks like...

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,160
Assistant Han,

122
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,080
help me make an order at the restaurant where Xiaoqi works.

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,920
Okay.

124
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,800
That's

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,080
what you said,

126
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
letting her come to you?

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,600
You don't get it.

128
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,920
To get a woman,

129
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,440
first,

130
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,400
you should help her when she is in need.

131
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,640
The restaurant Xiaoqi works for is off-season now.

132
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,520
I want to help her increase sales.

133
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,320
She will definitely come to thank me.

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Do it quickly!

135
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,080
Entrepreneurs do think differently.

136
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,240
Finished!

137
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,960
Finished?

138
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Have a look!

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,440
Okay.

140
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,800
This...

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
looks quite like my annunciator.

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,280
This...

143
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,960
Is it okay?

144
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,040
But,

145
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,280
what are you doing

146
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,000
with this annunciator?

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,200
My...

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,880
Wait a moment.

149
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,000
What's the matter?

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,960
1,000 cups.

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,720
Hi, Ms. Chai.

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
Just now

153
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,160
a customer ordered 1,000 cups of coffee in our restaurant.

154
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
What should I do?

155
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,920
Hello?

156
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,720
Hello? Ms. Chai? Boss? Bo...

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,160
What did she say?

158
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,160
She said she won't be back until afternoon.

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,560
Oh my god. 1,000 cups.

160
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,760
How could I do this?

161
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
Are you free this afternoon?

162
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,080
Why do I come here today?

163
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,600
I haven't seen so much coffee in my whole life.

164
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,040
Me, either.

165
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,560
Why don't I have the super power

166
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,920
to make coffee?

167
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,600
I couldn't feel my hands.

168
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
How many cups do we still need to make?

169
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
About a half.

170
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,320
But we have run out of coffee bean, what should we do?

171
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,880
How come we still have so many left?

172
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,960
I need to inform the customer first.

173
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
F Groups?

174
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,840
Which employee is so abnormal?

175
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
I have to fire him!

176
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,340
=Ordered by Mr. Fang Leng in F Groups=

177
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,080
My, my brother.

178
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
Screwed!

179
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,360
I can't let him know I'm making coffee here.

180
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,920
He will definitely criticize me again
for not attending to my own work.

181
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm leaving now.

182
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
Help me keep my drawing board.

183
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,080
Fang Lie.

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,000
Coffee is here.

185
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,080
-Thank you. -Thank you.

186
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Assistant Han.

187
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,720
Thanks. Thanks.

188
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,360
Could you help me bring this cup of coffee to Fang Leng?

189
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,800
I still have a lot to go.

190
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm going downstairs.

191
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Wait. Wait.

192
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,200
Well,

193
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,960
my feet have been killing me these days.

194
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,480
You'd better bring this to him by yourself.

195
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,680
Why are you still standing here?

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,600
Hurry up.

197
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,840
Come in.

198
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,400
Sorry,

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,920
Mr. Fang.

200
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,640
The coffee in our restaurant is out of stock.

201
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,760
I will refund you

202
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
the money for the rest of 500 cups of coffee.

203
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,000
No need.

204
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,160
Just take it as a tip.

205
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,480
I'll just order the rest in another shop.

206
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,680
Why should I take your money?

207
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,280
Furthermore,

208
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,920
this is my work.

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,240
We'd better to make it clear.

210
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
Do you really think

211
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,960
I ordered coffee in your restaurant

212
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
just for work?

213
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,000
Then what?

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,880
I said

215
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,800
I hope you can feel my sincerity.

216
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,480
You mean

217
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,840
you ordered a thousand cups of coffee in our restaurant

218
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,320
just to make me your girlfriend?

219
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
I don't mean that

220
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
but...

221
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Never mind.

222
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,920
I just thought you would be happy.

223
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,800
I won't fall in love with you.

224
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Actually,

225
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,440
I have long wanted to tell you this.

226
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,800
I don't have human feelings.

227
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,960
I won't fall in love with anyone.

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,200
You'd better not waste time.

229
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,120
You mean

230
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,280
you don't...

231
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,080
What about you?

232
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
You ask me to be your girlfriend.

233
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
But actually you don't like me at all, right?

234
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,800
In your eyes,

235
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,160
relationship is just a kind of game for pastime.

236
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,680
Am I right?

237
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,880
But for me,

238
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
I cherish every day here.

239
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
Every day here

240
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,040
is precious to me.

241
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,000
I love the food,

242
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,320
the people around me,

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,000
and everything I see and experience.

244
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Maybe one day,

245
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,080
I might leave here.

246
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,560
But before that,

247
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,560
I don't want to waste time

248
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
playing games with you.

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
You

250
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,160
have always hated me,

251
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,280
right?

252
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,400
I get it.

253
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,360
I will not badger you anymore.

254
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
Sorry.

255
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,000
Bye.

256
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,440
I am sorry.

257
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,560
Actually I don't hate you.

258
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,360
But,

259
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,280
but I don't want you to do things for me anymore.

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,640
Goodbye, Fang Leng.

261
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,360
How is it going?

262
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
Are you feeling better after a good sleep?

263
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,920
How long did I sleep?

264
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,200
About

265
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
the whole afternoon.

266
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,560
How do you feel?

267
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,520
What happened?

268
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,480
Regarding the treatment plan you mentioned to me before,

269
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,320
I want to cancel it.

270
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
Xiaoqi

271
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
rejected you?

272
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,640
Do you still remember that

273
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,240
you told me

274
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,360
there is another plan that needs medication?

275
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,160
That's just an alternative plan.

276
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,960
The medicine has strong side effects on human body.

277
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,280
You want to switch to medication?

278
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,320
Yes.

279
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,920
From today.

280
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,400
You have to

281
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,480
think carefully about medication.

282
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,680
It really has great side effects on your body.

283
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,600
You should take care of yourself.

284
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,920
Got it.

285
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,320
Go.

286
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,520
As you expect,

287
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,960
I finally have something on Fang Leng.

288
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,160
Okay.

289
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
What?

290
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,440
This should have been a gift that Mr. Fang prepares for you.

291
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
However,

292
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,640
he said you didn't want to see him.

293
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
So he asks me to give this ticket

294
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
to you.

295
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,560
Wait.

296
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,960
Take it back.

297
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,160
I won't go there.

298
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,560
Miss Xiaoqi,

299
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,480
do you know

300
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,040
why Mr. Fang asks you to be his girlfriend?

301
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,160
He is a playboy.

302
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Then what else?

303
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,360
Mr. Fang can not fall in love with others.

304
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
And only you can

305
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,040
help him.

306
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,320
What do you mean?

307
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,040
He...

308
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,800
He is sick.

309
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,800
It's not what you think.

310
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,320
Mr. Fang is very healthy.

311
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,880
He just,

312
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,680
just,

313
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,080
has a little mental problem.

314
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,240
Anyway, only you can help him.

315
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,200
If you still want to help him,

316
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
you can come to me at any time.

317
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,880
Chairman.

318
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,360
There are no outsiders.

319
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Get it straight.

320
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,240
What's going on?

321
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,840
Someone sent me these things

322
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,520
and said he saw you entering the psychological clinic.

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,120
How long do you want to hide from us?

324
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,360
Dad,

325
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,320
I...

326
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,920
I really don't know why I am here.

327
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,240
No,

328
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,600
I can't have any feelings.

329
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,040
I can't help him.

330
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,800
I...

331
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,680
Just make it like this.

332
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,440
Why are you here?

333
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,840
Don't you say

334
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,840
only I can help him?

335
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm going.

336
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Say something.

337
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,520
What's wrong with you?

338
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,280
I...

339
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,360
It's me!

340
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,960
The medicine is prescribed for me.

341
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
He went to the clinic for me.

342
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,400
Nonsense.

343
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,520
Who are you?

344
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,640
How dare you come here to be a scapegoat for Fang Leng?

345
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,600
I...

346
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
I am his girlfriend.

347
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,640
I am sick.

348
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,480
He did everything for me.

349
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:55,880
Dad,

350
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,600
I don't want to always hide this from you.

351
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,840
I've been with Xiaoqi for some time.

352
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,040
I hope you can approve our relationship.

353
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,000
Do you want to piss me off?

354
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,680
Fang Leng, this is your fault.

355
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Didn't you visit us with Jiang Xue

356
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
several days ago?

357
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,280
You have a new girlfriend

358
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
just a few days later.

359
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,800
And even...

360
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,640
Mom,

361
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,240
stop it.

362
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,960
Don't pour oil on the flames.

363
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,120
Right. Right.

364
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,560
Sister,

365
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,960
love and marriage should be decided by young people themselves.

366
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Let's leave them

367
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
to the kids.

368
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Brother-in-law,

369
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,400
don't be angry.

370
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,400
It isn't appropriate to talk about these things

371
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
in front of all the kids.

372
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,440
How about you

373
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,160
talk to Fang Leng in private?

374
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
What do you think?

375
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
You know

376
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
what to do!

377
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,080
Leng,

378
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
I don't expect you are more rebellious than me.

379
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,120
Brilliant!

380
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,440
Well, Xiaoqi,

381
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,560
my mother just talks like that.

382
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Don't take it to heart.

383
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,480
It's okay.

384
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,280
I'm leaving.

385
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Shida.

386
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,280
Shida.

387
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,400
Sister,

388
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,440
don't object to

389
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
what Fang Leng

390
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,280
wants to do.

391
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,640
I'm going to criticize you.

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,560
Why did you speak for Fang Leng just now?

393
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm not helping him.

394
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm helping you.

395
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,400
Think about it.

396
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,320
We just lost our chance.

397
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,600
Will Fang Leng

398
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,960
give us another chance?

399
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
Such being the case,

400
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,040
we might focus our attention on that woman.

401
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,040
You mean?

402
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,480
Obviously, Chai Xiaoqi

403
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
can be used by us.

404
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
As long as they are together,

405
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,160
we don't need to worry

406
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,240
we can't find their soft spot.

407
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,760
Moreover,

408
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,240
there's Jiang Xue, a ruthless character, involved.

409
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,840
Do you think

410
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,800
Fang Leng can handle these two women at the same time?

411
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,080
You mean

412
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,920
I should put a spoke in their wheel

413
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,320
and then I can fish in troubled waters.

414
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,680
Okay.

415
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,600
I get it.

416
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm taking off.

417
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,480
Okay.

418
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,040
Why do you help me?

419
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,080
Don't you say you don't like me anymore?

420
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,560
Having said that,

421
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,720
Assistant Han said...

422
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
What did he tell you?

423
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
He said you are sick

424
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
and only I can help you.

425
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,600
You know everything?

426
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,920
Although I don't know what disease you have,

427
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,400
you helped me and

428
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I can't stand by.

429
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,400
But I'm telling you now,

430
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,880
you,

431
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,480
I just pretend to be your girlfriend.

432
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,360
Except helping you treat the disease,

433
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,640
you must never have an improper thought.

434
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,840
Okay.

435
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,520
I promise you.

436
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,040
Anything else?

437
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,720
What?

438
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
You give me such a big favor.

439
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,720
There's gotta be something you want.

440
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,360
Money?

441
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,240
Job?

442
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,120
Status?

443
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,880
As long as I can do,

444
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,360
I will promise you.

445
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,880
No need.

446
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,080
I won't stay here for too long anyway.

447
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,160
What did you say?

448
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,920
Nothing.

449
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,720
You haven't told me what to do.

450
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,480
What have you got?

451
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,760
I'll tell you later.

452
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,360
Now the most important thing is

453
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,560
you have to deal with my dad first.

454
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,160
Welcome!

455
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,320
I take these two.

456
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,760
Yes.

457
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,080
These four.

458
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,680
Okay.

459
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,240
I take them all.

460
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,200
Yes.

461
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,640
These two.

462
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,800
And these four.

463
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,760
Okay.

464
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,200
And this row, I take them all.

465
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:12,920
Okay.

466
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,840
And this one.

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,640
Suit her.

468
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,960
Okay.

469
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,920
Welcome!

470
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,280
Get her a decent hairstyle.

471
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,240
Yes, Mr. Fang.

472
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Put them on later.

473
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,160
Nice.

474
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,480
Let's go.

475
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,320
Wait.

476
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,080
Relieved!

477
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
You haven't told me what we are going to do.

478
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
Do you still remember what my dad told you just now?

479
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,280
He said you knew what to do.

480
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,440
Does he ask you to

481
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,160
dress me up like this?

482
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,680
Of course not.

483
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,600
In my father's opinion,

484
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,880
you are just a person who doesn't have any status

485
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,800
or career

486
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,760
but mental illness.

487
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,520
He means I should break up with you.

488
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,080
But before he issues an ultimatum,

489
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
we still have a chance to fix it up.

490
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,680
How?

491
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,560
Today's meeting is too hasty.

492
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,520
I have to take you to see him again

493
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,720
these days

494
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,760
and find ways to get him to accept you.

495
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,200
But

496
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,520
you need to make some proper changes.

497
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,880
Got it!

498
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,080
Change to the way they like.

499
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,160
Right?

500
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,960
You need to make your time available these days.

501
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,160
I will teach you the do's and don'ts.

502
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,120
If you don't make any mistakes,

503
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,440
I don't think my dad would embarrass you.

504
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,720
We aren't in a real relationship.

505
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,160
Why do we have to get their approval?

506
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,760
Can't we meet each other in private?

507
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,440
Then you look down on my family extremely.

508
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Even if my dad doesn't check,

509
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,760
there are many people trying to catch your soft spots.

510
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,200
Whether our relationship is real or fake,

511
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,080
we will have to go through this.

512
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
All right.

513
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,920
Thank you for your hard work today.

514
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,480
I'll ask someone to pick you up tomorrow

515
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,920
and bring you the stuff.

516
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
See you.

517
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,000
Wait.

518
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,080
Being my girlfriend will bring you a lot of trouble.

519
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,800
It's still okay if you go back on it now.

520
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,520
Don't worry.

521
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,560
I never regret

522
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,520
what I did.

523
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,400
I'm going inside.

524
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,760
See you.

525
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,520
Why?

526
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,040
I actually became a human's girlfriend.

527
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,520
How shameful it would be

528
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,720
if the people in my mother land know this!

529
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,920
All right.

530
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,000
What is done cannot be undone.

531
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
Does regret work?

532
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,800
I have no regrets.

533
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm just wondering

534
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,880
we cannot stay on earth forever.

535
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,560
What if I have concern for humans?

536
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
Then I will...

537
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
You will what?

538
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,600
You will be reluctant to leave.

539
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,120
Right?

540
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,520
No.

541
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
I won't.

542
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,280
I just

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
have to stay here

544
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,200
because I haven't found the annunciator.

545
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,080
I've been thinking of ways to go back.

546
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,160
Right.

547
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,760
The annunciator is still in Fang Leng's company.

548
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,600
You are his girlfriend now.

549
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,840
Can you find a way to retrieve the annunciator?

550
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,680
You mean

551
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,040
I enter their company

552
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,000
and watch for my chance to steal the annunciator?

553
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Kubri,

554
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
brilliant!

555
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,320
This is a good idea!

556
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Mr. Fang,

557
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,120
Xiaoqi is here.

558
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,640
Come.

559
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,120
What is this?

560
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,040
This is your task today.

561
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,920
Now what I'm telling you

562
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,360
is what you have to remember.

563
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,000
Understand?

564
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,520
Understand.

565
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
The first is my dad.

566
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,800
He is an intractable and stubborn person.

567
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,800
He is also a very utilitarian businessman.

568
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,160
It's impossible for you

569
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,800
to get his recognition now.

570
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,640
But if he doesn't oppose,

571
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,520
we are successful.

572
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
Is there any difference between them?

573
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,400
As long as I don't tell my dad I want to marry you

574
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,000
and your conditions are barely qualified,

575
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,240
he will think that I am not serious about our relationship

576
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
and won't intentionally break us up.

577
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,800
How can I be qualified?

578
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll tell you later.

579
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,880
The second is Ms. Zhou.

580
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
She is my dad's second wife,

581
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Fang Lie's mother.

582
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,080
She is the one you should guard against most.

583
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,960
Why?

584
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,040
Isn't she your family?

585
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,960
Do you think there is a real family in my family?

586
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,200
She always wants Fang Lie to take over me

587
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,600
and tries to have something on me.

588
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,480
You mustn't reveal anything between us

589
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,040
in front of her.

590
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,960
If

591
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,720
you think she's sounding you out,

592
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,320
you just play dumb.

593
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Got it?

594
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,480
Got it.

595
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,440
Fang Lie.

596
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,760
As for Fang Lie,

597
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,400
it will be fine as long as you don't be infatuated with him.

598
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,000
How about this one?

599
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
He kept helping you last time.

600
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,280
Is he on your side?

601
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,360
In this family, except myself,

602
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,720
no one is on my side.

603
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,320
Uncle Kang is my opponent in the company.

604
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
If you meet him,

605
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
just get yourself out of there.

606
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,400
Okay.

607
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,320
It's your turn now.

608
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,680
Me?

609
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,040
Why?

610
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,880
Your family and your experience.

611
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I need to know everything

612
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,560
so that I can help you out in front of my dad.

613
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,720
I have no family.

614
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
I am hatched...

615
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,560
I, I mean

616
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,000
I am raised as an orphan.

617
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,240
I have no parents.

618
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,600
And

619
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,920
your dad can't find them.

620
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,920
Sorry,

621
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,400
I don't know you have such experience.

622
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
It doesn't matter.

623
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,680
Isn't it nice to be alone?

624
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,160
Right?

625
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,720
It's just

626
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,880
when you are alone for a long time,

627
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,400
you will feel quite homesick.

628
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,800
Right,

629
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,320
could I ask you to do me a favor?

630
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,880
Just tell me.

631
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,360
I want to work in your company.

632
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,240
What?

633
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,800
You wanna quit?

634
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,160
I am sorry, Ms. Chai.

635
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,760
I have my reason about my resignation.

636
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,320
But I can assure you

637
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,520
once I attain my goal,

638
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,040
I will come back immediately.

639
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,840
Is it alright?

640
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Xiaoqi,

641
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,080
you finally sell yourself out!

642
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,080
I am so happy.

643
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,560
Aren't you supposed to be angry

644
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,280
that I work in other place.

645
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,600
Why would I be angry?

646
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,280
You go to work at Fang Leng's company.

647
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,040
This means

648
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,040
you are one step closer to entering a wealthy family.

649
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,080
I will be able to

650
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,200
rely on you by then.

651
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,640
I didn't expect it.

652
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,640
Xiaoqi,

653
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,400
you really have the foresight.

654
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,800
I don't misjudge you.

655
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,640
But after I quit,

656
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,520
what about our restaurant?

657
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,400
Who will take delivery?

658
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,440
The recruitment advertisement is ready.

659
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,200
Ms. Chai, thank you.

660
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,040
But I still want to live here.

661
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,880
I promise

662
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,960
I will pay the rent on time.

663
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,640
And

664
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,920
as soon as I'm free, I will come back to help you, OK?

665
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Sure. Sure.

666
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
I promise you

667
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,800
whatever you want now.

668
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,720
You and your brother are really alike.

669
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,920
You guys never invite people out.

670
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,600
Why do you invite me out this time?

671
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,480
A cup of soda, thank you.

672
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,320
Okay.

673
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,560
Aren't you planning the art exhibition for me?

674
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,480
It will be open soon.

675
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,280
I want to see you.

676
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,680
I see.

677
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,160
Are you supervising and urging me?

678
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,400
Don't worry.

679
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,360
I won't let you down.

680
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
How does the thing go between

681
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,440
you and my brother?

682
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,720
I've been busy recently.

683
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,760
I don't see him.

684
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,840
But,

685
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,880
is there another woman?

686
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,960
How do you know?

687
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,240
No,

688
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,400
I mean...

689
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,560
Why do you ask so?

690
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,360
I saw that he prepared a valentine's set the other day.

691
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,720
And he told me he had a date.

692
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Didn't he go out with a woman?

693
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,560
I wasn't with him.

694
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,880
How come I know?

695
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,440
Right,

696
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,600
he knows nothing about romance.

697
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,280
It's impossible for him to do such a thing.

698
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,520
Maybe I think too much.

699
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,520
What if he does have someone?

700
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,880
Jiang Xue,

701
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,200
my brother is not the man for you.

702
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,680
What do you mean?

703
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
Did he tell you something?

704
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,600
No.

705
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,120
But my brother is in a complicated situation.

706
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,600
If you get too close with him,

707
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,080
you will be involved, too.

708
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,040
And

709
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
you have been hurt once by him.

710
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,680
Do you want him to hurt you again?

711
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,800
That is my own business.

712
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,800
Leave me alone.

713
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm begging you,

714
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,440
please.

715
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,520
I have worked hard for so long

716
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
to come back.

717
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,600
Fang Lie, you have never loved someone.

718
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,920
You won't understand.

719
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,120
Don't tell me this anymore.

720
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,000
How do you know

721
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,120
I have never loved anyone?

722
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,920
Hello?

723
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Help me make an appointment with Mr. Fang.

724
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm sorry, Miss Jiang.

725
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,680
Mr. Fang has some private matters to deal with recently.

726
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,440
He won't be in the company these days.

727
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,760
Okay, thank you.

728
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,600
Where will he go?

729
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,720
Are you ready?

730
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,920
I am ready.

731
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,240
Come.

732
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,840
Let's go.

733
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,680
Are your feet alright?

734
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,200
They are okay.

735
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Be careful.

736
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,920
You are back.

737
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:56,920
Go inside.

738
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,760
Your dad is waiting in the study.

739
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,640
Wait.

740
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,040
Your dad only wants to see you.

741
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,320
Miss Chai, right?

742
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,920
Come with me.

743
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,760
Dad.

744
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,640
You really think that

745
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,640
you take such an unknown woman home,

746
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,160
and I would like to see her?

747
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,520
Dad, you misunderstood us.

748
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,320
I bring her here today

749
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,080
just to apologize to you.

750
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,840
We took the liberty

751
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,720
of bothering you that day.

752
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,560
No matter how ridiculous you used to be,

753
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,400
you wouldn't show it to me.

754
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,480
But now

755
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,840
you're with a delivery woman.

756
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
Do you still have any sense

757
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,720
or rules?

758
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,160
She is not the person you think.

759
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,920
I don't care what kind of person she is.

760
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
I don't allow you to be with her.

761
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,960
I know

762
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,320
you and Fang Leng have just been dating,

763
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,080
but why does he bring you back home so soon?

764
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
What did Fang Leng tell me?

765
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,720
I can't tell her anything about us.

766
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,680
Right.

767
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,240
He wants to go home

768
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,360
and I come with him.

769
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
Nowadays,

770
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,960
numerous people have tried their best to

771
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,520
marry a wealthy man.

772
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
Don't you like him

773
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,320
because of his superior status?

774
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,120
Yes, Fang Leng is rich and handsome.

775
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,000
Of course I like him.

776
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Fang Leng also

777
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,040
dated a lot of unknown women before.

778
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,400
But none of them dared to come to Fang's house.

779
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,120
Do you think we will accept you

780
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,160
by doing this?

781
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,120
Then what should I do?

782
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,920
In fact,

783
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,800
no matter when,

784
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,280
we should know

785
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,840
what can be done

786
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,440
and what cannot be done.

787
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,560
On the face of it, the Fang's house is very attractive.

788
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,360
But you have no idea how many people have been tripped

789
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,960
by the threshold outside.

790
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,560
Even if you fortunately come in with one foot.

791
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
That other

792
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,360
will be always outside.

793
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,040
You will probably

794
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,160
get abandoned when you are old.

795
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,400
Actually,

796
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
marrying into the Fang's

797
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,200
will end like this.

798
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,120
Didn't you marry into the Fang's?

799
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,560
I don't think

800
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,040
you're having a hard time.

801
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,440
Why do you picture the Fang's so horribly?

802
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,200
You...

803
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,280
You are so shameless.

804
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,880
We are just talking.

805
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,000
Why are you abusing me?

806
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,280
What if I say she is the one?

807
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,080
What did you say?

808
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,840
Since mom passed away,

809
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,840
I haven't begged you ever.

810
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
I'm begging you now

811
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,280
only for this thing.

812
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
Xiaoqi is really important to me.

813
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
I have to keep her by my side.

814
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,840
I can promise you everything

815
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,880
except breaking up with her.

816
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,160
Alright.

817
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,760
My son

818
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,040
is willing to give up dignity for a woman.

819
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,680
Okay.

820
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
I promise you.

821
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,200
But as long as I'm alive,

822
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,000
she can't enter our family.

823
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,200
No one is allowed to know your relationship.

824
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
She will remain

825
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,760
a stain on you forever

826
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,720
and can't be known by anyone.

827
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,400
I promise you.

828
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,480
How is it going?

829
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,360
Is your dad still against us?

830
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,880
Everything is okay.

831
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,080
Did Ms. Zhou embarrass you?

832
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:13,960
No.

833
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,440
I just pretended to know nothing as you told me.

834
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,360
Why do you come out?

835
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,680
You don't bring me to see your dad?

836
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,120
My dad doesn't want to accept you.

837
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,040
What do you mean?

838
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,800
He doesn't want us to make public our relationship.

839
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,400
From now on,

840
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,720
you and I can only see each other secretly.

841
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,240
It doesn't matter.

842
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,080
Our relationship isn't real anyway.

843
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,720
Isn't it better we don't make it public?

844
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,840
Let's go.

845
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,920
Stupid woman who can't walk!

846
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,440
What are you doing?

847
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,560
Put me down. Put me down.

848
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,360
Don't move.

849
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,040
Listen.

850
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,440
Since you have promised to be my girlfriend,

851
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,120
from now on,

852
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,800
you just need to shut up

853
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,320
and listen to me.

854
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,160
Clear?

855
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,920

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,540
Ever since I met you,

868
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

869
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

870
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,500
only you.

871
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,700
We're out of reach

872
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,020
but appreciate each other.

873
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,820
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

874
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,860
The yearning invades

875
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,420
and lurks in my mind.

876
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:30,980
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

877
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm getting addicted to it

878
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,380
and my sense is shielded.

879
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:45,180
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

880
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,340
Put the hottest heart

881
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,660
in this cold body.

882
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,020
I'm looking at you,

883
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,180
and my love has nowhere to go.

884
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,420
Ever since I met you,

885
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

886
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,620
Every day is a new memory

887
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,660
which is only be about you and me.

888
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,900
I can't lie to myself anymore.

889
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,740
Please give me the courage to believe.

890
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,660
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

891
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,580
only you.

892
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,700
Even everything becomes silent,

893
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,820
I still have you.
