1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 17

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,800
What are you doing here?

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
Am I hallucinating again?

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,200
Enough.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
How did you get in my house?

23
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,800
How could I know?

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,320
I was in this room when I opened my eyes.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,240
Are you sure you didn't bring me here?

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,960
Me?

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,920
All right.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,800
I came by myself to see him.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
Do you mean that

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,160
you are still after Fang Leng

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
even when you have broken up?

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
What does that mean?

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,760
I came for a reason.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,760
What is it?

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,360
I...

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
My tortoise...

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
What's wrong with your tortoise?

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
Since you returned it,

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,520
it has been very sick.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,560
Look at it.

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
So I've come here.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,920
How much?

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,280
What?

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
You said it is sick.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,840
How much does the medical cost?

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,000
No, no need for that.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You broke in for a tortoise.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
And you ask for money.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
Miss Chai,

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,200
you are really good at business.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
I am not.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,880
Fang Leng is kind to you because you are pitiful.

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
But you have come to him again and again.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
Don't you think you have gone too far?

55
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,480
-You... -Miss Jiang,

56
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,760
sorry for this incident today.

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,680
I will visit you another day.

58
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
Could you leave us?

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,360
I've got to talk to her.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,520
Don't forget that

61
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,020
you have promised to work hard for me.

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,360
And

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,480
I hope you will get rid of irrelevant people.

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,960
Do something for me.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,040
Find out Chai Xiaoqi's

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,520
family, back ground,

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,600
and everything about her.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,920
I've got nothing else.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,080
See you.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Stop there.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,240
Do you think

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,520
you can fool me with a pet?

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,840
You knew it.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,400
Did you see how I got here?

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
Or anything weird?

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,840
Stop playing possum.

77
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,860
You sneaked in when I was not home.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
It is really a surprise

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
that you use a pet as the excuse.

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,720
I said it was an accident.

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
If I had control over it,

82
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
I wouldn't have come here when you were on a date.

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,400
I'd like to ask you

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
how you got in

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
without the key.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
What means did you use?

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
When will you stop going after me?

88
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,840
Who is going after you?

89
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,960
If I were going after you,

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,760
I would directly tie you up

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
and throw you in bed

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,280
rather than bother doing all these.

93
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,720
I will never come to you anyway.

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,800
See you.

95
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,700
Do you think you can come

96
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,720
and leave as you want?

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,200
What are you doing? Let me go.

98
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,520
Isn't it what you want?

99
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,700
Let me help you.

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,280
No.

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
It's my fault.

102
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,600
I will never show up again.

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,560
Don't do that.

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,320
It's my fault.

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
It's my fault.

108
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,120
Xiaoqi.

109
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,520
Xiaoqi, what's the matter?

110
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
Are you injured?

111
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,840
Why can't I control my powers

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,880
when I am with him?

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
Looking back,

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
it seems he was involved in the last several times.

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,480
What does that mean?

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,480
Each time when your powers went wrong,

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,480
it was because either someone mentioned Fang Leng to you

118
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
or you two met.

119
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
Is it possible that

120
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,560
you lost your powers because of him?

121
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,480
Impossible.

122
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,100
He's an earthling.

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
How can he control me?

124
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,160
It's not that he controls you,

125
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,080
but you lose control of yourself.

126
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,960
Haven't you noticed

127
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,640
that you care for him more and more?

128
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,800
No. That will not do.

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
I have to forget him.

130
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,880
I will be busy these days.

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120
I can't go to the office.

132
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,480
Call me

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,280
if you need help.

134
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Fang Lie.

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,760
Lie.

136
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,400
Mom,

137
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,240
why didn't you knock?

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Why so much trouble?

139
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,600
Who were you calling just now?

140
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
Xiaoqi asked for a leave.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
She won't be coming to office for a while.

142
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
So they have broken up?

143
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,440
Is she upset?

144
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,440
Probably.

145
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,880
Mom,

146
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,920
you must have been frustrated in love before.

147
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,440
How did you recover?

148
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,200
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
Listen to me.

150
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,160
Whatever happens between them,

151
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,440
it's none of your business.

152
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,200
Got it?

153
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,240
Mom,

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,880
Xiaoqi is a friend.

155
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,900
What's wrong of me to help her?

156
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,680
Besides,

157
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
you promised

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
you would not interfere between Leng and Xiaoqi.

159
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,060
Don't go back on your word.

160
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,240
Of course I won't.

161
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,000
But

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,520
based on what you told me,

163
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,160
they have really fallen out?

164
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,220
You can say that.

165
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,320
What?

166
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,400
Nothing.

167
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,280
By the way,

168
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I have made your favorite soup.

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,880
Clean up and come downstairs for the soup.

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
You haven't finished what you were saying.

171
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,160
What's this all about?

172
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,600
You said I cared for Fang Leng.

173
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm quitting him now.

174
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,920
This is called desensitization. I looked it up.

175
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,280
If

176
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I see this face every day,

177
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
I will develop a kind of resistance

178
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,560
and won't lose control anymore.

179
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
What about Jiang Xue? What's she doing here?

180
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,880
She is for consolidation.

181
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,240
If I look at her,

182
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,320
it will remind me that

183
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,520
she is the one he loves

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,040
and I should forget him.

185
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Are you going to look at them all the time?

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,840
No.

187
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,440
Not only looking at them,

188
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
but also imagining that

189
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
when he is hungry,

190
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,360
she will take food to him

191
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
and feed him.

192
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,600
They walk in the street hand in hand

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,480
and buy clothes.

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
When she feels cold,

195
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,080
he will hold her in his arms.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Are these what Fang Leng and you did?

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
Restraint.

198
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
Calm down.

199
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
I am an alien.

200
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,160
How can I be affected by a life from Earth?

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,560
Never!

202
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Expire.

203
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
Inspire.

204
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,640
Refreshed.

205
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,440
Welcome.

206
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,160
I've never thought you would come here.

207
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
We are so honored.

208
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,520
Do you know me?

209
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
Not yet.

210
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,280
But I believe I will soon.

211
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,560
Look at this wonderful complexion,

212
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,560
this temperament,

213
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,640
this outfit,

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,880
this stature,

215
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
and this well-cared face.

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
You must be

217
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
a noble woman with a successful career and from a wealthy family.

218
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,520
According to my investigation,

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
Chai Xiaoqi lives here, right?

220
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes.

221
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Bring her here.

222
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,880
You have finally come.

223
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
When Xiaoqi first came here,

224
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
I knew she was special.

225
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,160
You must be her mother.

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,080
Aren't you?

227
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,080
We don't have such a daughter in the Fang's.

229
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,080
Where is she?

230
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,000
Ask her to come here.

231
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,360
The Fang's?

232
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Xiaoqi!

233
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,720
Bad news!

234
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,320
Xiaoqi!

235
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,880
Xiaoqi,

236
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,680
what are you doing?

237
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,800
Ms. Chai,

238
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,440
control yourself.

239
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
Look at me.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
I am calm.

241
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,760
Listen.

242
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Well...

243
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,380
Fang Leng's step-mother is waiting for you downstairs.

244
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,400
She wants a word with you.

245
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Ah?

246
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,120
She wants a word with me?

247
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,280
She wants a word with me.

248
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,400
She wants a word with me.

249
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,000
What's it about?

250
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,040
What's it about?

251
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,800
What does she want to talk about?

252
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,060
You asked me to be calm

253
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,340
and quiet just now.

254
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
She is right downstairs.

255
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,400
How can I stay calm?

256
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,760
But

257
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
I have never met her before.

258
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Why does she want to talk to me?

259
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,040
No.

260
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,680
I have just turned him down.

261
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,680
I can't get in touch now.

262
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,120
What's more,

263
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,760
his mother is but an ordinary human.

264
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Why should I fear her?

265
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,960
You can't go!

266
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,640
You can't go!

267
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,520
You can't go downstairs now.

268
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,720
You can't.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Why?

270
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,480
Based on my many-year experience of watching TV shows,

271
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,480
if you go downstairs now,

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
there will be only one ending.

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
She is certainly going to break up you and Fang Leng.

274
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
If you don't agree,

275
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,680
she will offer you a lot of money,

276
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,720
-more than that enough for the rest of your life!

277
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,400
to make you

278
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,000
sacrifice love and happiness for money.

279
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,400
Why does this

280
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,200
never happen to me?

281
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,200
I've heard that Fang Leng and you have broken up.

282
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,600
Are you alright?

283
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,640
Why?

284
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Are you offering me money?

285
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,360
You are much smarter than I thought.

286
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,640
Is it money that you want?

287
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,200
No problem.

288
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
I can give it to you.

289
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
What Ms. Chai said is true?

290
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Why?

291
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,560
It's only a little compensation.

292
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,560
Look.

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,080
When you and Fang Leng were together...

294
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,400
Could you please not mention Fang Leng?

295
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,160
When you mention him,

296
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,720
I'll get...

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm allergic to him.

298
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Poor thing.

299
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,240
What a fine girl you were.

300
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,040
Look at you now.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,960
But don't worry.

302
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,040
I will do you justice.

303
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,520
What are you going to do?

304
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,040
About money,

305
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
as long as you cooperate,

306
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,400
I will give you

307
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,080
all the money you want.

308
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
Cooperate in what?

309
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,360
Look.

310
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,640
You were with Fang Leng for a long time.

311
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,880
You must know a lot about him.

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,680
For example,

313
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
what is he keeping from us?

314
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
Or,

315
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
what illness does he have?

316
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,200
Enough.

317
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,240
You are thinking too much.

318
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Fang Leng

319
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
has done nothing wrong.

320
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,360
He is just not into me.

321
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,760
We've known that

322
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,960
it's Fang Leng that is sick.

323
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,960
You just helped him to keep his secret.

324
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,600
That's why you two were together, right?

325
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
I don't understand what you are talking about.

326
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,080
Anyway,

327
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't want your money.

328
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,600
Wait.

329
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,240
Look.

330
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,000
You have broken up.

331
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
Why are you still helping him?

332
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,160
Think about it.

333
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,120
You had

334
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,560
done so much for him

335
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,160
and he just dumped you.

336
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,480
What's more,

337
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
he has already forgotten you.

338
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
I know that

339
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,520
you have fallen out.

340
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,600
Next

341
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,240
he will do everything to drive you away.

342
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Look at you,

343
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
a little girl

344
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,800
without anyone to depend on.

345
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
As long as you tell me his secret,

346
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,880
I promise

347
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,640
you don't have to

348
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
worry about your life anymore.

349
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Stop it.

350
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,640
I'll do it.

351
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,600
That's right.

352
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
When you meet Fang Leng's father,

353
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,920
tell him everything.

354
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,680
Understand?

355
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,760
Ms. Chai,

356
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,960
Have I done something wrong?

357
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
You are not to be blamed.

358
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
But it's weird.

359
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,760
It's not like anything in the shows.

360
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,440
Where is she?

361
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,840
About the recent publicity expenses,

362
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,740
I hope the Publicity Department will

363
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,500
handle them properly as soon as possible.

364
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,160
He will be mad at me if I go in now.

365
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,600
What should I do?

366
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,080
If there is no other problem, it'll be all for today.

367
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,280
Fang Leng.

368
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,800
It's really important.

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,040
Could you hear me out?

370
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,120
Mr. Fang.

371
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
I really have to tell you something important.

372
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,280
Tell the Security Department

373
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
to keep irrelevant people out.

374
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,240
Yes, sir.

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,440
Mr. Fang.

376
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
I know you don't want to see me,

377
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,200
but I am serious this time.

378
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
I can't say it here.

379
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Could you please hear me out?

380
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,080
Trust me.

381
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm really not...

382
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,040
Mr. Fang.

383
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,360
Fang Leng you bastard.

384
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,400
I can't use my powers now.

385
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,720
What's wrong with me?

386
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:40,960
Fang Leng.

387
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,560
Fang Leng.

388
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,440
Fang Leng.

389
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,120
He's gone.

390
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,400
What now?

391
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,380
=Assistant Han=

392
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,280
Pick up!

393
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,440
How can he do this to me?

394
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,800
It's late.

395
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,680
Why hasn't Xiaoqi come home?

396
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
Xiaoqi,

397
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,960
here you are.

398
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,520
How is it?

399
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
I've got

400
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,880
your favorite cake here.

401
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,400
Tell me.

402
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,560
Did Fang Leng

403
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
blame you today?

404
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
That's great.

405
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:31,920
Here,

406
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,080
have a bite.

407
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
He simply ignored me.

408
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

409
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,520
How could it be?

410
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,640
Based on my experience,

411
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,720
he should

412
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,960
help you

413
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
fight his family now.

414
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,860
I can't blame him.

415
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,080
I have brought the trouble

416
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,580
and I should solve it on my own.

417
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,280
But I used to rely on him too much.

418
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I went directly to him when I panicked.

419
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,280
Ms. Chai,

420
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,720
should I just run away?

421
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
If Fang Lie's mother couldn't find me,

422
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,360
she could do nothing.

423
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
I'd say you are stupid.

424
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,840
His mother wants to deal with Fang Leng.

425
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,880
Even without you,

426
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
she will use someone else.

427
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,080
You don't want anything to happen to Fang Leng, do you?

428
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,120
I don't care about him.

429
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,840
He ignored me in the first place.

430
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,440
How can you be so selfish?

431
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,960
Love is selfless.

432
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
Love is great

433
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,120
and forgiving.

434
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,560
In true love,

435
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
whatever he does to you,

436
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,640
you will love him unconditionally.

437
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,960
Ms. Chai,

438
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,040
explain it, please.

439
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Explain it.

440
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
You have to hold

441
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
on to him tight.

442
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,840
Understand?

443
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,120
No use.

444
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,720
Even if I went to help,

445
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,920
he would not appreciate it.

446
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,160
In his mind,

447
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,120
I am only a stain

448
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,360
that he can't wait to wipe out.

449
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,240
Don't you want to prove yourself?

450
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,480
Listen to me.

451
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,040
A girl's value is not given by others,

452
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,920
but is earned by herself.

453
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,960
Even if it's not for Fang Leng,

454
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,920
don't you want to

455
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
hold your head high in front of his parents?

456
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,720
Ms. Chai,

457
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,760
Great speech!

458
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
I have never thought about such question as

459
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760
what a girl's value is.

460
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,080
No.

461
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,200
I'm not human anyway.

462
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
I'm from Planet Capetown.

463
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
I was incubated.

464
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,640
On our planet...

465
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,360
Stop it.

466
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
Just listen to me.

467
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,680
Visit his parents tomorrow

468
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,920
and explain to them that Fang Leng is innocent.

469
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,040
In this way,

470
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
you can also make up for what you have done today.

471
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,120
Hearing your words,

472
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,760
I seem to have some idea now.

473
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
Shida, here she comes.

474
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,520
I've heard that

475
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,600
you want to tell me something about Fang Leng.

476
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,120
Yes.

477
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,220
Before...

478
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,240
Before this, she visited me

479
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,640
and said something is wrong with Fang Leng.

480
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,400
I'm afraid you won't believe it.

481
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,000
So I asked her to tell you about it.

482
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,040
Anyway,

483
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
you want to know about Fang Leng, right?

484
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,640
I've come today to explain it.

485
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,760
Please.

486
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,200
Give it to me.

487
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,880
What?

488
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
Money.

489
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,360
You want me to talk.

490
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,240
How can I do it without money?

491
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,080
Don't be rude

492
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,960
to the elders.

493
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
If you say anything you are not supposed to say,

494
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,480
I will never let you go easily.

495
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,440
As long as you tell the truth,

496
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,840
I won't let you do it in vain.

497
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,920
That's right.

498
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,160
You must have known

499
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,520
why I was with Fang Leng, right?

500
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:53,920
Why?

501
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,880
Of course for money.

502
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,000
Look at me.

503
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,280
Do I look like someone to be in a serious relationship?

504
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,560
I went after Fang Leng

505
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,240
because he is rich.

506
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,800
What interests us is Fang Leng's issue.

507
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,800
Why are you telling us this?

508
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,560
That is his issue.

509
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,440
He is so mean.

510
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,080
He worked all day long

511
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,680
and spent no money on me.

512
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,800
Look at me.

513
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,520
I have abused my love and youth.

514
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
What for?

515
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Just to find

516
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,400
a rich boy and to spend his money.

517
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,240
Look at him.

518
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
He cares only his work

519
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,960
and is no fun at all.

520
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,160
What are you talking about?

521
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,640
Is this Fang Leng's issue?

522
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Yes.

523
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,080
I broke up with him because of it.

524
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,200
Or,

525
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,800
Fang Leng

526
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,880
is not only cute, capable,

527
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,320
but also conscientious and dedicated to his career.

528
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,360
Why should I break up with him?

529
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,920
Doesn't Fang Leng

530
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,200
have any other issue?

531
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,160
If anyone is to blame, it's me, a money worshiper.

532
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,160
Fang Leng has done nothing wrong.

533
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,360
You are lying.

534
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,440
You said before that he was ill.

535
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,680
You are still

536
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
keeping his secret now.

537
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,040
That's right.

538
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,920
He is ill.

539
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
What's with my son?

540
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,800
I should not betray him.

541
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,240
Say it.

542
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,600
In fact,

543
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,840
Fang Leng

544
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,160
has indeed a little

545
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,480
psychological problem.

546
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,720
He...

547
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,520
He

548
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,440
suffers insomnia.

549
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,520
He's been under great stress recently.

550
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,880
He can't sleep well.

551
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,640
What's wrong with you as his parents?

552
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
You don't care about him at all.

553
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,240
But he is always thinking about helping you.

554
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Is this what you called a big issue?

555
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Back then

556
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
I didn't know it was like that.

557
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,520
I just care about Leng.

558
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,800
Well then,

559
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,960
I will ask them to remit the money

560
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,080
to your account within one day.

561
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,120
But,

562
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
from now on,

563
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,440
do not go after Fang Leng anymore.

564
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,840
Got it.

565
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Wait.

566
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,560
You!

567
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,360
How dare you fool me?

568
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,920
Do you know what the consequences are?

569
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,320
Considering Fang Lie,

570
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,600
I'm not going to make a fuss of it.

571
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,880
What I said today is the truth.

572
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Believe it or not.

573
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,720
Do you think that he will resume your relationship

574
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,240
if you keep his secret?

575
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,080
Listen.

576
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,040
As long as I am here,

577
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,480
you will never get close to the Fang's.

578
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,560
Let me warn you too.

579
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,880
If you ever try to harm Fang Leng,

580
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,480
if you ever threaten me again,

581
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,920
I will not make it easy for you.

582
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,240
Don't you think I fear you.

583
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,240
You...

584
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,960
Help!

585
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,520
That's terrible.

586
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,680
Mr. Fang,

587
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,040
this is the milk tea shop where Miss Jiang wants to meet you.

588
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,360
Sorry, I'm late.

589
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,440
Never mind.

590
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,320
I'm early.

591
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,080
And

592
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm happy

593
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,320
you have come.

594
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,920
For what you saw at my home,

595
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,600
I've come to...

596
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Don't apologize.

597
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,720
This is our first date.

598
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
Don't you have any plan for me?

599
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm kidding.

600
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,400
You are still so dull.

601
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Back then,

602
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
we used to sit here quite often,

603
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,720
all day long.

604
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,040
You were always serious,

605
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,160
saying nothing.

606
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,440
But it was weird.

607
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,480
The more you ignored me,

608
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,920
the more I wanted to get close to you.

609
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,080
Can I ask you a question?

610
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes.

611
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
Why do you fall for me?

612
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,720
I don't think there is unchanging feelings in this world.

613
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,000
No matter they are the family

614
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,900
or someone you want to remember,

615
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,720
everything about them will fade

616
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,200
as time goes.

617
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,320
Even though we were deep in love back then,

618
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,920
it's been quite a long time now.

619
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,200
Why do you still keep me in mind?

620
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,480
Because we are the same.

621
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,520
I have whatever you have.

622
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,440
I can even help you get what you don't have.

623
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Over so many years,

624
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,960
I've never met anyone

625
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,320
as outstanding as you are.

626
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
I believe no one around you can

627
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,880
replace me in your life.

628
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,400
Don't you think

629
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,080
we are a perfect match?

630
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,520
A perfect match?

631
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,880
I know

632
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,000
you don't believe in something as intangible as love.

633
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,520
Neither do I.

634
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,320
Love should be a relationship between two strong forces.

635
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
Only when they are both strong enough,

636
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,600
can they attract each other.

637
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,320
Right?

638
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,560
Let's order first.

639
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,000
OK.

640
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,560
Assistant Han.

641
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,200
Eh?

642
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,280
Do you think

643
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,520
there is groundless love in this world?

644
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
Groundless?

645
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,800
There is someone

646
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,920
who is good as you know,

647
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
but you just don't want to get any closer.

648
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,280
But for someone else,

649
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,920
you are aware of all her shortcomings,

650
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,520
but you just wanna reach out for her.

651
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,960
Mr. Fang,

652
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,280
why say this all of a sudden?

653
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,080
Hello.

654
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,800
What?

655
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,120
Mr. Fang,

656
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,360
it is said that

657
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,400
Xiaoqi,

658
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Miss Chai

659
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,840
went to visit the Chairman today.

660
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,800
Dad?

661
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,560
Yes.

662
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,840
Why did they meet?

663
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,160
I don't know.

664
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,200
But

665
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,760
it is said that Mrs. Fang arranged it.

666
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,960
And after that,

667
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,600
they gave Miss Chai a lot of money.

668
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,680
Hi.

669
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,920
It feels so good that everything is sorted out.

670
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,360
I'm so happy.

671
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,640
What are you doing here?

672
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,720
Come with me.

673
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,040
Hey.

674
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,040
Where?

675
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,800
Fang Leng!

676
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,160
Where...

677
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
What's that about?

678
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,160
Why did you visit my father?

679
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,400
You want to know it now?

680
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,440
Last time I ran after you

681
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,320
to tell you about it.

682
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,240
Cut the crap.

683
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
Did Zhou Siqin ask you to visit my father?

684
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,080
Yes.

685
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,960
She expected me to tell him about your illness.

686
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
And at that time,

687
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,800
I said yes

688
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,480
because of some special conditions.

689
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,040
But I didn't tell him anything.

690
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,920
I gave you my word to keep the secret.

691
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,120
Do you think I believe you?

692
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,760
Ever since I lost my memory,

693
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
you haven't done anything

694
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
you promised me.

695
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
You went after me,

696
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,120
pretended to be cute, lied,

697
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,960
and drugged me.

698
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,880
You even went to my family now.

699
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,000
Do you think I'd believe you?

700
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,080
I didn't betray you.

701
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
To keep your secret,

702
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,200
I even pretended to worship money in front of your father.

703
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,760
I told him nothing.

704
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,140
Why do you scold me

705
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,580
without knowing what happened?

706
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:52,960
Stop it.

707
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
I'd say it has always been about money.

708
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
What does that mean?

709
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,000
How much have you taken from my dad?

710
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,240
I made that money because I can.

711
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,880
He is willing to give it to me.

712
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,960
Why shouldn't I take it?

713
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Right.

714
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,640
Good.

715
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,800
Where are you going?

716
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm not finished.

717
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,160
Coma back.

718
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,960
Fang Leng!

719
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,840
So annoying!

720
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,480
What a man!

721
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,280
Mr. Fang.

722
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,400
Tell the Chairman

723
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,000
I want to see him.

724
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,840
Yes.

725
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,040
Stop there!

726
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,040
Again,

727
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,120
I didn't betray you.

728
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,840
Out.

729
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,880
I won't allow you to misunderstand me.

730
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,720
Tell the Security Department

731
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,080
to come up here now.

732
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,120
You said

733
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,920
you would believe whatever I said.

734
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Have you forgotten it?

735
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,800
Piss off.

736
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Mr. Fang.

737
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,840
Take her out.

738
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,920
Come.

739
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,360
Since you are home,

740
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,400
come join me in the dinner.

741
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,360
No need.

742
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,680
I just want to ask you one thing.

743
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,480
I'll go after that.

744
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:21,960
Ah,

745
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,160
look at you.

746
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,280
You don't come home very often.

747
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,000
Come.

748
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,680
Sit down.

749
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,080
If you want to talk to me,

750
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
you can tell me.

751
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,880
It's unnecessary to involve others.

752
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
Whatever you want to ask,

753
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,440
Ask.

754
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
What do you want to know?

755
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,920
Why did you see Chai Xiaoqi?

756
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,200
I'd like to ask you.

757
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,920
You hurried home once you got the news.

758
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,400
I just don't like it when you doubt me.

759
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,680
You worry that girl would betray you.

760
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,480
You worry that I would know

761
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,840
what kind of people she is once I met her.

762
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
She really has no idea who she is,

763
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,920
trying to get close to you only for a penny.

764
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,200
She asked to see me for money too.

765
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,360
You are still trying to protect her.

766
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,920
Do you know what she thinks of you?

767
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
In her eyes,

768
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,120
you are nothing but an instrument for her to ascend.

769
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,200
When she's done with you,

770
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,360
she'll dump you.

771
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,960
Don't you think you are stupid?

772
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,600
Did she say

773
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,000
she used me

774
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,320
and dumped me?

775
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,280
Yes.

776
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,680
But

777
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,720
she knows herself

778
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,520
and left with some money.

779
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,440
Fang Leng, listen.

780
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Don't lower yourself to such girls anymore.

781
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,720
Stop there.

782
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,040
She said you have been busy with your work

783
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,560
and have insomnia.

784
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,320
She asked me to care more about you.

785
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,080
If you really feel stressed,

786
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,360
you can tell me.

787
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,760
Dad,

788
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,360
thank you.

789
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,520
What you said is very important to me.

790
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,120
Ah,

791
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,360
I just showed some caring,

792
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,240
and he was so touched.

793
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,380
=Xiaoqi=

794
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,980
=Fang Leng=

795
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,960
It's so lovely.

796
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,360
Have it.

797
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,240
Yummy.

798
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,080
Here.

799
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,580
Who is she?

800
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,200
She's just a friend.

801
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,080
Friend?

802
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,600
You always say it's a friend.

803
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,360
Tell me everything.

804
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,520
What's going on between you and her?

805
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
I don't understand it. It's only a trivial.

806
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,160
What's going on between you?

807
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,480
What's wrong with dining with her?

808
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,680
Dining?

809
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,480
Don't you think you are annoying?

810
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,040
You think I'm annoying now?

811
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,740
-You are annoying! Leave me alone!
-You wanna break up, don't you?

812
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,740
-Let's break up then! No big deal! -You...

813
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,980
Where does the flowers come from? They are so beautiful!

814
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,140
Sorry.

815
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,360
Mr. Fang,

816
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,720
here you come.

817
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,960
Why not get in?

818
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,600
I am just passing by.

819
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Is Xiaoqi home?

820
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,640
It's so late.

821
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
She should be.

822
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,600
Let me get her out for you.

823
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,160
No need.

824
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,520
She must have gone to bed now.

825
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,320
Don't bother.

826
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,040
Mr. Fang, don't leave.

827
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,200
Since you have come at this time,

828
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,640
you must want to see her.

829
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,760
I'll get her to you.

830
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,920
I really didn't come for her.

831
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,160
Just forget about it.

832
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,320
Xiaoqi.

833
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
Why are you so late today?

834
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,040
Oh, by the way,

835
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,960
Mr. Fang just...

836
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,920
Don't mention him, Ms. Chai.

837
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,640
I'm tired.

838
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
I'm going to bed.

839
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,840
These two people,

840
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,800
I really can't understand their behaviors.

841
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,040
Here.

842
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,680
Since you and my brother are together,

843
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,080
isn't it inappropriate

844
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
for us to meet?

845
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,880
What?

846
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Still upset about what happened?

847
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,920
I know that

848
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,080
it was my fault to ask you

849
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,920
to steal Fang Leng's fingerprint

850
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,200
and to fire Miss Chai.

851
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,320
I should also have seen

852
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,080
that you are not who you were.

853
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,960
It's all the past.

854
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,280
I don't blame you.

855
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,800
That's good.

856
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,680
But I will help you two.

857
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,520
What does that mean?

858
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,960
Your brother and I, we are really getting back together.

859
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
For him,

860
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,560
I will support you and Miss Chai.

861
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,960
What?

862
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,040
We have known each other for so long.

863
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,200
Do you really think

864
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,720
I can't see that you have feelings for her?

865
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,680
You and she,

866
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,000
Fang Leng and I.

867
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,080
Don't you think it a perfect arrangement?

868
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,920
So you are saying that

869
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,080
I should be with Xiaoqi

870
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,880
so that you have no barrier anymore,

871
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,440
right?

872
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,960
Not like that.

873
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,440
In fact I always hope

874
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,000
you can find the right girl.

875
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,440
Now, here is the chance.

876
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
If we work together,

877
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,160
both of us will get what we desire.

878
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,880
Enough.

879
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,800
I am so stupid to believe

880
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,360
that you take me as a friend.

881
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,120
I thought

882
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560
you become who you are now

883
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,920
because you love my brother too much.

884
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
I've never thought

885
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,160
you could do this.

886
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,760
What are you talking about?

887
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,560
I am helping you.

888
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,520
No need.

889
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't want

890
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,200
anything achieved through scheming and tricks.

891
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,680
And,

892
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,720
from today on,

893
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,160
we are not friends anymore.

894
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,960
I...

895
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,680
Come on!

896
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,400
Isn't that Xiaoqi?

897
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,720
It is.

898
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,640
Wasn't she driven away by Mr. Fang?

899
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,200
She was.

900
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,480
Why is she still here?

901
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,400
Shameless.

902
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes.

903
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
I heard my brother had driven you away.

904
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,040
Why are you still coming to work?

905
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,640
I am not fired.

906
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,600
Why can't I come to work?

907
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,560
People are talking about you.

908
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
If you go on working here,

909
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,280
you will be drowned in gossip.

910
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,160
What's the big deal?

911
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,320
I work here.

912
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,480
I have made no mistake.

913
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,200
No one has the right to fire me.

914
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,600
And I came here

915
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,760
because of Fang Leng.

916
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,800
If I leave because of him again,

917
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,800
he will really become my focus of life.

918
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,720
I don't want that.

919
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,600
Xiaoqi,

920
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,520
sometimes I just feel

921
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,160
you are awesome.

922
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,840
It's true.

923
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,440
I'm going upstairs.

924
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,640
Eh,

925
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,120
I'm going with you.

926
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,280
Please pass this on.

927
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,160
-OK. -Thank you.

928
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,640
Mr. Fang, please sign this document.

929
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,480
Wait.

930
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,960
Mr. Fang, can I help you?

931
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,440
If not, I'll be on my way.

932
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,600
You said

933
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,560
we would not meet again.

934
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,360
I'm sorry.

935
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,540
Ever since I met you,

936
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

937
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

938
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,500
only you.

939
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,700
We're out of reach

940
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,020
but appreciate each other.

941
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:48,820
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

942
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,860
The yearning invades

943
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,420
and lurks in my mind.

944
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:02,980
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

945
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm getting addicted to it

946
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,380
and my sense is shielded.

947
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:17,180
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

948
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,340
Put the hottest heart

949
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,660
in this cold body.

950
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,020
I'm looking at you,

951
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,180
and my love has nowhere to go.

952
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,420
Ever since I met you,

953
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

954
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,620
Every day is a new memory

955
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,660
which is only be about you and me.

956
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,900
I can't lie to myself anymore.

957
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,740
Please give me the courage to believe.

958
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,660
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

959
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,580
only you.

960
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,700
Even everything becomes silent,

961
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,820
I still have you.
