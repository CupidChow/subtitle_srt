1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 4

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Mission accomplished.

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,680
Mr. Fang,

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
if you are satisfied,

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,760
remember to give me five-star praise.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,800
See you, Mr. Fang.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,640
See you.

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,300
Never see you again.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,560
OK.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,800
Have a good life.

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Mr. Fang.

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,560
Fang Leng.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,040
Fang Leng.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,280
What's wrong with you, Fang Leng?

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Why is it so hot?

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,600
What's wrong with you?

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,000
=Seafood Porridge=

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,720
You are allergic to seafood.

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,760
You shouldn't eat this.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,680
Wait.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,880
I, I'll call the emergency center.

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,880
Xue.

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
What did you

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
just call me?

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,040
Do you remember me?

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Fang Leng.

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,720
I forgot to return the car key.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,320
Fang Leng.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,640
Hold on, Fang Leng.

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,200
Fang Leng.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Fang Leng.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,080
Fang Leng.

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,720
What's wrong with him?

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,800
It is hot.

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,240
Well.

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:28,960
Come on.

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
Someone is in a coma due to seafood allergy.

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes, in F Group.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
Super power doesn't work.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,400
Hurry up.

58
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,280
Go to the hospital, sir.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
What's wrong now?

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
There is a traffic jam, girl.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,440
What?

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,960
I can't believe that there are still traffic jams

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,720
in this day and age.

64
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll find a way.

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
What is this,

66
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,060
the reality or my hallucination?

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Well, this is your hallucination.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
You're sick.

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,640
Certainly this is your hallucination.

70
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,280
How do you know?

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,560
Of course I do,

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,880
or we can't fly in the sky

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,480
with the force of gravity.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,800
Look.

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Down there are people, roads and cars, right?

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,160
I mean,

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
how do you know this is my hallucination?

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
Because,

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,360
because it's also my hallucination.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Hallucination.

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,240
Yes.

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,920
It happens

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
to both you and me.

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,400
What are you doing?

85
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Don't act recklessly in this case.

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,480
Stop. Stop. Stop.

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,000
Stop.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
I want to test

89
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
if you're lying.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,360
I...

91
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,360
Don't act recklessly in this case.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,800
Stop.

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,040
Stop.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,640
Make way. Make way.

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,920
Oh, my God! You scared me.

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,040
Well.

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,280
Doctor.

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,760
Help.

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
Help now.

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Doctor Zhang,

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,680
when will he wake up?

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,080
Mr. Fang

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
has a special allergic constitution.

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,680
We can't find it through physical examination.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,720
Now he is

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,600
suffering from arrhythmia.

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
The specific reason

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,520
hasn't been found out yet.

109
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
Stay in hospital for observation.

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,960
Would he die from it?

111
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,600
Nonsense.

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
You sent him here in time,

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,640
so he's out of danger.

114
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,160
But he needs more rest.

115
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
That's all. I'm leaving.

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,560
OK.

117
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,400
Thanks, doctor.

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,000
OK.

119
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,240
Miss,

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,160
first,

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
thank you very much for sending

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,800
Mr. Fang to hospital in time.

123
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,440
As for his allergy,

124
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,720
we'll find out who is to blame

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,800
when he wakes up.

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,480
As for the rest,

127
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
leave it to the professional caregivers.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,480
So

129
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,800
you can go first.

130
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,000
Can I wait for him to wake up?

131
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
What?

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
I didn't mean to.

133
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,160
Xiaoqi.

134
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,840
You wake up.

135
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,600
Those around you are so careless.

136
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Don't they know that you're allergic to seafood?

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
It happened once when we were students

138
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
and you almost lost your life.

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
It seems that I have to think about your proposal.

140
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,800
Where is she?

141
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,880
Who?

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,440
Chai Xiaoqi, the unusual girl,

143
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,960
I told you before.

144
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
The girl I just drove out.

145
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,880
It's you.

146
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Do you

147
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
remember me?

148
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,440
What?

149
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,360
You forget what happened when you were in a coma.

150
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
What is it?

151
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Nothing.

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,680
You called my name in a coma.

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
I thought you liked me.

154
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,400
Miss Jiang,

155
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,560
you misunderstood it.

156
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,400
The delivery girl took me here.

157
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
It has nothing to do with you.

158
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,080
Like one of my friends,

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,160
you are too serious.

160
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm just here

161
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,280
to make sure that you're alright.

162
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,040
Now I'm rest assured.

163
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,480
See you.

164
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,000
Your new girlfriend?

165
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
A partner.

166
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Really?

167
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,060
=Secretary Zhang=

168
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,300
Hello.

169
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,400
OK. I see.

170
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,440
Give me a car.

171
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
I'll see Fang Leng in the hospital.

172
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,280
What's wrong with him?

173
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,240
I think he should be too busy

174
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,200
to have meals regularly,

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
so he suffers food poisoning.

176
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,760
OK.

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,360
Chairman,

178
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,960
this is sales report of the last quarter.

179
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Have a look.

180
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,560
You've come at the right time.

181
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,680
Fang Leng is in hospital now.

182
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,720
Go there with me.

183
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't worry.

184
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,560
I've sent someone to visit him.

185
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,400
It is food allergy.

186
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,520
He is resting now.

187
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,400
Those who take care of him

188
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,480
are so careless.

189
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,960
He has had a gastrointestinal problem since childhood.

190
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
There are so many things to pay attention to.

191
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Well, improve his health

192
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,160
with the help of Chinese Traditional Medical doctor, OK?

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
I know a well experienced one.

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,920
Shall I arrange it?

195
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,040
That's a good idea.

196
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,480
Just do what you said.

197
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,600
According to my investigation,

198
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,720
this is all about Jiang Xue.

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,520
She is unreliable,

200
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,080
but we should pay more attention to Fang Leng.

201
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,320
Sister,

202
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,440
do you have any plan?

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,240
Instead of relying on a girl to find out what he forgets,

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,720
we'd better take the initiative

205
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,920
to find a professional.

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,280
I asked you to leave, right?

207
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,720
Mr. Fang, it's me.

208
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
What are you doing here?

209
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,760
Anyway, I got you in trouble.

210
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
I should stay here to take care of you.

211
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,880
This is the breakfast for you.

212
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,200
It's absolutely safe for you.

213
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,760
I won't have food that you bring to me.

214
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Let me do something for you.

215
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,920
Otherwise,

216
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,720
I always feel that I owe you.

217
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,480
If you really want to make up for it,

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
there is a way.

219
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,600
Well,

220
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,600
what to do?

221
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,240
It's improper.

222
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,800
Well.

223
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,640
What are you talking?

224
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,480
Scratch the itchy for me.

225
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,520
OK.

226
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,200
I see.

227
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,620
Do you have to use such an old-school stuff

228
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,120
to help?

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
We're here alone.

230
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
It is improper for me

231
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,740
to touch your body directly.

232
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,840
We should conduct ourselves.

233
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,600
Why do you turn around?

234
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Are you getting a nosebleed?

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
No.

236
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm attracted by your male hormone.

237
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,520
You will never know the feeling

238
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,000
of pain and happiness.

239
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,700
Here?

240
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:30,960
To the left slightly.

241
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,000
The left.

242
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,760
This is my head.

243
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,940
OK. Here?

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,920
Go down.

245
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,040
My back.

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,640
My back.

247
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,380
Isn't it your back?

248
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,440
Or what can it be?

249
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,780
Here is not my back but my chest.

250
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
We will do a comprehensive examination

251
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,440
for Mr. Fang.

252
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,280
Miss,

253
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
please go out.

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,360
OK. OK.

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,560
Well,

256
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll come to see you tomorrow morning.

257
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,920
No need.

258
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Assistant Han will come tomorrow.

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,720
Don't bother.

260
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
I don't want to, actually.

261
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,860
I hope you recover soon so that

262
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,100
I won't have to worry about you.

263
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,880
It's so strange.

264
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,440
Come to the point.

265
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,140
According to your health,

266
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
even if you're allergic,

267
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,560
it is unlikely

268
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,040
to have arrhythmia.

269
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
I wonder if you suffered

270
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,480
any psychological trauma before.

271
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,600
You didn't see me as a doctor before.

272
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,680
Chairman Fang specially

273
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,880
asked me to take care of your health.

274
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,000
He told me that

275
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,800
you have had allergies since childhood.

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,240
Since you have to take a rest now,

277
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,480
take care of yourself.

278
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,000
My dad?

279
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:12,900
Yes.

280
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,680
He really cares about you.

281
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,160
He was afraid that you were too busy with your work

282
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,560
to take good care of yourself.

283
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
Did my dad really say that?

284
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,320
Sure.

285
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,400
Mrs. Fang called to remind us at that very night.

286
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,320
Your parents are very concerned about you.

287
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,400
My parents?

288
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
You mean Ms. Zhou?

289
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,040
Yes.

290
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,040
What did you do to me?

291
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,380
What food should I prepare for him?

292
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Mr. Fang,

293
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
take it easy.

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,080
Breathe calmly.

295
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,640
Breathe deeply.

296
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,360
What do you want to do

297
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,540
by mesmerizing me?

298
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,000
Then we can only treat you in other ways.

299
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
Why is the door locked?

300
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,920
What are you doing?

301
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,800
What do you want to do?

302
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,120
Go.

303
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,320
Stop.

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,320
Xiaoqi.

305
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,720
Stop.

306
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,540
Well, are you all right?

307
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Are you all right, Fang Leng?

308
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,920
I'll call the doctor now.

309
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,600
Don't go.

310
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,980
They dare not hurt me.

311
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,340
It's just hypnotic.

312
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Thank you.

313
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,560
Don't mention that.

314
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,340
I even couldn't catch them for you.

315
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't mention that.

316
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,960
My stepmother sent them here.

317
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,560
Your stepmother?

318
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,660
You don't need to know that.

319
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
Although I think you are strange,

320
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,080
your world

321
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,520
is very simple.

322
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,160
What?

323
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
What, what did you say?

324
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,680
Fang Leng.

325
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,600
Fang Leng.

326
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,760
Hello,

327
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,760
doctor.

328
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,840
Anyone?

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,480
Recently,

330
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
Fang Leng, President of F Group,

331
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,920
nicknamed Playboy President,

332
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
was hospitalized for unknown reasons.

333
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,640
The specific reasons are

334
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,420
to be further investigated by our reporter.

335
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm back.

336
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,040
Xiaoqi,

337
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
I just saw you on the TV.

338
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,560
How warm-hearted you are!

339
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,360
Fang Leng

340
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,880
was hospitalized

341
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
for eating our food.

342
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,320
Our food?

343
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,000
Impossible.

344
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,300
What I made

345
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,060
for him is

346
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,360
the super special food in our restaurant.

347
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,960
Even if it was a small bowl of porridge,

348
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,120
I put

349
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,060
sea cucumber, abalone

350
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,960
and lobster in it for him.

351
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,960
Therefore, he is in hospital

352
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,760
because he is allergic to seafood.

353
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,600
What?

354
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,760
He is

355
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,640
allergic to seafood.

356
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,200
You should have told me earlier.

357
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,360
How is he now?

358
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,040
Is he seriously sick?

359
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,020
He's much better now,

360
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,440
but he is still weak.

361
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,480
What to do?

362
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,760
Once he finds it out,

363
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,440
our restaurant

364
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,320
may be gone.

365
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
But he hasn't mentioned that.

366
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,200
No.

367
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,360
Big shots

368
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,260
like him are really good at

369
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,580
hiding their emotions.

370
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,560
No one knows what they think.

371
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,360
But he

372
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,340
seems to be different now.

373
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,760
Xiaoqi,

374
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,200
it's a critical moment

375
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,600
for our restaurant now.

376
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,080
From now on,

377
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,080
as a special agent of our restaurant,

378
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,160
you must be by his side and

379
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,400
keep a very close eye on what he does.

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,880
Got it?

381
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,200
Yes.

382
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,100
Fighting.

383
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,640
Fighting.

384
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,660
Fighting.

385
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,160
Well, is all settled?

386
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,240
Don't worry.

387
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,360
All is arranged.

388
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,860
There will be alternating shifts.

389
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,660
Those unrelated

390
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,460
can't bother you.

391
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,880
Thank you.

392
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,980
Go back and rest.

393
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,380
Don't stand on ceremony.

394
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,200
See you.

395
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,940
Take care. Bye.

396
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,040
What are you doing?

397
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,480
What are you going to do to him?

398
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,880
Stop.

399
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,880
What are you doing, miss?

400
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,080
Let me in.

401
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,960
You can't.

402
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I can.

403
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Let me in.

404
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,800
No, you can't.

405
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,600
What's going on?

406
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,720
Never mind, Mr. Fang.

407
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,840
We'll handle it now.

408
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,680
Mr. Fang.

409
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,000
Mr. Fang.

410
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,520
Mr. Fang,

411
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,600
I was driven away by Ms. Chai.

412
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,160
Can I stay here tonight?

413
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,320
Let go.

414
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,400
Let go.

415
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
You can first go out.

416
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,960
Go out.

417
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,840
Sorry

418
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,640
to disturb you late at night.

419
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
What's going on?

420
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,720
Ms. Chai asked me to compensate for it.

421
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,400
She was afraid that
you would hold our restaurant responsible.

422
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,360
You helped me today,

423
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,960
so I won't embarrass you.

424
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,480
Go back.

425
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,040
He's sick,

426
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
but no one takes care of him here.

427
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,360
Like a planet out of orbit,

428
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,660
Fang Leng is so lonely in this situation that

429
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,180
I want to embrace him.

430
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,840
It's late.

431
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,720
I'm afraid that it's dangerous for me

432
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,300
to go back alone.

433
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,720
But if you stay here,

434
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,560
I'll be in danger, right?

435
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't worry.

436
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,600
I dare not hurt you.

437
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,480
Look. I have took bedclothes here.

438
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,640
Please let me sleep here tonight

439
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,040
to do what Ms. Chai ask me to do.

440
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Please.

441
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,320
Stay away from my bed.

442
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
OK.

443
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,460
Although I can't return to my home planet right now,

444
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,940
it's also wonderful to watch

445
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,640
a handsome man

446
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,140
on such a beautiful night.

447
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,700
Don't sleep facing me. Turn away.

448
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,140
You also sleep facing me,

449
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
or you won't know how I face.

450
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,500
Believe it or not, I may drive you away now.

451
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,720
OK. OK.

452
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,180
How nasty you are!

453
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,660
No wonder no one is here with you though you're sick.

454
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,960
You are here.

455
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm different.

456
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,680
You have seen it, right?

457
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm an alien with hallucinations.

458
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,040
How about

459
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,600
showing you my hallucinations?

460
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Can you do that?

461
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,920
Sure.

462
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
Let me show you the stars in my hallucinations.

463
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,580
These are the stars in your hallucinations.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,740
Yes.

465
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
I don't know why only you

466
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,360
can see it on the earth.

467
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,240
But it's better for you to

468
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,880
try to accept troubles in life

469
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,620
than feel like a patient, right?

470
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
Life is so boring.

471
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,920
Sometimes you

472
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,200
need to see something different.

473
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,540
I wish this isn't a dream.

474
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,060
Regard it as a dream.

475
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,480
You are also a star in my dream.

476
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,080
Sometimes

477
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,160
the star is very warm,

478
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,640
but

479
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,240
sometimes

480
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,400
it's quite erratic.

481
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,040
I, I'm sorry.

482
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,700
I, I promised that I would stay away from your bed.

483
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,080
Thanks.

484
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
Your hallucinations are really beautiful.

485
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,240
I will try to

486
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,400
accept my illness.

487
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,440
Good night.

488
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
Good night.

489
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,980
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot...

490
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,400
Fang Leng,

491
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,120
answer my phone call.

492
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,360
Which ward are you in?

493
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,360
Drive carefully, OK?

494
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Long time no see.

495
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,920
It's been a long time. You're still...

496
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,200
Why do you come back?

497
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,840
After such a long time,

498
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,080
I want to come back and have a look.

499
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,240
Then you shouldn't leave back then.

500
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,200
If there's nothing else,

501
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,160
I'm leaving.

502
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
You already knew it.

503
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,600
I left and came back

504
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
for Fang Leng.

505
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,960
Yeah, I like him.

506
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,580
I made friends with you for him.

507
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,600
You should tell him that.

508
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,800
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

509
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,120
Do you remember Huayin?

510
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,520
You said you wanted to be a painter,

511
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,320
so I turned to all people I knew for help.

512
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
Even in the most difficult time abroad,

513
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,200
I still kept recommending you.

514
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm still planning your art exhibition now.

515
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,320
OK, don't be angry.

516
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,280
I'm back, right?

517
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,200
How about Leng?

518
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,480
You should have met him.

519
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,720
I'll deal with

520
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,960
the business between him and me.

521
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,960
Actually, we are unfamiliar.

522
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,280
And after all these years,

523
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,840
he may have forgotten me.

524
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,240
So

525
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,800
I hope you won't mention it to anyone

526
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,280
what happened between him and me in the past.

527
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,520
Come on.

528
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Who?

529
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,880
Who?

530
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,360
Hello.

531
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,800
Why am I on the bed?

532
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,300
Why are you on the ground?

533
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,720
I should ask you these questions.

534
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,840
Why are you on my bed?

535
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,980
What a lustful girl!

536
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,020
I must attracted by his hormone.

537
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,240
I...

538
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,840
Luckily, nothing happened.

539
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,440
Do you think I'll do anything improper to you?

540
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,580
You should worry that I will do that to you.

541
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
You know it.

542
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,400
=Assistant Han=

543
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,520
What's up?

544
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,200
It's going to be tricky, Mr. Fang.

545
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,800
I just received the report that

546
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,080
it's going to rain.

547
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,200
What's wrong with you?

548
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,160
Do you remember that hallucination?

549
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
I remember you said you were

550
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,600
an alien in the hallucination.

551
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,520
On your planet,

552
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,320
what if

553
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,320
you are forgotten?

554
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,600
It won't happen.

555
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,920
Our memories are stored as data on our planet,

556
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,280
so we'll never forget anything.

557
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,120
What if someone deletes you?

558
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,920
Then I'll delete him, too.

559
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,600
I don't care.

560
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
OK.

561
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,280
Where are you going?

562
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,300
Will you come back tonight?

563
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,660
If I don't come to you,

564
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,520
please delete me.

565
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,040
Assistant Han,

566
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,160
start the database.

567
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,920
Call the heads of departments

568
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
to send me all the documents

569
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,480
that should be handled in the near future.

570
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,640
It's arranged.

571
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,480
We are ready to deal with

572
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,160
your amnesia in rainy days.

573
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,080
Don't worry.

574
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,580
Ask the memory bank to prepare for a meeting.

575
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,240
What?

576
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,360
Mr. Fang,

577
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,180
the memory bank is

578
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,440
specially for your memory storage.

579
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,900
No matter how much you lose your memory,

580
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
the data there

581
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,960
will remind you of the memory in this period.

582
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,600
You said that

583
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,960
for the avoidance of suspicion,

584
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,160
you rarely meet

585
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,060
Director Yang in charge of the memory bank.

586
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,000
Is there anything

587
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,540
special this time?

588
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,620
Nothing.

589
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,720
I just want to personally review

590
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,340
some of my personal information.

591
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,300
I see.

592
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,140
Hello, Mr. Fang.

593
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,540
Don't worry, Mr. Fang.

594
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,840
The security system here

595
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,700
is improved by the technology department.

596
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,860
Only insiders know.

597
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,000
At ordinary times,

598
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,620
only Assistant Han and Doctor Zhang

599
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,360
come in and connect with us.

600
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,160
Thank you for your hard work.

601
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,400
I just want to see the recent deposited documents.

602
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,840
OK, Mr. Fang.

603
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,940
These memory bars

604
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,460
are about all women you met recently.

605
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,900
No matter who you forget,

606
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,580
we can remind you through them.

607
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,280
Whose do you want to check?

608
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,240
It's urgent. Let me be brief.

609
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,080
I read your latest medical information.

610
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,400
The heavy rain is likely

611
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,640
to have a more serious impact

612
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,000
on you than before.

613
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,600
What does it mean?

614
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,760
Previously, you couldn't

615
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
remember women you met in a certain period.

616
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,000
For example,

617
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,840
you can remember your stepmother clearly.

618
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,260
However, you've been

619
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,860
hallucinating a lot lately.

620
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,360
I think

621
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,940
it's a sign that your health is getting worse.

622
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,120
How about my mom?

623
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,940
If it gets worse,

624
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,340
will I forget her completely?

625
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
Well, it's just

626
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,520
a guess for the time being.

627
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,840
Anyway,

628
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,940
I suggest you avoid the heavy rain.

629
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,000
How to?

630
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,880
Leave here

631
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,720
before it rains.

632
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
Should I do that

633
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,400
all my life?

634
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,480
Well, I'm not recommending that either.

635
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,260
The best way for us to deal with harm

636
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,160
is to face it,

637
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,600
but

638
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
we have tried so many times, right?

639
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,880
No one

640
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,340
can help you get rid of the shadow.

641
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,480
So this time

642
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,260
you have to leave,

643
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,820
Fang Leng.

644
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,100
As expected, you're reliable.

645
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,700
The front defense layers of the memory bank

646
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,400
have been broken.

647
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,700
I'll handle with anything else subsequent as soon as possible.

648
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,940
OK. The money has been transferred to your account.

649
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,660
If you want it to be done earlier,

650
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,140
there is another way.

651
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,140
That is, to destroy the memory bank completely.

652
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,020
Calm down.

653
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,000
My memory is also there.

654
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,820
It won't help anyone if you do that.

655
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,740
I helped you work in F Group

656
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,260
to keep an eye on things there.

657
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,540
As for the rest,

658
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,380
don't act

659
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,220
without my instructions.

660
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,700
What a pity!

661
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,260
You could have benefited more.

662
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,020
That isn't what I want.

663
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,780
I just want his love.

664
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,740
Break the subsequent defense layers as soon as possible.

665
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,980
I want to get his memory information earlier.

666
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,280
Take these

667
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,580
as my last trump card.

668
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,620
I wonder

669
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,740
who you will forget when it rains.

670
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Ms. Chai.

671
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,840
Ms. Chai.

672
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,860
Ms. Chai.

673
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:05,920
Well.

674
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,420
What's going with the mess outside?

675
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,000
The restaurant front was smashed.

676
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,860
What?

677
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,740
Are you alright?

678
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,700
Let me check.

679
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,420
I'm alright.

680
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:15,880
Xiaoqi,

681
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,860
you just come in time.

682
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,300
We're closing

683
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,180
and having a rest.

684
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,960
Why?

685
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,140
You ask me why.

686
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,260
It's Fang Leng's fault.

687
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,880
Since he was hospitalized

688
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,080
after eating our food,

689
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,940
rumors have it that we run an illegal restaurant

690
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,060
making poisonous food.

691
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,840
Well,

692
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,320
he was hospitalized for allergy.

693
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,560
They shouldn't make such a rumor.

694
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,440
You fool,

695
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,120
now it's much easier

696
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,500
for reporters to lie than to tell the truth.

697
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,640
Compared with seafood allergy,

698
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,680
food poisoning will get more clicks.

699
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,640
What to do?

700
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,740
I'll explain to the customers that

701
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,840
he was allergic.

702
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,520
Forget it.

703
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,520
It's better to save trouble.

704
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,120
I think

705
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,080
we'd better first close

706
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,040
and rest.

707
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,000
What?

708
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Ms. Chai, are you leaving?

709
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,000
Don't leave.

710
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,920
This is my only home.

711
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,000
What should I do without you?

712
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,400
I don't know.

713
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll come back.

714
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,760
I just agreed with my best friend

715
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,080
to go out for a few days off.

716
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:06,800
Well,

717
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,660
here you are.

718
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,140
I haven't had a rest for a long time.

719
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,580
You've been working hard lately.

720
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,760
Take care of the restaurant

721
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,980
and have a good rest.

722
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,500
Well, come back earlier.

723
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,100
I'll wait for you right here.

724
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,480
OK.

725
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,660
It's boring.

726
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,280
Life is really boring.

727
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,780
Come on.

728
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
I agree.

729
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,220
Who is speaking?

730
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,260
I'm here.

731
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,300
Come here and turn me around.

732
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,920
Kubri.

733
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,820
Gosh.

734
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,660
You wake up.

735
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,020
Kubri, you wake up.

736
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,940
Calm down.

737
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,760
Don't shake me heavily.

738
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,100
It's great that you wake up.

739
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,480
However,

740
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,240
Fang Leng

741
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,420
and Ms. Chai left.

742
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,820
Luckily, you're here with me.

743
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,820
I thought you forgot me

744
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,020
as you were attracted by Fang Leng.

745
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,440
I've warned you that

746
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,820
the more handsome a man looks, the more dangerous he is.

747
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,960
Now I've hit it, right?

748
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,120
This restaurant is your home on the earth.

749
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,180
Your alien home is gone

750
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,140
and this one is going to be gone.

751
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,600
You know that.

752
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,860
Yes,

753
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,660
and I have a solution.

754
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,920
What is it?

755
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,660
Go to Fang Leng for help.

756
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,180
He is the focus of the media.

757
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,900
As long as he tells reporters that he was not poisoned,

758
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,580
the rumor will be proved to be ill-founded.

759
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,040
I see.

760
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,820
Gosh, you're so great.

761
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,860
That's it.

762
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,460
When I am not here,

763
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,700
please take care of it.

764
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,980
OK, Mr. Fang.

765
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,260
Fang Leng.

766
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,700
Who is she, Mr. Fang?

767
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,820
You're the delivery girl, right? What's up?

768
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,580
I come to you for something very important.

769
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Talk with my assistant.

770
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,960
No, Fang Leng.

771
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,260
Fang Leng.

772
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,640
He is very busy.

773
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,140
-I really need his help. -Go.

774
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,400
Go.

775
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,280
No. No.

776
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,960
Fang Leng,

777
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,060
can you explain it for our restaurant?

778
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,380
Fang Leng, our restaurant is closed because of your allergy.

779
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,540
Would you please clarify it to the media?

780
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,500
Fang Leng, listen to me.

781
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,500
Fang Leng.

782
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,580
Fang Leng.

783
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,220
Fang Leng.

784
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,980
What should I do?

785
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,240
-Xiaoqi. -Yes?

786
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,740
You've been walking around the building for 3 hours.

787
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
When are we going home?

788
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,380
Wait a minute.

789
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,740
Perhaps Fang Leng will return.

790
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,180
You fool,

791
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,500
he left you behind by car.

792
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,220
Obviously, he doesn't want to help you.

793
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,540
You've been on the earth for a long time.

794
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,980
Why can't you see their true colors?

795
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,020
No,

796
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,700
he won't do that.

797
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,180
When I took care of him in the hospital,

798
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,820
he clearly regarded me as a friend

799
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,060
and told me stories.

800
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,380
Why does he

801
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,820
change suddenly?

802
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, no.

803
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,660
You're beginning to believe in earthling.

804
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,860
You're going to degenerate.

805
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,020
Forget it.

806
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,260
If he doesn't want to help me,

807
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,780
I'll find my own way.

808
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,340
Welcome to today's morning news.

809
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,180
The sensational poisoning incident of Playboy President

810
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,500
Fang Leng ends finally.

811
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,380
He is

812
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,860
said to have been discharged from hospital

813
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,940
and back to work.

814
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,080
However,

815
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,300
after this incident,

816
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,660
food safety problems

817
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,500
have become a hot topic recently.

818
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,060
Oh, no.

819
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,740
I just contacted one reporter.

820
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,700
Why are there so many people here?

821
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,660
What are you doing?

822
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,740
Run.

823
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,780
I thought all would be settled with brief explanation.

824
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,180
I didn't expect that it creates a sensation.

825
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,580
Let's lie low

826
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,060
-until it blows over. -No.

827
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,460
I caused it,

828
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,020
so I have to settle it for the restaurant.

829
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,520
She is coming.

830
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,260
Excuse me,

831
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,900
are you the delivery girl who caused Fang Leng's poisoning?

832
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,860
Did you contact him after the poisoning incident?

833
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,060
How will you compensate?

834
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,740
Have you ever considered the consequences

835
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,900
of running such an illegal restaurant?

836
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
Don't you have conscience?

837
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,600
-Do you? -Yeah, do you?

838
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,160
Fang Leng was not poisoned,

839
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,620
but just allergic.

840
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,300
Do you have any proof?

841
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,440
He was just allergic.

842
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,660
There's nothing wrong with our restaurant.

843
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,980
No way.

844
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,760
That's true.

845
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,140
He was just allergic.

846
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,300
I mean it.

847
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,260
That's impossible.

848
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,100
Do you have any proof?

849
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,980
You should give us a proper explanation.

850
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,640
I'll eat to prove it.

851
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,620
We were approved by Mr. Fang personally

852
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,540
before we delivered food to F Group.

853
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,260
He won't choose

854
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,220
an restaurant with food problems.

855
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,060
He was really just allergic.

856
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,020
There's nothing wrong with our restaurant.

857
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,780
He was really just allergic.

858
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,100
Do you have any proof?

859
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,820
Why does he

860
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,420
keep silent over the statement of food poisoning?

861
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,300
Right.

862
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,440
Why don't you explain it until now

863
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,560
with such a farfetched reason?

864
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,480
Mr. Fang, we are ready.

865
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,860
Let's go.

866
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,100
=An Lian Restaurant=

867
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,860
Mr. Fang.

868
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,460
Go.

869
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,180
Yesterday

870
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,660
Xiaoqi seemed to come for something urgent.

871
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,880
Mr. Fang,

872
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,700
do you want to contact her before boarding?

873
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,260
Yesterday, we had to

874
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,420
avoid talking many things

875
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,660
before Uncle Kang.

876
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,060
Forget it.

877
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,700
Even if I go to her,

878
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,620
I will forget her one day.

879
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,980
He was really just allergic.

880
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,620
There's nothing wrong with our restaurant.

881
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,740
He was really just allergic.

882
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,980
Stop.

883
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,060
Mr. Fang.

884
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,980
It's going to rain.

885
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,500
Don't take risks.

886
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,780
It's said that you were refused

887
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,360
when asking Mr. Fang for help before.

888
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,120
Is that true?

889
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,220
Since Mr. Fang hasn't admitted that he was allergic,

890
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,040
is that an indirect proof that you are lying?

891
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,540
Ever since I met you,

892
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

893
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,620
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

894
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,500
only you.

895
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,700
We're out of reach

896
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,020
but appreciate each other.

897
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:56,820
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

898
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,860
The yearning invades

899
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,420
and lurks in my mind.

900
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:10,980
The more I want to escape,
the more I am pulled by it bearing pains.

901
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:15,060
I'm getting addicted to it

902
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,380
and my sense is shielded.

903
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,180
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

904
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,340
Put the hottest heart

905
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,660
in this cold body.

906
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,020
I'm looking at you,

907
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,180
and my love has nowhere to go.

908
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,420
Ever since I met you,

909
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,340
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

910
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,620
Every day is a new memory

911
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,660
which is only be about you and me.

912
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,900
I can't lie to myself anymore.

913
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,740
Please give me the courage to believe.

914
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,660
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

915
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,580
only you.

916
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,700
Even everything becomes silent,

917
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,820
I still have you.
