1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 16

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Chai Xiaoqi, get up!

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
I don't wanna get up.

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,640
I don't wanna go to work.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
I won't get up.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
What did we do last night?

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
What could we do in the dead of night

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,120
except sleeping?

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
You slept with your head on my shoulder.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,520
My neck is aching.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
If I remember correctly,

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
you made me take a drug, didn't you?

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
What exactly are you up to?

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,960
If you want money, I can give it to you.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,480
Why did you do such a boring thing?

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,040
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh. no.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,760
I didn't take my annunciator.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
You were so weak

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,200
and your forehead kept burning.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,760
I couldn't even manage to do it.

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
I'm the one who should be gloomy.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,160
What did you try to do?

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,120
What on earth do you want to do?

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm the one who should worry what you'll do to me.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,800
What do you think I'll do to you?

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,720
Why are you still here?

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
He was holding onto me.

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,280
How could I go home?

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,360
How can you blame it on me?

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,400
Why can't I blame it on you?

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,840
Alright, stop quarreling.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
Boyfriends and girlfriends now are all so irritable.

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000
-Shut up! -Shut up!

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,440
-I'm not her boyfriend! -I'm not his girlfriend!

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,800
How long are you going to lock us here?

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Can we leave now?

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,360
I forgot that you were here.

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
Why didn't you call me?

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,960
Mr. Fang,

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,880
something happened.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,640
The Public Relations Department

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
has tried to contact Jiang Xue this morning

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,640
but she's been refusing to communicate.

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,760
Go to her company.

62
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,760
What else do you want to do?

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
I haven't got the thing

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
I tried to take yesterday.

65
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,440
When can we meet again?

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Can you cut it out?

67
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,520
I'll let you get away with what you did yesterday.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't push your luck.

69
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,840
We're over.

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
We've been over a long time ago.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,560
Fang Lie,

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
come and drink milk.

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,120
It's fresh

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,600
and can supply you with calcium.

75
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,480
Quickly.

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,040
Mom,

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,480
I have grown up.

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,000
If I keep taking in calcium,

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
I'll be two meters tall.

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,920
But you're still a kid in my eyes.

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Okay, okay.

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
Got it, Ms. Zhou.

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,320
Sit.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,920
Here,

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,600
let me knead your shoulders.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,680
You cheeky boy.

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,760
No one can give you

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,120
feelings of security except yourself.

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,400
In fact...

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,720
Jiang Xue.

91
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm the one who should make him feel secure.

92
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,040
Let's go and check.

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,120
He kept seeing different people.

94
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
Isn't it all because he hadn't met

95
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,920
someone who could make him feel secure?

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Could you tell us

97
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
if you're going to get married?

98
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
Isn't Fang Leng seeing

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
that delivery person?

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,800
What's going on?

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,920
I need to go out now.

102
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Fang Ruthless.

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Fang Heartless.

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I'll go back to my home planet

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,880
and I'll never see you again.

106
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
You ruthless and heartless rascal.

107
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,800
Rascal.

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,560
Xiaoqi!

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,640
Hey.

110
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,520
What are you doing here early in the morning?

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,320
Could I not come here

112
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,160
after such a terrible thing happened?

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
Ms. Chai said you had been out all night.

114
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,360
Your heart has been broken, hasn't it?

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
I'm still feeling bad.

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,560
My neck is killing me.

117
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,000
Come here.

118
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,760
Lean on my shoulder.

119
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,400
I'll get it through with you.

120
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,320
Compared with your shoulder,

121
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,240
a good sleep would suit me better.

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,480
Everything will be fine

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,080
as long as I get some sleep.

124
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Wait a minute.

125
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,120
You haven't known it yet?

126
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,600
What should I know?

127
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,360
No...

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,120
nothing.

129
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,200
It's just that

130
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,480
I had a nightmare yesterday.

131
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,280
I dreamed that your heart was broken

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,640
so I came to see you

133
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
this early morning.

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,480
Dreams

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
are the opposite of reality.

136
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Besides,

137
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,760
my heart is super strong.

138
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,120
No one can break it.

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,280
Now

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
everything will be over

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,920
as long as I have a good sleep.

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
Temporarily we're not going to get married.

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,480
You...

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
you are so strange.

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
What's wrong with you today?

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm all right

147
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
but the company is not.

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
It's very important.

149
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,600
Now it's time to work.

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,480
Go to a place with me.

151
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,080
Let's go.

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,120
Where are we going?

153
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,440
Hello.

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,040
What do you think of these flowers?

155
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
You're good at arranging flowers

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
but you're even better at lying.

157
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Looks like you're here to criticize me.

158
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,400
Miss Jiang,

159
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
you released misinformation about us.

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,960
It'll benefit neither of us.

161
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
The truth proves that it benefits.

162
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,880
At least you're here now.

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
I didn't show up yesterday.

164
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,760
It's my fault.

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,280
I apologize.

166
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,520
But you can't

167
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
solve the problem in such a wilful way.

168
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,320
I'm wilful?

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,080
I was hurt by you again and again

170
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
just because I was too sensible before.

171
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,520
What happened between us before?

172
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
I've been keeping this photo.

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
Because I'm afraid without it,

174
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,560
even I myself will forget

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
about our past.

176
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
This is our past?

177
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,160
When did we get acquainted?

178
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,120
Remember the milk tea shop where I asked you to meet me?

179
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,680
When I was a kid,

180
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,800
my dad and my mom were busy doing business abroad

181
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,960
and my home was always empty.

182
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
I didn't want to go home after school

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,040
so

184
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,560
I could only do my homework there.

185
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,320
At that time, you didn't like

186
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,880
going home, either.

187
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
So we kept hiding there

188
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,320
until it closed.

189
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,640
So you were my girlfriend before?

190
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,560
I don't know if I was either.

191
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,480
I tried many methods and became your friend.

192
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,640
And then

193
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,360
I told you I liked you

194
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,440
and you agreed to be with me.

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,880
But the next day it rained

196
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,080
and you forgot me.

197
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
So you've known my secret for long.

198
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,160
I had no idea such an absurd thing

199
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
would happen to you.

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
I just thought you played the field

201
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,760
and dallied with me.

202
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
So what do you want?

203
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,680
You think I aim for your status

204
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
like the other women?

205
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,360
I just want you to

206
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,160
help me drop the idea forever.

207
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Sorry.

208
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
I really don't remember anything.

209
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,520
Yes,

210
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,520
you've forgotten everything.

211
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,600
Miss Jiang,

212
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
there's no way I can remember my past.

213
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,880
For me,

214
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
what matters is the present.

215
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,560
Let's not talk about the past

216
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
but the present.

217
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,800
Will you start again with me?

218
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,640
I've never thought about that.

219
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
People are all gossiping about us.

220
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,080
You must consider it.

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
You're not forcing me

222
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,320
but yourself.

223
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Yes.

224
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm forcing myself.

225
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
Because I don't want to stupidly

226
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,480
wait for you like I did before.

227
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,400
At least I'm trying.

228
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,680
How about you?

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,400
Will you try just for once?

230
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,800
Welcome.

231
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,360
Go on in, please.

232
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,920
The main feature of this perfume shop

233
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
is its various linear fragrances.

234
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
They don't have top, middle and base notes.

235
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
Some even don't have a fragrance,

236
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,720
such as this one.

237
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,400
Its name is Tears.

238
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,520
Try it.

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,280
What smell can tears have?

240
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,080
What do you think?

241
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,920
Is there a salty and sour smell

242
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,480
that makes you wanna cry?

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,840
I have no interest in it.

244
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,520
I'll never cry.

245
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
Try this, too.

246
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,360
Its name is Storm.

247
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,520
What do you think?

248
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
Is there a strong

249
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
smell of damp

250
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
that reminds you of a stormy night?

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,560
Xiaoqi.

252
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,320
Xiaoqi.

253
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,920
Xiaoqi!

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,200
You were in a trance.

255
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,080
I may be too

256
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,160
sleepy today.

257
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,280
You're being so strange.

258
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,280
Answer me.

259
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
What did you do last night?

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
I went to meet Fang Leng

261
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,120
to take something back.

262
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,840
But I think I may never get it back.

263
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
What did he take from you?

264
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,400
Is it

265
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
your heart?

266
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
If my brother is in a relationship,

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
will you be sad?

268
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
Why will I be sad?

269
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,480
He has a heart of stone.

270
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,120
I'll thank goodness if he has his eye on someone else.

271
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,200
I meant it.

272
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,160
I can't wait to hear that.

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,880
You can only cheat yourself.

274
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I didn't cheat you.

275
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm telling the truth.

276
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,880
Even if he stands

277
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
naked in front of me now,

278
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,040
I won't paw at him.

279
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,120
You know that's not

280
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
how I behaved towards men on earth before.

281
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
Although I said I didn't like them,

282
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
my hands

283
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,360
would give me away.

284
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,720
I'm not lying.

285
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,400
I'm resistant to

286
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,840
everything about him now.

287
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,280
Well,

288
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,560
how will you behave towards me?

289
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,840
As for you,

290
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
I've restrained myself for a long time.

291
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,280
I was wrong.

292
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,480
I was wrong. I was wrong.

293
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,360
I was wrong.

294
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,080
I was wrong. I was wrong.

295
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Now you believe me, don't you?

296
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,400
Yes. Yes.

297
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,960
I believe you.

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm going home, then.

299
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:17,920
Hey.

300
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
It all depends.

301
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,640
Temporarily we're not going to get married.

302
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,040
I hope you'll give us more space...

303
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,120
Well,

304
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,320
I suddenly remembered that...

305
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,480
well...

306
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,040
Jiang Xue announced her relationship.

307
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,480
you need to go to another place with me later.

308
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,160
It's the Sales Department of our company.

309
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Let's go and check out those best-selling perfumes.

310
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
What's going on?

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Why are you so busy today?

312
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,120
I...

313
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,440
What on earth is going on?

314
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,240
Tell me.

315
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
Can't I turn over a new leaf?

316
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,880
I've made up my mind to

317
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,240
develop a super good product with you.

318
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
I'll change my brother's opinion of you.

319
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,640
I'll let him know

320
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,760
what an excellent woman he has missed.

321
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,040
I don't care what he thinks of me.

322
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm quite happy now, anyway.

323
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,360
Do you remember...

324
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
How about you helping me become

325
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,160
an excellent man?

326
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,680
Mr. Fang,

327
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,440
is everything alright?

328
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Assistant Han,

329
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,160
can you find my earliest

330
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,440
memory of Jiang Xue?

331
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,800
Probably

332
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,240
it is your blind date with her.

333
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
Your memory bank

334
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,880
wasn't established until

335
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,720
you entered the company, after all.

336
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,480
What's that?

337
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,200
That's what you and Xiaoqi

338
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,480
left at the mall yesterday.

339
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,280
Let go of me.

340
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,800
You ruthless earthling.

341
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,560
I order that you take me to

342
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
my dear Xiaoqi now.

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,680
I really can't understand what that woman

344
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,640
always takes a tortoise with her for.

345
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
Is she a fortune-teller?

346
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,520
None of your business.

347
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
Lower animal on earth.

348
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,200
You can't even hear me swearing at you.

349
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,400
Mr. Fang,

350
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,400
that's Xiaoqi's pet.

351
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,320
We'd better return it to her as quickly as possible.

352
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,920
These are the most important sales analyses

353
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
of F Group over the years.

354
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,160
Fang Lie,

355
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,880
you value me too much, don't you?

356
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,000
I must value you.

357
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,360
You'd better not go out

358
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,240
over the next few days.

359
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,280
Don't

360
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
surf the Internet,

361
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,840
watch TV

362
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,280
or read the newspapers.

363
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,160
Studying hard is the serious business.

364
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,520
Okay.

365
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,720
It'll depend on your comprehension

366
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,880
whether our product can steadily

367
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,560
and accurately seize the market.

368
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
That seems very important.

369
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,880
Allow me.

370
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
What are you doing here, Leng?

371
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,160
Why are you staring at me?

372
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
That's scary.

373
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm the one who should be scared.

374
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,040
You made me take a drug

375
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,960
and then made a pass at my brother.

376
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
What on earth do you want to do?

377
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,360
Can you make it clear?

378
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,080
Don't always beset me.

379
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,000
You're the one who's besetting her,

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,400
Leng.

381
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,280
Do you have no idea

382
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
what you've done?

383
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
How did I beset her?

384
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,880
You...

385
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,400
Well,

386
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,720
he's...

387
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,200
he's not right in the head.

388
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Can you stop quarreling?

389
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,680
Go home.

390
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,720
I'll help you out.

391
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,240
Okay.

392
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Stay here.

393
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,440
Make it clear to me.

394
00:15:59,520 --> 00:15:59,960
Leng,

395
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
must you rub salt in her wound?

396
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
Do you think you haven't hurt her enough?

397
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,600
Oh dear,

398
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,440
he...

399
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,840
he's not

400
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
right in the head.

401
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Don't quarrel.

402
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,280
Don't quarrel.

403
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,240
I... I'll...

404
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,720
Okay.

405
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,800
Go home.

406
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,400
Bye.

407
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,680
Leng, you know something?

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
I only did one thing today.

409
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,400
I tried my best to prevent Xiaoqi from knowing

410
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,960
gossip about you and Jiang Xue.

411
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,840
Can you stop

412
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,480
making us suffer?

413
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,600
Xiaoqi,

414
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
you're finally back.

415
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,960
I've been worried sick.

416
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,480
Why did you worry about me?

417
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,640
Oh dear,

418
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,400
when you young people are dumped,

419
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,160
you can be extremely reckless.

420
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,280
Could I not worry?

421
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm dumped?

422
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,640
How come?

423
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,840
You haven't known it yet?

424
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,720
What?

425
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,240
Come, come, come.

426
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,720
No one can give you

427
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,120
feelings of security except yourself.

428
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,400
I don't care what's your relationship with Jiang Xue.

429
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,320
If you're back together,

430
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,680
then please

431
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,040
stay away from Xiaoqi.

432
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,440
We're back together?

433
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,360
You know we were once together?

434
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,200
I don't want to

435
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,400
talk about the past.

436
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,240
Don't go too far.

437
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,600
You dumped all of your girlfriends

438
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,440
when you were fed up with them.

439
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
You can't hurt all these

440
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,680
stupid women just because

441
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,840
you're a jerk, can you?

442
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,160
You know I met Jiang Xue

443
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,400
when I was a student.

444
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,000
So what?

445
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
You think you can travel back to the past?

446
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,760
Jiang Xue and I

447
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,240
are not in a relationship.

448
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
News about you is flying around now.

449
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,320
You're still flirting with her?

450
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,800
Awesome.

451
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,360
You are really good.

452
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,840
You don't take the initiative.

453
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,880
You never refuse.

454
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,800
You assume no responsibilities.

455
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Those women were so unlucky

456
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,720
when they met you.

457
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,760
Are you being so angry

458
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
because of Xiaoqi?

459
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
Confirmed their relationship.

460
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,080
I can't believe this.

461
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
That bastard.

462
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,240
He slept with me yesterday

463
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,400
and today he confirms his relationship

464
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,240
with another woman.

465
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
Calm down.

466
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,000
I think what you need to do now

467
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,280
is to have a good talk with him

468
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,680
and make things clear.

469
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,440
When you're dating someone,

470
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,880
you always need to talk.

471
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,320
Yes, that's true.

472
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,120
I can't stand you hurting her.

473
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,560
I see what you mean.

474
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,480
Perhaps Xiaoqi and I were in love before

475
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,560
but I've completely forgotten

476
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,520
my feelings for her.

477
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:51,920
Tell me

478
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,640
how I should handle it so as not to hurt her.

479
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,200
I don't need you to do anything

480
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
except answering this question.

481
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:00,960
Go on.

482
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
Will you love Xiaoqi?

483
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
If she tries hard to be close to you

484
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,240
and never stops loving you,

485
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,360
will you love her back?

486
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,760
What's up,

487
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,240
Leng?

488
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,640
Leng.

489
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
You are an unscrupulous businessman.

490
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Fang Leng!

491
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,880
Here's your takeaway, Mr. Fang.

492
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm cold.

493
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,000
Can you hug me?

494
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,600
I won't be cold if you hug me.

495
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,720
You've always wanted an answer, haven't you?

496
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,680
Listen carefully, then.

497
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,040
I don't love her anymore.

498
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,560
Take her away

499
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,320
if you want.

500
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,680
Okay.

501
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,840
Good.

502
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,600
I'll remember what you said today.

503
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
If you regret it in the future,

504
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,200
I won't be nice to you.

505
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,280
Xiaoqi,

506
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,480
you came back so quickly.

507
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,440
How was your talk?

508
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
Xiaoqi!

509
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,560
What's up, Xiaoqi?

510
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,760
I'm leaking.

511
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,480
What?

512
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,080
Something is leaking.

513
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,720
Don't spoil

514
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,080
my new furniture.

515
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,160
Wait a moment.

516
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,520
I'll be right there with tools.

517
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,840
What should I do?

518
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm breaking down. I'm leaking.

519
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,720
Xiaoqi.

520
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,160
Calm down, Xiaoqi.

521
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,080
You're not leaking.

522
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,800
They're tears.

523
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,520
Tears?

524
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,960
Yes.

525
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,280
Stupid girl.

526
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,320
Oh, no. I'm breaking down.

527
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,520
What's leaking?

528
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,040
What's leaking? What's leaking?

529
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,040
What's leaking?

530
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,400
What is it?

531
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,520
What's leaking?

532
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,200
I am.

533
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,720
Oh dear.

534
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,200
Why are you crying, Xiaoqi?

535
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,200
Keep crying.

536
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,680
You'll feel better after you cry,

537
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,400
won't you?

538
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
No.

539
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,760
It's full of the smell of tears here.

540
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,680
The smell of tears?

541
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,800
What smell can tears have?

542
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,240
The sour smell that will irritate your nose.

543
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,920
Why am I doing such a

544
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
debased and shameful thing?

545
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,760
For girls, crying is

546
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,560
nothing to be ashamed of.

547
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,520
You should cry

548
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,480
and it'd best

549
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
if you cry in front of Fang Leng.

550
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,320
Only then

551
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,120
will he be sorry for hurting you.

552
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,120
No.

553
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,960
I can't cry in front of him.

554
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,120
I am

555
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,800
Giliska Qiusuo laka laka No. 7.

556
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,160
If I go on like this,

557
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll degenerate into a fish.

558
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,200
Fish?

559
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
Why would a fish cry?

560
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
Fish won't cry in the water.

561
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
Fish in the water.

562
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
Xiaoqi, have some warm milk.

563
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Heavens!

564
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,960
Xiaoqi!

565
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,040
Are you all right, Xiaoqi?

566
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,720
Xiaoqi! Xiaoqi!

567
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,520
What's the matter with you, Xiaoqi?

568
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,080
-Ms. Chai. -Xiaoqi!

569
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm sick. Ms. Chai.

570
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,240
You're not dead?

571
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,960
You're alive.

572
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm curing myself.

573
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,080
Curing yourself?

574
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,960
What for?

575
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
I keep crying.

576
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm running out of water.

577
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,840
If I immerse myself for a while,

578
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,880
perhaps I can be well again.

579
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,800
No!

580
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,080
You can't do that.

581
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Were you...

582
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,880
Were you so angry

583
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,000
that you damaged your brain?

584
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,320
Ms. Chai.

585
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
It's my fault.

586
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,960
It's my fault.

587
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,960
I shouldn't have encouraged you

588
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,560
to chase after Fang Leng.

589
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,600
I shouldn't have made you think that

590
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
you could marry into a rich family.

591
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,200
What happened to Cinderella

592
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,720
won't become a reality.

593
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,240
It's all my fault, Xiaoqi.

594
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm to blame. I promise you.

595
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,880
You don't have to repay the money you owe me anymore,

596
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,440
okay?

597
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,000
I just need you to be alive.

598
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,040
Did you hear me, Xiaoqi?

599
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,840
Ms. Chai, I won't immerse myself again.

600
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,240
Don't be sad.

601
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,320
Are human's tears infectious?

602
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
Ms. Chai, I won't immerse myself again.

603
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Good girl.

604
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,880
Be a good girl.

605
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,200
Don't worry.

606
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm not that vulnerable.

607
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
He doesn't love me anymore

608
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,160
but I don't love him either.

609
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,360
He made me cry today.

610
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,640
I'll make him bleed tomorrow.

611
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm super good.

612
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes, don't forget

613
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,880
our watchword.

614
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,920
Keep fighting.

615
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,480
Keep fighting.

616
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,160
Oh dear, I was frightened to death.

617
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,880
Get up quickly.

618
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
I'll help you

619
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,000
dry your hair.

620
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,920
If she tries hard to be close to you

621
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,480
and never stops loving you,

622
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
will you love her back?

623
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,760
I don't love her anymore.

624
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,240
Take her away

625
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,880
if you want.

626
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,640
Xiaoqi,

627
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,080
are you okay?

628
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,680
I'm not okay.

629
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,480
I can't stop crying.

630
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
Help me search for a cure, can you?

631
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,080
Is there a way

632
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,760
to force my tears back?

633
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,440
I have searched for it.

634
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,840
There have never been cases of crying on our planet.

635
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,520
Just like earthlings won't breathe out fire.

636
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
It's a symptom of something.

637
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
Fang Leng seems

638
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
a bit dangerous for you.

639
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,400
Why don't we think of another way to go back to our planet?

640
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,920
No. Why should I?

641
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,720
Why should I be thrown away

642
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,840
like an object?

643
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,240
I must see him.

644
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
He has to apologize to me.

645
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,560
Cancel this afternoon's meeting.

646
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,240
I need to rest.

647
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes.

648
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,560
But the chairman asked you

649
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,200
to see him tonight.

650
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,400
Shall I arrange it for another time?

651
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,760
No.

652
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,720
I'll go.

653
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,560
Stop. Stop.

654
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,680
Fang Leng.

655
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,400
-Fang Leng. -Miss!

656
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,120
Fang Leng!

657
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,920
Fang Leng, get out of the car.

658
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,160
-Fang Leng! -Ignore her.

659
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,240
Where are you going?

660
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,320
Fang Leng, get out of the car!

661
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,240
Where are you going?

662
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,840
Miss.

663
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Fang Leng.

664
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,360
Miss!

665
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,200
Don't go, Fang Leng.

666
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:32,840
Fang Leng!

667
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,360
Miss.

668
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,000
Don't touch me.

669
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,040
Let go of me!

670
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,280
Fang Leng!

671
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,880
Are you crazy?

672
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,560
Do you know it was dangerous?

673
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,160
Why?

674
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,200
You worried about me?

675
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,960
Of course.

676
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,840
Of course I had to worry.

677
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,040
If I had hit you just now,

678
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
I would have had to spend some time dealing with it.

679
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:56,960
You...

680
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,680
you think I enjoy plaguing you?

681
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,080
We have been over.

682
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120
What did you stop me for, then?

683
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,800
I...

684
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm here to congratulate you.

685
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,480
Congratulate me?

686
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,600
Yes,

687
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,640
you found such a good girlfriend.

688
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,720
I wish you an everlasting marriage.

689
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,600
I wish you a sweet life.

690
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,040
Got it.

691
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,560
Is there anything else?

692
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,720
I...

693
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,440
Don't look at me like that.

694
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,520
Do you still like me?

695
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,000
Of course not.

696
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,000
That would be the best.

697
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,720
Listen,

698
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
we're not the same kind of person.

699
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,000
So

700
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,120
we'd better not be linked with each other.

701
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,600
That will do both of us good.

702
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,320
Do you understand?

703
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,280
Answer me.

704
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,520
Yes.

705
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,280
You'd better remember what you said.

706
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,480
Don't bother me again.

707
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,160
We're over.

708
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,080
I'm not angry.

709
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
I'm not angry at all.

710
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,040
I'm not angry at all.

711
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,480
I'm happy.

712
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm especially happy.

713
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,040
I wish you happiness.

714
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,680
Why should I?

715
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,560
You think you can walk away

716
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,160
after kissing and hugging me?

717
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,160
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

718
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,240
You'll lose if you cry, Chai Xiaoqi.

719
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,160
Don't cry. Don't cry.

720
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,920
Restrain yourself.

721
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,000
There are ghosts here!

722
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,160
Where? Where?

723
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,720
There's nothing here.

724
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,560
What's going on?

725
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,360
What's going on?

726
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,240
What...

727
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,520
what's wrong with me?

728
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,200
What...

729
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,560
what's wrong with me?

730
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,360
Ghosts!

731
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,480
There are ghosts here!

732
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
Wonderful.

733
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,680
Come. Sit.

734
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,480
I've read the news.

735
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,920
You did the right thing.

736
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Fang Leng,

737
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,920
you've indulged yourself for long.

738
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
It's time you married a good woman

739
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,880
and settled down.

740
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,200
You've split up with that delivery person, haven't you?

741
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,680
Yes.

742
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,360
Good.

743
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,560
You can offend a gentleman but you should never offend a rat.

744
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,280
When people like them are pissed off,

745
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,040
you have no idea what they'll do.

746
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,360
Xiaoqi won't be like that.

747
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,280
Okay.

748
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,800
I mean

749
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,320
we've talked things over.

750
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,360
She won't be so unreasonable.

751
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,840
Okay.

752
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,840
Have you minded the way you spoke to her?

753
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,240
She's a patient.

754
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
Don't make her condition worse.

755
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I'll be careful.

756
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,720
Has she recovered?

757
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,600
We have broken up.

758
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,400
That concerns her privacy.

759
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,880
I think

760
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,720
there's no need to discuss it.

761
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,800
Okay.

762
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,720
Let's stop talking about a past event.

763
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,240
What we care most is Xue.

764
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,440
When are you going to settle down with her?

765
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,000
Dad,

766
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,520
it's a personal matter.

767
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,800
Don't worry about it.

768
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,640
Xue is not like those women you dated before.

769
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,240
She's not someone to be trifled with.

770
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
Now that she has committed herself in front of the media,

771
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,040
you should settle down as quickly as possible.

772
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,760
Dad.

773
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm tired.

774
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll have a rest now.

775
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,080
What's up, sister?

776
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,840
Something is definitely wrong with Fang Leng and Chai Xiaoqi.

777
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,480
Your guess is very likely to be true.

778
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,800
The key to disclosing

779
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,720
Fang Leng's lie

780
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,520
is Chai Xiaoqi.

781
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,760
Sister,

782
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,840
don't worry.

783
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,280
Let's pry into it first.

784
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,800
As long as we find out his secret,

785
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,760
the truth will be disclosed soon.

786
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,800
Okay.

787
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
What do you mean?

788
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,080
I have considered it.

789
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,480
Everything has

790
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,960
changed now.

791
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,960
I don't want to be with you again

792
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,880
just to make amends to you.

793
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,280
Why?

794
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,840
I'm sorry that

795
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I lost my memories of you.

796
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,000
But people won't lose their feelings about someone.

797
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
I only appreciate you.

798
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,680
I don't want to hurt you again.

799
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
What if I'm not

800
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,000
afraid of being hurt?

801
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
Even if you have no feelings for me now,

802
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,760
you said

803
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,800
you appreciated me.

804
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,520
That means I still have chances,

805
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,640
doesn't it?

806
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,200
Actually you've guessed it, right?

807
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,880
What have I guessed?

808
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,960
You know I'm a businessman.

809
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,080
Whatever I'm doing do,

810
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,880
my sense always

811
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,400
triumph over my sensibility.

812
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,520
You also know I need a woman

813
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,880
who's my equal

814
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,880
so you made our relationship public.

815
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,520
You think I won't act against my interests

816
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,280
and push you away.

817
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,320
Did I guess wrong?

818
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,240
You guessed right.

819
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,280
But I really don't want to take advantage of you.

820
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,280
Fang Leng.

821
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,880
You know something?

822
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,720
Over the years,

823
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,680
I've never thought I have broken up with you.

824
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,640
You lost your memories.

825
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
You owe me an apology.

826
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,560
Just...

827
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,080
just to make me give up forever,

828
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,800
will you try for once?

829
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,760
Jiang Xue,

830
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,440
what's the point of being so persistent?

831
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,840
I promise.

832
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,360
If it doesn't work out after you try,

833
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,720
I'll stop fastening on you.

834
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,960
Is that okay?

835
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,800
Xiaoqi is still not back.

836
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,520
Has something happened to her?

837
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,160
When did you come in?

838
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
I've been waiting for you here.

839
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,760
Why didn't I see you come in?

840
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,320
Why...

841
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,520
why am I back?

842
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,480
Xiaoqi,

843
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,400
Are you badly hurt

844
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
after being dumped?

845
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,920
Listen,

846
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
you must cheer up.

847
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,040
Tell me.

848
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,560
Did you see Fang Leng today?

849
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,480
My goodness,

850
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,760
it's on fire!

851
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,440
It's on fire! It's on fire!

852
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,120
It's on fire! Help!

853
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,400
It's on fire!

854
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,600
Help!

855
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,720
What do I do?

856
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,040
Sorry.

857
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,560
What's wrong with me?

858
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,920
Kubri,

859
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,400
quickly, save me.

860
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,560
What happened? You're so anxious.

861
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,240
I have no idea.

862
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,680
My super power has run wild.

863
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,040
I can't control them.

864
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,800
Look!

865
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Isn't that normal?

866
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,760
No.

867
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,520
It's burning downstairs because of me.

868
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,760
Calm down.

869
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,120
Tell me the specific symptoms.

870
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,520
I will

871
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,160
suddenly disappear

872
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,920
and I keep discharging.

873
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,680
Are they regular?

874
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
I don't know.

875
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,160
I'll discharge again later.

876
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,360
Xiaoqi,

877
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,200
are you having hallucinations?

878
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,000
What should I do so that you'll believe me?

879
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,300
=Fang Lie=

880
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,560
Hello.

881
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,480
Xiaoqi,

882
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,920
what's wrong with you?

883
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,120
Why are you absent from work?

884
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:25,920
I...

885
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,520
I didn't mean to do that.

886
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,200
I know.

887
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,600
You did it on purpose.

888
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,920
I gotta handle something.

889
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,520
I'll hang up now.

890
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll explain it to you later.

891
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,600
Don't... don't hang up yet.

892
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,400
Ms. Chai has told me.

893
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,760
I'm calling to straighten you out.

894
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Xiaoqi, you must know that

895
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,560
except love,

896
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,560
people also have jobs.

897
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,600
Do you know the difference

898
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,400
between the rich and the poor when they're dumped?

899
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,880
No.

900
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,200
The answer is simple.

901
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,400
When poor people are dumped,

902
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,640
they can't even afford makeup

903
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,120
that won't be damaged when they cry.

904
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,480
I'm not dumped.

905
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,280
If someone is dumped,

906
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,280
that will be Fang Leng...

907
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:01,720
Hello?

908
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,640
Xiaoqi.

909
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,720
Xiaoqi!

910
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,440
Xiaoqi,

911
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,640
you didn't cheat me.

912
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,040
Is it because I said his name?

913
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
Xiaoqi,

914
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,600
weren't you home?

915
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,360
Hi. Well,

916
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,360
I've been here for a long time.

917
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,080
Oh,

918
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,760
I see.

919
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,040
You deliberately talked with me

920
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,960
on the other side of the wall.

921
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,640
Don't be so romantic again.

922
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,040
I have been worrying about you.

923
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,360
I heard today you and my brother...

924
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,040
Don't mention your brother!

925
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,160
Oh, my goodness.

926
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,600
I find that your brother

927
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,040
is my spell now.

928
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,000
Don't mention him.

929
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,720
What's going on?

930
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,360
Quickly.

931
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,400
Find a rope

932
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,560
and tie me up.

933
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,080
Otherwise,

934
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,840
something horrible will happen later.

935
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,640
Go now!

936
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:03,960
Oh dear,

937
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,160
stop talking nonsense.

938
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,640
Go now.

939
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,920
I know you're sad now.

940
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,280
Quickly.

941
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,720
No matter what happens,

942
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,600
I'll handle it with you.

943
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,480
You can't handle it.

944
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,560
Why?

945
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,000
Only my brother can?

946
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,800
Don't mention your brother!

947
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,640
Oh, no.

948
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,400
Hello,

949
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,720
ask the Electricity Department to come here.

950
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,760
Hello?

951
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:32,960
Hello?

952
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,280
I'm sacred.

953
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,640
I'm scared.

954
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,240
Xiaoqi,

955
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,320
don't be scared.

956
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,280
I'll protect you even if

957
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,640
a frightening monster turns up.

958
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,120
If one day

959
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,320
you find that I'm also a frightening monster,

960
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,160
will you be afraid?

961
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,040
Even if you're a monster,

962
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
you'll be an adorable one.

963
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,240
I'll only want to protect you.

964
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,280
Stop imagining things.

965
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,720
Come. Walk by my side.

966
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,560
Look!

967
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,120
They stop flickering.

968
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,600
Let's go.

969
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,640
I'll take you home.

970
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,640
Okay.

971
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,400
Okay.

972
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:37,920
Wow.

973
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,440
I could comfort her

974
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,920
when she immersed herself in the bathtub.

975
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,000
But I can't see her when she's at work,

976
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,600
take care of her.

977
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,160
Got it.

978
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
If she does stupid things again,

979
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,040
let me know immediately.

980
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,200
What are you doing?

981
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,640
Aren't you super daring?

982
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,320
You tried to kill yourself in the bathtub.

983
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,240
What do you cover your head for?

984
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,560
I'm afraid I'll become something and scare you.

985
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,960
Stop pretending that you're a snake.

986
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,520
Being dumped is no big deal.

987
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
Just cry and let it go.

988
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,400
Leaving my brother

989
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
will save you from an abyss of misery.

990
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,240
Don't mention your brother.

991
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,160
I'll tremble all over once you do that.

992
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,600
I can't control myself.

993
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,880
Okay, okay. I won't mention him.

994
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,920
If I don't talk about him,

995
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,320
can you stop yourself from thinking about him?

996
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,160
Of course I can.

997
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,560
I can.

998
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,000
Good.

999
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,720
I just want to help you feel better.

1000
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,640
Have a good sleep.

1001
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,640
Nothing should stop

1002
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,560
us from sleeping.

1003
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,520
Okay.

1004
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,160
I'm off, then?

1005
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,120
It was me.

1006
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,720
I asked you not to touch her.

1007
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,240
After the rain stops,

1008
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
let's be together at ease.

1009
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,960
What are you doing here?

1010
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,640
I brought you breakfast.

1011
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,240
I hear you suffer from a weak stomach

1012
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,920
so I specially made porridge for you.

1013
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,360
You don't need to do this.

1014
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,760
Why not?

1015
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,520
People say I'm your girlfriend.

1016
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,560
I'll clean things up first.

1017
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,080
That's not necessary.

1018
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,420
Ever since I met you,

1019
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,100
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

1020
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,500
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

1021
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,380
only you.

1022
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,580
We're out of reach

1023
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,900
but appreciate each other.

1024
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,700
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

1025
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,740
The yearning invades

1026
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,300
and lurks in my mind.

1027
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:44,860
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

1028
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,940
I'm getting addicted to it

1029
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,260
and my sense is shielded.

1030
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:59,060
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

1031
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,220
Put the hottest heart

1032
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,540
in this cold body.

1033
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,900
I'm looking at you,

1034
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,060
and my love has nowhere to go.

1035
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,300
Ever since I met you,

1036
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,220
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

1037
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,500
Every day is a new memory

1038
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,540
which is only be about you and me.

1039
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,780
I can't lie to myself anymore.

1040
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,620
Please give me the courage to believe.

1041
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,540
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

1042
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,460
only you.

1043
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,580
Even everything becomes silent,

1044
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,700
I still have you.
