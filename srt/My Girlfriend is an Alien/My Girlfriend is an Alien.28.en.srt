My Girlfriend is an Alien

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,240
Xiaoqi.

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,600
Hmm?

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,560
Get me that...

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Why are you so nervous?

7
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm just cooking.

8
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
Why are you holding a fire extinguisher?

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,360
Don't you remember?

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,240
The last time we were here,

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
we burnt this whole place.

12
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
I've begged Ms. Chai for so long

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,060
that she finally agreed to lend us the kitchen.

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,680
A fire extinguisher?

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,760
A fire extinguisher?

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,880
What is a fire extinguisher?

17
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,600
Are you a fool?

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Let me tell you,

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,360
don't worry.

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,000
I will never let you help me cook.

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,160
Seriously.

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,920
Humph!

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
Put that away.

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,400
What are you doing?

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,120
It smells so good!

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,320
Really good!

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,240
Can I have a bite?

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,200
No.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,080
Just one bite.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,200
Xiaoqi!

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Just a bite.

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Aha!

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,600
Hey.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
Your body is weak.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,080
This is too much heat for you.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,080
Jingle jingle!

37
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
What's this?

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
it tastes good?

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,480
Where did you buy this?

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
I made this.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
When I was studying abroad,

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,880
I wasn't used to eat the food there.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,120
So I had to cook myself.

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,480
I learned how to make this, too.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,440
Jesus!

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,920
You have so many different skills!

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
It's true.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,040
You are good at working and cooking.

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
Since you cooked so many great stuff,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,320
I gotta try some, right?

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
No!

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,760
You really want to eat?

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
Ok, then promise me.

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,440
You must come back next time.

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
I'll cook for you myself.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,680
Really?

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,040
I'll come back no matter how far I am,

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
just for a bite of your food.

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,280
Pull-hook.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Do this with me.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,560
Bend your finger.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Like this.

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
Make a little heart.

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
Why are they so slow?

65
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,760
I'm gonna check it out.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Hmm.

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
Doctor Zhang,

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,640
so here's just us.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
I have something

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
to ask you.

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm listening.

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Where is Xiaoqi's hometown exactly?

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,520
Why I feel like it's about life and death

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,920
every time we send her home.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
You're right.

76
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
I feel strange about this, too.

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
Xiaoqi is a bit weird.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,320
You think so, right?

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,680
Yes.

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,880
Let me tell you,

81
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
she's a thin little girl.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,240
But she can carry a bag of rice with one shoulder.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,840
And there was one time

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,200
that I almost fell from upstairs,

85
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
But she was in the kitchen that time,

86
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,280
she suddenly pulled me up.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,720
I think

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,600
this is a little strange.

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
I feel like you may explain it

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
since you are a doctor?

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,120
Alas.

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,760
I think she's not common people

93
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,240
since she can tame Fang Leng.

94
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Here, have a drink.

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,160
Okay.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,200
That makes sense.

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,920
Food's ready!

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
You are finally here.

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,640
It's not like everyday I can taste Mr. Fang's cooking.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,640
Lucky me.

101
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Thank you, thank you.

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
Let's eat!

103
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,440
Wait a second.

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
Let me sterilize first.

105
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
why sterilize?

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
Wait a second.

107
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Let me take you a photo.

108
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
And you.

109
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,320
And Ms. Chai.

110
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,230
So cute.

111
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,280
And you.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,320
Why are you so boring?

113
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
Just eat, ok?

114
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,200
I can be more boring.

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,640
Come here.

116
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,560
Come here!

117
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,440
Come here!

118
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,440
Hurry up!

119
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,880
Like this.

120
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Try this.

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Try this!

122
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
It's so boring. Alas.

123
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,320
Smile.

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,080
Smile a little bit!

125
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
Just once.

126
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
In three seconds.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,880
Here.

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
Three.

129
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
Two.

130
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
One.

131
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,400
You are not inviting us to have a meal.

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,120
You are inviting us to see your public display of affection.

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm enough already.

134
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
I wanna throw up.

135
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,520
Don't, don't.

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,480
Cheers!

137
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,920
Come on.

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,880
Come on.

139
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,370
= My dear Xiaoqi... =

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
What are you doing?

141
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm posting on moments for you.

142
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,520
= My dear Xiaoqi, I love you with no reasons. =
I'm posting on moments for you.

143
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,760
= My dear Xiaoqi, I love you with no reasons. =

144
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,840
I posted that picture on the moments!

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,800
Awesome!

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
Like it.

147
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,780
= Fang Lie: Awesome!   Doctor Zhang: Like it.   Xiaoqi: I'm shy. =

148
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,960
I found that

149
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,160
I don't have Mr. Fang's moments.

150
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,120
Really?

151
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,080
I can have your WeChat?

152
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,240
Oh my god.

153
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,200
I just have Mr. Fang's WeChat!

154
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,840
So wonderful, isn't it?

155
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,920
Let me delete it.

156
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
What are you doing?

157
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,280
Don't!

158
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,480
You promised to rebuild your memory bank.

159
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,120
Is there anything better that can show people

160
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,720
your love to me than posting on moments?

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,920
Give me that.

162
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
You're really gonna delete it?

163
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,890
= You're my cup of tea. Postscript: my account is not compromised. =

164
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
You posted another one?

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,520
You are good at it, bro.

166
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,640
Cheers!

168
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,560
Let's drink!

169
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Cheers!

170
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Let's eat.

171
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Let me have a bite.

172
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,160
Don't.

173
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
Just one bite.

174
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
No, not even one bite.

175
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,680
I wanna taste it.

176
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Fang Lie.

177
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
The spaceship's gonna pick me up

178
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
in a few days.

179
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,720
Before I go,

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,760
I have a little present for you.

181
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
No need.

182
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
You can bring another cute alien girl like you

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,480
next time you come back.

184
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
That's the perfect gift.

185
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,680
Only in your dream.

186
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I draw some sky maps.

187
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,760
These are some galaxies you can't see on earth.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,960
I hope these can bring your some inspirations.

189
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,480
Do you like it?

190
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,880
You really do know me, Xiaoqi.

191
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,160
I don't want you to leave even more.

192
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,280
What should I do?

193
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,800
Alright, alright.

194
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,520
Be good.

195
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,440
Hey!

196
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
Fang Lie, who allows you to hug Xiaoqi?

197
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,960
Brother,

198
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I only want her for a minute.

199
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,640
Just a minute.

200
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Alright.

201
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,360
It's time.

202
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,520
Xiaoqi,

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
thank you for this wonderful present.

204
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,800
I have a special gift for you, too.

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,720
Wait.

206
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
Alright, Fang Lie.

207
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,760
You are drunk,

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,640
just like Ms. Chai.

209
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Let's go. I'll send you home.

210
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,080
Wait.

211
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Take care.

212
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,750
I'll give you the gift tomorrow morning.

213
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,080
This way.

214
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Bye, Lielie.

215
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
Bye.

216
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
Wait for me!

217
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,320
Ok!

218
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,680
Where's my gift?

219
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,520
Your gift is upstairs. Let me fetch it for you.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,600
What are you doing?!

221
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
You are my present.

222
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Wait, let me get you the present!

223
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,640
Don't go.

224
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
Don't go, okay?

225
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,240
Don't go, no...

226
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,800
Don't go away.

227
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,080
Don't leave me.

228
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
Don't leave me, please.

229
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Don't go away.

230
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
- You can't leave. - I won't leave.

231
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,600
Don't be scared.

232
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
I won't leave.

233
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
I won't leave.

234
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,560
I won't go, I won't go.

235
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,160
Fang Leng.

236
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Don't go, okay?

237
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,080
I won't go, I won't go.

238
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
You're awake.

239
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Morning.

240
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Moring.

241
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,040
I wish I can see you

242
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
every morning when I wake up.

243
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Me too.

244
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,240
The spaceship...

245
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,640
It's coming, isn't it?

246
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,240
I've been thinking about it overnight.

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
I can stay.

248
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,520
No, you can't.

249
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,680
It's good if you can go home successfully.

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Are you hungry?

251
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,280
Let me get you some drinks.

252
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,160
No.

253
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,160
Don't.

254
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Hmm.

255
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Hmm.

256
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,960
What's wrong?

257
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,840
Don't push me away, okay?

258
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm very well-behaved.

259
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
I do as you told.

260
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,480
I eat as you said.

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Really?

262
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,720
Hmm.

263
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,440
Go and bring the milk in fridge here.

264
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,760
Hmm.

265
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,360
What's like

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
when the spaceship's coming?

267
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,320
First, there might be a wind.

268
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,840
Then, the spaceship may appear

269
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,400
Go.

270
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't push me away.

271
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
I might live well

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
even I don't use superpower later on.

273
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,080
Even if I can save you,

274
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,520
I can't keep you.

275
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
Why?

276
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
You don't like me?

277
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,960
Silly girl.

278
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,320
Why not?

279
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
There's an old saying goes,

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,640
I raise my eyes to the moon, bow heads and think of home.

281
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,720
But you are here all the time.

282
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,400
Every time you look at the sky,

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
you still think about your home.

284
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,000
The people there are your same kind.

285
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,120
Do you

286
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,320
want to stay here as an alien?

287
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,960
Go.

288
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,720
Bro!

289
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
Ask Xiaoqi to see!

290
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
This is my farewell gift for her.

291
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,560
Fang Lie, you scared me!

292
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
What's so scared about?

293
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
Just balloons.

294
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,040
How is it?

295
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,920
Do you like my present?

296
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,120
Why do you want to give me this?

297
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
I don't have anything good for you.

298
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,120
So I want to imitate that movie,

299
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,480
"Up."

300
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,800
Perhaps,

301
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,240
I can go to space with you.

302
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,400
I started to do this before dawn.

303
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,440
My hand turns red because of this.

304
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,560
Oh.

305
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,440
You are the one who made me have nightmare overnight.

306
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,680
What are you saying?

307
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,560
I come here for Xiaoqi, not you.

308
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,360
What do you think?

309
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,320
You are surprised by my gift, right?

310
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,000
I am surprised.

311
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Hello, security?

312
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,520
Call a cab.

313
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
For what?

314
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Come here.

315
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Bro, what are you doing?

316
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,320
I still have a bunch of balloons to blow.

317
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,360
- Ouch! - Get inside.

318
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,320
Sir.

319
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,760
Yes?

320
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,320
Take this man

321
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,280
to An Ding Mental Hospital.

322
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,920
No, I won't go.

323
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,320
Bro!

324
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
I...bro!

325
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
Isn't it appropriate

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,320
that you do this to him?

327
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm already very nice to him like this.

328
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,400
Actually,

329
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,840
I really like this present he gave me.

330
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,920
Because

331
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,720
it makes me figure out one thing.

332
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,960
What thing?

333
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,440
Didn't you ask me

334
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,440
whether I want to go homeland or alien land?

335
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,520
I want to tell you,

336
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
the place where you are

337
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
is my hometown.

338
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,120
Sir,

339
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,080
I'm not a psycho.

340
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,920
Have you ever seen such a handsome psycho?

341
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,600
Drive me home, please.

342
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,840
How much did he pay you?

343
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,840
I'll pay you double.

344
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
= Mom =

345
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,080
Fang Lie,

346
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,160
where are you?

347
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,600
Oh, mom!

348
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,640
You call in a right time.

349
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
Explain to the driver please.

350
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
Explain to him your son is a totally normal person.

351
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
You're normal?

352
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,480
Your uncle finally won the achievement for you.

353
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
But you gave all of this to Fang Leng.

354
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,360
Come back home at once!

355
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,470
Your uncle and I are waiting for you.

356
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,040
Oh my god! This dumb kid!

357
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm so pissed off.

358
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,040
Look at what you wrote here!

359
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,600
Ah?

360
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
These programs you were in charge of

361
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,690
made so much achievement for the company.

362
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,960
But you attributed all these to Fang Leng.

363
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
If it had not been for your uncle's help,

364
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,840
your CEO position

365
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
would already be replaced by others.

366
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,920
I only wrote down the facts.

367
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,200
What facts?

368
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
Fang Leng had not been in the company for so long.

369
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,600
How could he help you?

370
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,880
He has that all arranged.

371
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,360
Ever since I enter the company,

372
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
he has been helping me in secret.

373
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,200
Otherwise, how could a single commander like me

374
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
make so many achievements.

375
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Are you telling the truth?

376
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
These are not Fang Leng's evil tricks?

377
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,800
Why you always think that way?

378
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
No matter how I compete with my bro,

379
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
I can't risk the company!

380
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
If I didn't write these things

381
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,480
in the report,

382
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,760
nobody would know my brother's heart.

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,640
My dear son,

384
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,200
since nobody knows,

385
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,680
then we don't need to write down like this.

386
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,920
You will understand these things in the future.

387
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,280
Mom.

388
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
You are the one who doesn't understand.

389
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,240
People like my brother

390
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,600
can easily take the CEO position in any companies.

391
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,240
Then what about you?

392
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,520
If you leave your dad and the company,

393
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
what can you do?

394
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,640
I worry about this.

395
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Mom.

396
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,920
I applied for a painting studio in Paris.

397
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,840
Whether they accept me or not,

398
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,560
whether I'm going to do chores

399
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,040
or perform on streets,

400
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,280
I want to try it.

401
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,800
My dear son.

402
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,440
You haven't done enough?

403
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,480
Not enough.

404
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,440
One of my friend gave me a universe picture album.

405
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,680
Until then do I realize

406
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,320
how big the world is.

407
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,040
There are so many planets

408
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,760
as well as choices.

409
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,520
There are so many other companies,

410
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,840
besides our Group F.

411
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,040
Rather than staying at home

412
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,760
and fighting with my brother for this tiny place,

413
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,560
why can't I think bigger

414
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,080
and live more easily?

415
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,840
My dear son,

416
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm doing all this for you.

417
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,160
Mom.

418
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,960
You are not doing this for me.

419
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,840
Just because you want to win.

420
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm unhappy every day,

421
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,800
because I live as told.

422
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,800
Mom.

423
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,560
Uncle.

424
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
I beg you.

425
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,520
Please let me go.

426
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Please let my brother go.

427
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,000
And let yourselves go.

428
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,040
I'm gonna go, mom.

429
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm gonna go.

430
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,160
Lie.

431
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,840
Lie!

432
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,360
Eh...

433
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
What now?

434
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,560
Forget it.

435
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,840
Do as he told.

436
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,440
Give this to the board.

437
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,680
Alas...

438
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,560
How much things you bought.

439
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
What if the spaceship

440
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,960
can't take this much?

441
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,000
And cordyceps sinensis and others?

442
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
We don't get to eat it in my planet.

443
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,680
Just show off to your friends.

444
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,160
Do I need buy Maotai for uncle?

445
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,480
No need.

446
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,640
We are all cultivated by gene culture plates.

447
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,440
Plus, we don't have parents.

448
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,160
So, I don't need these.

449
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,000
Alright.

450
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,600
What about diamonds? Gold?

451
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,160
Take and give others as gifts.

452
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,160
I really hope that

453
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,360
they can let you come back sooner.

454
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,160
Will it work?

455
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,360
The point is to let them know my heart and kindness.

456
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,640
Humph.

457
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,760
Mr. Han.

458
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,640
Buy some gold and diamonds for me.

459
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,480
Don't!

460
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,200
Buy more.

461
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,320
I'll give them to Xiaoqi.

462
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,200
That's enough.

463
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,190
I want Xiaoqi to bring them to her planet.

464
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,360
No need!

465
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
Buy the whole store.

466
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,160
What are you doing?

467
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,160
That's enough.

468
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,000
What are you doing?

469
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,640
It's done.

470
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,640
How does the season in your planet?

471
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,360
In my hometown,

472
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,880
we have twelve seasons in a year.

473
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,840
There are Ming Soil

474
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,800
and Qi Water in spring.

475
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,960
In summer,

476
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,520
there are...

477
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,160
Alright!

478
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,280
Let's buy some clothes for you.

479
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
Nah.

480
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,880
We don't wear these clothes there.

481
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
Let's go! It's my way or the highway.

482
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,120
I don't need this, really!

483
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,560
How about this?

484
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,640
Sir, you have such a good taste.

485
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,600
This is our new arrival.

486
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,240
It's really suitable for this young.

487
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,560
Then take it.

488
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Alright, I'll pack this for you later.

489
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,200
Don't!

490
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,760
This one.

491
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Enough!

492
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,200
And this one.

493
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,040
- Enough! - Yes, sir.

494
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,160
No more.

495
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,720
This one.

496
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,360
Yes, sir.

497
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,440
Enough.

498
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
Leave those I have picked.

499
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,000
And pack all the other clothes in this store for me.

500
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,360
I can't wear all these stuff, these are too much.

501
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,960
Sir, are you sure you want to pack all of these?

502
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,880
I don't like to say the same thing again.

503
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
We will pack these for you right now.

504
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,200
What are you doing?

505
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
Are you out of your mind?

506
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,780
You bought me so many clothes.

507
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,560
You want me to wholesale in my planet?

508
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,200
Just let your friends see something new.

509
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,050
You can let your friends wear the clothes if you don't.

510
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,280
You really don't need to do this.

511
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,760
Alright, it's my way or the highway.

512
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,920
That's way too much, really.

513
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,120
Fold this for me.

514
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,920
Ok.

515
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,680
You see, this clothes...

516
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,240
we can't afford one with months' salary.

517
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,560
Stop it.

518
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,520
We have our own fate.

519
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm so jealous of that girl.

520
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,600
I'm going to take one more.

521
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,240
Ok.

522
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,360
I really can't wear too much clothes.

523
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,160
Why do you spend so much?

524
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,520
Take your time.

525
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,280
Let me ask them to sign bills.

526
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,120
Ok.

527
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,120
Such a waste.

528
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,400
Sir.

529
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,200
You need to sign it here.

530
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,000
Ok.

531
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,440
Sir.

532
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,000
You bought a lot of clothes.

533
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,400
How about I give you my business card?

534
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
So, I can let someone to send you these clothes.

535
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,320
You don't need!

536
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,520
We can carry these on our own.

537
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,120
We are so lucky that this gentleman likes our clothes.

538
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,240
When we have new arrivals,

539
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,800
then I can tell you.

540
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,160
Who need you tell?

541
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,480
If you have the courage to tell, you can try.

542
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,960
I'll crash this stupid store, believe or not?

543
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,920
What are you laughing at?

544
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Xiaoqi.

545
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,760
Alright.

546
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,840
Alas.

547
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
You may misunderstand me.

548
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
Misunderstand what?

549
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,200
I can even smell your hormones!

550
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,440
We won't buy the clothes anymore.

551
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,480
Excuse me.

552
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,560
Sir!

553
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
What are you doing?

554
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,960
What is it?

555
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,520
Come here.

556
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,960
Laugh? What the hell are you laughing at!

557
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,680
Nah.

558
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,820
It's not like everyday you get jealous because of me.

559
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,280
I'm so happy.

560
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
So happy about what?

561
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,160
I'm telling you this.

562
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,320
If you hanker after women and wine,

563
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,120
I... I will...

564
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
You... What are you gonna do?

565
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,280
I... I'm gonna curse you up there.

566
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,400
Have you heard about the Butterfly Effect?

567
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,880
That butterfly from Amazon

568
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,360
just flapped its wings a little bit.

569
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,520
Then the tornado was coming in Texas.

570
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:28,760
HuHu

571
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm gonna curse you up there.

572
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,080
Then, it might be snow or knives here.

573
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm telling you...

574
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,440
I know, I know.

575
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,200
Sometimes I wonder

576
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
what if you won't come back?

577
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Then you have to wait for my working hard,

578
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,320
then you can have someone else.

579
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,440
Nah, I'm not sure about it.

580
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,720
It depends.

581
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,000
Again? You are so annoying!

582
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,160
Do you remember

583
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,840
that we have once met here?

584
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,600
This is where we...

585
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm so sorry.

586
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,720
It's ok.

587
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,600
Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

588
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,160
- It's fine, it's fine. - I'm so sorry.

589
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,560
You just leave.

590
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,600
What about me?

591
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
What am I gonna do?

592
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,520
Xiaoqi.

593
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,160
What am I gonna do? Xiaoqi.

594
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
What should I do in the rest of my life?

595
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,640
We said that we would look up at the stars together.

596
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
You just leave?

597
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
What am I gonna do?

598
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,960
Can you bring her back?

599
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,240
I beg you.

600
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,440
We are reporting for you.

601
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,040
Group F's CEO Mr. Fang,

602
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,240
who was known as a womanizer,

603
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,200
has gone back to company today.

604
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,080
And the turmoil inside Group F

605
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,720
has calmed down.

606
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
According to an insider,

607
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
Fang Leng's amnesia has been cured.

608
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,040
He's now in charge of everything of the company.

609
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,360
According to reliable resources,

610
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,200
Fang Leng is about to invest beverage business

611
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
with low-calorie female drinks.

612
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,880
The theme is about scented tea.

613
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,000
It seems like the very experienced Mr. Fang

614
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,760
decides to take advantage of

615
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,720
his most familiar area.

616
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,480
How's it?

617
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,440
Hmm.

618
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,160
Nice.

619
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
Let's put Xiaobu in it.

620
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,640
Alright.

621
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
Nice job, bro!

622
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,980

= Two years later =

639
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,600
Dear media friends,

640
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,440
welcome to our product launch conference.

641
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,000
You my ask our Mr. Fang

642
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,360
all the questions about our new products.

643
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,520
Two years ago,

644
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
the Qi Tea you created becomes popular.

645
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
What's the purpose

646
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
of this tea's name?

647
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,560
Qi pronounces like "wife" in Chinese.

648
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,320
Qi Tea means

649
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,240
men make tea for women.

650
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,120
Mr. Fang,

651
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,080
you have "womanizer" as your nickname.

652
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
But these two years,

653
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,960
we haven't heard any love affairs about you.

654
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,120
Are you single right now?

655
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,160
Well, do you think I'm single now?

656
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,920
About this...

657
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,320
We're not sure.

658
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,720
Your last girlfriend

659
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,840
was a delivery girl.

660
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,680
This news made quite a stir once.

661
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
We wonder what relationship you two now are.

662
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,360
We...

663
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
We are good.

664
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,480
There are rumors that your delivery girlfriend dumped you.

665
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,400
Seem like it's fake?

666
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,040
You didn't break up,

667
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
but why we never see you're two together?

668
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Are you two married in secret?

669
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,840
Dear fellows,

670
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,720
it's not everyday that Mr. Fang's willing to

671
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,520
cooperate with us media.

672
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,360
In order to complete today's draft successfully,

673
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,840
please only ask questions

674
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,280
about the new product.

675
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,360
You guys are right.

676
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,040
I was dumped.

677
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
And that happened two years ago.

678
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,920
Now, I still can't move on.

679
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Dumped by that delivery girlfriend?

680
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,920
Why did she break up with you?

681
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,160
Will you want to get married

682
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,360
if you date someone now?

683
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,440
Do you have any questions for me?

684
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,640
Mr. Fang,

685
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,040
are you using this drink

686
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,440
to win back your ex girlfriend?

687
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,840
Yes.

688
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,040
You have asked me a question.

689
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,880
Can I ask you one?

690
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,040
Yes, please.

691
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,320
What's your name?

692
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,120
My name is Xiao Qi.

693
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
"Qi" from chess in Chinese.

694
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,920
Xiao Qi.

695
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,400
It's a good name.

696
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,520
Would you like to be my date?

697
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,440
Wow!

698
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,680
Big news! Take pictures now!

699
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,580
= 'How would you like to be my date?'

700
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,300
Womanizer showed himself again and flirted with young reporter =

701
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,440
Do we need public relations?

702
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
No.

703
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,600
Just leave it.

704
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,120
Xiaoqi's still not here?

705
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,560
It's weird.

706
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,360
Why is it thundering in day like this?

707
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
Perhaps, someone's cursing me up there.

708
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,800
Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?

709
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,840
The butterfly from Amazon

710
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,560
just flapped its wings a bit.

711
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
Then, it caused the tornado in Texas.

712
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,600
You see, if someone's cursing me up there.

713
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,840
It may not cause rain,

714
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,840
but snow, or knives.

715
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,800
How about...

716
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,120
I reject that girl?

717
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,880
Bro.

718
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
You should be so sorry for Xiaoqi!

719
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
Why is that?

720
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,400
If I hadn't stopped those reporters in the way,

721
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,520
you would have made a big mistake.

722
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,160
You get it?

723
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:35,880
Bro.

724
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
You have endured for two years.

725
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,120
How can you try to make mistakes

726
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,800
in this moment?

727
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,360
These might be two years for you,

728
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,600
but these are like two lifetimes for me.

729
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,920
How about I get that girl back?

730
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,120
You two can just chat, ok?

731
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,160
You don't need to.

732
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,400
I just wanted to

733
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,920
ask her to interview me exclusively.

734
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Ah?

735
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,040
Bro,

736
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,040
I know you are in so much pain.

737
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,920
In those years, Xiaoqi and I

738
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,280
have created several perfumes.

739
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,600
How about I give you those recipes?

740
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
You can introduce new products with them

741
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,960
or just make collections.

742
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,680
It's better if you have something to do,

743
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,800
than you always think too much yourself.

744
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,960
You'd better take care of yourself first.

745
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,120
This place

746
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,040
is the original land of our lavender essential oil.

747
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,240
That perfume created by Xiaoqi

748
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,960
mostly uses this flower scent.

749
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,570
In order to make sure of the good quality,

750
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,680
we used the newest extraction process.

751
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
= Fang Lie =

752
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,520
Excuse me. A second please.

753
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,080
What's up?

754
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,040
Bro,

755
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm leaving for Paris very soon.

756
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,600
I have something in my heart to tell you.

757
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,720
Can you talk now?

758
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,480
Say it.

759
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,280
I've thought about it.

760
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,960
You can't stay single forever.

761
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,720
If Xiaoqi doesn't come back,

762
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,480
I won't have a sister-in-law?

763
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Get to the point.

764
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,080
The point is

765
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,600
I've found a nice girl for you.

766
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,160
She's a bit younger than you.

767
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
And she works at the embassy,

768
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,360
a state-owned unit.

769
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,280
How about that?

770
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,600
Do you want a blind date?

771
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,360
Okay.

772
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,360
You just said yes?

773
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,280
You don't need to see any pictures?

774
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,360
No.

775
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,680
Bro,

776
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,320
you have changed so much!

777
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,090
You don't worry about Xiaoqi? She might gets jealous

778
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,440
and flies back to get you for this.

779
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,920
I do want her to come back,

780
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,560
if she has the ability.

781
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
This is agitating.

782
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,080
You are in the perfume original land, right?

783
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Luckily,

784
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,880
the girl's not far away from you.

785
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,080
You go prepare yourself.

786
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,880
Meet her in a bit.

787
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,680
Hmm, alright.

788
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,120
Professor,

789
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,920
is there a clean and quiet place?

790
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
I wanna meet a friend.

791
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,000
Yes.

792
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,320
Here, this way please.

793
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,240
This is the raw material area.

794
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,080
Very calm and peace.

795
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm not gonna bother you, Mr. Fang.

796
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,680
You're mad right now?

797
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,120
Xiaoqi.

798
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,160
I have to let you be mad more often.

799
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,240
So you can come back to me.

800
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,520
Hmm?

801
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,720
It has been a long time.

802
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,160
You don't recognize me?

803
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm your cutest Chai Xiaoqi!

804
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,400
Yes!

805
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,400
Why do you take my phone?

806
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,880
Give it back!

807
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,440
But you have to keep quiet.

808
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,180
I'll promise you but you have to me back first.

809
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,520
Come and get it if you can.

810
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,160
Are you gonna give me back or not?

811
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,680
It's you?

812
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,600
You don't recognize me?

813
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,720
Of course I know you are Xiaoqi.

814
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,840
I just...

815
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,520
have to make sure if this is in my dream.

816
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,840
How about this?

817
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,960
Still like in your dream?

818
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,440
Even more.

819
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,000
How do you want me to prove it?

820
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,200
Do you wanna see my ID card?

821
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,560
Clang clang!

822
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
We are sending

823
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,240
Gillis Cal Qiuso Cara Cara Number Seven

824
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,360
to live on earth,

825
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,120
as Planet Cape Town's ambassador of peace on earth.

826
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,040
Hope you can work hard

827
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
and be trusted.

828
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,520
Now you believe me?

829
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,560
In order to let you understand,

830
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,920
I specially translated for you.

831
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,640
I hope you can keep this secret between us

832
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,760
as the universe friendly rule says.

833
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,240
Eh!

834
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,600
Xiaoqi.

835
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:55,920
Hmm?

836
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Welcome home.

837
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,600
Home?

838
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,560
Anywhere you are

839
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,970
