1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 6

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,440
Hi.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,440
Excuse me.

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,880
Hello.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,120
Your couple dolls are ready.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Thank you, Ms. Chai.

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
These are for me?

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,480
Yes.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,520
You are different from

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,960
Fang Leng I knew before.

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm not feeling well.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,080
I'll go back first.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,120
I'll ask Assistant Han to take you back.

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,000
I wonder what brings you here.

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
I came to find Fang Lie today,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
but I didn't expect him not to be here.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Fang Lie has his own place

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
and his own business.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
I didn't see

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
you two are quite alike.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
We are alike?

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
You see, you're both so obstinate.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,160
You don't listen to the advice of your elders.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,480
In those days,

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
your mom wanted a divorce,

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,600
but you didn't agree.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,040
If it wasn't for saving you,

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,520
she wouldn't have...

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Stop.

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,720
You're not in a position to mention my mom.

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,400
Leng.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,760
Leng.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,200
Leng,

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
how are you?

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Are you not feeling well?

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,480
Mr. Fang.

54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,600
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?

55
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Mr. Fang.

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,400
Madam,

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,120
Mr. Fang is not feeling well.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
You'd better go back first.

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Mr. Fang,

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,000
are you OK?

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,440
Mr. Fang,

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,760
your condition seems to be more serious.

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
Would you like to accept Doctor Zhang's suggestion

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,760
and contact Xiaoqi?

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,320
This is my mom punishing me.

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,360
Don't mention Xiaoqi again.

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
She can't.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,680
She can.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,520
She is the only one who can cure you.

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,320
Today, Ms. Zhou came for Fang Lie.

71
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
The urgent task is to deal with Fang Lie's affairs.

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
Tomorrow is the last day.

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,320
I hope he doesn't let himself down.

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
Your takeout is here.

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,000
You've arrived.

76
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,480
Wait a minute.

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,680
I'll be finished in a minute.

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,720
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,840
It's not the perfect moment yet.

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
You're here to help me watch the door.

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,760
No one is allowed to come in.

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm about to finish

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
this unparalleled work.

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,760
OK.

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
I'll watch the door for you.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Nobody can get in.

87
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,680
Don't answer the phone.

88
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Let my brother calm down.

89
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,080
Hello.

90
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,240
Why it's you?

91
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,640
Tell Fang Lie that

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,840
Filner has changed his flight ahead of time

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,200
and ask him to go to the airport immediately.

94
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,240
Fang Lie is almost finished.

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
Maybe I can hold on to Filner first.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,480
It's too late.

97
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,400
No matter what he paints,

98
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll take him to the airport now.

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,400
No way.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
Then you go upstairs and watch Fang Lie.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,960
I'm going to hold on to Filner.

102
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,640
Xiaoqi.

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
Filner,

104
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
wait a minute.

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Filner.

106
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,000
Xiaoqi,

107
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,760
come and have a look.

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,320
Xiaoqi.

109
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Leng.

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,560
Here, Leng.

111
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,880
She shouldn't be far on a scooter.

112
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,600
Shut up.

113
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,200
You need to figure out

114
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,360
what to tell Filner later.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,720
OK.

116
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,160
Wait a minute, Filner.

117
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,280
What should I do?

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
This is what you force me to do.

119
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Wait a minute.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
Run.

121
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
Keep running.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,880
Try to run again.

123
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,560
You can't run anymore.

124
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,240
Here.

125
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Sorry.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,400
Ouch.

127
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,800
Xiaoqi.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,600
Xiaoqi.

129
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,040
Xiaoqi.

130
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,120
How are you?

131
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,560
We will send her to hospital.

132
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
Xiaoqi, how are you? Xiaoqi.

133
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll call the ambulance right away.

134
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,160
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

135
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,920
I only scratched a little bit.

136
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,600
It's okay.

137
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,160
I'm okay.

138
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,480
God bless you,

139
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Xiaoqi.

140
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,760
It's too dangerous.

141
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Well,

142
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
let me have a rest.

143
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,240
Fang Lie

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,400
introduces your painting to Mr. Filner.

145
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
What time is it now?

146
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
We have been working so hard

147
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
just for this moment.

148
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Are you sure Xiaoqi is OK?

149
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,400
Mr. Filner,

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,320
she's trying to give me a chance

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,680
to show you my work.

152
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,440
Oh, I see.

153
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,280
Show me

154
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,600
your new work.

155
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,960
I'm drawing myself.

156
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,800
It's called

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,760
"Bullshit".

158
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,560
"Bullshit"?

159
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
Because someone appreciates him,

160
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,040
cares for him and helps him,

161
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,880
Mr. Bullshit

162
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,160
also shines.

163
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,080
If Fang Lie's work doesn't pass the test again,

164
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
I will do such things again

165
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,240
and even pretend to be ill.

166
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,760
I have to keep Filner.

167
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,840
I believe I can make it.

168
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,640
Are you really OK?

169
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I'm fine.

170
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,760
I've measured them all.

171
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,880
No need to fear.

172
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,280
Am I awesome?

173
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
Are you doing this

174
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,200
for Fang Lie or for me?

175
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Is there any difference?

176
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,240
If you're for Fang Lie,

177
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
you're a fool.

178
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,400
If you are for me,

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,640
you are stupid.

180
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,920
Aren't these two words

181
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440
both used for swearing?

182
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,400
Yeah, I don't just want to scold you now.

183
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
I also want to hit you.

184
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,200
No.

185
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,520
No.

186
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Don't take the chance to hit me.

187
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,800
Do you know how dangerous it was just now?

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Don't you want to pretend to be sick?

189
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,280
Come on.

190
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
Do it.

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,040
Don't be angry.

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,680
I promised you

193
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
I'll help you out.

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,160
Look,

195
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
how hard it is to walk alone.

196
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,160
Whether we are sick

197
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,000
or working,

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,480
we can try to

199
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,400
rely on another person,

200
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,360
right?

201
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,800
Rely on you?

202
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Because someone appreciates him,
cares for him and helps him,

203
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,240
Mr. Bullshit also shines.

204
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm impressed by your work

205
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,920
and your friends are great.

206
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,600
I'd like to contribute to your art exhibition.

207
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,720
Thank you.

208
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
I can't wait

209
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
to tell them the good news.

210
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,000
You finally passed.

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,560
I will have three bowls of rice to celebrate today.

212
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,840
Add me a bowl.

213
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I will order five takeouts from different stores today.

214
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,720
Leng,

215
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,640
what would you like to eat?

216
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
What would you like to eat?

217
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
What's wrong with him?

218
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,160
I don't know, either.

219
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,840
He said today that

220
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,160
he was going to hit me.

221
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,000
I am scared.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,720
What should I do?

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Then you're screwed.

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,720
I can't defeat my brother.

225
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,320
Well...

226
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,120
Mr. Fang,

227
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,440
well,

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
I remember I have something else to do.

229
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,920
How about you pull up

230
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,480
and let me go off first?

231
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,640
Mr. Fang.

232
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
Mr. Fang.

233
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,120
Fang.

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,520
Get off.

235
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,880
OK.

236
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,920
Not you.

237
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,800
You.

238
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,840
Get off.

239
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,840
Me?

240
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,120
Do you want to go down by yourself

241
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,080
or I force you into doing it?

242
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,240
No.

243
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,400
I'll get off by myself.

244
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,960
Don't go.

245
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm leaving.

246
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,720
I...

247
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
No. No. No.

248
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,720
-Xiaoqi. -Lie.

249
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,480
-I'm leaving. -Don't leave.

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,760
Don't leave me alone.

251
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
Don't go.

252
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,480
Hang in there.

253
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,200
Bye-bye.

254
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,080
Sit over here.

255
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,080
It's

256
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,760
quite spacious here.

257
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,560
Listen carefully.

258
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
I won't say the same thing again.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
Be my girlfriend.

260
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,440
What did you say?

261
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
I don't like to say the same thing twice.

262
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll give you time to think about it.

263
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,440
Help! Is there anyone?

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,840
What?

265
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,720
Didn't you let me date her?

266
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,000
I confessed.

267
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,000
I suggest you date her.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,960
But don't you

269
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,760
usually watch TV series?

270
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm so busy

271
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,080
that I don't have time

272
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,600
to study things that don't make sense.

273
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
The woman

274
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,600
is a very complicated,

275
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
fickle and ill-tempered creature.

276
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,400
You have to pay enough time,

277
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,840
money and energy

278
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
before you confess.

279
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,400
After that, you have to pamper,

280
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,400
help

281
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,480
and hurt her.

282
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,040
At the critical moment,

283
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
you have to seduce her.

284
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,240
You can't ask her to be your girlfriend

285
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,200
until you make her

286
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,040
be fascinated with you.

287
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,280
Get it?

288
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,280
Isn't that men are rich and handsome enough?

289
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,200
Well, this is true, too.

290
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
But if that's the case,

291
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
she likes your money.

292
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
Is this relationship what you want?

293
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,920
Look.

294
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,960
So

295
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,400
the next step

296
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
is to chase her

297
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,760
and let her feel

298
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,880
the love from the bossy president,

299
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,320
understand?

300
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,000
Bossy president?

301
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,320
Yes.

302
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Just like in TV series,

303
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,880
you send flowers, bags, gifts,

304
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,160
and all kinds of things to her.

305
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,880
You dine, watch movies, travel and shop

306
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,640
with her every day.

307
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,360
You give whatever she wants

308
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,400
and let her see

309
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
a totally different world.

310
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
Then let her fall in love with my money.

311
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,360
Let me tell you, you'll regret it.

312
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,400
Whatever.

313
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,720
Go ahead with your stuff.

314
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,200
OK.

315
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Xiaoqi,

316
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,200
what happened to you?

317
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,360
Why are you so angry?

318
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
Fang Leng

319
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,000
pissed me off.

320
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,680
He confessed to me.

321
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,400
Sorry.

322
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,680
Keep your voice down.

323
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,280
What did you say?

324
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,480
Fang Leng confessed to you?

325
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Yes.

326
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
We're friends.

327
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,640
How could he

328
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,000
do this to me?

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,160
He's too lascivious, isn't he?

330
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,040
No, he isn't.

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
He is so domineering.

332
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
Xiaoqi,

333
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,800
did you reject him?

334
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,440
It happened so suddenly.

335
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,160
I forgot.

336
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,320
That's good. That's good.

337
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,240
Xiaoqi,

338
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,840
although

339
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm not greedy,

340
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,160
Fang Leng

341
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,720
is not only rich,

342
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
but also handsome and capable.

343
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,920
Most of all, he is kind to you.

344
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,760
What kind of man do you like

345
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,240
except him?

346
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,600
Listen to me.

347
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't miss a great man like him.

348
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,160
You earthling choose spouses

349
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,320
so casually?

350
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,960
This is casual?

351
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,560
Tell me

352
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,720
what isn't casual?

353
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,280
Type matching.

354
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,000
Put all our data

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,960
into the database,

356
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,400
determine the matching degree between us

357
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,560
according to our height,

358
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,360
character and weight,

359
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,640
and then we will...

360
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,880
Forget it.

361
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
You can't understand it.

362
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,200
Anyway,

363
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,120
my other half needs to be

364
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,000
decided by the organization.

365
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,680
Fang Leng.

366
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,280
No.

367
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,360
No.

368
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,960
What do you

369
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,440
think of Fang Lie?

370
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Fang Lie is so handsome.

371
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,920
His face is so good-looking and his legs are so long.

372
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I knew

373
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,280
it must be because of Fang Lie.

374
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,880
Let me tell you,

375
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,920
Fang Leng is different.

376
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,440
He helped us.

377
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
You can't repay his kindness with enmity.

378
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,440
He helped me.

379
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,520
So I can't refuse him?

380
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't mean that.

381
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
But

382
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
men are

383
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,200
concerned about face-saving.

384
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
If you tell him directly that you don't like him,

385
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,280
he will be embarrassed.

386
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,000
How about

387
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,760
you treat him coldly

388
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,080
for a few days?

389
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,720
He'll be able to

390
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,040
understand your idea in a few days,

391
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,560
right?

392
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,040
Did she understand?

393
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,680
Be my girlfriend.

394
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,680
Assistant Han.

395
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Mr. Fang.

396
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,320
Did Xiaoqi contact me?

397
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,880
Wasn't she with you all the time today?

398
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,640
Nothing.

399
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,560
It's 11 p.m.

400
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,280
It's time for you to sleep.

401
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,080
Do you have any questions?

402
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,760
Insomnia

403
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,720
is often caused by many reasons,

404
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,800
including work pressure and love troubles.

405
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
The best treatment for a insomnia patient

406
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,640
is to relax

407
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,160
and avoid thinking about the problem causing insomnia.

408
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,120
For example, a lovelorn man...

409
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,200
Shut up.

410
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,880
OK.

411
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,040
Morning, Mr. Fang.

412
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,760
Mr. Fang.

413
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,400
Morning, Mr. Fang.

414
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,320
Mr. Fang.

415
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,440
Mr. Fang.

416
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,320
Is anyone looking for me this morning?

417
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,440
Mr. Zhang of Sunshine Investment has contacted you

418
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
and hopes to discuss the next cooperation plan with you.

419
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,960
Here are the quarterly reports of each branch of the group.

420
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,080
Mr. Fang.

421
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,360
Mr. Fang.

422
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,040
Great.

423
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,280
You do just that.

424
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,360
But I haven't said anything yet.

425
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,920
By the way,

426
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,040
this is from Director Allen of
the Scientific Research Department.

427
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,000
It's about the sapphire project

428
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
you asked them to investigate before.

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,760
So long.

430
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,520
According to Director Allen,

431
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,360
these sapphires are special.

432
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,000
They are substances

433
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,800
that have never been found on the earth

434
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,320
and have

435
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,760
some kind of peculiar magnetic field.

436
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Mr. Fang,

437
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
our company may find

438
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,720
some unprecedented new material.

439
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,440
So next?

440
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
Let them go on investigation

441
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,200
and try to find out how to make this kind of gem.

442
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,880
I see.

443
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,960
Our restaurant is empty again.

444
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,280
If only you and Fang Leng

445
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,040
could make another piece of news.

446
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,840
What are you doing?

447
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,560
Why do you stare at me?

448
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,880
I'm just saying it.

449
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,320
Now young people

450
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,520
are half-hearted.

451
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,360
When the restaurant became a hit,

452
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,840
they struggled to visit it.

453
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,000
Look, when it is not longer fresh,

454
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,440
the business is not as good as it used to be.

455
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
Xiaoqi.

456
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,760
Do you sense anything?

457
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,520
What?

458
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,560
Are you sensing money

459
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,240
or customers?

460
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Annunciator.

461
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,000
My annunciator appears.

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
Xiaoqi.

463
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,120
Where are you going, Xiaoqi?

464
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Assistant Han,

465
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,160
is this the way to Tropical Restaurant?

466
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,400
Yes.

467
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,160
Mr. Fang,

468
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
you have been

469
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
thinking about Xiaoqi these days.

470
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,320
Is there anything wrong?

471
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,760
Nothing.

472
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,120
I'm just...

473
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I'm a little hungry.

474
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
Let's go to Tropical Restaurant for a light meal.

475
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,840
Right now?

476
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,920
Didn't you just have breakfast?

477
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,120
It's already 10 a.m.

478
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,440
Let's have lunch.

479
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,840
Yes.

480
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,680
Stop.

481
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:44,840
OK.

482
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,120
What are you doing?

483
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,360
Do you know how dangerous it is?

484
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,360
Look at the lights when you cross the road.

485
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
Don't rush forward rashly

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
and don't be afraid.

487
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,240
Are you listening?

488
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,280
Follow me.

489
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,920
Did you hear what I said just now?

490
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Xiaoqi.

491
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,040
What?

492
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,400
I said you must look at the lights

493
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,640
when you cross the road.

494
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
Don't rush forward rashly

495
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,880
and don't be afraid.

496
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,560
If you have any problems, just turn
to the person next to you for help.

497
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,240
Do you understand?

498
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,400
Oh,

499
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,120
I see.

500
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,120
Don't you

501
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,800
have anything to tell me?

502
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,120
No.

503
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,960
Why are you here?

504
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm just passing by.

505
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,680
I'm going to talk business.

506
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,240
Fine.

507
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,280
I have something else to do.

508
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,960
Go ahead with your stuff.

509
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,760
I'm leaving.

510
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
I should avoid him.

511
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,480
But why do I always meet him?

512
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,720
Forget about it.

513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Find my annunciator first.

514
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,360
Why is it here again?

515
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,440
Excuse me.

516
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,360
I want to ask

517
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,880
what that place is.

518
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,280
The third floor?

519
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,800
It seems to be the Scientific Research Department.

520
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,360
What is

521
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,600
the Scientific Research Department for?

522
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,520
It's for group research.

523
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,200
Thank you.

524
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,040
It's for group research.

525
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,000
The Scientific Research Department.

526
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,520
What is this?

527
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,160
I don't believe it.

528
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,920
Why can't I go in?

529
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,600
It hurts me.

530
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,320
Kubri.

531
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,080
What's wrong?

532
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,560
Is it time to eat?

533
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
No.

534
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Let me tell you,

535
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,400
I found my annunciator today.

536
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,520
Kubri.

537
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,040
Kubri.

538
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,240
I, I was so excited

539
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,920
that I was trapped.

540
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,760
But don't get excited too early.

541
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,560
I just feel

542
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,880
a kind of familiar energy.

543
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,200
It's not sure

544
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,000
whether it's an annunciator.

545
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,560
Why is it not sure?

546
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,840
You'll know if you look at it.

547
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,120
But here's the problem.

548
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
I don't know what's wrong with

549
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,440
the room where the annunciator is in.

550
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,440
As soon as I got close to it,

551
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,800
my super power would fail.

552
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,360
You see, my forehead is broken.

553
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
I didn't go in.

554
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,000
What should we do?

555
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,560
Unless,

556
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,680
unless I can walk right in.

557
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,280
Then go ahead.

558
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,280
No.

559
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,240
The security there is too strict,

560
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,520
and it's in

561
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,400
Fang Leng's company.

562
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
I just decided to avoid him.

563
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
I can't ask him for help again.

564
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,720
No.

565
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,280
You are stupid.

566
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,080
You don't just know Fang Leng alone in F Group.

567
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,520
Ask Fang Lie for help?

568
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Mom,

569
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,520
how long have I been on my knees?

570
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,280
Go on.

571
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,080
You're not allowed to get up.

572
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,320
Come on,

573
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,880
you promised me

574
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,040
you wouldn't hold any art exhibition.

575
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,560
I went to talk to Filner

576
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,720
about it for you.

577
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,920
However,

578
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,560
you colluded with Fang Leng instead.

579
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,000
What do you think of me?

580
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,240
You're trying to piss me off, aren't you?

581
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,800
Mom,

582
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,560
I just want to hold an art exhibition.

583
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,280
I don't want others to look down on me.

584
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
Who looks down on you?

585
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,400
Did Fang Leng tell you something?

586
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,960
It has nothing to do with my brother.

587
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,520
I don't want to do nothing in my life.

588
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,920
When my art exhibition is finished,

589
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,720
I will become a great artist.

590
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,520
I will hold more weight when I enter the company, right?

591
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,560
You can arrange me

592
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,840
as you want by then.

593
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,220
=Xiaoqi=

594
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,920
Hello.

595
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,920
OK. I'll be right there.

596
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,240
Mom, I have something to do and have to go out.

597
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,800
Whose call? You so care about it.

598
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,480
It's a secret.

599
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
Mr. Wang,

600
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,080
Fang Lie just went out.

601
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,800
Right.

602
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,680
Keep an eye on him.

603
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,080
Xiaoqi.

604
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,000
Fang Lie,

605
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
did I bother you?

606
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,280
What are you talking about?

607
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
I don't have anything serious to do.

608
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,360
You just called for my help.

609
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,080
What can I do for you?

610
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
It's not a big deal.

611
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,960
Well,

612
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
can you enter the Scientific Research Department of F Group?

613
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,240
What are you going to do there?

614
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,600
I'll tell you in secret.

615
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,480
Don't tell anyone.

616
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm looking for something.

617
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,520
What are you looking for?

618
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,120
A very, very important thing.

619
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
But I can't tell you.

620
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,120
I see.

621
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,640
You can enter?

622
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,560
Do you see my handsome face?

623
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
With it,

624
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,760
I can enter any place in my company.

625
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,160
Get in the car.

626
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,160
Great.

627
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,960
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

628
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,000
You don't have a certificate.

629
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,320
I really can't let you in.

630
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,320
What?

631
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,200
See clearly.

632
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,160
I am

633
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,440
Fang Lie.

634
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm Fang Leng's brother.

635
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Maybe I have a stake

636
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,600
in your department.

637
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,040
I'm so sorry.

638
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,400
Don't embarrass me.

639
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,320
I really can't let you in.

640
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
Forget it. No need.

641
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,880
No way.

642
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,680
No need.

643
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,320
It doesn't matter. We can't get in.

644
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Let's go.

645
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,360
No need.

646
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,080
No need. No need.

647
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,800
That's not polite.

648
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,720
What if we get caught?

649
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,800
Don't worry.

650
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm here.

651
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,360
Look for it.

652
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I'll keep watch for you.

653
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
You don't know what I'm looking for.

654
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,000
You're not afraid that I'll steal from your company?

655
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,880
There are so many products in our company

656
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,280
that we can't find if we lose one or two.

657
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,400
Take whatever you like.

658
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,080
I can afford it.

659
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,840
Thank you.

660
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,520
If I find it,

661
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,160
I,

662
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,160
I can do nothing to thank you.

663
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,440
Maybe

664
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,440
I'll take it out of here.

665
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,160
But with a good friend like you,

666
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,840
I will miss you when I leave.

667
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,640
What's up?

668
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,360
Nothing.

669
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
No way.

670
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,960
It should be here.

671
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Was it taken away?

672
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,720
Run.

673
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,000
No.

674
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,440
No.

675
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,720
Wait.

676
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,000
I...

677
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
Why do we run?

678
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,320
Because...

679
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,840
That's strange.

680
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,360
Why can't I use my super power?

681
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,080
Breaking into the Scientific Research Department.

682
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,200
Attempted theft.

683
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,040
Do you know the consequences

684
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,960
of being caught?

685
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,760
You even nodded?

686
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,040
You almost became business spies today.

687
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,000
They almost called the police.

688
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,440
If I didn't get the message in time,

689
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
it's not me standing in front of you.

690
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,600
It's the police.

691
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
Blame me. It's me.

692
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,000
It's me.

693
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
I took Xiaoqi there.

694
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,400
I want to create a painting with
a sense of science and technology,

695
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,120
so I took Xiaoqi to go for inspiration there.

696
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,720
You went for inspiration in the Scientific Research Room?

697
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,000
You even brought a drag with you.

698
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,240
The company is the place to support the family,

699
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,520
not the playground for you two.

700
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,320
Do you know how many people

701
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,440
have been reprimanded for this

702
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,400
and how much manpower and
material resources the company will spend

703
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,760
to check the scene?

704
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,600
I, I was wrong.

705
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,680
I was wrong, too.

706
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,200
But is there

707
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,040
something strange

708
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,240
in your Scientific Research Department?

709
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,040
For example...

710
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,960
There's nothing strange in the company

711
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,400
but you two.

712
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,840
Enough.

713
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,800
I'm going to

714
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,880
withhold this.

715
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,600
You two don't talk about it to others.

716
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,800
Otherwise, the founding members
should say you're not doing your job again.

717
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,240
Thank you, Leng.

718
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,120
We're leaving.

719
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,760
Wait a minute.

720
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,840
When you get downstairs,

721
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,760
if someone asks you about it, you can say

722
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,120
I called you to the company.

723
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,120
As for her,

724
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,560
I have some personal problems

725
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,520
to solve with her.

726
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,320
Oh.

727
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,560
What?

728
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,360
Fang Lie was caught?

729
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,480
They are a family.

730
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
One is superior

731
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,120
and the other one can't even enter the company's door.

732
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,000
What the hell!

733
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,080
That's all right.

734
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,720
You can leave.

735
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,320
Yes.

736
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,560
Hello.

737
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,480
Hello.

738
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,640
Didn't I say that?

739
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,240
Don't call me at work.

740
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,040
He bullied my son and me.

741
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,560
I don't want to

742
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,800
wait anymore.

743
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,040
What happened?

744
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,440
Do you remember

745
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,040
the last time I went to Fang Leng's house?

746
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,160
Somehow he fell ill.

747
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,200
After that,

748
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,280
the more I think about it, the more I feel it is strange.

749
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,400
You keep an eye on him these days.

750
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,520
I don't believe

751
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,200
we can't find his problem.

752
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,880
Okay, I see.

753
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,920
Sit down.

754
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,600
Sit down.

755
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,600
What do you want to do?

756
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,160
Have you decided

757
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,240
how to answer

758
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,400
my confession that day?

759
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,600
I,

760
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,040
I don't know, either.

761
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,000
I understand.

762
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,640
What do you understand?

763
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,600
You'd rather get into trouble with Fang Lie today,

764
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,840
but you don't want to come to me.

765
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,880
It proves that

766
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,120
the person you really like

767
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,920
is Fang Lie,

768
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,520
right?

769
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,280
It has nothing to do with Fang Lie.

770
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,680
It's because...

771
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,280
It's because

772
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,920
I don't belong here.

773
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,280
You're leaving.

774
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,800
Kind of.

775
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,240
I didn't mean to hurt you.

776
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,560
Moreover,

777
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,600
you have dated several women.

778
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,080
You're fickle in love, right?

779
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,200
You don't have to put all your eggs in one basket.

780
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,000
You mean that

781
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,160
the reason why you refuse me

782
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,360
is not Fang Lie,

783
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,000
right?

784
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,760
Yes?

785
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,160
I understand.

786
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,960
What do you understand again?

787
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,880
Doctor Zhang is right.

788
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,320
Take it easy.

789
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,840
I will let you feel my sincerity.

790
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,880
You can leave.

791
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,760
You'd better stay here

792
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,040
and feel my sincerity

793
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,400
in this office.

794
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,880
Mr. Fang,

795
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,480
it's all ready.

796
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,840
Look.

797
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,640
This is a recent TV series

798
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
of bossy president's love.

799
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,200
These are

800
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,120
love stories about the president.

801
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,960
Here is

802
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,360
the girl's favorite gift recommendation.

803
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,120
It has been opened for you.

804
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,960
Good.

805
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I'll study first.

806
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,840
You can leave.

807
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,440
OK.

808
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,760
Mr. Fang,

809
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
I want to ask you that

810
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,880
you are preparing these

811
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,080
for...

812
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,480
Assistant Han,

813
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,000
have you ever dated someone?

814
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,840
Sure.

815
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,680
But compared with you,

816
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,720
maybe not.

817
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
You know,

818
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,640
women are creatures

819
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,680
that takes time to chase.

820
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,600
Even if we are rich,

821
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,720
handsome

822
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,040
and almost perfect,

823
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
sometimes we need some means

824
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,280
to chase them.

825
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,760
Do you understand?

826
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,640
Mr. Fang,

827
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,240
it makes sense.

828
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,520
You can go back.

829
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,520
"President's Favorite".

830
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,720
He pinned her on a two-meter-wide bed.

831
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,680
I've been in love with you

832
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,760
since I met you in the coffee shop that day.

833
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
Woman,

834
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
sooner or later, you are mine.

835
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,960
Woman,

836
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
sooner or later, you are mine.

837
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,520
That's wrong.

838
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,000
How about this?

839
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,800
I've been in love with you

840
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,680
since I met you in the coffee shop that day.

841
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,280
Woman,

842
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,800
sooner or later, you are mine.

843
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,320
Oh, my God!

844
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,760
That's wrong, too.

845
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,040
That's strange.

846
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,800
Why?

847
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,600
I can't feel it.

848
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,680
Is it taken away?

849
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,160
Xiaoqi.

850
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,560
Xiaoqi.

851
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,760
Serve the dish, Xiaoqi.

852
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,520
Hurry up.

853
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:13,920
Oh.

854
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,040
-OK. Thank you. -Thank you.

855
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,720
Have a look.

856
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,780
Ever since I met you,

857
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,460
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

858
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,860
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

859
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,740
only you.

860
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,940
We're out of reach

861
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,260
but appreciate each other.

862
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:39,060
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

863
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,100
The yearning invades

864
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,660
and lurks in my mind.

865
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:53,220
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

866
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,300
I'm getting addicted to it

867
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,620
and my sense is shielded.

868
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,420
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

869
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,580
Put the hottest heart

870
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,900
in this cold body.

871
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,260
I'm looking at you,

872
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,420
and my love has nowhere to go.

873
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,660
Ever since I met you,

874
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,580
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

875
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,860
Every day is a new memory

876
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,900
which is only be about you and me.

877
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,140
I can't lie to myself anymore.

878
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,980
Please give me the courage to believe.

879
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,900
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

880
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,820
only you.

881
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,940
Even everything becomes silent,

882
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,060
I still have you.
