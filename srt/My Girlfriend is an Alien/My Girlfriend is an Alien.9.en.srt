1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,660
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 9

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,200
Mom.

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,120
Mom.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,080
Mom.

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,440
Mom.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,680
Mom.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,000
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,360
Nothing serious.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,200
I have an attack of my old illness headache.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,360
I'll call a doctor for you.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,680
No.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,640
No need. No need.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,880
It's useless.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,560
I have an anxiety.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,880
What do you mean?

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,200
Mom,

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
who made you angry?

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
It's your dad.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,320
He said you were useless

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
and could do nothing

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,640
but paint.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,040
He doesn't allow you to enter the company.

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,120
Son,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
I feel hopeless.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
Did my dad really say that?

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,160
Great.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,480
Mom,

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
I finally don't have to go to work at the company.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,280
Why,

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
why do you say so?

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
You asked me back hurriedly

49
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
for such a trifle?

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,520
I think my dad has a point.

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,720
If there's nothing,

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,280
I'll go back first.

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,160
Wait.

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,440
What's up, mom?

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,640
Son,

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,000
you really don't want your dad to admit you once?

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,620
=Assistant Han=

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,680
The gallery is on fire.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,280
Xiaoqi rushed into the fire to save you.

60
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,320
We haven't found her until now.

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,800
What?

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
She rushed into the fire to save you.

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,200
Her life is uncertain now.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,800
Fool.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Xiaoqi.

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,840
She came to herself.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,760
I think there's nothing serious with her.

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
Unexpectedly,

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
she's the only one who cares about me.

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,120
Don't stand on ceremony.

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,680
She's my girlfriend,

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
also your family member.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,960
Even if my family

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,800
may not risk their lives

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,760
for me.

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,480
Only she

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,880
did this stupid thing.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,440
Is she more important to you

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
than us?

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,960
I don't mean that.

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
However,

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,200
since I knew Xiaoqi,

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
she's been helping me.

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
She helped me find inspiration

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,360
and accompanied me to relieve boredom.

86
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,760
When I was not happy,

87
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
she amused me.

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,680
If I had danger,

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
she rushed into the fire for me.

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,920
Leng,

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,240
do you know?

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
It's only when I'm with Xiaoqi

93
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,120
that I feel I'm so important.

94
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,960
In fact, she just regards you as her friend.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
She cares so much about everyone.

96
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
What a silly girl.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,240
Yes.

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm so glad I have such a friend.

99
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,440
Leng,

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
aren't you going to work today?

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Let me take care of Xiaoqi

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,520
tonight, OK?

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,840
No need.

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,320
I've arranged the time.

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,680
I can take care of

106
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
my own girlfriend myself.

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,760
Then I'll leave.

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I'll come another day.

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,440
By the way, Leng,

110
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,160
why did the gallery suddenly catch fire?

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,120
I also feel sort of strange.

112
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,080
At that time, I saw the smoke.

113
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,960
After that, I found it's a small fire.

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,480
It just burned a few pieces of furniture

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
and messed up your art exhibition.

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
There is no other loss.

117
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,560
Fang Lie.

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
It's you.

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,880
You are disappointed?

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,080
No. No.

121
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you for coming over to save me

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
yesterday.

123
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,360
Don't misunderstand.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
I just didn't want to see

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
anyone dies in front of me.

126
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Why did you have to bring me back?

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
You're my employee.

128
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,520
As your president,

129
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,440
I should show concern for you.

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,880
Regard it as the company welfare.

131
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,480
OK.

132
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,480
What do you want to do?

133
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
I accepted the company welfare.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

135
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,080
I'll go home.

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,520
Sit down.

137
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,080
Your injuries haven't recovered yet.

138
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
Don't walk these days.

139
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,720
Have a good rest and recuperation.

140
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm much stronger than common people.

141
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,240
The fire couldn't hurt me.

142
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,600
Do you know how dangerous it was yesterday?

143
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you know what would happen

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,280
if I didn't come in to save you?

145
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,600
Even if you don't care about yourself,

146
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
you need to think about me at times.

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
Think, think about others.

148
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
Don't let others worry about you.

149
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,120
You still

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,600
came to save me.

151
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
You did that.

152
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,880
Why do you still lecture me?

153
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,440
Anyhow, stay in bed these days

154
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,480
and don't go anywhere.

155
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,760
OK.

156
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,600
By the way,

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,160
where is Fang Lie?

158
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,360
Did he get hurt?

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,480
You are injured.

160
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,320
Do you still have the mood to care about him?

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,840
Surely I care about him.

162
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,160
He's my friend.

163
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
Unlike someone

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,720
who regards the care for me

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
as his work and duty.

166
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,120
Are you really a friend to him?

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
Or else?

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,080
Though,

169
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
though he looks very handsome,

170
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,240
he looks like a little prince in a fairy tale...

171
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,040
Though,

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,120
though he also often helps me...

173
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,640
Though he is also like the perfect man...

174
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:12,880
Enough.

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
...all girls like...

176
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,200
Enough.

177
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm going to work.

178
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,040
Take care.

179
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,480
What's wrong with you?

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,480
I haven't finished my words.

181
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,040
Though he is a nice man,

182
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,040
I won't be crazy about him anymore.

183
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,680
Especially when

184
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
you came to save me

185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
at all hazards yesterday.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,760
My annunciator.

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,800
Are these the only things left?

188
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,120
Here was burned down

189
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,880
on the day of the fire.

190
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,080
Is there something taken away

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
or cleared away by people?

192
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,960
What can I do?

193
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,680
Hello.

194
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,240
I called you before.

195
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,400
I want to check the surveillance video

196
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
on the night of the art exhibition.

197
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,640
I already told you

198
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,480
no one could check it

199
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
except for police and related staff.

200
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
I left something in there.

201
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,000
I have to find it

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,920
through the surveillance video.

203
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Do me a favor.

204
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,200
Make an exception.

205
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,760
You all said you lost something

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,640
and came to find.

207
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
It's all burned down here.

208
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,720
Nothing was left.

209
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,400
We all?

210
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,520
Did someone else also come?

211
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,720
Is it a girl

212
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,920
of this height?

213
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,560
Yes.

214
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,280
She didn't find anything

215
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:11,960
and left.

216
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,880
It's indeed her.

217
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,040
How is

218
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,320
the case of sapphire?

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The Scientific Research Department is working on it.

220
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,320
There should be a result soon.

221
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,160
OK.

222
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,720
Tell Allen

223
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,520
to investigate this matter internally

224
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,520
and not to report to the police.

225
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,240
Why?

226
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,640
Are you afraid

227
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,640
Xiaoqi may be suspected?

228
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,400
There's no relationship with her.

229
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,480
Only you, Allen, other core members

230
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,640
and I

231
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,560
know this matter.

232
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,800
Now the missing sapphire

233
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,840
must be related to our internal staff.

234
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
If we report to the police,

235
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,760
it means this person's whole life

236
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,120
will be ruined.

237
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
After all, he is the employee of our company.

238
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,400
I'd like to give him an opportunity
to admit his mistake actively.

239
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,040
I see.

240
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,520
I'll tell Allen right away that

241
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,600
as long as someone can return the sapphire,

242
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,000
we'll give up investigating and affixing the responsibility.

243
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
How can it be different?

244
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,240
I told you

245
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,720
not to meet me except that there is something special.

246
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,920
Now there is something special.

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,400
There's something

248
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,600
I want you to do for me.

249
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,680
Don't you forget your identity?

250
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I hire you.

251
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,360
I helped you enter F Groups

252
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
and fund your loss-making lab

253
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,240
which may be found by Fang Lei at any time.

254
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,680
You ask me to help you.

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,240
Do you think you're qualified to order me?

256
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,000
You did help me.

257
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,480
In these years,

258
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,800
I helped you figure out

259
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,480
Fang Lei's memory bank and amnesia,

260
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,960
and I've been reporting to you about his actions.

261
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,560
Miss Jiang,

262
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm your ally,

263
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,840
not your subordinate.

264
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,160
OK.

265
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
I'd like to hear

266
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,160
what you can bring me, ally.

267
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,280
The secretary surnamed Chai who is close to Mr. Fang

268
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,000
should be the sapphire thief.

269
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,640
She was body-searched by you that night.

270
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,520
I remember the sapphire wasn't on her.

271
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
This is the surveillance video
of our Scientific Research Department.

272
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
The picture that she steals the sapphire is blocked.

273
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
But this video can prove she is a suspect

274
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,440
at most.

275
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,120
But

276
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
she went straight to the gallery

277
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,200
after stealing the sapphire.

278
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,400
I guess

279
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,240
there must be definite evidence in the gallery.

280
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,280
Are you sure that

281
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,920
the sapphire must be on her?

282
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,880
Yes.

283
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
So you ask me here

284
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
to let me look for evidence in the gallery.

285
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,720
The gallery employee says I'm an outsider.

286
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,080
So far, he has refused to

287
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
show me the surveillance picture.

288
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,520
You're different.

289
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
As the planner of this art exhibition,

290
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,760
you must have a way to see the picture

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
before the fire.

292
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,360
Surely I have.

293
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,040
Don't worry about it.

294
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,720
I'll investigate myself.

295
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,160
Help me contact the gallery.

296
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,680
Xiaoqi.

297
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,880
Where did you go?

298
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,680
I don't want to talk right now.

299
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
Don't talk to me.

300
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,960
What happened?

301
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm done.

302
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,680
I may have to stay here forever.

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
What do you mean?

304
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,560
You mean you'll stay at my house all the time?

305
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,440
You don't understand.

306
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,960
I don't have

307
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,640
any goal in life.

308
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,760
I'll never go back

309
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,840
to my home.

310
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
What can I do?

311
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,120
If you want to go back,

312
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,960
I can send you home now.

313
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,400
No. No.

314
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,720
Please.

315
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm basically a good-for-nothing now.

316
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,800
If you send me back,

317
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm sure I'm not in the mood to work.

318
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
I must have a hard time.

319
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,120
I'd better stay here.

320
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,680
You can provide me with food

321
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,040
and a big house to live.

322
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,840
I won't separate from you.

323
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,400
Don't forget.

324
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,440
We aren't a real couple now.

325
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,400
It's unsuitable for you

326
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,320
to live with me.

327
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Don't worry.

328
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
Even if I want to do something to you,

329
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,560
I don't have that energy.

330
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,480
Now,

331
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,800
let me lie down

332
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,040
in despair and quiet.

333
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,080
OK?

334
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,640
OK.

335
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,520
Since you said that,

336
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
I'll just let you stay.

337
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,600
Have a meal now.

338
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,960
Assistant Han,

339
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,720
sent all my papers

340
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,520
home.

341
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
Xiaoqi is very sick.

342
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm not going to the company today.

343
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,480
OK.

344
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,000
What do you want to do?

345
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,560
I am hungry.

346
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Give me food.

347
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,120
You just ate your fill.

348
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,800
You don't understand.

349
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,160
As long as there's something wrong with my mind,

350
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
my digestive system will strengthen.

351
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,440
So no matter how much I eat,

352
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll feel hungry.

353
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,920
I am hungry. Give me food.

354
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,720
I'll have it delivered to you.

355
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,960
So hungry.

356
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,720
What are you doing?

357
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,000
Hungry.

358
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,000
Wait.

359
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,480
I'll cook for you.

360
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,540
♪Move through the crowd. Between you and me♪

361
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,820
♪Ambiguous feelings are fermenting.♪

362
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
♪The inaccessible hug♪

363
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,460
♪may come into contact soon.♪

364
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,900
♪I'll only let you know those things on my mind.♪

365
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,180
♪Let's love each other until the end of time.♪

366
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,600
You actually can

367
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,800
let such a handsome and perfect man

368
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
make a pan-fried egg for you.

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Are you glad?

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,040
But don't expect me

371
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
to be so nice to you again.

372
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,760
I want more.

373
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,360
How many?

374
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,760
Enough?

375
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
So comfortable.

376
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Why do you wear my shirt?

377
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,960
I didn't bring my own clothes,

378
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,880
so I have to wear yours first.

379
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
I am obsessive about cleanliness.

380
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
Please don't mess with my clothes.

381
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,240
Go and change it.

382
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,280
OK.

383
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,080
What are you doing?

384
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,520
You asked me to change it.

385
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,480
A distinction should be made between males and females.

386
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,040
How can you change in front of me?

387
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,160
Go back to your room for change.

388
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
Anyway, I almost take it off.

389
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,360
Why can't I change it here?

390
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,240
I'll go back to my room.

391
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,240
I need to work.

392
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,680
Please don't hang around

393
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,360
in front of me in the future.

394
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,200
Why?

395
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
I don't make any sound.

396
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
Because your image affects me.

397
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,160
Image?

398
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
What do you want to do?

399
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,680
I can't fall asleep,

400
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,520
so I want you to drink with me.

401
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,520
Do I look like that kind of person

402
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,960
who drinks with others?

403
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,080
If you have anything, just say it.

404
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Lately, I seem to

405
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,640
have been scared by that fire,

406
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,760
and I often have some fantasies.

407
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,920
What fantasies?

408
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,240
According to my fantasies,

409
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,920
many years later,

410
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,080
you,

411
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
no, we earthling

412
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,960
will have particularly advanced technologies.

413
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,800
And then we can fly freely

414
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,320
to the universe.

415
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,600
I'm a small

416
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,760
and ordinary person

417
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,080
with poor abilities and no money.

418
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,640
I have no place on my own planet.

419
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,840
But on one occasion,

420
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,040
I go to another planet.

421
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,920
Suddenly,

422
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,200
I become an alien with super power.

423
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,160
And then?

424
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,120
Then...

425
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,680
I fall in love with this planet.

426
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,080
It's a very big planet

427
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
with much good food

428
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,520
and pretty scenery.

429
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
There are a lot of things

430
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,320
we don't have on our planet.

431
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,960
Most importantly,

432
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
the people on this planet are very nice to me.

433
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,400
They help me, warm me, save me

434
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,640
and let me know what warmth is.

435
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,760
Don't you

436
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,760
want to go back?

437
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,840
I also don't know.

438
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
I thought

439
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,360
I wanted to stay here.

440
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,480
But I'm really afraid

441
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,040
when I know that I'm really thrown away

442
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,840
and I'll never go back.

443
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,960
What are you afraid of?

444
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
On a planet that doesn't belong to me,

445
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,600
I'm always an alien

446
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,080
and I am always a lonely person.

447
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
Then who tells you they're the same?

448
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
Even people on the same planet,

449
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,400
in the same city,

450
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
and even in the same family,

451
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,880
they're different.

452
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,640
Some people seem impressive in appearance,

453
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
but behind the scenes,

454
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
they do everything they can to do
things that they even feel ashamed of.

455
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,080
And some people seem to be happy,

456
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,880
but in fact, they're lonely.

457
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
And some people

458
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,520
seem to have everything,

459
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,320
but they can't catch anything.

460
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,960
They don't remember anything.

461
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,120
Really?

462
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,880
Even if you're a special person,

463
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,240
you're one of many aliens.

464
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Everyone is living

465
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,520
in loneliness and fear,

466
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,760
so you just treat yourself

467
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,560
as a slightly different person,

468
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,080
right?

469
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,760
Yes.

470
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,600
A slightly different person.

471
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,800
Let's have a drink.

472
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,320
Are you OK?

473
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,560
It tastes so bad.

474
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,920
Look at that planet.

475
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,800
Over there.

476
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,280
All the stars on it

477
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,280
are colored.

478
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,520
And that one.

479
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,960
It's over there.

480
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,000
See?

481
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,720
There.

482
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,120
All the stars on it

483
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,520
move like meteors.

484
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,800
I am eager to go there,

485
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,760
but I always can't.

486
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,760
What about other planets?

487
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,800
And look at that planet.

488
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
It gives a particularly large white light

489
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
before dawn every day.

490
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,120
Every time they wanted to take me there,

491
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,600
they always failed.

492
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,880
You got up so early.

493
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,920
Morning.

494
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,080
I've almost recovered.

495
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,760
I can't stay here every day.

496
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,160
This is the breakfast sent by Assistant Han.

497
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,080
I borrow it to offer to you.

498
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,640
Thank you.

499
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,360
Will you move back

500
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,880
to the restaurant?

501
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,840
I decided to

502
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,120
work carefully

503
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,840
and live here in a down-to-earth manner

504
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,200
from today on.

505
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,680
If nothing happens,

506
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,800
I can go to work today.

507
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,320
OK.

508
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,920
I misunderstood you

509
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,880
about the sapphire.

510
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,920
Don't worry.

511
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,800
In two days, I can catch the thief.

512
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,840
Well,

513
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
are you still investigating

514
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,360
the case of the sapphire?

515
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,560
Sure.

516
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,480
It's related to the interest of the company,

517
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,160
so I must take it seriously.

518
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,680
If you find the thief,

519
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
how will you deal with him?.

520
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,840
It depends.

521
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,360
I won't call him to account

522
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,480
if I can get back the sapphire.

523
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,920
What if

524
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,000
the sapphire is destroyed?

525
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,560
He destroyed it deliberately.

526
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,480
I have to report to the police.

527
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,040
Eat quickly.

528
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,320
After you eat your fill, I'll drive you there.

529
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,640
Where, where do I go?

530
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,480
You want to work.

531
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,840
I'll take you there.

532
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
I don't seem

533
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
to feel well.

534
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,600
I may have to rest for another several days.

535
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,400
You go first.

536
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
I feel unwell suddenly.

537
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,160
I have a slight headache.

538
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,800
Are you OK?

539
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,520
Yes. Yes.

540
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,680
Let me have a rest first.

541
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,600
Xiaoqi, do you really decide to leave?

542
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,280
Or else?

543
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
He said he would punish me seriously.

544
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,000
If I don't escape,

545
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,960
I'll be caught by him.

546
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,560
So where do you want to go?

547
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,520
Yes.

548
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,240
He knows where I can go.

549
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,560
If I escape, he'll still catch me.

550
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,880
Unless you can

551
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,840
escape to another city

552
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,800
and avoid him the whole life.

553
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,360
That's not good.

554
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,120
After all, he saved me.

555
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,360
And I already

556
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,680
have feelings for this city.

557
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,480
I think you hate to part from Fang Leng.

558
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,800
No.

559
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,720
I just...

560
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,160
But the annunciator is supposed to be mine.

561
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
I stole it back,

562
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,360
so it returned to me, the origin owner, right?

563
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Why do I escape?

564
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,000
It was destroyed.

565
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,440
Even if you tell Fang Leng these,

566
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,160
can he believe you?

567
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,200
Maybe he can.

568
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,000
When I talked about the alien with him,

569
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
he said

570
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,080
I was just a little special.

571
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
If I tell him about the annunciator,

572
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,080
what if he can accept?

573
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,280
Well,

574
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,000
why don't I try to tell him about it tonight?

575
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,640
If he becomes flexible,

576
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,640
I can confess it to him.

577
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,440
What do you think?

578
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,480
Let me go.

579
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,640
Let me run myself.

580
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
You must agree.

581
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:44,960
Mr. Fang,

582
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,520
it must have been hard for you

583
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,240
to take care of Xiaoqi these days.

584
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,400
No.

585
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,680
I think it's interesting.

586
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,240
Interesting?

587
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,640
Do you believe there are aliens in this world?

588
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,160
And we humans

589
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,200
can land on the moon.

590
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,160
Can we also land on the other planets?

591
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,320
Mr. Fang,

592
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,520
did you have fantasies again

593
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,080
these days?

594
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,200
No.

595
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,520
By the way,

596
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,320
has the cause for the fire come out?

597
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,160
It is said to be caused by the aging of the circuit.

598
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,960
However, there's not much loss,

599
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,800
so the gallery doesn't investigate it.

600
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,760
Pay attention to what happens

601
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
in my family these days.

602
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,160
Your family?

603
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,320
You mean...

604
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,400
Fang Lie's art exhibition was ruined.

605
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,240
My dad and her mom will give him some pressure.

606
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,360
If something happens to Fang Lie,

607
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,280
tell me in time.

608
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,400
I see.

609
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,480
Well,

610
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,520
have soup.

611
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,760
You're sick,

612
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,920
so don't cook yourself.

613
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm used to it.

614
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,120
I worry the food others cook may not meet your taste.

615
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,880
Mom,

616
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,720
why did you kick me?

617
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,440
If you have something, just say it out.

618
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
Don't do anything behind me.

619
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,360
Shida,

620
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,520
before our son,

621
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,840
I have to intercede with you for me today.

622
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,960
I made a mistake before.

623
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,960
It's my fault.

624
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
For the sake of our son,

625
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,520
don't get angry with me.

626
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,520
Yes.

627
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,200
You quarreled.

628
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,360
It's childish for you

629
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,320
to let me play the peacemaker.

630
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,080
Now that I talked it with you,

631
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,520
I don't bother about it with you truly.

632
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,840
Let it

633
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,600
be the past.

634
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,520
Well,

635
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,880
our son made efforts and wanted to hold an art exhibition,

636
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,120
but it was destroyed by a big fire.

637
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,320
Look,

638
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,440
now he is in no mood to paint again.

639
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,920
Do we...

640
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:53,880
Mom,

641
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,280
I am still passionate about painting.

642
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
My mistake can't

643
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,800
affect our son's future.

644
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Look, poor child.

645
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,920
Now he has nothing.

646
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,120
How about letting him

647
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
work in the company for a period of time?

648
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:09,920
Dad,

649
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,280
you agreed to let me paint

650
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
in the rest of my life.

651
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
You can't regret it.

652
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,920
Well,

653
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,560
as parents,

654
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,600
I can't decide your life in a word.

655
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
If you want to paint,

656
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,000
I allow you to hold your art exhibition again.

657
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,680
If you want to enter the company,

658
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
I'll find a position for you.

659
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,800
Just do

660
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
what you like.

661
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,240
Dad, I still want to paint.

662
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,760
No. Stop that.

663
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Go there now. Go there.

664
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,800
Mom.

665
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
Why did you take me here?

666
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,960
I haven't spoken to my dad yet.

667
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,640
You milksop.

668
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,360
I descend myself to be your dad's second wife.

669
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,960
It's hard for me to get a chance for you.

670
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,840
But you don't cherish it

671
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,720
and want to paint again.

672
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
Listen.

673
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,040
If you don't promise me today,

674
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,520
I,

675
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,200
I'll crash and die before you.

676
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,600
If you force me into the company again,

677
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,280
I'll crash and die here, too.

678
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
Let's check who can do it.

679
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
One last question for you.

680
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,720
Will you listen to my plan?

681
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,520
OK.

682
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,320
Since you're so determined,

683
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,440
I have to give myself up to the police.

684
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,000
Mom,

685
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,720
what do you actually want to do?

686
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,760
Why do you give yourself up to the police?

687
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,240
I don't need to

688
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,680
keep it from you now.

689
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,600
I asked someone

690
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,120
to set fire to your art exhibition this time.

691
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,400
What did you say?

692
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,240
Son,

693
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,320
I've tried hard

694
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,920
and been trembling with fear

695
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,080
these years.

696
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,640
Why?

697
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,560
I just hope you can

698
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,960
inherit the family property

699
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,760
and get whatever you want in the future.

700
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,520
But you were so busy with

701
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,200
that meaningless art exhibition

702
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,280
and fooled around by Fang Leng.

703
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,240
Well,

704
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,720
how can I

705
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,320
not worry about you?

706
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,640
So you had my art exhibition burned down.

707
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,640
Mom,

708
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,160
that's my art exhibition.

709
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,360
That's all I've done.

710
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,160
That's not yours,

711
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,880
but Fang Leng's.

712
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,080
I did it all for you.

713
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,920
If I didn't destroy

714
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,840
your art exhibition cruelly,

715
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,200
you won't give up

716
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,880
and your dad won't let you enter the company.

717
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,160
I also did this

718
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,920
due to helplessness.

719
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,480
You didn't do that.

720
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,480
Lie. Lie.

721
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,000
Look at me. Look at me.

722
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,000
I am old.

723
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,720
I can only

724
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,000
depend on you.

725
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,720
Even if you don't consider others,

726
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,040
don't you consider me?

727
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
Even if you don't consider me,

728
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,400
then you should consider yourself.

729
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,120
When you just graduated,

730
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
you said you would do something big

731
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,720
as your dad does.

732
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Over these years,

733
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,600
if you weren't suppressed by Fang Leng,

734
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,680
how could you

735
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,400
be so depressed, son?

736
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,400
You shouldn't do this

737
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
even if I am suppressed by my brother.

738
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,160
Even if he is better than me in every aspect,

739
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,200
you can't go against him in everything.

740
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,960
My brother supports me for painting,

741
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,480
but you had my art exhibition burned down.

742
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:22,960
Mom,

743
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,480
do you know?

744
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,080
Someone was almost killed in the fire to save me.

745
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,480
You know how guilty I'm in my heart.

746
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,200
You can destroy me.

747
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,280
Why did you hurt the people I care most?

748
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,240
Son,

749
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,880
as long as you listen to me

750
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,000
and enter the company obediently,

751
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,320
I won't do these things anymore

752
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,600
in the future.

753
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,040
Lie.

754
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,080
Sorry.

755
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,920
I stole the sapphire.

756
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,000
I cheated you.

757
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,920
No. No.

758
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,280
I stole the sapphire.

759
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm an alien.

760
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,960
Will he be greatly shocked?

761
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,000
I am

762
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,680
an alien.

763
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,080
Why are you here?

764
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,480
I come to see you.

765
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,600
When I saw you last time,

766
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,560
you were sleeping.

767
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
Are you feeling better now?

768
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,720
Am I?

769
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,880
I feel well.

770
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,440
Well.

771
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,400
If it hadn't been for me,

772
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
you wouldn't have been hurt.

773
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,960
You must hate the one who set the fire, right?

774
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,920
Well,

775
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,720
did you find the arsonist?

776
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,120
No.

777
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,080
I mean,

778
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,800
if that person appears

779
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,880
and apologizes to you,

780
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
will you forgive him?

781
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,400
I don't know.

782
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,880
In fact,

783
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm also as bad as that arsonist.

784
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,520
Someone has been

785
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
taking care of me

786
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,920
and helping me.

787
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,120
He also comforted me when I was sad.

788
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,200
But I keep

789
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,720
cheating him.

790
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,640
It's so terrible to be a bad guy.

791
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes.

792
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,240
I mean, I'm the arsonist.

793
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,800
No,

794
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,800
it's not directly related to me.

795
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,160
Anyhow,

796
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,360
to save me, you got hurt.

797
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,920
Xiaoqi,

798
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,320
I hope you can forgive me.

799
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
Don't mention it.

800
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,960
If you can protect the people you care,

801
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,320
you'll also do it.

802
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,840
Don't think too much.

803
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,200
Don't misunderstand me.

804
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,800
In a word,

805
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,720
I've thought of you as my friend for a long time ago.

806
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,000
I see.

807
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,560
Xiaoqi,

808
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,680
after you are with my brother,

809
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,160
you've changed a lot.

810
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,200
Why?

811
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,360
Well,

812
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,640
you should ask yourself.

813
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,120
OK. OK.

814
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,760
I'll leave.

815
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,480
OK.

816
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,280
OK. OK.

817
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,360
I'll leave. Bye-bye.

818
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,640
Bye-bye.

819
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,400
Bye-bye.

820
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,000
See you tomorrow.

821
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,800
See you tomorrow.

822
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,880
So many tortoises.

823
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,520
Why are you back?

824
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Do I affect your mood?

825
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,640
No.

826
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,120
How's the case

827
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,920
of the sapphire going?

828
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,720
I don't know.

829
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,960
Then

830
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,760
do you think

831
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,240
it may have another owner?

832
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,840
What are you trying to say?

833
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,440
I want to say...

834
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,640
Well,

835
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,800
is it possible that

836
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,000
something

837
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,160
seems to

838
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,480
belong to you,

839
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
but in fact

840
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
it belongs to other?

841
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,120
Really?

842
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,040
So you want me to give up

843
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,720
and let me give it to someone else.

844
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,240
Right?

845
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,920
You also want to say

846
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,840
even if someone stays with me,

847
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,880
her heart doesn't belong to me either, right?

848
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,160
That's pretty much what it means.

849
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,600
It's good that you understand it.

850
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,160
Do you like Fang Lie so much?

851
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,880
What does this have to do with Fang Lie?

852
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,160
You are my girlfriend,

853
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,760
but you got hurt for someone else.

854
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,560
You stay with me for him.

855
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,280
Now you even ask me to give up you to other.

856
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,920
Do you think I am that generous?

857
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,000
I don't.

858
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't...

859
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,000
Listen carefully.

860
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,680
From today on,

861
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
I don't allow you to watch him,

862
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,080
smile at him,

863
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,440
or even like him.

864
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,920
You're my girlfriend.

865
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,560
You can only watch me.

866
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,260
♪I can't lie to myself anymore.♪

870
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,940
Ever since I met you,

871
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,620
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

872
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,020
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

873
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,900
only you.

874
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,100
We're out of reach

875
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,420
but appreciate each other.

876
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:46,220
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

877
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,260
The yearning invades

878
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,820
and lurks in my mind.

879
00:41:53,140 --> 00:42:00,380
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

880
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,460
I'm getting addicted to it

881
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,780
and my sense is shielded.

882
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:14,580
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

883
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,740
Put the hottest heart

884
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,060
in this cold body.

885
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,420
I'm looking at you,

886
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,580
and my love has nowhere to go.

887
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,820
Ever since I met you,

888
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,740
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

889
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,020
Every day is a new memory

890
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,060
which is only be about you and me.

891
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,300
I can't lie to myself anymore.

892
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,140
Please give me the courage to believe.

893
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,060
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

894
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,980
only you.

895
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,100
Even everything becomes silent,

896
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,220
I still have you.
