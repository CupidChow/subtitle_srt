1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm self-willed and act like a baby to make you angry,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,820
but you always stay so calm.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,340
Until you are beaten by my loveliness,

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
I will consider leaving the solar system.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,620
The universe has gravitation, has gravitation,

6
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,060
and you have a fatal attraction to me.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,540
Even the path of half of the universe

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,220
can't stop me.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,660
I have the sadness of being homeless,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,300
while you have the warmth like the sun.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I've been through tens of millions of light-years

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,940
just to be loved by you.

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,980
I am the love of the moon following the planet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,580
You are the charming danger of flying over the asteroid belt.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I've wandered for tens of millions of light-years

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,060
just to be found by you and to be remembered forever.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,460
My Girlfriend is an Alien

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,020
Episode 25

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Go save Xiaoqi.

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Go!

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
The police have detained Allen.

22
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,240
His head was hurt when he resisted.

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
He's receiving treatment now.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,800
He won't have another chance

25
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
to harm Xiaoqi in the future.

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
The company's press conference

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,160
has ended.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,680
You didn't show up

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
and the Board of Directors told the media that

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
you resigned.

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,120
It went

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
as I expected.

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,800
Actually,

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,640
you could have sent other people to rescue Xiaoqi

35
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,000
rather than going there personally.

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,320
I can't do that.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Don't you

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
have any regrets?

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,080
I have.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,400
My regret is that

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,960
the unprecedented products we designed

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,840
won't be known to them.

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
You're such a sleepy head.

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
You scared the hell out of me.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
If anything happened to you,

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,720
I'd lose my mind.

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,760
My brother has already lost his mind.

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
He even...

49
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Go save Xiaoqi.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,480
Go!

51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,320
You two...

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
A fool

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
and a lunatic.

54
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,880
What a perfect match.

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,280
As a fool,

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
you have superb tastes.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,240
After all,

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
your eyes settled on me first.

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,800
Though you tried hard to court me,

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
I have decided to give you up.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,760
Well?

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Are you

63
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
too sad to wake up?

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
It's alright.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,520
You'll learn to accept reality someday.

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,280
Love is not fair

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
in the first place.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
You can

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
settle down with my brother

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
from now on.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,720
How is she?

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
The doctor said she was fine.

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
How is your hand?

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,160
It's okay.

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,480
I'll buy breakfast.

76
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Xiaoqi.

77
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,920
Xiaoqi, are you feeling alright?

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,600
No!

79
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
Xiaoqi, I'm here.

80
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Your hand...

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,400
How is it?

82
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,560
-Is it serious? -I'm alright.

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Tell me,

84
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,120
how do you feel?

85
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Did he do anything to you?

86
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,200
Oh no.

87
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,480
My face.

88
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,920
-My face... -What's wrong?

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,960
What's wrong?

90
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
What's wrong?

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,760
Have you got a mirror?

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,080
Mirror?

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Here.

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Here.

95
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,520
Thank heavens,

96
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,880
no scar is left.

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
Are you saying he cut your face with a blade?

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
No.

99
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,480
He...

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,920
He just touched my face with his hand.

101
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,800
So, no scar is left.

102
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
How dare he touch you?

103
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Wash it off.

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,520
Hum.

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,640
This is how you wipe it clean?

106
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,920
I almost lost you.

107
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,800
Why are you smiling?

108
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
Because you look like an old man.

109
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
Don't you look like an old woman?

110
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
Of course.

111
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,280
I will grow old with you.

112
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

113
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,720
Odd.

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
I simply had a bump.

115
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,680
Why can't I stand?

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
How can it be?

117
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,160
My superpowers...

118
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
Is your wound hurting?

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,920
I...

120
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,400
I...

121
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,440
I want to handle it alone.

122
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,640
Can you wait for me outside?

123
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,520
Okay.

124
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,040
Be careful.

125
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,320
Yes.

126
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,560
Call me if you need anything.

127
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,120
I will.

128
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,240
Go.

129
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,920
Xiaoqi.

130
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,560
What happened?

131
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,640
Let me send you to hospital.

132
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm fine.

133
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,040
Just too hungry.

134
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Feeling a little dizzy.

135
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
Can you send me home?

136
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,360
I want to eat the foods cooked by Ms. Chai.

137
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,160
Alright.

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,600
Ms. Zhou Siqin.

139
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,000
Your son is having a bad mood.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Please make it short.

141
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,280
Aw.

142
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,480
You didn't come home last night.

143
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,640
Where have you been?

144
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
I watched a movie at midnight.

145
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,960
The prince and the princess lived together in the end.

146
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,120
The knight and the devil king

147
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,760
lived together happily as well.

148
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,400
What is this nonsense?

149
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
Come home right now.

150
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,360
I need to talk to you about something important.

151
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Do you know

152
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
the Board of Directors decided

153
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,280
to lay off Fang Leng?

154
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,400
Mom.

155
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
How can it be?

156
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,840
Explain it to me.

157
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
Come home now.

158
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,920
We'll talk at home.

159
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,080
You're back.

160
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,480
Ms. Chai.

161
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Please give us food.

162
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,080
She didn't come back last night.

163
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
And they are still cuddling.

164
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,680
Go back.

165
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,480
I'm fine.

166
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,240
You're hungry, not fine.

167
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,640
I'll fetch you food.

168
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,000
Do it slowly.

169
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,360
There are so many things that I want to eat.

170
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,320
No rush.

171
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,840
Ah.

172
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,560
Got it.

173
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
Kubri.

174
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
Do a scan.

175
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,560
I have done a scan.

176
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,200
The foul odor of love is all over the place.

177
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,360
No, I need you to scan me.

178
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know

179
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
what Allen injected me with.

180
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm feeling ill.

181
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,760
Oh no.

182
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,560
Xiaoqi.

183
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
You have lost too much blood.

184
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Your magnetic field is chaotic.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
Is Earth's gravity

186
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,640
causing you pain now?

187
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
Raising my head is enough to tire me out.

188
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,320
Well, Xiaoqi,

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,960
are you feeling better now?

190
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,360
I think I'm feeling much better.

191
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
Kubri, you're so powerful.

192
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
It's not my doing.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,680
I just activated your survival system.

194
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm telling you this seriously.

195
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,800
Unknown electrolytes have entered your body.

196
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,200
If you don't return to your home planet
for treatment in time,

197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,920
you would even have difficulty standing.

198
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,640
In earthly words,

199
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,920
you might become paralyzed.

200
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,560
Paralyzed?

201
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,280
Xiaoqi.

202
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,400
It's time to eat.

203
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,160
Coming.

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,920
Xiaoqi. Xiaoqi.

205
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
You can't eat.

206
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,080
You don't have the extra energy

207
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,440
to digest Earth food.

208
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,960
Then...

209
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,560
Don't go.

210
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,240
Don't eat anything, Xiaoqi.

211
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,080
Xiaoqi!

212
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,200
So many foods.

213
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Ms. Chai said

214
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,640
these are your favorite foods.

215
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,920
Let me feed you.

216
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,880
I

217
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,120
suddenly don't feel hungry.

218
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,160
How is it possible?

219
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,880
It's true.

220
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,280
Don't eat, Xiaoqi.

221
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,760
Here.

222
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,760
You can't eat, Xiaoqi.

223
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,720
Is it delicious?

224
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,640
Good, right?

225
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,200
It's warm.

226
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,080
It smells good.

227
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,360
Good girl.

228
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
Heck.

229
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,240
Just wait for your energy to drain.

230
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,800
You will be crawling on Earth.

231
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
Is Kubri talking to you?

232
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,960
Uh...

233
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
It's saying

234
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,120
thank you.

235
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,240
No problem.

236
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,000
Can you ask it

237
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,880
to leave us alone

238
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,360
when I come over?

239
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
Why?

240
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,520
Never mind.

241
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,440
Here.

242
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,400
Try a chicken leg.

243
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,560
For nourishment.

244
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm not hungry anymore.

245
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,680
Here.

246
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,340
=Red alert. Hurry to the company. =

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,080
I need to go.

248
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,280
Go on eating.

249
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Then take a good rest.

250
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,360
Yes.

251
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,760
Good. I'll get going.

252
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,760
Bye-bye.

253
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,820
Poor Xiaoqi.

254
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Our news is

255
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,760
affected by the southeastern coastal typhoon,

256
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,960
the city will experience

257
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,720
the heaviest rainfall of the second half of the year.

258
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,760
Mr. Fang.

259
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,280
Here are the latest flight offers.

260
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,400
Check it out.

261
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,480
Which flight will you take?

262
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,480
Why should I leave?

263
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,960
Hey.

264
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,240
You saw it.

265
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,080
Rain is coming.

266
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,400
You'll lose your memories once it rains.

267
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,680
So many people are watching you right now.

268
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
Let them watch.

269
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,440
I went into hiding for multiple times.

270
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
This time, I'm not going anywhere.

271
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,400
I'll just stay here.

272
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,160
So, your plan is to wait?

273
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,280
Of course not.

274
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,320
Doctor Zhang,

275
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
I need you to help me do something.

276
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,640
Say it.

277
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,720
I will rebuild Chai Xiaoqi's database.

278
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,320
How is that going to work?

279
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,720
How can your database of her

280
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,680
change anything?

281
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,320
We tried so many times.

282
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,360
But you still forgot her.

283
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,320
I think

284
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
you should just take Xiaoqi away this time.

285
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,360
No way.

286
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,560
I want to try again.

287
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,720
I don't believe that

288
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,600
people are manipulated by their memories.

289
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,160
The most unforgettable things

290
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,080
are not memories,

291
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,000
but feelings.

292
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,840
Okay.

293
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,760
How are you gonna do it?

294
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,360
I will collect her data personally.

295
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,800
This time, I won't allow

296
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
Xiaoqi to escape

297
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,040
from my mind.

298
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,880
Xiaoqi.

299
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Xiaoqi, are you okay?

300
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
I don't think

301
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,120
I can hold on any longer.

302
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm going to Fang Leng right now.

303
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,120
I will take out the annunciator to save you.

304
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,680
At this point,

305
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,040
I don't care

306
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,920
even if I have to kill him.

307
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,720
Kubri.

308
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,600
Don't stop me.

309
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,000
Kubri.

310
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,960
Argh.

311
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,040
I'm so tired.

312
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,040
Luckily, you are living inside a tortoise.

313
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,960
Otherwise,

314
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
I might not be able to stop you.

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,560
Now you can't even survive

316
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,360
and you're still thinking for that Earth man.

317
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,520
I won't take away

318
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,760
the annunciator from him.

319
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I won't risk his life again.

320
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,080
If he dies,

321
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,400
I wouldn't want to live.

322
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,120
Stupid Xiaoqi.

323
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,560
A lowly life like a paramecium.

324
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,040
Don't you know

325
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,440
Fang Leng would think so too?

326
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,160
If you die,

327
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
would Fang Leng keep on living?

328
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,680
It's fine.

329
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
He'll forget me.

330
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,160
His old self will.

331
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
But now,

332
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,680
he cherishes you.

333
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,160
Take Allen for example.

334
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,280
If that blade tilted a little,

335
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,960
he would be dead.

336
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,520
No.

337
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,280
I must make him forget me.

338
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,600
Rain.

339
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,680
That's right. Rain.

340
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,360
Before rain comes,

341
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,800
I will destroy his memory bank,

342
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
so he will forget me.

343
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,160
Xiaoqi,

344
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,320
you can barely stand now.

345
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,000
Focus on yourself.

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
I can stand.

347
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,400
I just

348
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,440
need to remove

349
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,360
all my superpowers

350
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,440
and use all my energy

351
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,720
to stand and walk.

352
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,800
That will do.

353
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,040
Are you nuts?

354
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,360
You will lose the last chance to return home.

355
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,680
Xiaoqi.

356
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,760
What are you doing?

357
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
No, Xiaoqi.

358
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,120
No.

359
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,160
Xiaoqi.

360
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Stop.

361
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,440
The mermaid traded her tail

362
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
for a chance to become bubbles.

363
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm doing way better than her.

364
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,160
The prince loved me after all.

365
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,440
Your uncle is waiting at the company.

366
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
Are you going or not?

367
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,000
Mom.

368
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,320
Going there at this time

369
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
is hitting my brother when he's down.

370
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,200
Your brother is doomed.

371
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,520
He was absent from the press conference yesterday.

372
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
The whole Board of Directors

373
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,240
is unhappy about him.

374
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,640
He didn't miss it intentionally.

375
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,320
He was going...

376
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,880
What?

377
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
Are you trying to defend him?

378
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,480
Fang Lie.

379
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,520
I'm telling you,

380
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,320
you can be wilful all you want,

381
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,000
but you don't get to

382
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
call the shots today.

383
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
What do you want me to do?

384
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
Replace Fang Leng

385
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,640
and take over the company.

386
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,640
You know I don't have that talent.

387
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,760
My dad knows it too.

388
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,680
Don't worry.

389
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,520
Your uncle and subordinates will help you.

390
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,240
When I say you have that talent,

391
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,040
you have.

392
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,360
How come I can't talk any sense into you?

393
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,320
Forget it. I'm not talking to you.

394
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,920
I'll talk to my dad.

395
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,600
Stop right there.

396
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,000
Listen to me.

397
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,320
If you dare to give it up in front of your father,

398
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,240
I will try every means

399
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,600
to make the lives of Chai Xiaoqi and Fang Leng miserable.

400
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,840
You know

401
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,360
that.

402
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm capable of such things.

403
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,080
Assistant Han.

404
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,560
You got here so early.

405
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,680
You came at the right time.

406
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,360
Come here.

407
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,720
Does this wishing wall look familiar?

408
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,320
How do you know this store?

409
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,440
Mr. Fang has been building his memory bank.

410
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,120
This photo was

411
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,560
taken from that store.

412
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,640
Oh.

413
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,440
Back then,

414
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,680
you two were so lovey-dovey.

415
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,760
It was...

416
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,720
It was a misunderstanding.

417
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
Stop.

418
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,840
How far did your relationship

419
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,440
go in this restaurant?

420
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,360
Did you pledge your love here?

421
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,640
Yeah.

422
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,200
Tell the details.

423
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,680
For instance,

424
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,880
did you kiss?

425
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,000
You...

426
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,920
You...

427
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,280
Uh...

428
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,680
It's old history.

429
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,400
Don't be so gossipy.

430
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,480
We aren't being gossipy.

431
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,920
I must carry out an objective and detailed investigation.

432
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,320
Mr. Fang will need my materials

433
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,560
to retrieve his memories

434
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
after he loses them.

435
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,560
I can tell you.

436
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,680
But in return,

437
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,520
can you take me

438
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,360
to Fang Leng's memory bank?

439
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,840
I'm afraid not.

440
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,440
Just show me around.

441
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,120
Perhaps, it'd enable me

442
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,680
to help you with memory retrieving

443
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,320
in a more objective

444
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,120
and detailed way.

445
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,360
But even if I take you there,

446
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,440
without Mr. Fang's

447
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
pupil for verification,

448
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,520
none of us can enter the memory bank.

449
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,200
So much trouble.

450
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,720
If only I still have my superpowers.

451
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,600
It's not impossible

452
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,440
for you to see the memory bank.

453
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,280
I just need you to cooperate with me on one thing.

454
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
What is it?

455
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,880
Oh.

456
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,080
Here.

457
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,440
Look this way.

458
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,120
Good. Very good.

459
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,600
Closer.

460
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,320
Hold her tighter.

461
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,440
Alright.

462
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Get ready.

463
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,400
Three, two, one.

464
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,920
Nice.

465
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,600
From now on, we will take a photo

466
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,000
every day and put it here.

467
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
If I lose my memories,

468
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
we can put it here,

469
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,280
so every diner here

470
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,760
will be our witness.

471
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,480
I want to not only retrieve my memories of us,

472
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
but also create more memories.

473
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,680
What do you say?

474
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,880
We have taken the photo.

475
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,920
When will you take me to the memory bank?

476
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,480
No rush.

477
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,320
There's one more thing.

478
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,860
Don't let me lie here

479
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,060
until I forget you.

480
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,980
Stop talking about it, OK?

481
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,840
Dumb.

482
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,920
How is it dumb?

483
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
The female protagonist's amnesia
affects the male protagonist.

484
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,640
Since they can't be together,

485
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,960
they should separate.

486
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,560
Why break each other's heart?

487
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
So, you think

488
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,480
mismatched people shouldn't be together?

489
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,400
They aren't equal in every way.

490
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,120
The relationship

491
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,480
has been a mistake from the start.

492
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,120
Are you trying to irritate me

493
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,280
because I forgot you?

494
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,480
I...

495
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,960
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,120
I hate to disturb you.

497
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,800
But this is so touching.

498
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
So sad.

499
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,240
Here. Wipe your tears.

500
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,720
It's alright. We understand.

501
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,880
You don't understand.

502
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,240
Ms. Chai.

503
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,720
Why are you here?

504
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,760
I invited her.

505
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,760
Huh?

506
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
What are you doing?

507
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,280
Giving you a lesson.

508
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,400
Hum?

509
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,720
The reason I invited you here today

510
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,040
is to help you understand my illness better.

511
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,720
Many diseases can cause amnesia.

512
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,720
Unfortunately,

513
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,840
I contracted one of these diseases.

514
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,560
I have escaped in the past few years.

515
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Now, I no longer want to escape.

516
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,640
I want to face it.

517
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,440
I want to overcome it.

518
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,400
So touching.

519
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,320
It's alright.

520
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,160
How are you going to overcome it?

521
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,560
You just need to

522
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,000
cooperate with me as I planned.

523
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,880
What's more,

524
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,240
if I lose my memories again,

525
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,720
please don't

526
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,320
come to me all of a sudden.

527
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,000
You know

528
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,720
I don't like proactive girls.

529
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,320
Who are you calling proactive?

530
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,520
Tsk.

531
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,560
Mr. Fang, just leave it to me.

532
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,320
I promise I will restrain her emotions.

533
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,200
Okay.

534
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,520
Moreover,

535
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,440
after I lose my memories,

536
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,080
hand Xiaoqi's profile to me as soon as possible.

537
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
Doctor Zhang, I'll leave it to you.

538
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,880
Okay.

539
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,920
The most important thing is

540
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
that I don't want Xiaoqi to be hurt

541
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,560
when I'm undergoing memory loss.

542
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,120
Ms. Chai,

543
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,480
I need your help.

544
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,280
No problem. Leave it to me.

545
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,760
I have thought it over.

546
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,640
I will record a video for her.

547
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,760
If she gets mad when I'm undergoing memory loss,

548
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,240
play the video for her.

549
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,440
Mr. Fang, are you going to say all the sweet words

550
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,800
to my Xiaoqi in the video?

551
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,560
So sweet.

552
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,480
Not really.

553
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,480
In the video, I will just

554
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,520
tell a certain person that

555
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,880
if people give up each other
just because they're mismatched,

556
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
no relationship in this world

557
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,360
would last until the end.

558
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,720
If you truly love someone,

559
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,600
you should be together with him forever.

560
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,920
No matter what the price is, it's worth it.

561
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,320
Hum.

562
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
I'll get out for some fresh air.

563
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
Are the stars so attractive?

564
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
The lights here are too dazzling.

565
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,720
They even cover the stars.

566
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,880
Then let's go back.

567
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,480
The wind is strong.

568
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,800
I don't want you to fall ill when I'm undergoing memory loss.

569
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
I know I'm not the type

570
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,520
that takes care of strangers.

571
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,960
What to do?

572
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,320
I want your special ability so much.

573
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,920
Special ability?

574
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,600
Do you want to forget me?

575
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,920
Huh?

576
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,480
I'm having

577
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,640
mixed feelings right now.

578
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,000
No more thinking.

579
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,040
It's a little cold indeed.

580
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,360
Let's go back.

581
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,600
I know

582
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,320
I hurt you the last time I lost my memories.

583
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,040
I failed to remember you.

584
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,720
But, even if we both forget each other,

585
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
we'd still end up together.

586
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,440
Look at the stars in the sky.

587
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Each star has its own trajectory.

588
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,680
I'm convinced that your mass and gravity

589
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
will guide you to me

590
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,840
again and again.

591
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
So, don't think too much.

592
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,280
Alright?

593
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,560
But some stars

594
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
leave their orbits

595
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,080
and turn into space debris.

596
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,960
The moment I disappear on Earth,

597
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,760
I probably disappear in the whole universe.

598
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,880
What is going on

599
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,080
in your little head?

600
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,240
I should be the one saying sorry.

602
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,120
I shouldn't have taken you here to watch a sad movie.

603
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,640
I shouldn't have

604
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,760
pressed you to

605
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,240
face our problems.

606
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,040
But,

607
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,520
there are some problems we should face.

608
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,520
I don't want to think about those things.

609
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,720
I just...

610
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,680
I fear that I'd lose you.

611
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I fear that you won't be with me.

612
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,960
I fear.

613
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,440
How can you not be confident?

614
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,080
Huh?

615
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,120
Perhaps,

616
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,760
when I forget you

617
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,040
and meet you again,

618
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,520
I'll fall in love with you at first sight

619
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,400
and can't stop thinking about you?

620
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
You won't be like that.

621
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,560
Smile.

622
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,160
Smile.

623
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,000
You look your best when you smile, you know?

624
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,920
Don't have any fear.

625
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,720
Hum.

626
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
I have a favor to ask.

627
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,200
I want

628
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,640
our memories.

629
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,720
Can you give me

630
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,160
the key of the memory bank?

631
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,960
It contains our memories anyway.

632
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,160
At least,

633
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,320
you can use it to evoke my memories of you

634
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,040
when I'm undergoing memory loss.

635
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,000
Thank you.

636
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,200
Thank you for making me

637
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,160
understand love.

638
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,720
Here.

639
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,720
If you need any information in the future,
you can always come to me.

640
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,760
I'll open the door for you.

641
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,400
Look there.

642
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,880
Wow.

643
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,520
Your iris information

644
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,840
has been input into our system.

645
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,640
From now on, you only need to use your eyes

646
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,760
to unlock it.

647
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,120
Oh.

648
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
Why is this place so tightly guarded?

649
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,200
Because hackers attacked it once.

650
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,960
So, we strengthened our defense system.

651
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,440
Oh.

652
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,280
Are these Fang Leng's memories?

653
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,600
Not all of them are.

654
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,000
Only some of his memories have been restored.

655
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
Why are you doing nothing?

656
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,560
Start planting the virus.

657
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,400
Got it.

658
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,880
Time is up.

659
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,920
We should leave.

660
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,320
Mr. Fang is waiting for us.

661
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,200
Okay.

662
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,800
Come on.

663
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,360
Yes.

664
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,360
Alright.

665
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,040
If Fang Leng ever relapses,

666
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,880
your help would be appreciated.

667
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,520
No problem.

668
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Mr. Fang, you are still here.

669
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,120
Chairman's wife has come to visit you.

670
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,320
It's nothing important.

671
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
It's just that my boy Lie

672
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,880
answered a call in a hurry.

673
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,160
He's asked to assume the general manager's position.

674
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,520
And his office

675
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,600
doesn't have anything decent.

676
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
This marble desk is nice.

677
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,000
You no longer need it anyway.

678
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,160
Guys.

679
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,960
Move the marble desk

680
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,120
to Fang Lie's office.

681
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,680
What are you doing?

682
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,360
Nobody touches it.

683
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Let them take it.

684
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,000
It's just a desk.

685
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,440
Since you have always been

686
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,920
coveting my desk,

687
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,160
you might as well take the chair too.

688
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,880
Come and take it.

689
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,680
Take it.

690
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,000
Hurry. Move it.

691
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,680
-Take them all. -Come on.

692
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,480
What are you doing?

693
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,320
Take the general manager's nameplate

694
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,400
away along with these things.

695
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,560
Stop it.

696
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,600
This place only deserves to be a warehouse.

697
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,880
Why are you still here?

698
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,480
Get out.

699
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:48,960
You...

700
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,600
Get up.

701
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,080
I respect you as my elder.

702
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,720
But you'd better not push your luck.

703
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
Thank heavens,

704
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,320
you remember that I'm your elder.

705
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,360
Have you forgotten

706
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,600
how you repressed me and my son?

707
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,880
I thought your illness has turned you against your family.

708
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,360
Mom.

709
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,840
Why are you here?

710
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,400
Son.

711
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
I came here to tidy your place.

712
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,480
But I can't even decide where a desk should be put.

713
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,120
Mom.

714
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,120
Aren't you going too far?

715
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,280
So many people are watching.

716
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,120
I need them to watch

717
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,160
and find out whose side you are on.

718
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,440
Fang Lie.

719
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,040
Come with me.

720
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,560
I need to talk things out with you.

721
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,280
Son.

722
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,280
Fine. I'm not afraid of you.

723
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,560
Uh...

724
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,360
What are you looking at?

725
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Start working.

726
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,720
Come in. Hurry up and move things.

727
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,520
Madam. After you.

728
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,960
What do you need to talk about?

729
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,360
My mother is also your mother.

730
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,760
Can't you leave her

731
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,600
with a certain degree of dignity?

732
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
That's why I asked you to come here.

733
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,240
I need to tell you something.

734
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,160
What is it?

735
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,760
Rain is coming.

736
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,800
Sometimes, I think about

737
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,840
the ways to make

738
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,760
Xiaoqi happier

739
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,160
after I lose my memories.

740
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,200
So you brought me here

741
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,320
with a straight face for this?

742
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
I love Xiaoqi.

743
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,400
But I think you and her have more in common

744
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,880
regarding hobbies and interests.

745
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,640
Whether it's a snack or perfume...

746
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
You think that's important?

747
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,240
No matter how good the food is,

748
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
or how fun the place is,

749
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,160
she always thinks about you.

750
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,760
As the saying goes,

751
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,360
"Water can feed you to satiety as long as you have love."

752
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,160
When you are with her,

753
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,640
she is happy.

754
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,680
Is that so?

755
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
If not,

756
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,960
I wouldn't give her up.

757
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,680
So you have finally given her up?

758
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,200
What else can I do?

759
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,600
Steal my brother's girl

760
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
while he's undergoing memory loss?

761
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
I'm warning you. Don't even think about it.

762
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,520
Rest assured that

763
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,640
I will make it clear to Xiaoqi.

764
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,040
I don't want her to

765
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,120
feel awkward between us.

766
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,720
By the way,

767
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,360
if you have any work-related problems,

768
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,840
just contact Assistant Han.

769
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
I know Uncle Kang has been helping you at the company,

770
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,120
but he has little knowledge

771
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,760
about certain things.

772
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,600
Alright. Got it.

773
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,560
Get better soon.

774
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,200
Got to go.

775
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,720
Aw.

776
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,120
Kubri.

777
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
Help me find a way

778
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,480
to open the outer door.

779
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,800
It requires an authority card of the company executives.

780
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,040
I'll try to find other ways.

781
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,160
Hurry up. Hurry up. We don't have much time.

782
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,560
Oh.

783
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,000
Xiaoqi?

784
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,800
Why are you here?

785
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,280
Ah.

786
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,160
Who are you talking to?

787
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,040
No one.

788
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,840
Come here.

789
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,760
I need to talk to you.

790
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,160
Aw.

791
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,040
No, I'm busy.

792
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,600
Can you do me a favor?

793
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,200
What?

794
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,560
Come here. Use your card.

795
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,320
No.

796
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,120
This is my brother's data room.

797
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,040
I may have replaced him as President,

798
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,600
but I can't enter his data room at will.

799
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,520
Please.

800
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,760
Just do me a favor, okay?

801
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,720
I'm begging you, Fang Lie.

802
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,320
Please.

803
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,000
No.

804
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,840
Go ask my brother if you want to enter the data room.

805
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,880
If he says yes, then yes.

806
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,080
Forget it.

807
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,200
I wonder

808
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,520
if my superpowers still work.

809
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,520
Xiaoqi.

810
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,800
Xiaoqi.

811
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,840
Are you crazy?

812
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,400
Are you

813
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,840
alright...

814
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,760
Xiaoqi.

815
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,720
Why is your blood blue?

816
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,700
Ever since I met you,

817
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,380
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

818
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,780
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

819
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,660
only you.

820
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,860
We're out of reach

821
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,180
but appreciate each other.

822
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:19,980
I keep going and run into your track somehow.

823
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,020
The yearning invades

824
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,580
and lurks in my mind.

825
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:34,140
The more I want to escape, the more
I am pulled by it bearing pains.

826
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,220
I'm getting addicted to it

827
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,540
and my sense is shielded.

828
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,340
There is no trace of the reason for this moment.

829
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,500
Put the hottest heart

830
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,820
in this cold body.

831
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,180
I'm looking at you,

832
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,340
and my love has nowhere to go.

833
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,580
Ever since I met you,

834
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,500
I've just wanted to forget all the past.

835
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,780
Every day is a new memory

836
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,820
which is only be about you and me.

837
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,060
I can't lie to myself anymore.

838
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,900
Please give me the courage to believe.

839
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,820
The love I want doesn't have the date of return,

840
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,740
only you.

841
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,860
Even everything becomes silent,

842
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,980
I still have you.
