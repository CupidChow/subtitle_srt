- Episode 26 -
My Girlfriend is an Alien

3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Xiaobu,

4
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,800
Is there anything you can do

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,440
to open this door?

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,560
It requires cards from senior executive.

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,840
Let's see what I can do.

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,440
Hurry up,

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
I am running out of time.

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,120
Xiaoqi?

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,720
Why are you here?

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,280
Ah?

13
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,120
Who are you talking to?

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,040
No one.

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,800
Come with me.

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
I need you on something.

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
No. I am busy.

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,680
Could you do me a favor?

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,480
What?

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,360
Here. Borrow me your card.

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,120
No. No way.

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
This is my brother's reference room.

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
Though I've substituted him for president,

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,790
I can't get in his place without his permission.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,560
Please.

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,840
Just do me a favor, could you?

27
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,760
Please. Fang Lie.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,400
I beg you.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,120
I can't.

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,040
If you really want to get in, go talk to my brother.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,090
He will let you in if he want.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,000
Well then.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,120
I have no idea whether

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,590
my superpower still works.

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,680
Xiaoqi.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,680
Xiaoqi.

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,120
Are you crazy?

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Why don't you...

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,040
Xiaoqi.

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,960
Why is your blood blue?

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
You have to explain it.

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
Why is your blood blue?

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
Don't fool me with your theory that you're alien.

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm not three years old.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,480
Since you don't buy it,

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,680
no use of saying it then.

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Given that you're alien,

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
you should have something like superpower, right?

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
For me,

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
my only superpower left

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,240
is to keep me walking on my feet,

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
and not faint easily.

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,280
How can I help you then?

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,440
Mr. Fang,

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,760
are you OK?

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
Fine.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,840
Zhou Siqin is just building her authority

58
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,320
through such trifle.

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,960
Let her be.

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,720
After the board announced your dimission,

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
the project you were in charge of

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,360
was also sent back.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,080
These are files about that perfume.

64
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
The lab has given the result of the test.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
= Hormone Perfume
Experimental Result =

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,950
= Hormone Perfume
Experimental Result =

67
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,960
Where is Xiaoqi?

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,080
I don't know.

69
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,920
Probably she has returned home.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,200
What's wrong?

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,800
Missing such important project

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,840
is such a pity.

73
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Xiaoqi and Fang Lie seem to have

74
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,960
proposed similar perfume project before.

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,560
What's the difference?

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
Those are ordinary perfume products.

77
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
This one is different.

78
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,840
It's better to call it a hallucinatory magic

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,080
than to call it a mere normal perfume.

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
Magic?

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
Under this perfume's stimulation, test mice secretes

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
distinctly more dopamine.

83
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
It can last for three minutes.

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
Within the three minutes,

85
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,280
it can cause a hallucination of love.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,880
Simply put,

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
it's a bottle of perfume

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,640
that can let people fall in love.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,680
It's developed

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,470
much far than

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,920
the category as simple perfume.

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
Why does Xiaoqi know how to make this?

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
We have to ask her about it.

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Xiaoqi.

95
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,200
You're crying?

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,520
No.

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Files are too many.

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,960
My eyes even sweat for deleting them.

99
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
If it hurts you to do so,

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,280
just stop then.

101
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,240
If

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
you can't stay with your loved one always,

103
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,400
would you let him keep the memories alone?

104
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,200
Happier these memories are,

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
more they hurt.

106
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,120
It was me who deviated

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
and came on the earth.

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,160
Just let me

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
bear these sufferings.

110
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,760
Not good.

111
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
Let's run. Now.

112
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,360
My brother is coming.

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,080
- Hurry up. - I haven't finished deleting.

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,160
Don't worry.

115
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,980
I'll guard it here for you.

116
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,640
Just go.

117
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,560
I've treated you like that.

118
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,640
Why help me so much?

119
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,840
Just go!

120
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
Go now!

121
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,840
Fang Lie!

122
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,640
No matter you're earthling or alien,

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,120
we're the same kind.

124
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,160
I know you would never

125
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,280
do things that can harm my brother.

126
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,200
That was the general situation of this project.

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,240
But it still

128
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
may need your personal check.

129
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,250
Memory bank has been breached.

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,270
I'll call the security office.

131
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,280
OK. Make them quick.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Fang Lie. Get out now.

133
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,040
Wait there!

134
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
A few minutes more!

135
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Brother.

136
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Brother, wait.

137
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
Deleting will finish soon.

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,360
Brother.

139
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Who allowed you?

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,520
It's been too late, brother.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,680
It's done.

142
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Why are you doing this?

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
I just can't get used to you being with Xiaoqi.

144
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,680
I'm jealous.

145
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Where is Xiaoqi?

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do you want her for?

147
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
I'm the culprit.

148
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,880
Do it to me if you want anything.

149
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,520
Only she

150
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,040
dares do such thing with me around.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,400
She wants to give up.

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,760
But I don't grant it.

153
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,760
Brother!

154
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,200
You're back.

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,640
Xiaoqi.

156
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,400
What are you doing, Xiaoqi?

157
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
What are you doing?

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,320
These were pasted by Mr. Fang himself.

159
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
What are you doing?

160
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,680
Ms. Chai.

161
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,720
I have to go.

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
I have to go to somewhere far.

163
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,720
Somewhere Fang Leng can't find me.

164
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,120
What's it?

165
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,880
You two had a fight?

166
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,240
I'm sick.

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,400
Severe sickness.

168
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,920
To let him forget me

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,240
is better than to let him suffer with me.

170
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,240
You're suffering from your princess fantasy.

171
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,920
Tell you what,

172
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,520
the biggest taboo

173
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,280
in a relationship is to propose to break up easily.

174
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,920
You know?

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,120
I don't want to quit either.

176
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,840
The one I love also loves me.

177
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,000
Isn't that the best thing?

178
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,160
But I've ruined it.

179
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,290
Inform the technical department.

180
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
No matter what ways they take,

181
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
data must be retrieved.

182
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,520
I go find Chai Xiaoqi.

183
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,850
She can't run away from me.

184
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Here. Drink something hot.

185
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,840
It seems going to rain.

186
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,840
Xiaoqi.

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,560
Tell me.

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,280
Those memories you deleted

189
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,560
can be retrieved?

190
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,880
I used the strongest virus.

191
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,840
All computers there were destroyed.

192
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,800
How can you be so willful?

193
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,680
Do you know?

194
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,980
Maintain a relationship

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,560
is not gonna be smooth all the way,

196
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,560
Happiness and sadness both exist.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,920
You can't desert it because it's of sadness now.

198
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,240
What if that happiness is poisonous?

199
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,920
It's not only poisonous to me

200
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,960
but to him.

201
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,600
I know that sound.

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,800
Mr. Fang's car.

203
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,800
Is he coming to catch you?

204
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,200
Ms. Chai.

205
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
Do we have some tunnel or what?

206
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,320
The kind for emergency.

207
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,840
Whatever the tunnel is OK.

208
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,320
No.

209
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,000
But there's a bar tender.

210
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,160
You can hide.

211
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,960
I'll cover you.

212
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,560
OK.

213
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,160
Chai Xiaoqi. Show up.

214
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,560
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

215
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
We've closed today.

216
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,040
Please visit us in another time.

217
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
I call the last time.

218
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
Chai Xiaoqi.

219
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,120
She is not hiding behind the bar!

220
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,520
How can I help you?

221
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,480
Let me down!

222
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,440
Hey!

223
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,800
Ms. Chai.

224
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Let me down!

225
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
Xiaoqi, you such a dummy.

226
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
I've been covering for you.

227
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,920
Why did you stand up?

228
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,800
Fang Leng.

229
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,360
Let me down!

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,600
Or I will stop acting nicely!

231
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,880
Have you considered about the

232
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
consequence when you're deleting memories?

233
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,200
I have.

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,720
If I hadn't deleted them,

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,600
they'd get you harmed.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
So you have planned it already.

237
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,320
For deleting my memories,

238
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,760
you've been lying to me from the beginning.

239
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,720
You can always say it out

240
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,850
if you have a problem with my sickness.

241
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,080
I won't force you to be with me.

242
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,000
Not like that.

243
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,440
But that's what I saw.

244
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,440
I made all the efforts

245
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
to enhance the safety system of memory bank

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,200
just in case of the intrusion from the best hackers

247
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,480
that threat the company.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,080
But I couldn't imagine,

249
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,040
it was you two that breached it.

250
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
One is who I'm most familiar with.

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
One is who I love most.

252
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,320
Good for you two.

253
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,360
Sorry.

254
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
I don't need your sorry.

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
I didn't have a choice.

256
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,560
Can't you understand my language?

258
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,480
I don't want your sorry.

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,120
Sorry.

260
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,040
Sorry.

261
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,120
I just want to know

262
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,840
you are that eager to get rid of me?

263
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,640
It's raining soon.

264
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,720
Go back now.

265
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,200
Or after your amnesia,

266
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,360
I can't explain to you

267
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
why you're in my place.

268
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,120
I don't care about the rain.

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,600
And I don't care that you deleted my memories.

270
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,440
What I do care is

271
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,920
whether you are still willing to be with me.

272
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,680
Did you get something hard to tell?

273
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,920
Just tell me, Xiaoqi.

274
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
Sometimes I do wish

275
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,160
you could totally delete my memory bank.

276
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,720
Feelings can't be deleted. Xiaoqi.

277
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,200
Every time I forgot you

278
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
we eventually reunited.

279
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,880
Every time you tried to run away,

280
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,920
you still couldn't run away from me.

281
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,400
I also can't run away from you.

282
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,400
Could you please go outside now?

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
We both need to calm down.

284
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll give you time to calm down.

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,640
But I also need your answer.

286
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Ask your heart,

287
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,200
if it will be touched by me again,

288
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,280
if it still desires to

289
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,320
accompany me till the end like you said before.

290
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
Mr. Fang. Let's wait inside the car.

291
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
It's going to rain.

292
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,400
Wait.

293
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,160
Xiaoqi. Xiaqoi.

294
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
He's still standing down there.

295
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Rain is coming.

296
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,360
He will forget all these.

297
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,080
Mr. Fang.

298
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,800
You should wait inside the car.

299
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,680
It

300
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
is about to rain.

301
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,600
You may go back.

302
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,960
But once the rain falls down,

303
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,080
you might...

304
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,320
If this is what she wants,

305
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I can take it.

306
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,600
Just go down there.

307
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,600
Sorry.

308
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,400
Xiaoqi is still...

309
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,920
How about taking shelter inside?

310
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,920
I probably won't come to bother you again.

311
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,360
Wait a second.

312
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Give me a chance to persuade her.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Mom!

314
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,360
Mom! Don't go! Mom!

315
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
Mom!

316
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,680
I don't want you to be my mom and dad anymore.

317
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,680
Fang Leng.

318
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
It's raining outside.

319
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,560
Just go home!

320
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,200
I don't want home. I want my mom.

321
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,240
Mom!

322
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,800
Don't go.

323
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,200
Don't go! Mom!

324
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,760
Don't leave me!

325
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,640
Mom!

326
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,480
Wake up! Mom!

327
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,920
Let's go home together!

328
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,600
Mom!

329
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,640
Mom!

330
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,600
Fang Leng! What's wrong?

331
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,840
Fang Leng!

332
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,160
What's wrong with you?

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Fang Leng!

334
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Fang Leng!

335
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,880
Fang Leng.

336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,040
Don't you feel

337
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,360
we're the same kind?

338
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,280
What are you doing?

339
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,040
What are you going to do to him?

340
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,880
I like you.

341
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,200
Here lies something very important to me.

342
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,640
Fang Leng.

343
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,480
Fang Leng.

344
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Fang Leng.

345
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,920
Wake up, Fang Leng!

346
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,400
Let's go home!

347
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Wake up!

348
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,360
Fang Leng.

349
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,960
Xiaoqi.

350
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,360
Why don't you get in?

351
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
How is he now?

352
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,840
He...

353
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,320
He is still in coma.

354
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,240
And the situation is also unclear.

355
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,120
But considering

356
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,600
the situation of his last time,

357
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,320
it's more complicated this time.

358
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
Ah?

359
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,400
But easy now.

360
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,680
Don't worry too much.

361
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,680
It's OK now.

362
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,280
Thanks.

363
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,800
My brother might

364
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,280
have been stricken by his anger to us.

365
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,280
Don't worry.

366
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,800
Thanks for still helping me.

367
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
My identity

368
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,080
must have freaked you out.

369
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,080
Of course.

370
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,800
I was frightened like I made a billion.

371
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I prepared many questions about the cosmos after I went back.

372
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I thought

373
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,600
maybe this time some difficult problems about the universe

374
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,440
can be solved easily.

375
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,640
Ask then.

376
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,680
I'll tell you

377
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,360
if I know.

378
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,000
But

379
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,720
compared to those questions,

380
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm more interested

381
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,520
in whether you're in trouble or not.

382
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,120
No.

383
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
What trouble can I be in?

384
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm just wondering

385
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
why you suddenly expose it

386
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,760
after a long time of hiding your identity.

387
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,480
Well, stop thinking that far.

388
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,680
I came to earth

389
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,600
for completing a task.

390
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,280
I have to leave after it's completed.

391
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,680
The relationship between Fang Leng and me

392
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,360
is just an error during the task.

393
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,640
Is it so?

394
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,040
Yeah.

395
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,400
I once heard a story.

396
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,560
That

397
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,960
only after the daughter of sea cleave her tail fin

398
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
can she stand upon the land.

399
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,590
I suppose you probably have sacrificed somethings.

400
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,080
Are you in a danger of turning into bubbles?

401
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
Please rest assured, Miss Jiang.

402
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Mr. Fang is just in a temporary coma.

403
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,640
His vital signs have stabilized.

404
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,480
Are his memories intact?

405
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,480
We can't be sure

406
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,200
before Mr. Fang wakes up.

407
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,240
Actually compared to amnesia,

408
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
the shade in Mr. Fang's heart is more dangerous.

409
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,960
Still no solutions yet?

410
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,670
Please give it up.

411
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Too risky.

412
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,040
Give it up.

413
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
I've given up my feelings about him.

414
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,720
Whether he's happy

415
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,320
or who he's being with.

416
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,280
I don't care anymore.

417
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,560
But I can't stop caring his life.

418
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,520
At least I want to be sure

419
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,200
he's alive

420
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,920
in the world like me.

421
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,120
You're out of ways.

422
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Someone does.

423
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
Just let me save him once.

424
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,880
Let me save him once.

425
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,320
Please let me save him.

426
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,040
I can give up going back home.

427
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,720
I can stay here forever.

428
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,240
Just let me save him once.

429
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,480
Xiaoqi.

430
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,560
What's wrong, Xiaoqi?

431
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,280
Let me send you to hospital.

432
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm OK.

433
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,520
Once a planet

434
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,760
deviates from its orbit,

435
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,960
it will become a shard in the universe.

436
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
If

437
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,240
I disappear from the earth,

438
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,480
I probably will disappear from the universe too.

439
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,880
Xiaoqi!

440
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,920
You're awake.

441
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,400
Dad.

442
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,880
Xiaoqi is not right,

443
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,600
I have to...

444
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640
What do you want now?

445
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,560
Of course she's not right.

446
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,970
She made all the efforts to approach you

447
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,080
and delete your memories.

448
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,880
Wait.

449
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,320
Why you still remember her?

450
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,880
Of course I remember her.

451
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
I remember everything now.

452
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,600
Why don't you tell me clearly, dad?

453
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
Tell you what?

454
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,760
I've been always unaware of

455
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,280
how my mother died.

456
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,680
I've been blaming you.

457
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,280
Turns out if it weren't because of me,

458
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,320
my mom couldn't have died.

459
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,160
Why don't you blame me?

460
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,880
Hating me

461
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,200
is much better than hating yourself.

462
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,320
Your amnesia

463
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,520
has been the punishment you brought about.

464
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,120
Good that you've recalled them all.

465
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,000
Because of Xiaoqi.

466
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,640
What's wrong with that woman?

467
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,080
She has her own reason.

468
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,240
Don't worry.

469
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,680
How can I turn into bubbles?

470
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,560
I'm an alien.

471
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,280
Good. You made me worried there.

472
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,680
Saw you bleeding...

473
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,560
Therefore, I'm awesome, aren't I?

474
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,790
You see my blood is like sapphire.

475
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,600
That is worth a lot of money.

476
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,280
Stop.

477
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,840
In case some earthling overhears it,

478
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,400
and you'll be taken to be blood cattle.

479
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,000
Only believed by you.

480
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
Maybe my brother also believes it.

481
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,040
Once there's a relationship between two people,

482
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,960
many unreasonable problems

483
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,200
seem reasonable now.

484
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,600
Now he should

485
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,680
have forgotten me.

486
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,200
Well.

487
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,200
Let's change the topic.

488
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,080
When do you plan to leave?

489
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,760
Soon.

490
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,000
Before you go,

491
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,650
you have to bid me farewell.

492
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,640
Don't leave without any notice.

493
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,400
Just like you showed up

494
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,440
in front of me.

495
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,200
Rest assured.

496
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,640
I'll bid you a serious farewell.

497
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,600
Alright,

498
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,920
let's visit my brother together.

499
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
I'll pass.

500
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,080
He finally forgot me.

501
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
What if he remember me again?

502
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,760
But you can't avoid him all the time.

503
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,080
You can still say goodbye to me before you leave.

504
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,280
But you and he are totally

505
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,560
strangers now.

506
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,040
You're still defending her at this point.

507
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,240
You tell me

508
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,480
for what she

509
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,880
hurt you like this?

510
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,280
Dad, I don't know.

511
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,570
But can you tell me the truth then?

512
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,840
Why didn't you tell me?

513
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
Why did you let me hate you so much?

514
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,920
Why did you let media

515
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,120
depict you as a bad man who got his wife killed?

516
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You're just five.

517
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,960
And lost your mom not long ago.

518
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,120
How could I tell you something such cruel?

519
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Sometimes

520
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,460
we must cover the truth

521
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
with lies

522
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Because people are not as strong as they think.

523
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
I suppose there's also

524
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,720
a cruel truth about Xiaoqi.

525
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,920
Fang Lie.

526
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,520
I feel it's not proper.

527
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,400
Dad.

528
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,440
I brought my friend here to visit my brother.

529
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,680
Your friend?

530
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,880
Uh.

531
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,680
My brother is supposed to have forgotten her.

532
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,360
This is the last time you two can meet.

533
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Thank you.

534
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,640
Come in.

535
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,320
Brother.

536
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,640
Are you still fine?

537
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,680
Yeah.

538
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,440
This is...

539
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,080
Oh,

540
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,800
this is my friend.

541
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,980
She accompanies me to visit you.

542
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,280
Girlfriend?

543
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,560
No. No.

544
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,840
Business friend.

545
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,860
I heard you're in charge of the company now.

546
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,880
What's her department?

547
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,440
She's not in the company.

548
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,790
I knew her because she was my model

549
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,760
when I was drawing pictures.

550
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,870
Model friend.

551
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,120
No wonder she looks familiar.

552
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,240
Where's familiar?

553
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,440
Just a feeling maybe.

554
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,840
Can you recall anything?

555
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,040
Should I recall anything?

556
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,760
No.

557
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,480
Glad you're OK.

558
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,880
Thanks.

559
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,400
For what?

560
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,800
For seeing me here.

561
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,760
How long have you been a model?

562
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,080
Ah?

563
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,160
Three. Three.

564
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,880
Not very long.

565
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,960
Can you come closer?

566
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,320
What are you doing?

567
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,640
Brother.

568
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,200
You two just met the first time.

569
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,240
Are you alright?

570
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,360
It seems at the first sight I've...

571
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,840
fallen in love with your friend.

572
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
Are you kidding me?

573
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
What do you think?

574
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,400
How can I know?

575
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
I'm just kidding you.

576
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,040
Isn't your girlfriend a model?

577
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,320
The body is just her tool.

578
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,040
One kiss doesn't hurt.

579
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,040
You...

580
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,760
Treat me like what?

581
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,240
Xiaoqi.

582
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,960
Xiaoqi.

583
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,000
Xiaoqi.

584
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,680
I have questions for you.

585
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,800
Damn Fang Leng.

586
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,240
Bad Fang Leng.

587
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,920
I cared so much about your health.

588
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
Turns out you're such a flirtatious guy.

589
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,920
Ah!

590
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
Home planet,

591
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,840
when can you send people to pick me up?

592
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,600
I can't hold it now.

593
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,480
Have you got it?

594
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,960
Come and pick me up.

595
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,360
I'm your brother in blood.

596
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,240
Brother, don't.

597
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,400
Brother, why do you tie me?

598
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,520
Brother.

599
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,750
You can't also have forgotten your sexual preference, can you?

600
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,320
Brother.

601
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,690
I don't have energy to fool around with you.

602
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,920
Just be good

603
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,280
and answer my questions.

604
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,280
First,

605
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,680
why did you

606
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,160
and Chai Xiaoqi delete my memory bank?

607
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,280
Ah!

608
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,240
What...

609
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,440
Brother, are you out of your mind?

610
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
You block my mouth

611
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,240
and ask me question?

612
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,440
You didn't lose your memory.

613
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Cut the chit-chat.

614
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,440
Why did she do that?

615
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,080
Don't think tying me can work.

616
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,920
I'll die before

617
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,040
I turn my back on Xiaoqi.

618
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,880
Well.

619
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,560
Brother! Brother!

620
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,160
Say or not?

621
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,000
Yes. Yes.

622
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,280
Brother.

623
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,160
Just give it up.

624
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,560
You and Xiaoqi are not

625
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
from the same world.

626
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm also different from her.

627
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,000
You mean she's an alien, right?

628
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah.

629
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,320
You've...

630
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
You've known that already?

631
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,560
But

632
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,600
why are you so calm?

633
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,690
My memories are back.

634
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
I know she saved me

635
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,090
in the car accident last time.

636
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,800
Now that you've recalled it,

637
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,080
you should respect her decision.

638
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,200
She was in pain when she deleted the memory bank.

639
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,480
You think it's that simple?

640
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,600
Something not right with Xiaoqi.

641
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,360
If my guess is right,

642
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
she lost her annunciator.

643
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,040
She can't return to her planet.

644
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,200
No way.

645
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,560
She told me she's gonna return.

646
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,680
She'd be long gone now if she could.

647
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,080
If you were her and

648
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,360
you found yourself in a place that doesn't suit you.

649
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,640
you'd stay or go home?

650
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,520
Of course I'd go home.

651
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,600
But what if you couldn't make it in a short while?

652
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,920
Probably

653
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,080
Xiaoqi stayed here so long just for you.

654
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,520
I also wish so.

655
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,000
Tell me,

656
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
if you are going home today,

657
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,720
will you delete

658
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,240
your loved one's memories

659
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,320
before you leave?

660
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,640
Of course not.

661
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm an artist.

662
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,760
Without love I'd rather die.

663
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,880
What about Xiaoqi then?

664
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,960
She's not the ruthless kind.

665
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,440
Could it be

666
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,800
that she's in a big trouble?

667
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,780
It depends on her answer.

668
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,800
Untie me.

669
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,120
I'll go ask her myself.

670
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,000
She'd already have said it if she could.

671
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,280
Why she took so much trouble to

672
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,240
fool us?

673
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,240
We can't force her to answer, right?

674
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
She's alien.

675
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,400
She has superpower.

676
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,480
So what?

677
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,460
Here is human territory.

678
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,460
It remains unknown that whose specie is more advanced.

679
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,600
Besides,

680
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,600
I got the perfume she invented.

681
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,400
What can that thing do?

682
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,760
Come.

683
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,960
Why do we come here?

684
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,280
Too noisy.

685
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,200
My body can't take it.

686
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,080
What "can't take it"?

687
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,090
Mental sickness should be transferred to physical body.

688
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,960
It's said standing up late harm the body but boost your heart.

689
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,920
That makes no sense.

690
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
I should go home.

691
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,840
What are you going to do?

692
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,040
The program is about to start.

693
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,160
Tonight there's Three Minutes Love Ball.

694
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,520
What's that?

695
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,120
