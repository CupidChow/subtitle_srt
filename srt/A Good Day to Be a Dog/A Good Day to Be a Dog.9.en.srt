(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,438
I guess I'll really turn into a puppy.

10
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,768
As long as he loves me,

11
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:56,008
I wouldn't want anything else just like a puppy.

12
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,478
- Dad? - Is this the guy?

13
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:01,018
I'm sorry about earlier.

14
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:03,478
It got so hectic, so I couldn't say goodbye properly.

15
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:06,318
It's okay. I got to see you even for a quick second.

16
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,399
See you tomorrow at school.

17
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,058
Yu Na.

18
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,187
What do I do?

19
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:11,358
Let's go there.

20
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,089
We need to find out who it is and how exposed you are.

21
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:16,235
That jerk, Jin Seo Won, doesn't know about this...

22
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,604
seeing how your curse is not lifted.

23
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:19,498
Why must I give you money?

24
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:20,827
So you're telling me...

25
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,038
I can post all the videos I have, right?

26
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,308
- I'm sorry. - Stop being weak.

27
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:26,544
Everyone, take a day off tomorrow.

28
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:28,479
Is Ms. Han not here today?

29
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,438
- She's taking a sick day. - Yul.

30
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,908
Earlier, I saw Jun Seo feeding Cocoa on his phone.

31
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:34,078
Be honest.

32
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,177
Where is she from? And whose dog is she?

33
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:39,018
He won't go and talk to Mr. Jin, right?

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,487
Before that happens, I should...

35
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:41,517
No.

36
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,865
You should only worry about yourself now.

37
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:45,627
What if you go out and get hurt or something?

38
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:48,158
What did I say I'd do if I saw you again?

39
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,835
Hurry up and tell us where we can find him.

40
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,828
Eun Hwan or whatever his name is. His home address or his office.

41
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,168
Isn't he that guy?

42
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,969
I will be posting an incredible story soon.

43
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:58,168
She's a schoolteacher during the day,

44
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:00,368
but she turns into a dog at night. If such a woman exists,

45
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,438
would you believe it?

46
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,479
I told you...

47
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:04,489
that I wouldn't stay quiet this time.

48
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,547
Why are you people doing all this?

49
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,618
Because we're family.

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,088
Do you remember this place?

51
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,687
Whenever you came here, you couldn't do anything.

52
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,658
You just let us beat you up to a pulp, remember?

53
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:18,429
Mr. Hwani. I just received a photo.

54
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:21,029
I think it's a photo of your place.

55
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:23,128
Come to that place again now.

56
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:25,168
If not, I will kill this idiot.

57
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,298
Today is the day.

58
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,299
I will introduce her to you. She is right here.

59
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,269
Ms. Han, are you okay?

60
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:37,878
Ms. Han!

61
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:39,809
Ms. Han!

62
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:40,908
Wait.

63
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:42,848
Please don't come any closer.

64
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,219
I was going to tell you everything myself.

65
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,519
I do want to bond with Cocoa.

66
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,489
If it's really you,

67
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,158
I don't need to be afraid.

68
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,228
That's enough.

69
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,529
It's over now.

70
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:57,429
Forget about everything.

71
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,499
Mr. Jin. You know, the kiss.

72
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,068
Can we do it one more time?

73
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,538
With love, just like other people do.

74
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,178
- All right. - Food is here.

75
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,079
This looks so tasty.

76
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,679
Ta-da.

77
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,778
It's all set! We did it!

78
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,988
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

79
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,618
(Congratulations on not being a dog. It's okay. You're a human now.)

80
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:20,947
- Thank you - Congratulations,

81
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,887
- Hae Na - Hae Na

82
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:25,059
- Congratulations - Congratulations

83
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:28,157
- On no longer being a dog - On no longer being a dog

84
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,158
Yes!

85
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:31,268
Congratulations.

86
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,698
(Episode 9)

87
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:37,138
Then does it mean you're really dating Math?

88
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:39,469
Hey, don't call him that now.

89
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:41,038
He's your brother-in-law.

90
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:42,537
- Her brother-in-law? - Hey.

91
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,138
- Gosh. - Oh, my!

92
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,149
Oh, right. Don't smile too often and give it away.

93
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,528
You said you weren't going to notify the school yet.

94
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,049
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

95
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,388
Seriously? "Mr. Jin Seo Won?" Change it to something else.

96
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:01,499
Hello.

97
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,698
Goodness.

98
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,068
Good for her.

99
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,839
She lifted the curse...

100
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,309
and is in a happy relationship.

101
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,528
She only has good things to look forward to now.

102
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,589
Hey.

103
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,927
Do you think staring at the chicken gizzard...

104
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:36,688
will make it magically walk into your mouth?

105
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:37,728
Here.

106
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:39,728
Gosh.

107
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,808
Hey. Look at this.

108
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,178
- What are you doing? - Doesn't it look like a gizzard?

109
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,178
Doesn't it?

110
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,128
Sorry.

111
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,198
Gosh. I thought it was a real chicken gizzard.

112
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,398
Your lips looked just like this.

113
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,598
I totally got confused.

114
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,069
Wait. You still have my number under Ms. Han?

115
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:24,908
I mean, we started dating each other for...

116
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,808
It's already been 22 hours.

117
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,819
I should change mine too then.

118
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,848
What will you change it to?

119
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,889
How about adding a heart after your name?

120
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,728
That's great,

121
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,797
but it should be a bit secretive...

122
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:47,798
and somewhat special. Any ideas?

123
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,469
Somewhat special...

124
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:55,839
Cocoa?

125
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,908
Come on, not Cocoa.

126
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,779
Do you still see me as a puppy?

127
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,488
Why don't we come up with...

128
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,689
cute nicknames like Bong-meo and Seo-liet?

129
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:16,098
So you were envious of them.

130
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,399
No, it's not that. I...

131
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,569
Yes. I was.

132
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,738
Then we can be the Seo Hae Couple.

133
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,038
Seo Hae?

134
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,047
I see. As in Seo Won and Hae Na.

135
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,108
The Seo Hae Couple. I like it.

136
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,949
Then what about our pet names for each other?

137
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:38,449
A pet name?

138
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,848
How about Trotting Hae?

139
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,089
Trotting Hae? What does it mean?

140
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:46,788
You were cute when you were trotting away.

141
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,029
I mean, Cocoa was.

142
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,269
Trotting Hae sounds nice.

143
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,089
Mr. Lee.

144
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,189
What are you doing here?

145
00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:21,129
I'm crafting.

146
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,479
You can enjoy your hobby in your spare time at home.

147
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:25,618
Why are you doing this at school?

148
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,639
You must be having fun, playing the vice principal.

149
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,189
Gosh. This came out really nicely.

150
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,558
That can't get mixed up.

151
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:52,858
Right.

152
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,029
Gosh, this has a strong scent of the tiger.

153
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:59,629
Most of the animals will want to stay away from it.

154
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,209
Well,

155
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,108
by the way,

156
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,608
can we stop here...

157
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:15,748
and go back?

158
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:21,247
Everything in this human world is gray.

159
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,858
I don't see any vibrant nature here.

160
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:24,788
Can't we go back...

161
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:27,558
to the mountain now?

162
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,538
I mean, you've done enough. Haven't you?

163
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,168
Come on.

164
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,169
Look at this.

165
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,169
Look!

166
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,738
This outfit is so uncomfortable. You know?

167
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,608
And what is this? Look.

168
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:47,549
It's like I'm wearing a leash.

169
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,758
I meant to say...

170
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:58,858
If I was going to stop now,

171
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,027
I would have neither abandoned the mountain...

172
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,299
nor decided to leave.

173
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,069
Don't you miss it?

174
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,669
But still.

175
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:12,469
It's our home.

176
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,909
No.

177
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,819
I don't even want to see the sight of it.

178
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:22,738
What does that woman mean to you? Why go to such lengths...

179
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,189
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,348
The two of them ought to face the loss just like I did.

181
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:02,919
They must suffer...

182
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,429
just like I did.

183
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,488
Two days since the formation of the Seo Hae Couple.

184
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,257
We still have an hour until we can see each other.

185
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,338
(We still have an hour until we can see each other.)

186
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,698
(We still have an hour until we can see each other.)

187
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:45,929
I can't wait to see you.

188
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,809
Uncle, are you dating Ms. Han?

189
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:55,608
What?

190
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,008
Yes.

191
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,709
Then do you know it too?

192
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,118
Ms. Han's secret?

193
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:04,748
Let's eat.

194
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,028
That looks great.

195
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,659
It's a bit burned.

196
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:19,929
- Then did her curse get lifted? - Yes.

197
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:21,669
That's great then.

198
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,768
We still have 58 minutes left.

199
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,159
But are you two really dating?

200
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:46,589
Yes.

201
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:55,039
Uncle.

202
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,607
There are some things you need to know...

203
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,409
since you're dating Ms. Han.

204
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:02,939
Firstly,

205
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,608
don't ask her to do what puppies do.

206
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,018
She's human again.

207
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:11,148
"Paw."

208
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:13,089
"Foot."

209
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:14,988
"Bang."

210
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,199
Don't ask her to do tricks like this.

211
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,728
When you go to cafes with her, don't order coffee.

212
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:22,799
Get her a cup of cocoa.

213
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:25,069
When you do nice things for her,

214
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,098
she's happy, but pretends she's not.

215
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,939
So don't make it obvious when you do that.

216
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,209
On your 100th day together,

217
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,409
go to her desk and give her some chocolate.

218
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,809
She'll love it.

219
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,278
And lastly,

220
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:46,618
Ms. Han doesn't know...

221
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:50,159
how adorable,

222
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:52,528
caring,

223
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,258
and lovely she is.

224
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,569
So...

225
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:00,969
remind her often.

226
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:08,238
Don't you have school?

227
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,559
- Hello. - Hello.

228
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:35,669
What's that?

229
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:38,267
The vice principal bought them at a temple.

230
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,409
He said it was some kind of a talisman.

231
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,079
A talisman?

232
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:47,049
Yes. Ms. Han, you should take one too.

233
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:48,579
Thank you.

234
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,618
It's great to wear it on your date.

235
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,689
This bracelet has the perfect harmony of yin-yang energy.

236
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,695
You'll never break up with your significant other.

237
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,758
I see.

238
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,028
- Try it on. - Sure. I'll put it on.

239
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,839
Gosh, it looks great on you.

240
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:16,008
Right.

241
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,377
I'm not sure if you heard about...

242
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,709
what happened at our neighboring school.

243
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,147
Two teachers were caught kissing each other at school...

244
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:24,748
by their students,

245
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,747
and the complaint reached the Office of Education.

246
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:28,819
Gosh.

247
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:32,728
That's not allowed even if you're married.

248
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,998
Things are getting out of control these days.

249
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,019
Teachers ought to remember their place in school.

250
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:41,328
Don't they know better to behave properly?

251
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,069
That's the first rule of being a teacher.

252
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,237
There cannot be any acts of affection at our school.

253
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:49,377
I'll be keeping my eyes on everyone, just so you know.

254
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:51,178
Didn't he just talk about the harmony...

255
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:53,178
- the yin-yang energy? - What do you mean why?

256
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,179
If you were to spot...

257
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,148
any sorts of acts like that,

258
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,388
you must tell me personally. Report to me immediately.

259
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,018
Yes, sir.

260
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,498
I don't get it.

261
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,699
Right? I can't believe he'll keep an eye on us.

262
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:19,939
No. Not him.

263
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,179
- What? - That couple.

264
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,607
They must be madly in love or something.

265
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,179
Did they have to publicly display their affection at school?

266
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:30,348
Why not? There must be a thrill in that.

267
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,919
I would love to try that out.

268
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,887
Holding hands in secret...

269
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,728
and sharing a secret kiss. Stuff like that?

270
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,159
Anyway,

271
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:45,098
this has nothing to do with us, though.

272
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:48,097
Good grief. Of course. It's been over a century...

273
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:49,637
since my dating DNA got activated.

274
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,199
- Right? - Yes.

275
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,439
A century.

276
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:00,409
Ms. Han.

277
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:07,248
- Hey. - Yes?

278
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:08,919
He's calling you.

279
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,758
Yes?

280
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,299
Can I have a tangerine?

281
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:20,699
No.

282
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:27,668
Hey. You have so many of them. Don't be like that.

283
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:28,978
Have one, please.

284
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,289
Hey. Did you check the lunch menu today?

285
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,757
They are all vegetables.

286
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:47,238
I might turn into a cow at this rate.

287
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,809
- Does my hair look okay? - Your hair?

288
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:57,939
What was that?

289
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:00,637
- What? - Did you see that?

290
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:02,308
- What? - No? Was I the only one?

291
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,778
Did you see what just happened?

292
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:06,348
Gosh, no way.

293
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:08,379
Hello.

294
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,818
(My 6th period is open. See you in the music room.)

295
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:28,028
Hey! It's Ms. Han!

296
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:34,108
Where? I don't see anyone.

297
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:35,938
- What's with you? It's creepy. - What was that?

298
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,007
- Let's go. - Let's go.

299
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:38,888
(Objective: Learning the poetic expressions...)

300
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,219

"is not the Euler's formula, but you."

Jin Seo Won.

305
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,798
"There you are, teaching me about conditional probability."

306
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:00,468
"What's the probability..."

307
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:03,538
"of me having your unconditional love?"

308
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:04,738
A zero percent.

309
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:08,337
"There you are, teaching me about mathematical induction."

310
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,578
"My fierce heart and boiling blood..."

311
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:14,679
"are induced only by my love for you."

312
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,518
"There you are, teaching me the Pythagorean theorem."

313
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,788
"Chase away all of the temptations around you,"

314
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:26,258
"and put an end to them."

315
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:34,068
Everyone in this class is crazy.

316
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,469
Ms. Han.

317
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,308
There are some things you must know...

318
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,379
since you're dating my uncle now.

319
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,349
You see, when my uncle...

320
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,919
makes fried eggs,

321
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,659
he always draws faces on them.

322
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,998
You must eat those faces last.

323
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,589
If you don't, he gets upset although it's subtle.

324
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:10,238
Sometimes, he keeps his eyes closed in the elevator.

325
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:13,379
Then he opens his eyes on the floor he needs to get off,

326
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,238
which secretly makes him happy.

327
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:17,658
Don't let him know you know that.

328
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,469
He'll say you're wrong with a straight face.

329
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,649
And...

330
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:26,389
he likes solving math problems.

331
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,959
Buy him a lot of newly released math books.

332
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,199
Okay. Thanks for the tips.

335
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:09,159
Yes. Of course!

336
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:22,337
Mr. Jin, you're making it difficult for me...

337
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:23,379
by behaving like that.

338
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,639
What do you mean?

339
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
I mean, we're at school now,

340
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,179
but you keep flirting with me,

341
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:28,449
trying to tempt me.

342
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:32,548
Well, then...

343
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,248
I guess you don't need this.

344
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,159
What is it?

345
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:37,389
It's nothing.

346
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,359
Come on. What is it?

This is our book.

350
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:52,068
I'm sorry for flirting with you and tempting you at school.

351
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:53,909
No, don't be sorry.

352
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:55,609
You can be more flirty with me.

353
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,088
Sir.

354
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,429
- Oh, thank you. - Gosh. What?

355
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,528
Sir, I just saw something strange.

356
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:18,128
- What? - Please come with me.

357
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,289
- What? What did you see? - Come with me for a second.

358
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:25,669
They're gone.

359
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,978
I just saw Ms. Han and Mr. Jin over there doing...

360
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:32,448
Were they hugging?

361
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:33,478
No.

362
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:35,649
Did they kiss?

363
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,448
Were they holding hands like this?

364
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:38,777
With their fingers interlocked...

365
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:40,189
like this?

366
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:41,788
No.

367
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,258
He gave her a book.

368
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:45,518
Sorry?

369
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,588
But the vibe was...

370
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,798
A vibe cannot serve as evidence, Ms. Yoon.

371
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,068
Okay?

372
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:59,178
Are you done with the performance assessments?

373
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,609
No.

374
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,538
Can you fill in for me and take care of the morning assembly tomorrow?

375
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:04,909
Sorry, I can't.

376
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,109
I see, you can't.

377
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,659
What?

378
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:28,169
Why did you bring me here?

379
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,098
To show you something.

380
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,238
Oh, what?

381
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:32,969
What could it be?

382
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,078
All right.

383
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:38,379
One, two, three.

384
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:42,778
A rainbow.

385
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,348
What do you think?

386
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:45,619
It's so pretty.

387
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,519
It's been so long since I last saw a rainbow.

388
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,338
Hey, you brats. You're so loud.

389
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,138
- Hey, come on. - What?

390
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,139
Be quiet, guys.

391
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,008
- Hey, open the curtains first. - Yes, sir.

392
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:12,948
Guys, follow Min Jae and grab...

393
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:14,577
- your shuttlecocks and rackets. - Yes, sir.

394
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:15,777
Get moving. Go that way.

395
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:17,195
- Today, we were supposed to... - Go on. It's okay.

396
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:18,247
- Hey, give me one. - Let's go.

397
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,517
- Let's go. - Hey, mine too.

398
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:21,348
- We need three. - Here you go.

399
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,418
- Let's go. - We need three.

400
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,119
Hey, guys. Quiet down.

401
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,859
(Open curtains, Left)

402
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,828
Come on. Hurry.

403
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,998
(Open curtains, Right)

404
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:45,109
Ms. Han.

405
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:10,849
It is beautiful.

406
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,379
Are you all right?

407
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,818
I heard you suddenly fainted.

408
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,189
What happened?

409
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,058
Are you possessed or something?

410
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,859
Why was my face on that wall?

411
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:02,828
Hey, Min Ji A.

412
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:08,139
You are not Min Ji A right now.

413
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:17,379
You evil spirit!

414
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,778
Go away at once!

415
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:29,988
That scarf.

416
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,828
- You evil thing, leave her body. - It looked like mine.

417
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:36,599
Faith.

418
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:39,469
Hope.

419
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:41,429
With the power of love,

420
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:43,298
I shall expel you.

421
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:45,699
That memory.

422
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:47,838
Could it be my memory?

423
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,619
Hey, ghost. You see that light, right?

424
00:29:58,649 --> 00:29:59,788
Follow the light.

425
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:03,659
Go!

426
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,088
Or was it my past life?

427
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:17,998
Hey.

428
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,109
Are you all right?

429
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,179
I'm just worried about you.

430
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:27,609
Why are you worried?

431
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,719
Well...

432
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:33,189
You said you were ill for three years.

433
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:36,258
The shamanic illness is an illness too, so you are ill.

434
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:39,758
I'm okay now.

435
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,629
Then why did you faint earlier?

436
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,439
I guess I still have some homework left to do.

437
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:53,369
"Homework?"

438
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,808
Once I finish my homework,

439
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,038
I'll learn more about myself.

440
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:13,189
My gosh. You were so cute as a dog.

441
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,669
Why? Do you want one?

442
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,738
No.

443
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:26,508
"No."

444
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,538
- Hey, you know... - What?

445
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:34,409
Never mind.

446
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:38,619
Hey.

447
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:41,288
Never mind.

448
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:43,459
What is it?

449
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:44,859
Tell me.

450
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,459
What? What is it?

451
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:48,909
Well, I forgot what it's like...

452
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,898
because it's been so long.

453
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:52,899
Okay.

454
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,708
Your appetite and your sex drive aren't the same thing, right?

455
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,038
They must be different.

456
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:02,238
Right? They must be.

457
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:11,478
Explain why they're different.

458
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:19,219
Well, appetite is the desire to eat food,

459
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,828
whereas your sex drive is...

460
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,369
You know, it's wanting to do it.

461
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:33,738
You see, I...

462
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,068
Yes.

463
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,337
I was eating chicken gizzards.

464
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:38,379
Okay.

465
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:40,878
Then I suddenly saw something...

466
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,348
and wanted to kiss someone.

467
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:43,478
What did you see?

468
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:45,679
That, you don't need to know.

469
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,119
What did you see?

470
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:49,818
What was it?

471
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,888
- Come on. What was it? - Woo Taek's lips.

472
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:54,087
- Gosh. - Gosh!

473
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:55,458
Hey, have you lost your mind?

474
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:57,497
No, blame my appetite.

475
00:32:57,498 --> 00:33:01,268
My appetite boosted my libido for a split second.

476
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,297
This is all because of those darn chicken gizzards.

477
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:06,199
Darn you, chicken gizzards!

478
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:11,538
Do you want to try it?

479
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:15,109
No, I'm good.

480
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,219
Then what about this?

481
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:28,488
Aren't you curious?

482
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:56,788
Do you want to try this?

483
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:59,359
No, I'm not curious at all.

484
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:02,758
Oh, I guess you don't like this.

485
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:05,998
It's not that.

486
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,199
I like it.

487
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:24,548
Don't come home tonight.

488
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:29,068
Woo Taek is coming over. I'm going to find out.

489
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,859
What's gotten into you? You're buying me fried chicken?

490
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:36,599
Well, I was hungry...

491
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,128
and had to eat something, so...

492
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:41,668
You owe me an apology, don't you?

493
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,199
Woo Taek.

494
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,269
Yes?

495
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:53,249
You're such a great...

496
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:55,749
friend.

497
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,479
What are you saying?

498
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:00,749
Woo Taek.

499
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:08,028
It's okay for friends to kiss once, right?

500
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,878
I was wrong. Hey, let's eat.

501
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,648
Gosh, I'm suddenly so hungry.

502
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:35,648
Eat up.

503
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,059
I should take you home.

504
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:41,429
No, it's okay. I have a lot of time today.

505
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:43,398
I can go home late.

506
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,798
Is your sister still working?

507
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,699
Yes, I think so.

508
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,708
My gosh. We're here.

509
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,079
I came here so often as Cocoa.

510
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:09,019
Do you want to come in?

511
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:10,818
What?

512
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:14,159
Make yourself at home until your sister calls you.

513
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,958
Is Yul not at home now?

514
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,258
He's doing a sleepover at his friend's place.

515
00:36:49,898 --> 00:36:53,369
My gosh. Today, I'm here as a person, not a dog.

516
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,929
It feels very different.

517
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:58,639
- Really? - Yes.

518
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,409
Do you want something to drink?

519
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:12,478
(Yu Na)

520
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,349
I'm done checking. You can come home now.

521
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,119
- Is that your sister? - Oh, yes.

522
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:20,329
What did she say?

523
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:24,027
She said she'd be a while...

524
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:25,429
and told me to take my time.

525
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,438
- Do you want some fruit? - Sure.

526
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:48,208
Aren't you...

527
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:50,648
curious?

528
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:07,869
Ms. Han.

529
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:11,199
Yes, I'm curious.

530
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:13,969
- Sorry? - Sorry?

531
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:16,909
Oh...

532
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,508
Can I use your bathroom?

533
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:21,678
Yes, it's over there.

534
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,708
Okay.

535
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,789
I am not curious.

536
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:35,929
I am not curious.

537
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,159
Shut up, you dirty mind. Seriously, shut it.

538
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,108
I am...

539
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,608
curious.

540
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:05,318
Is your stomach upset?

541
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:09,429
No, I just wanted to check myself in the mirror.

542
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:15,168
Ms. Han.

543
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:20,039
I've just realized that we're not at school now.

544
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,479
Right, we're not.

545
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:25,878
Then...

546
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,878
can I do...

547
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:32,119
what I want to do?

548
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:58,809
Jin Seo Won.

549
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,079
- What? - What are you doing?

550
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:03,849
What do you mean?

551
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,170
Why are you here all of a sudden?

552
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,418
Because I missed you.

553
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:09,848
I actually...

554
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:12,258
just left something here the last time I came.

555
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,688
Let me look for that.

556
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:14,789
Okay.

557
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,258
Hey, Yul, Mr. Lee is here. Aren't you going to...

558
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,168
It's locked.

559
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:23,128
He's going through puberty.

560
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:24,869
We should leave him alone.

561
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:26,599
Puberty?

562
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,108
I'll be quiet.

563
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,508
Ms. Han, just come out.

564
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,008
If we just tell him...

565
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:07,825
(Ms. Han, just come out. If we tell him...)

566
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,508
Mr. Jin, my shoes!

567
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,789
What are you doing?

568
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,119
My sister wanted me to send her these.

569
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:35,508
Tell her to buy a new pair.

570
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:37,179
It'll cost more to send it to her.

571
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:39,878
Tell me about it. I don't understand.

572
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,009
Maybe these are her favorite.

573
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,318
Hold on.

574
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:52,488
Yul.

575
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:54,058
What's wrong?

576
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:55,159
Why are you here?

577
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:57,999
I mean, it just wasn't that fun.

578
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,469
Didn't you go there to study?

579
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,539
Of course. I definitely was not there to play games.

580
00:43:05,238 --> 00:43:06,297
Go back.

581
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:07,409
What?

582
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:09,338
Mr. Lee is inside.

583
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:10,608
And?

584
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:11,708
Well,

585
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:14,708
something bad must've happened. He keeps...

586
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:16,408
He keeps crying.

587
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:17,818
- Really? - Yes.

588
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:20,188
Now is not the right time.

589
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:21,449
It's that serious?

590
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:23,249
Goodness.

591
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:28,559
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

592
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:30,258
What?

593
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,599
Right. Yul was at his friend's house. I forgot.

594
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:35,068
- What? - Right.

595
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,068
But...

596
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,369
Mr. Lee, it's okay.

597
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:42,139
Things happen in life, and they can't always be good.

598
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:44,679
He looks fine now.

599
00:43:46,338 --> 00:43:47,979
- Yes. - Right?

600
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:49,278
Yes.

601
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:50,579
You got this.

602
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,278
I got this.

603
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:56,958
Why won't this open?

604
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,559
It's locked, isn't it?

605
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:05,528
It wouldn't open earlier too.

606
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:06,929
Really?

607
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:08,429
It must be broken.

608
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:10,699
I guess so.

609
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,438
What's wrong with this?

610
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:19,079
Let's just open it next time.

611
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:21,749
But this is my room.

612
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,277
You'll hurt yourself.

613
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,778
Just push down harder.

614
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,618
Do you want to watch a movie?

615
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:42,099
What movie?

616
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,498
There was one I wanted to watch.

617
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,797
- Let's watch it. - What?

618
00:44:46,798 --> 00:44:47,869
Yes, let's do that.

619
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:49,909
Let's watch a movie.

620
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:30,918
Isn't it fun?

621
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,519
What?

622
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:58,249
(Consultation Room)

623
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:04,758
Just one peck...

624
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:07,588
is okay between friends.

625
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:26,979
No.

626
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,949
Why do I keep thinking of that?

627
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:32,318
I have to work.

628
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:34,949
Right. I should check.

629
00:51:00,338 --> 00:51:04,179
(Nana Animal Hospital)

630
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,278
- Yu Na. - Yes.

631
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:08,519
What about Uncle?

632
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:10,459
He's receiving dialysis in the treatment room.

633
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:14,958
He suddenly got worse,

634
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:17,758
so Woo Taek said...

635
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,929
that we should prepare for the worst.

636
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:36,708
Is your uncle okay?

637
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:39,749
Yes, he is staying in the hospital for now.

638
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:41,519
They finished his dialysis treatment.

639
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:44,059
Then did he remain a dog...

640
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:46,818
because he couldn't lift the curse?

641
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:50,388
Yes, it happened when I was little,

642
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:53,898
so I think it's been around 18 years.

643
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,168
But...

644
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:58,568
does no one know how the curse...

645
00:51:58,769 --> 00:51:59,898
first started?

646
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,208
No.

647
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:06,438
If you know how it all started, wouldn't you also be able to know...

648
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:08,079
how to end it all?

649
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:10,548
End it?

650
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,688
If that happens, your uncle, your sister,

651
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:17,389
and you can all be happy.

652
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:24,199
I don't think I've ever thought about it like that.

653
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:27,599
It was just something that was naturally a part of my family...

654
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:29,628
ever since I was born.

655
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:32,999
Nothing is ever certain.

656
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:35,969
Ms. Han,

657
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:40,579
no matter what happens, I'll always be by your side.

658
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:05,238
Do you have something weighing on your mind?

659
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:06,938
Ms. Yoon,

660
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:10,639
I also saw everything you saw.

661
00:53:12,479 --> 00:53:14,449
I know everything too.

662
00:53:15,378 --> 00:53:17,548
- Ms. Yoon. - Yes?

663
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:23,088
So love is fruitless.

664
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:27,988
You're right.

665
00:53:34,898 --> 00:53:36,929
It'll be fruitless.

666
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:39,769
You're right.

667
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:50,508
I fainted a few days ago...

668
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:54,318
in the historical archive.

669
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,659
I need to know...

670
00:53:58,688 --> 00:53:59,889
why that happened.

671
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:08,809
Did you eat your medicine for anemia?

672
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:13,269
Make sure to take your medications.

673
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:20,679
You must have something you're hiding.

674
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:08,229
Mr. Lee, do you want me to do a card reading for you?

675
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:20,469
Pick three cards.

676
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:42,958
You are a valuable person...

677
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:45,659
though no one knows.

678
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:49,269
Everyone thinks this is a chicken,

679
00:55:49,528 --> 00:55:51,039
but it's actually a phoenix.

680
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,249
You laugh on the outside,

681
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:03,649
but you're different on the inside.

682
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,719
A chilly wind blows around you.

683
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,458
This black area looks like an empty mountain,

684
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:16,358
but it's actually a silver grass field.

685
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:19,498
You must feel easily troubled...

686
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:21,199
even with the slightest amount of wind.

687
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:30,438
You keep lingering around the underworld...

688
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:33,608
because you miss a dead person.

689
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:44,358
That's why you left.

690
00:56:46,758 --> 00:56:49,688
You abandoned a field full of grass because of a dead woman.

691
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,128
Just to live an aimless life here.

692
00:57:00,298 --> 00:57:02,168
The dead woman doesn't even want that though.

693
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:36,668
No one is watching.

694
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:39,108
So it does not matter.

695
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:44,409
Hey.

696
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:53,679
Bo Gyeom.

697
00:58:56,918 --> 00:58:57,918
Bo Gyeom?

698
00:59:01,258 --> 00:59:02,289
Is he not here?

699
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:28,479
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

700
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:31,249
Have you noticed Bo Gyeom acting strange these days?

701
01:00:31,648 --> 01:00:33,848
It felt strange. It was like he was a different person.

702
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:35,119
So it's this dog.

703
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:37,389
The dog with a story that you're entangled with.

704
01:00:37,688 --> 01:00:38,817
It's strange.

705
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:41,488
Usually, dogs run up to me because they love me.

706
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:44,758
But these days, I feel like they avoid me.

707
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:47,397
Your temperature is above 39°C.

708
01:00:47,398 --> 01:00:49,769
A piece of iron that has once tasted blood...

709
01:00:49,898 --> 01:00:53,099
keeps wanting to taste blood again.

710
01:00:53,499 --> 01:00:55,208
Who are you?
