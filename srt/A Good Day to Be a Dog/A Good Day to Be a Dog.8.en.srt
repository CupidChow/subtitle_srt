Mr. Jin.

10
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,719
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

11
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:54,020
Han Yu Na's sister. This is interesting.

12
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,319
I wonder if he knows...

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,020
his girlfriend is a monster.

00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,998
I think I recognize him.

16
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,258
I'm working as a journalist now.

17
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,869
I'd like to cover your story on my channel.

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,069
Please write back.

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,198
My feelings right now are precious that I want to protect them.

20
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:11,868
But to do that, I need to tell him the truth.

21
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:13,039
I'm really scared.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,439
- Seo Won. - I have no interest...

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,640
in catching up with you.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,250
Are you still upset about what happened in the past?

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,409
I saw your picture online.

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,919
Your girlfriend is super gorgeous.

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,550
Stop this nonsense, and leave.

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,088
Hey, are you sure it was here?

29
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,690
Did someone take my clothes overnight?

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,059
I made sure I hid them.

31
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,519
Which one of you is it?

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,759
So you're not going to talk.

33
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:33,160
Fine. Then I can wait here until midnight.

34
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,729
I knew it.

35
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,058
- Bring him home tomorrow. - Bring whom?

36
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,299
Who do you think? Her boyfriend!

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,269
Mom, I'm sorry. The guy I kissed...

38
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,270
is someone else.

39
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,669
I was going to call you separately.

40
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,338
There's something I want to tell you.

41
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,478
Wait.

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,110
Can I tell you something first?

43
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:52,508
The truth is...

44
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,679
If it's hard for you to tell me, you don't have to say it.

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
What? They work at the same school?

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,619
Oh, my. How should I go about this?

47
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,490
Hey, Yo Sub, do me a favour.

48
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,989
What are you doing here?

49
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,720
- Something's in here. - What?

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,059
I don't know. I can just sense something.

51
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,229
Can you unlock this?

52
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,059
I'll ask Mr. Lee.

53
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,169
- Mr. Lee. - This is no fun.

54
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,298
Let's go.

55
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,169
Hey, what did that man say?

56
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:15,699
He asked about Ms. Han.

57
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,369
How did you know I was here?

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,538
Don't ever come back to the school that I work at.

59
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,839
I didn't go there to see you.

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
I went to see your girlfriend.

61
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,138
But if I see you ever again,

62
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,280
I won't let it slide.

63
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,350
You don't have much time left.

64
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,679
I should tell him.

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,979
Is he trustworthy?

66
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,250
Guess what my colour is when I change.

67
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,690
No matter what colour you are, I'm sure you'll still look pretty.

68
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,789
I think he is worthy of my trust.

69
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:36,859
I'm scared.

70
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,759
I don't want you to go through what I did.

71
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,298
Please kiss my daughter properly.

72
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:42,299
My poor...

73
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,569
That was real?

74
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,500
Hello, I'm the reporter who contacted you before.

75
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,799
Do you have any videos?

76
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,069
I want to buy them from you.

77
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,599
But what's making you spend this much money...

78
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,310
to reveal all of this?

79
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,138
Just because...

80
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,509
I think it'll be fun.

81
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,150
Hey.

82
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,548
You have a week left.

83
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,578
(Episode 8)

84
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,019
Were you able to talk to him at school?

85
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:07,989
No.

86
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,519
I've been avoiding him.

87
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,259
Han Hae Na.

88
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,030
What are you going to do?

89
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,500
I don't know.

90
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,699
Ask him to meet with you today.

91
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,699
I can't.

92
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,970
Are you really going to tell him at the last minute?

93
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,139
I'm so scared to find out about what he'll think of me.

94
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,479
I know what you're going through.

95
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,949
But you really don't have much time, Hae Na.

96
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,919
He finally started to smile at me.

97
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,489
If I tell him, it might ruin everything between us.

98
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,620
The only thing you can do...

99
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,789
is to trust that he is a good guy.

100
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,630
You trusted your ex-boyfriend also.

101
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,329
You should just trust him too.

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,668
I despise that jerk.

103
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,299
But I don't regret trusting him.

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,739
Yu Na.

105
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,840
I guess I'll really turn into a puppy.

106
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:11,989
I only wait for him.

107
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,859
When he looks at me, I'm happy.

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,830
My heart pounds when he calls me.

109
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,070
As long as he loves me,

110
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,070
I wouldn't want anything else...

111
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,379
just like a puppy.

112
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,450
Think of this...

113
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,919
as our home.

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,460
The most peaceful and safest place...

115
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,359
in the world.

116
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,070
Ms. Han!

117
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,010
Guess what my colour is when I change.

118
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,960
No matter what colour you are,

119
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,129
I'm sure you'll still look pretty.

120
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,660
Ms. Han!

121
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,910
- Dad? - Hae Na.

122
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,379
"Dad?"

123
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,020
I saw you following her from there. I thought you looked suspicious.

125
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,559
I got the wrong idea.

126
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,989
Dad, were you following me?

127
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,460
No. I wanted to surprise you.

128
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:34,859
Is this the guy?

129
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:35,999
What?

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,499
Your mother told me everything.

131
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:39,928
You.

132
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:42,038
What's the reason behind stalling time like this?

133
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,299
Dad. No.

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,340
I want you...

135
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,570
to take my daughter very soon.

136
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,608
If you made up your mind...

137
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,779
- You know? - Dad, come on.

138
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,279
Be a man! Okay?

139
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,248
- Take her already! - Goodbye, sir.

140
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm sorry. I can't talk to you today.

141
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,619
See you tomorrow at school.

142
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,419
Take my daughter already!

143
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:01,049
- He's handsome. He's my type. - Dad!

144
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,059
He knows nothing about the curse.

145
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,499
What?

146
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
What will you do then?

147
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,840
How did you let this happen?

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,499
It just happened.

149
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,878
Anyway, I'll take care of this on my own.

150
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,140
Don't worry too much.

151
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,179
I must tell him the truth...

152
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,150
and lift the curse.

153
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:33,889
My puppy.

154
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,559
Don't call me that.

155
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,059
My daughter.

156
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:40,059
I know it's tough.

157
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,299
Was it only a few days after I started dating her?

158
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,270
I...

159
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,140
stubbornly pestered her to marry me.

160
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,840
But your mother wasn't even flustered.

161
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,510
She just sat up so straight.

162
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,109
Then she gazed at me quietly.

163
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,650
So I asked her what was wrong.

164
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,950
Then she told me about the curse.

165
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:06,249
At first, I didn't believe her.

166
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,320
No, I couldn't.

167
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,419
To be honest, I was a bit scared.

168
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,330
I'm sharing this only with you.

169
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,260
I thought about running away too.

170
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:18,700
But that's when...

171
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,229
I saw your mother's hands.

172
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,410
Your mother was sitting there, her head up high and gracefully.

173
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,410
But her hands on her lap were shaking.

174
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,809
So...

175
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,850
I grabbed her hands.

176
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,920
She was just under this scary curse.

177
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,749
But she wasn't scary.

178
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,988
She was probably more scared...

179
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,389
than I was.

180
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,659
She was scared that people might mock her and call her a monster.

181
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,399
She was also scared that I might leave her.

182
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,700
This poor woman was shaking in fear.

183
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,070
How could I run away?

184
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,239
Will Mr. Jin...

185
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,310
think of me like you thought of Mom?

186
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,109
Of course.

187
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,909
He seemed like a good guy.

188
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,820
Right. I don't think he's as strong as me, though.

189
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,850
So...

190
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,590
don't worry too much.

191
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,790
I'm sure he will...

192
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,930
trust you too.

193
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,259
I only want one thing from you.

194
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,899
I just hope you won't have to worry about this...

195
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:26,869
as soon as possible.

196
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,769
That's the only thing I want.

197
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,109
My daughter.

198
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,509
Congratulations on having your first kiss.

199
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,988
It was fine earlier.

200
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,989
What is this?

201
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,060
Oh, my.

202
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm sorry about earlier.

203
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,810
It got so hectic, so I couldn't say goodbye properly.

204
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:06,970
Did you get home safely?

205
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,379
It's okay.

206
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,080
I got to see you even for a quick second.

207
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,049
See you tomorrow at school.

208
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,050
(Restricted Number)

209
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,919
(Restricted Number)

210
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,119
Come to this location by 11pm, Ms. Han Hae Na.

211
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,700
(Restricted Number)

212
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,700
Yu Na.

213
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,399
Yu Na.

214
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,768
What do I do?

215
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:40,810
What is it?

216
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,479
What?

217
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,519
You have no idea who it might be?

218
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,350
All right. Let's think about this calmly.

219
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,720
How did this person get her number?

220
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,460
Getting someone's number is easy for dirtbags.

221
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,499
Are you sure no one was there when you were running away?

222
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,399
Maybe, someone saw you turning into a dog.

223
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,670
Actually, things happened so fast. I couldn't check thoroughly.

224
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,379
If this is just a witness,

225
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,149
why does this person want you there at a late hour?

226
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,249
Money?

227
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,389
Or is this person trying to film a video of you like Sang Soo?

228
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,159
Let's go there.

229
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,159
We need to find out who it is and how exposed you are.

230
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,359
It's okay. We can make this go away.

231
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,499
Don't worry. I'll keep you safe.

232
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,430
Here.

233
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,769
They are yours, right?

234
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,779
That's odd. You don't smell like dogs.

235
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,180
Right.

236
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,479
This is the most popular dog chew these days.

237
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,649
Chew it.

238
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,989
What do you want?

239
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,859
That jerk, Jin Seo Won, doesn't know about this...

240
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,529
seeing how your curse is not lifted.

241
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,129
Who on earth are you?

242
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,998
Why are you...

243
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,399
Why do you want to know who I am?

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,869
Will that change anything?

245
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,869
Right. I will tell you why I'm doing this.

246
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,810
But isn't it obvious? Money is everything these days.

247
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,850
Why must I give you money?

248
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,549
So you're telling me...

249
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,919
I can post all the videos I have, right?

250
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
I really filmed everything.

251
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,859
Go ahead.

252
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:20,759
No one will believe it anyway.

253
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,060
You're wrong. People will believe it.

254
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,070
All right. Here you go.

255
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,040
I sent it to you. Check it.

256
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,180
Go ahead.

257
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,619
You're actually going to help me lift my curse today, right?

258
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:52,529
Sang Soo. I don't have that much time left.

259
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,330
I will now tell you my plan.

260
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,739
I'm going to post all the videos I have.

261
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,638
Then I'll call that jerk, Jin Seo Won.

262
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,739
I'll show him everything and tell your secret.

263
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,210
Imagine the look on his face. His girlfriend will turn into a dog.

264
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,680
I'll film his reaction.

265
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,619
Then I'll release real dogs.

266
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,019
You know that he's super scared of dogs, right?

267
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,820
When he's shaking in fear, I'll tell him this.

268
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,029
"Hey! You jerk!"

269
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,800
"One of those dogs is your girlfriend."

270
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,499
Gosh. That will be so fun.

271
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,479
Of course. It's only a plan for now.

272
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,180
This plan can be cancelled...

273
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,479
based on how much you make me happy.

274
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,019
How much money do you want?

275
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:58,059
Empty out your bank account, your sister's bank account,

276
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,028
your parents' bank accounts, your friend's bank account,

277
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,589
and your friend's parents' bank accounts.

278
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,159
Bring the cash to me.

279
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,470
I'll decide after I see the amount.

280
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,340
Bring the money here tomorrow at 11:55pm.

281
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,909
Okay? I'm leaving.

282
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,050
Right.

283
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,190
Don't bring your sidekicks tomorrow.

284
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,259
If they're going to hide, do a better job. What is that?

285
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,670
Hae Na.

286
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,139
- Are you okay? - Darn it.

287
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,609
Are you okay?

288
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:49,810
What do we do?

289
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,060
Darn him.

290
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,460
Who's that with the ugly jaw?

291
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,270
I swear I've seen him somewhere.

292
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,949
That jerk, Sang Soo,

293
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,320
had a video of me.

294
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:54,869
What's wrong?

295
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:57,480
Mom.

296
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,608
(Schoolteacher During the Day, Dog at Night?)

297
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:02,179
I opened my eyes after I kissed her.

298
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,750
Then I saw a dog.

299
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,719
At first, I didn't believe it.

300
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,959
You've never heard of someone...

301
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,760
turning into a dog, right?

302
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,859
I will be posting an incredible story soon.

303
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,730
She's a schoolteacher during the day,

304
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,669
but she turns into a dog at night. If such a woman exists,

305
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,770
would you believe it?

306
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,399
See you tomorrow.

307
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,369
Gosh. That disgusting jerk, Sang Soo.

308
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:29,510
Honey, let's calm down and think about this.

309
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,250
How can you stay calm right now?

310
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,109
Nothing is certain yet.

311
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,080
But my guess is that the blackmailer from YouTube...

312
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,549
probably bought the video from Sang Soo.

313
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,618
Gosh. I should have destroyed that jerk when I had the chance.

314
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,790
I should have destroyed that jerk the last time I saw him.

315
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,230
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,530
Why are you sorry? Be quiet.

317
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,639
Don't cry.

318
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,169
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,050
Stop being weak.

320
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,080
Everyone, take a day off tomorrow.

321
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,320
But we have a group order tomorrow.

322
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,830
Mr. Jin.

323
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,389
Are you looking for something?

324
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,199
No.

325
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,129
Is Ms. Han not here today?

326
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,000
She's taking a sick day.

327
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,639
Why?

328
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,469
Is she not feeling well?

329
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,280
I guess you have a question for Hae Na.

330
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,109
No.

331
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,490
Jun Seo, why haven't you handed in your phone yet?

332
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,659
I'll hand it in once I'm done feeding Cocoa.

333
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,060
What?

334
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,899
You know what I'm talking about.

335
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,600
Cocoa.

336
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,980
Why did you suddenly call me to the counselling room?

337
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,449
Shouldn't you have lunch?

338
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,649
Yul.

339
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,290
Why do you suddenly sound so serious?

340
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:28,889
Is Cocoa doing well?

341
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,459
Yes. Of course, she's doing well.

342
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,159
The thing is, Yul...

343
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,330
Earlier, I saw Jun Seo feeding Cocoa on his phone.

344
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,070
His phone? Why would he feed her on his phone?

345
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,340
Be honest.

346
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,679
I'm always honest with you.

347
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,879
Cocoa.

348
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,209
Where is she from? And whose dog is she?

349
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,949
Well...

350
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,490
She is Jun Seo's dog.

351
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,199
She and the character in the game...

352
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:10,830
share the same name.

353
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,500
Is that so?

354
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,909
Yes. What were you thinking?

355
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,010
All right. Go and have lunch.

356
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,550
- What about you? - I have somewhere to be.

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,320
I heard you caught a cold.

358
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,159
I'm leaving some porridge for you by the door.

359
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,060
Rest up, and feel better soon.

360
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,379
Eat up.

361
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,060
Why is this happening to you too?

362
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,830
He won't go and talk to Mr. Jin, right?

363
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,128
Before that happens, I should...

364
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,270
No.

365
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,169
You should only worry about yourself now.

366
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,209
What if you go out and get hurt or something?

367
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,419
Yu Na, why are you crying?

368
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm sorry.

369
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,060
Why are you sorry?

370
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,060
This is all my fault.

371
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,330
Had things with Sang Soo...

372
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,560
never happened,

373
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,530
you wouldn't have ended up in this mess.

374
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,709
No, Yu Na. This is not your fault.

375
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,340
You have no reason to apologize.

376
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,979
I'm sorry. I should've been careful.

377
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,179
I'm sorry, Yu Na.

378
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,119
You did nothing to apologize for.

379
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,889
There really is no reason for you to apologize.

380
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,359
I'm more sorry.

381
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:20,990
Darn it.

382
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,439
I blew it all again.

383
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:57,790
Darn it!

384
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,699
Hey, Sang Soo. How have you been?

385
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,740
How did you find me here?

386
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,908
I said, "I will find you,"

387
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:20,949
- "and I will kill you!" - Me too.

388
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,449
I told you I'd find you no matter where you were, didn't I?

389
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't you remember me?

390
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,688
I don't understand English!

391
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,520
You punk. Hurry up and open the door!

392
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,320
Darn it.

393
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,530
I'll call the police!

394
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:37,330
Gosh. This is crazy.

395
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,770
A person who does illegal gambling will call the police?

396
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,699
Then you'll end up behind bars.

397
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,109
What a nutcase.

398
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,219
Sang Soo.

399
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,158
What did I say I'd do...

400
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,389
if I saw you again?

401
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,830
You came here.

402
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:09,899
My goodness.

403
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,769
After making my beautiful elder daughter cry,

404
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,340
you even stabbed my adorable younger daughter in the back.

405
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:17,539
Father!

406
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,209
I'm not your father.

407
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,070
Then, mister?

408
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,310
Do you want a taste of this?

409
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,040
You little...

410
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,379
- No, don't. - Darn you.

411
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,980
Hurry up and tell us where we can find him.

412
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,119
Eun Hwan or whatever his name is. His home address or his office.

413
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,679
How would I know that?

414
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:33,790
I don't know. I swear.

415
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,320
Really?

416
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,719
All right. We'll find out soon.

417
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:41,490
Woo Taek.

418
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,800
I won't kill you.

419
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,830
I'll put you under before I get started.

420
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,938
Don't be surprised.

421
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,199
It'll be over before you know it.

422
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,939
You may not believe me, but Woo Taek...

423
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,878
has neutered 80,000 dogs. Right, Woo Taek?

424
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:58,439
- No, 70,000 to be exact. - I see.

425
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,060
He fled?

426
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,149
Shoot!

427
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,019
It's a long day for you, isn't it?

428
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,689
Aren't you getting tired, Sang Soo?

429
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,759
It's a perfect day for a run.

430
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,888
Oh, no. My goodness.

431
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,429
What? Are you already getting tired?

432
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,050
Honey, get started.

433
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,859
Darn it!

434
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,458
What are you doing?

435
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:24,560
Stay still.

436
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,369
Woo Taek.

437
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,840
All right, stay still.

438
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,270
You won't find anything on my phone. I swear.

439
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,280
- I'm telling you the truth. - Be quiet.

440
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,280
(Mr. Hwani)

441
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,480
- I got his address. - You got it?

442
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,379
Okay. You idiot.

443
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,149
You.

444
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,850
You have to help me.

445
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,858
- Hey. - What?

446
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,189
Isn't he that guy?

447
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:55,559
Oh, that reporter?

448
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,158
I think it really is our school.

449
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,458
Look, the wall looks the same.

450
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:00,399
Yes, this is the gym.

451
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:03,500
- You've never heard of someone... - It is our school.

452
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,070
Don't pry.

453
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,839
Shouldn't we ask Ms. Han Hae Na?

454
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,540
- No. - This looks exactly the same.

455
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,138
- My gosh. - I will be posting...

456
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:11,909
an incredible story soon.

457
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,148
Mr. Jin. Isn't he that guy?

458
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:15,979
- This is our school. - She turns into a dog at night.

459
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,280
If such a woman exists, would you believe it?

460
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,750
I will be posting an incredible story soon.

461
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,020
She's a schoolteacher during the day,

462
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,050
but she turns into a dog at night. If such a woman exists,

463
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:55,919
would you believe it?

464
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,600
Kang Eun Hwan! Open the door!

465
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,369
Hey.

466
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,709
Darn you. What are you doing here?

467
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:50,010
This is considered housebreaking. How dare you...

468
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,780
I told you...

469
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:57,750
that I wouldn't stay quiet this time.

470
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,149
You won't stay quiet? Then what will you do?

471
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Crazy idiot.

472
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,330
What's with that crazy jerk?

473
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,669
He's so fast.

474
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,090
I'm exhausted.

475
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,959
Hey, I'll lose weight because of you.

476
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,760
Do you remember this place?

477
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,800
I'll bring back the memories.

478
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,100
Hey, hurry up and come on out.

479
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,480
(Danger, Keep Out)

480
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,629
Hello?

481
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:15,959
Anybody here?

482
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,800
- Hello? - Hello?

483
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,240
What is all this?

484
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,898
What has this jerk been doing here?

485
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,439
This little... What a psycho.

486
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:30,639
This is Hae Na's.

487
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,049
- Honey! - Yes?

488
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,379
- Come here, quick. - Okay.

489
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,448
Look at this. This psycho.

490
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:44,159
What the... What is this?

491
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,820
- Honey, this computer... - Yes.

492
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:46,959
Destroy it.

493
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,090
Okay.

494
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,300
I can't believe it.

495
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:54,969
Hold on. This is stuck.

496
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:01,109
I told you to destroy the computer.

497
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,270
Okay.

498
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,980
- Honey, the bag. - The bag?

499
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,879
Here.

500
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,409
Goodness.

501
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,019
- Gosh. - Here, honey.

502
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,750
All right. Great.

503
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,730
Why are you people doing all this?

504
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,500
Because we're family.

505
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,630
But you're not their family.

506
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,089
Hey, Jin Seo Won. It's been a long time.

507
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,290
I guess you remember this place now.

508
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,218
Whenever you came here, you couldn't do anything.

509
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,060
You just let us beat you up to a pulp, remember?

510
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,830
Hey, he hasn't changed one bit.

511
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,468
Do what you were doing earlier.

512
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,900
You're a hard puncher.

513
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:09,069
Hey, do what you were doing earlier.

514
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,420
For a moment, I thought you were an MMA fighter.

515
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,060
Times have changed. How dare you punch me?

516
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:31,730
Well done, Soonja.

517
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,639
Darn you.

518
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,069
Gosh.

519
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,980
Why is he so heavy?

520
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:45,310
Well done.

521
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,610
Hey, by the way...

522
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,319
Why are you doing this to Jin Seo Won?

523
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,619
Well, let me think.

524
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,290
Because I'm angry.

525
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,319
Hey.

526
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,730
A dog must be taught what'd happen if it were to come at its master.

527
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,199
You know?

528
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,500
Look, Soonja is such a good dog.

529
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,399
You're so sweet. How adorable.

530
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,839
Right, yes.

531
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,509
Look what we found.

532
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,049
Look at these. Look.

533
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,420
What the... You psycho!

534
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:29,519
Calm down. I'm sure there's more.

535
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,118
Kang Eun Hwan, that evil psycho!

536
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,830
You need to bring me his phone.

537
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,929
Listen to me carefully.

538
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,869
Call Kang Eun Hwan now...

539
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,830
and lure him here. You got that?

540
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,869
- Answer. - Yes, ma'am!

541
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,199
Hurry and call him!

542
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,110
Put him on speaker.

543
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,350
Hello?

544
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,779
Mr. Hwani, where are you?

545
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,589
I'm out, taking care of some business. Why?

546
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,460
Mr. Hwani.

547
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,489
You should rush home now.

548
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,460
Why? What's going on?

549
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,460
Someone broke in and ransacked my home.

550
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:16,170
I believe...

551
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,940
it was Han Hae Na's family that did this.

552
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,080
They've done this before.

553
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,279
To look for her sister's video.

554
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:28,310
Okay, so what do you want me to do?

555
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:35,920
Mr. Hwani.

556
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,619
I just received a photo.

557
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,489
I think it's a photo of your place.

558
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,860
What?

559
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,029
I'll call you back.

560
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:57,839
These crazy jerks.

561
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,560
(Restricted Number)

562
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,759
Hey.

563
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,659
Come to that place again now.

564
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:22,369
If not, I will kill this idiot.

565
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,199
This time, you have to come alone. Don't make me repeat myself.

566
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,630
Hey, make sure you keep him here.

567
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,929
If he does anything funny, let the dog off the leash.

568
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,568
These rats.

569
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:56,170
Wait. How much longer should I stay here?

570
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,198
What do you think? Darn you.

571
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,809
Until I come back, you idiot.

572
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,868
Don't hit my head, okay?

573
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:03,710
Hey!

574
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,420
Since when did you talk so much?

575
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,790
Keep him here. Do you understand?

576
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,020
Okay.

577
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,279
Hey,

578
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,589
you know what'll happen if you run your mouth, right?

579
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,489
Do you?

580
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,920
Okay, good.

581
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,049
Hello, everyone. This is Hwani.

582
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,589
Today is the day.

583
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,758
None of you...

584
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:03,189
trusted anything I said, right?

585
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,360
I completely understand.

586
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,899
I didn't believe it either...

587
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,630
until I saw it with my own eyes.

588
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,469
To those of you watching this today,

589
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,909
you will witness something amazing.

590
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,580
How is this real?

591
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,909
There is actually a person who transforms into a dog.

592
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,480
I will introduce her to you. She is right here.

593
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,319
Please say hello.

594
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,329
This lady who transforms...

595
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,230
is very timid and shy.

596
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,210
Yes, she is a teacher.

597
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,770
She is in fact a teacher,

598
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,009
but it isn't courteous for me to reveal her identity.

599
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,379
So I'll just...

600
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,949
reveal the fact that she is a high school language arts teacher.

601
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,619
All right.

602
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:24,080
Hey.

603
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,909
How are you still afraid of dogs?

604
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,610
You're not a child.

605
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:33,750
Gosh.

606
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,449
What a tough life.

607
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:38,759
Isn't it tough for you too?

608
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:41,730
What?

609
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,730
You're no different from that dog.

610
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,259
You're tied to Eun Hwan.

611
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:48,029
What, you punk?

612
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,069
But at least...

613
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,339
you can untie yourself.

614
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,880
So what I'm saying is,

615
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,750
this lady will turn into a dog when the clock strikes midnight.

616
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,489
She's a human throughout the day and a dog at night.

617
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:10,619
I'm not using figurative language.

618
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,759
She literally turns into a dog.

619
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,559
Hello, Duck Beak.

620
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,000
Thank you for your donation. Here's a thumbs-up.

621
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,000
Hold on.

622
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,569
Will she turn into a dog if I kiss her?

623
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,409
What an interesting question.

624
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm not sure.

625
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,449
I'm starting to get curious though.

626
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:50,830
Okay, then.

627
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,569
I'm going to try kissing her.

628
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,380
Ms. Han, are you okay?

629
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:32,739
Ms. Han!

630
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:41,750
Ms. Han!

631
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:48,049
Ms. Han!

632
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,860
Ms. Han!

633
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,330
Ms. Han!

634
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,960
Ms. Han!

635
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,500
Wait.

636
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:06,940
Please don't come any closer.

637
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,310
I'm sorry.

638
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:19,319
I was going to tell you everything myself.

639
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:24,259
I'm sure...

640
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,190
you thought it was ridiculous and were offended.

641
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,799
You might've even started to dislike me...

642
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,639
because...

643
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,409
Because I'm such a weird woman.

644
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:46,580
I'm afraid of dogs.

645
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:51,520
If I see a dog on the street, I run away.

646
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,489
Do you think...

647
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:57,790
I'm weird?

648
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,000
Is it ridiculous and offensive?

649
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:06,900
No.

650
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,839
Then tell me.

651
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,179
Tell me your secret.

652
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,650
I don't want to hear it from Kang Eun Hwan, that jerk.

653
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:26,380
I won't let that happen.

654
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,000
I...

655
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,600
At dawn, I...

656
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,199
At dawn...

657
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,409
At dawn, I...

658
00:46:57,819 --> 00:46:59,250
I can't say it.

659
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,920
I do.

660
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,839
I do want to bond...

661
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,179
with Cocoa.

662
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,290
I like you, Mr. Lee.

663
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:46,889
Do I look like a pickled radish?

664
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:48,529
Yes.

665
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,139
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin.

666
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,339
I'm late for my class.

667
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,549
Mr. Jin.

668
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,750
When you want to cry,

669
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,319
it's okay to cry a little.

670
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,369
Are you okay?

671
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,210
If it's really you,

672
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,179
I don't need to be afraid.

673
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,989
When your descendants find love and are kissed,

674
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,360
they will take a form that is no longer human.

675
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,830
They must prove the sincerity of their oh-so-precious affection...

676
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,400
to turn back into human again.

677
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:27,850
Where did these punks go?

678
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,630
Where do you think you're going?

679
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:44,699
Who are you?

680
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,569
That's enough.

681
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:55,710
You must be on their side.

682
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,619
Oh, my gosh!

683
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:27,980
It's over now.

684
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,589
Forget about everything.

685
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,029
Where am I?

686
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,330
What is this place?

687
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:30,469
Where in the world am I?

688
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,679
My phone.

689
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,460
Mom!

690
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,659
Help!

691
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,659
My lady. Be careful.

692
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,969
You will get hurt!

693
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:37,480
Mountain spirit,

694
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,880
have you...

695
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,549
Right. Have you been well?

696
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,449
Please put these to good use whenever you feel lonely.

697
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,060
Then I will be back another time.

698
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,429
Goodness. You are so fast.

699
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:58,130
My lady!

700
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,029
Wait for me!

701
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,839
Mountain spirit,

702
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:08,468
thank you for saving my mother...

703
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:11,580
who almost died from a wolf attack.

704
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
Mountain spirit,

705
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,360
have you been well?

706
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,029
My father was appointed as a magistrate,

707
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,400
so I was away.

708
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,239
Why would you offer something so useless?

709
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,509
Who are you?

710
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:44,880
The mountain spirit...

711
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,449
and I are close.

712
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,489
You should have brought steamed rice cakes.

713
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,690
Leave it there.

714
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:04,230
It is for the mountain spirit to rise into the air if he is sick.

715
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,860
And then?

716
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I can see this mountain well from my house.

717
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,170
I will come running.

718
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,380
When will the mountain spirit ever be sick?

719
00:56:21,509 --> 00:56:23,449
He could be sick at heart.

720
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:32,460
What is your name?

721
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:45,100
I am Cho Young.

722
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,349
Mr. Jin.

723
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,949
(Epilogue)

724
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,049
I'm sorry.

725
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,319
I lied to you,

726
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,360
kept bugging you to lift my curse,

727
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,389
and never left you alone.

728
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,830
Are you going to leave me alone now?

729
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,440
Am I not useful to you anymore?

730
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,569
No, I'm going to stick to you like glue.

731
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:24,310
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

732
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:28,310
Ms. Han.

733
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
I like you.

734
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:38,159
Do you still like me when I'm such a weirdo?

735
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:42,460
Don't you remember what you said?

736
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:46,529
We're not weirdos.

737
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,130
It's just the way we are.

738
00:57:57,339 --> 00:57:58,339
Mr. Jin.

739
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,380
You know,

740
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,679
the kiss.

741
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,920
Can we do it one more time?

742
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:11,759
With love, just like other people do.

743
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,060
But won't you turn into a dog if I kiss you?

744
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,830
No.

745
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,940
If it's with someone I've already lifted my curse with,

746
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,770
I can kiss them hundreds and thousands of times.

747
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,380
"Hundreds and thousands?"

748
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:49,150
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

749
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,658
Two teachers were caught kissing each other at school...

750
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:53,258
by students...

751
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:55,989
and the complaint reached the Office of Education.

752
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,829
Did they have to...

753
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,460
publicly display their affection at school?

754
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,329
Then that means my love cells have been dried up...

755
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,969
for over 100 years.

756
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,198
Why is my face here?

757
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,770
Is that memory mine too?

758
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:11,610
Where is Yul?

759
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:13,239
He's sleeping over at his friend's house.

760
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,250
Now that I think about it, we're not at school.

761
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,020
Can I do whatever I want to do?
