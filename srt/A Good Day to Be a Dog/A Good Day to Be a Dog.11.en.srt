(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,419
By the way, have you noticed Bo Gyeom acting strange these days?

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,049
I briefly saw him yesterday.

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,719
It felt strange. It was like he was a different person.

12
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:56,858
So it's this dog.

13
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,958
The dog with a story that you're entangled with.

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,329
- Stop right there! - Oh, no!

15
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,799
Are you all right?

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,730
Apply this on your wound from the fall you took the other day.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,799
My lady did not treat me like a servant.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,369
She treated me like her friend. Then she was scolded quite harshly.

19
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,068
So I think it will be better if you treat me...

20
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,640
coldly instead of showing good manners toward me.

21
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:15,979
Do you happen to know who Lee Won Hwa is?

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,208
He is a member of the royal family, albeit in a collateral line.

23
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,318
Lee Won Hwa's wife...

24
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,419
is here for postpartum care at the moment for she is expecting soon.

25
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,589
We will arrest her right away. Consider yourself informed.

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,989
Be careful, my lady.

27
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,990
Go.

28
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,789
If she gets caught, they will kill her.

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,588
Young Master. What just happened?

30
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:33,758
I will find out what is going on. Be safe.

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,759
Her fate has abandoned her.

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,899
She lost her husband overnight...

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,929
and ended up here, chased by a pack of wolves.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
What about the child? Will it live?

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,970
It has already died.

36
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,808
I have lived for many years,

37
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:48,308
but I have never seen someone climb this cliff three times...

38
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,639
to die.

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,850
My newborn baby went to the underworld all alone.

40
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,678
Your child did not go to the underworld.

41
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,619
Its soul was hovering around you.

42
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,020
Then it ended up in the body of this dog on the verge of death.

43
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:00,719
It is not too late.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,559
Tell me where Lady Han and that girl went.

45
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,959
I looked for you everywhere.

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,329
Warm,

47
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,599
beautiful,

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,860
and happy memories.

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,758
Memories are shared between people,

50
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,030
so it will be a great present for me too.

51
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,999
She was hiding deep in the mountains.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,669
No wonder we could not find her.

53
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:17,969
The swordsmen are here.

54
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,810
Let us play one last game before going to the sea.

55
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,579
My lord.

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,009
If I stay hidden for too long,

57
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,280
or if I do not appear even after the game is over,

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,049
please forget about me.

59
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,948
You have a face as bright as the moon...

60
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,488
and speak bluntly,

61
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,189
but your gaze is sweet.

62
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,319
My mountain spirit.

(Nana Animal Hospital)

65
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,400
My lord.

66
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,400
If I stay hidden for too long,

67
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,579
or if I do not appear even after the game is over,

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,009
please forget about me.

69
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,030
Dong Chul.

70
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,499
Please do something.

71
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,939
Oh, no. What's happening to him?

72
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,770
Dong Chul.

73
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,239
Dong Chul. Look at me.

74
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,220
No!

75
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,160
Dong Chul!

76
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,260
Oh, no.

77
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,629
Dong Chul!

78
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Dong Chul...

79
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,580
Despite your attempts,

80
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,510
if you fail to forget about me,

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,520
I will find you then.

82
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,200
I've found you.

83
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,070
You have a face as bright as the moon...

84
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,439
and speak bluntly,

85
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,239
but your gaze is sweet.

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,749
My mountain spirit.

87
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,520
You've left your home and now live in a box.

88
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,559
Mr. Mountain Spirit.

89
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,498
Keep crossing the line, thinking you can get away with your visions.

90
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,869
You'll dearly pay for it.

91
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,070
It's me, isn't it?

92
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,340
The name of a woman you once sweetly called for.

93
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:15,809
"Cho Young."

94
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:22,320
I don't have any recollection of doing that.

95
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,890
What if that memory is within me?

96
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,660
Memories are supposed to be shared between people.

97
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,389
Memories are shared between people,

98
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,729
so it will be a great present for me too.

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
The memory...

100
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,070
I'll get it back.

101
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,379
A previous life...

102
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,789
is a thing of the past.

103
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,499
You should live your own life.

104
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,100
Have a comfortable, peaceful life.

105
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,729
I don't want to.

106
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,070
Why not?

107
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,570
Because it looks like you're suffering.

108
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,039
Do not get sick.

109
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,179
Neither your body nor your heart.

110
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,609
Do not hurt any part of yourself.

111
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,780
I'm on your side.

112
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,650
I'll help you.

113
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,070
Don't ever come back here to see me.

114
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,510
If you do, I'll scold you then.

115
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,618
Slowly.

116
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,780
- Not so fast. - Slowly.

117
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,220
- There you go. Good job. - That's it. Good job.

118
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,820
All right. Give us a minute.

119
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,820
There you go.

120
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,390
- Gosh. Good work. - Goodness.

121
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,160
- Okay. - He'll be okay.

122
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,729
- He's out of the woods now. - Yes.

123
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,739
Dong Chul!

124
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,210
Mi Sun.

125
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,149
(Nana Animal Hospital)

126
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,479
Gosh. Why are you shivering so much?

127
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,479
Why?

128
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,749
Well,

129
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,590
my fur disappeared all of a sudden.

130
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,960
Is it really you, Uncle?

131
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,460
Yes. This is your uncle. Uncle Dong Chul.

132
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
How did he turn back all of a sudden?

133
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:53,100
This is a miracle.

134
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,070
Maybe, miracles do exist after all. You know?

135
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,669
Uncle Dong Chul.

136
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,269
Uncle Dong Chul, I really thought you were going to die.

137
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,279
You have no idea how scared we were for you.

138
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,909
- Mi Sun. - Yes.

139
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,220
I'm hungry.

140
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,119
Yes. You must be hungry.

141
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,989
Yes, our food is ready.

142
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,889
Here you go, Dong Chul.

143
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,659
- No. - Uncle Dong Chul.

144
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,029
You must use your hands.

145
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,559
Here you go. This is your fork.

146
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,728
Grab this.

147
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,700
- Get your fork into the chicken. - Take this one.

148
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,830
Yes. Go for it.

149
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,499
There you go.

150
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,009
Take your time.

151
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,839
This is so tasty.

152
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
Yes. Is it tasty?

153
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,349
Here you go. Have some Coke too.

154
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,449
- No! - Hey!

155
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,749
Hold on a second.

156
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,359
Put your fork down.

157
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,758
Hold the cup with your hand.

158
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,029
There you go.

159
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,639
- What is it? - What's wrong?

160
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,169
It tastes amazing.

161
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,408
- Does it? - I see. It tastes good.

162
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:06,739
- Gosh. - Great. It tastes good.

163
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,680
- Dong Chul. - Yes.

164
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,210
By the way,

165
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,749
how did you turn back to a human form?

166
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,720
I have no clue.

167
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,489
He has no clue.

168
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,560
Wait.

169
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:26,629
Drink slowly.

170
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,159
- Does it burn? - That must burn.

171
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,670
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

172
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,440
How on earth did it happen?

173
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,470
Was there an incident like this in the record our ancestors kept?

174
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:39,810
I'm not sure.

175
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,440
I don't think I came across anything like this.

176
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,409
Yu Na and I will comb through the record.

177
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,518
Well,

178
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,149
is it like getting the last present?

179
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,419
You know,

180
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,248
right before people die, they get...

181
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,560
Gosh. Don't say that. It's bad luck.

182
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,960
Go ahead.

183
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,629
Unit 306, Building A,

184
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,559
Dongdo Apartment, Garam yuk-dong.

185
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,128
Yes. Okay.

186
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,269
Thank you. We'll try to deliver it fast.

187
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:07,899
Pan Dong.

188
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,369
- One order of fried chicken. - Okay.

189
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,840
It's time to take Dong Chul out for his walk.

190
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,479
Uncle Dong Chul.

191
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,190
Sit down, please.

192
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,850
Uncle Dong Chul.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,619
These are your hands now.

194
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,759
You must use your hands.

195
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,190
Use them.

196
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,109
Yu Na. Hae Na.

197
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,979
Growing up must have been tough for you guys.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,580
You need to start dating now.

199
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,149
Congratulations on getting a boyfriend.

200
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,950
Uncle Dong Chul.

201
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,489
When I was sick in the shape of a dog,

202
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,830
I had been meaning to ask you.

203
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,359
Where did you get this?

204
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,830
This?

205
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,759
It smells like tigers.

206
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,440
He hadn't been kissed. But his curse was lifted.

207
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,210
Do you think there could be a secret or something?

208
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,970
(All will be forgotten...)

209
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,989
A mountain spirit?

210
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,570
It looked like a letter about the curse.

211
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,508
By the way,

212
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,340
aren't mountain spirits supposed to help people?

213
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,979
I'm about to go into my house now.

214
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,350
I'll call you right back.

215
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,389
Mr. Lee.

216
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,649
Is Seo Won home?

217
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,790
Yes.

218
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,690
It's nice to go on dates with Seo Won, isn't it?

219
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,499
You guys look happy.

220
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,229
I see. He must have already told you.

221
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,940
Going on dates in your human form is convenient, isn't it?

222
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:00,909
In my human form?

223
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,180
Yes, in your human form.

224
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,710
Gosh. Not in the shape of a dog.

225
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,850
What do you mean?

226
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,790
Goodness.

227
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,659
I put that curse on you.

228
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,259
The curse that turns you into a dog.

229
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,768
I don't understand what you're saying.

230
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,970
I should go inside now.

231
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,440
Hey, Hae Na.

232
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
Well, will this make you believe me?

233
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,359
You...

234
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,470
Who are you?

235
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,940
I won't make it easy for you to figure out.

236
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,840
Take your time, and think about it.

237
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,909
You see,

238
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,109
I had been around you guys...

239
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,810
much longer than you might think.

240
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,190
Hae Na.

241
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,629
Hae Na. Are you all right?

242
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,170
What's gotten into you?

243
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,229
Go and wash up.

244
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,200
Gosh, it's so cold today.

245
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,710
Yu Na, give me your best shot.

246
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,949
- Stop it. - Take that.

247
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,350
- Seriously. Stop it. - Look at this.

248
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,449
- Come here. - Stop it.

249
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,858
Kids. Do you want some fish-shaped buns?

250
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,989
- Yes! - Yes!

251
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,060
- Thank you. - Sure.

252
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,128
Enjoy your buns.

253
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,259
- Okay. - See you around.

254
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,999
- Thank you. - Bye.

255
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:41,869
Look at this.

256
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,399
You see,

257
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
I had been around you guys...

258
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,680
much longer than you might think.

259
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,190
It does...

260
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,720
look like Bo Gyeom.

261
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,560
I couldn't believe it even after seeing it.

262
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,830
It just doesn't make sense.

263
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,428
How is this possible?

264
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,899
Why do you think he cursed your family?

265
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,300
I wonder that myself.

266
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,899
Why us?

267
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,879
(Knock Before Entering Teacher's Office)

268
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,129
Are you looking for someone?

269
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,270
No.

270
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:02,439
This explains why I kept smelling foxes at school.

271
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,010
A mountain spirit of tigers.

272
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,149
And a fox, staying by his side.

273
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,070
Lady Flint. Wait, no.

274
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,669
Min Ji A...

275
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,480
seems...

276
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:41,250
to remember you.

277
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,219
How do you know that?

278
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,820
Pardon?

279
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,889
Well,

280
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,659
her visions are right on the nose. You know?

281
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:59,070
If she were to regain all of her memories,

282
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,770
doesn't it mean Lady Flint has returned?

283
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,300
Gosh. If that happens,

284
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:09,040
you won't have to go through the hassle of getting revenge.

285
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:12,010
We might finally be able to go back to the mountain.

286
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,149
I'm no longer the mountain spirit...

287
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,949
she remembers.

288
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,389
Good grief.

289
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,188
What I'm saying is, you should stop here...

290
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:28,330
There is nothing we can change now.

291
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,030
It has already begun.

292
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Bo Gyeom.

293
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,990
What is this?

294
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,359
My gosh. When was this?

295
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,399
She has grown so much, hasn't she?

296
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,600
It looked like the two of you had been seeing each other.

297
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,439
Is it going well?

298
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,020
See you around, kiddo.

299
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,669
See you around, kiddo.

300
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:22,169
Bo Gyeom.

301
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,240
You'll find out soon.

302
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,889
Welcome. This way, please.

303
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:47,759
Hello.

304
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,928
Please form a line over here.

305
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,159
- Hello. Yes, hello. - Hello.

306
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,869
Good to see you, Bok Sil. Come here.

307
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:55,868
Look at you. You've grown so much.

308
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,868
Come here. My gosh.

309
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,209
You came all the way here, so I brought you...

310
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,138
- Oh, my. - some potatoes and sweet potatoes.

311
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:04,379
- They're tasty. - My gosh. Thank you.

312
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,780
Ma'am, don't give Bok Sil sweet potatoes too often.

313
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,819
Bok Sil has gained even more weight compared to last year.

314
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Okay, Doctor. I always trust you, you know.

315
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:19,030
Bok Sil will be fine if she just loses a bit of weight.

316
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,289
Let's go, Bok Sil.

317
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,359
Good job. Well done.

318
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:24,760
Doctor.

319
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,730
Who is that young lady?

320
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,868
We brought these for you.

321
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,269
My gosh. Thank you so much.

322
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,639
- Please wait just a few minutes. - Thank you.

323
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,178
- She's a friend of mine. - Not your girlfriend?

324
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,378
- Doctor, I brought you this. - Gosh.

325
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:41,408
No, please. It's okay.

326
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:42,520
It's really okay.

327
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,179
No, it's okay!

328
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,399
Every year, I wondered where you were going all alone.

329
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,369
You've been coming here to volunteer?

330
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,600
You're kind of cool.

331
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:07,909
I know.

332
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,780
You booked the ferry to go back, right?

333
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:17,379
Yes.

334
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,290
- What? - What?

335
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,628
Excuse me. Do you still have a ferry leaving the island?

336
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:32,060
Oh, no. The last ferry left a moment ago.

337
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
What?

338
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,909
What kind of idiot buys one-way ferry tickets?

339
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,280
It wasn't... It really wasn't intentional.

340
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,090
We missed the last ferry,

341
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:58,119
and this was the only room that was still available.

342
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,129
Hey, doesn't this look all too familiar?

343
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,000
Right, I've seen stuff like this in a number of TV dramas.

344
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,740
"Honey, I'll just hold your foot like this and sleep."

345
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,869
Then the female lead would be like, "My gosh. Don't do this."

346
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,878
"Come on. I'll just hold your hand and fall asleep."

347
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:18,379
- "Come here." - "No, please don't be like this."

348
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Well...

349
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,319
Hey, how about a beer?

350
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,889
- I'll go to the store. - Okay. We've run out of beer.

351
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,928
- Be quick. - There's a store nearby, right?

352
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,230
Yes. See you in a bit!

353
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,000
- The phone is now up and running. - Okay. Goodness.

354
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,468
- Take these too. - My gosh. Thank you.

355
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,399
- Gosh, how kind. - Thank you. Have a good day.

356
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:46,969
Happy now?

357
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:48,310
Do you even have anyone to call?

358
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,449
You punk. Don't tell me...

359
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,709
What?

360
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,749
I bet you're going to call that woman.

361
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,779
No.

362
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,419
Get it together, you idiot.

363
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,888
She refused to help you break the cause...

364
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:02,020
and left you. You still haven't forgotten her?

365
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,560
- Hand it over. - Why?

366
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,259
- Hand it over at once. - No, go away!

367
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
What? You brat!

368
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,359
Hey, stop right there.

369
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,760
Stop!

370
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,800
Dong Chul!

371
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,909
Dong Chul.

372
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:29,080
Yes, Mom.

373
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,050
Gosh, Hae Na. What should we do? Your uncle...

374
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,219
Your uncle...

375
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,300
Have you found out anything?

376
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,869
Why are you doing this to me?

377
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,609
Why are you messing with my family?

378
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,889
Mak Soon.

379
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,649
Duk Gu followed Cho Young and died.

380
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:37,919
Why are you still alive?

381
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:41,119
Even a dog follows its master when the master dies.

382
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:43,959
I am carrying...

383
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,790
a child in my womb.

384
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,000
Was it for your child's sake that you let swordsmen in my mountain?

385
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,099
No, I just...

386
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,669
For the man you love,

387
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,800
you betrayed your master?

388
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:02,580
I can gladly leave this lowly body,

389
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:08,280
but please spare my child.

390
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,060
I will not use this sword that easily.

391
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,899
I cannot put an end to it so easily.

392
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,270
However, that child...

393
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,340
Your sin will follow that child.

394
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,810
No. Please do not do that, my lord.

395
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,280
That child's children and their children too.

396
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,449
When your descendants kiss someone,

397
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:49,119
they will transform into something that is not human.

398
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,419
Only when they can prove their so-called "love,"

399
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:56,000
they can return to their human form.

400
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,729
This curse will be passed down generation after generation,

401
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,770
and your descendants will never break free from it.

402
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Hence, they will be reminded of their ancestor's sin...

403
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,810
over and over again.

404
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,439
Please, no.

405
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,678
No, my lord.

406
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,850
Please do not do this.

407
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,389
I'll lift the curse that was put on your family.

408
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,000
I have one condition, though.

409
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,100
Do you remember the day when your curse was activated?

410
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,600
Wait, Seo Won!

411
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,100
It's cold outside. Take this.

412
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,990
Mr. Lee.

413
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,280
Are you all right?

414
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,659
Hey, Seo Won.

415
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,230
You haven't forgotten about that cake, right?

416
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,369
Then you developed feelings for each other.

417
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,240
And now, you two are in love.

418
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
You'll have to make things go back to the way they were...

419
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:25,209
before that incident took place.

420
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,850
What do you mean?

421
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,189
How Seo Won feels about you.

422
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,659
Back to the time when he had no feelings for you...

423
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,969
whatsoever.

424
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,840
Just like that, his memories of you will disappear.

425
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,439
Then Seo Won...

426
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,580
won't like you anymore.

427
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,760
I am going to get rid of every ounce of affection he has for you.

428
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,230
Make your choice.

429
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,969
Will you break the family's curse?

430
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,740
Or will you choose your beautiful love over it?

431
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,480
I'll give you one day to decide.

432
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,300
What did you do to Ms. Han?

433
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,899
Where is she now?

434
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,899
How would I know?

435
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,209
Don't lie to my face!

436
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,130
Because of the two of you,

437
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,460
I lost this person.

438
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,540
It's only fair that you two pay for it too, don't you think?

439
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,790
The beautiful, heartwarming memories that you two share.

440
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,819
I will erase them all.

441
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,929
No.

442
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,330
You can't do anything.

443
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,330
Even if those memories are gone,

444
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,770
we'll fall in love again.

445
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:10,980
All right, then.

446
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:07,500
Back to the time when he had no feelings for you...

447
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,869
whatsoever.

448
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,869
Make your choice.

449
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:17,779
Will you break the family's curse?

450
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,880
Or will you choose your beautiful love over it?

451
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,699
I wanted to come here and see this with you.

452
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:15,130
The sea.

453
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,239
Me too.

454
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,650
Your uncle...

455
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,210
You should save him.

456
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,650
You can't let him die.

457
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,420
You know,

458
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,929
I've liked you since the moment I first saw you.

459
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,560
But you didn't really seem to like me,

460
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,400
so I gave up quickly.

461
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,710
But those feelings remained,

462
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,210
so I kept looking out for you and stealing glances at you.

463
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,779
So...

464
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,920
I might have come across as cold at the beginning.

465
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,420
Sorry about that.

466
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,389
Even if our memories are gone,

467
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:18,330
our feelings will remain,

468
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,100
so I'll go to you.

469
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,839
If you take a step back,

470
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,540
I'll take two steps toward you.

471
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,150
Even if I get a little lost,

472
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,480
I'll be okay because I've walked the path before.

473
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,150
Hello.

474
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,489
Young Master Soo Hyun is here.

475
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,500
Young Master Soo Hyun is here.

476
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,670
Young Master Soo Hyun has arrived.

477
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,440
He is here again.

478
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,920
He is here.

479
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,500
- My lady, be careful. - Wait.

480
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,310
- Let us go that way. - Yes, my lady.

481
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,210
Watch your step.

482
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,400
- Mak Soon. - Yes?

483
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,759
The weather is so nice today.

484
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,139
Go and have some fun.

485
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,009
- Hey, there. - Yes?

486
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,230
- What? - Young Master Soo Hyun?

487
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,630
Hello.

488
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:30,040
I will head inside now.

489
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,850
Mak Soon. Mak Soon!

490
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:45,060
It will get dark soon. Why do you want to go for a walk?

491
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,290
Leave it open.

492
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,199
Pardon? But why...

493
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,130
Lead the way.

494
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,169
I wonder what made Mak Soon...

495
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,869
so mad for her to stay in bed without eating dinner.

496
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:25,960
Why did you come all the way back here?

497
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,429
Why did you go inside earlier?

498
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,270
That lady from earlier...

499
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,080
It seems our families will be discussing marriage.

500
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,489
Mak Soon.

501
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:57,060
If I become a nobody,

502
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,830
will you be okay?

503
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,069
Mak Soon.

504
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,739
Let us live together somewhere far away.

505
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:15,710
Though it may be a little cold...

506
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,619
and a little hot,

507
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:22,520
and even if we end up eating less,

508
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,589
we can weave mats...

509
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,889
and make straw sandals...

510
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:34,569
as we have pleasant conversations...

511
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,869
with each other...

512
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:42,339
at a place...

513
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,480
where no one can say anything about me being nice to you.

514
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,719
Are you sleeping?

515
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,369
Do you happen to know who Lee Won Hwa is?

516
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,179
He is Prince Eunsung's great-grandson.

517
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,779
He is a member of the royal family, albeit in a collateral line.

518
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,949
Earlier today,

519
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,690
he was killed while being arrested for plotting treason.

520
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,819
Lee Won Hwa's wife...

521
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,500
is here for postpartum care at the moment for she is expecting soon.

522
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,069
We will arrest her right away. Consider yourself informed.

523
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,969
Giddy up!

524
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,710
Mak Soon!

525
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,449
- Lock the door. - Yes, sir.

526
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:09,250
Where is Master?

527
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,319
He is one of the envoys visiting Qing.

528
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:13,889
He left early in the day yest...

529
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,860
Lady Han, the wife of the traitor, Lee Won Hwa.

530
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,730
Come out at once. We must tie you up!

531
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:22,099
- My lady. - This way, my lady.

532
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,569
Watch your step, my lady.

533
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,899
Please get out and hide.

534
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,540
Mak Soon. Keep her safe.

535
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,210
Hurry.

536
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,139
- Oh, gosh. - Get them!

537
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,110
Check everywhere!

538
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,548
Gosh, my goodness.

539
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:38,980
- You cannot go in there. - Sir.

540
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,989
My lady.

541
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:46,719
They went that way!

542
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,659
- Get them! - Go!

543
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,029
Be careful, my lady.

544
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,080
Young Master. What just happened?

545
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,690
Go and keep Lady Han safe.

546
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,119
I will find out what is going on.

547
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,989
Can you not go?

548
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,929
There must be a way.

549
00:49:58,759 --> 00:49:59,799
But...

550
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:04,739
We will meet again.

551
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,770
Be safe.

552
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,719
Even with your face covered,

553
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:29,489
did you think I would not be able to recognize your sword skills?

554
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,529
We will meet again.

555
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:36,670
Be safe.

556
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,739
Please keep Young Master Soo Hyun safe...

557
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,009
and help Lady Han lift her spirits.

558
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,219
Also,

559
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,089
please protect the baby in my stomach...

560
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,600
Did something happen?

561
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,839
Go away.

562
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,069
Is there still no news about Young Master Soo Hyun?

563
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,440
No.

564
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,350
He would be happy to hear about the baby.

565
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:36,719
Have you thought of a name for the baby yet?

566
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,758
If he is a boy,

567
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:41,360
I will take a syllable from Young Master Soo Hyun's name.

568
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,389
If she is a girl,

569
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,159
I will take a syllable from your name.

570
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:48,929
- My name? - Yes.

571
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,839
I will name her Cho A.

572
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,139
What a pretty name.

573
00:52:57,409 --> 00:52:58,880
I am sure the baby will be beautiful...

574
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,009
no matter who they resemble.

575
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,449
That's it!

576
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,219
There.

577
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,630
How cold!

578
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:16,759
It is freezing! I cannot go inside.

579
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,799
I should just do this from out here.

580
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,529
Goodness.

581
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:22,069
Darn it.

582
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,639
I cannot believe you.

583
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,569
How did you do all of those fun things without me?

584
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,210
Were you not busy yesterday?

585
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,650
But still, how could you...

586
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,980
Gosh.

587
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,480
Darn it. I missed.

588
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,549
Goodness.

589
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,589
Right. About Lady Flint...

590
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,599
Did you not say the palace people were still looking for her...

591
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,029
because of her baby of royal blood?

592
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,068
If she gets caught,

593
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:59,069
they will probably torture her to make her hand over her child.

594
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:02,440
They will not believe her even if she says that the baby is dead.

595
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,279
I saw her in the village the other day.

596
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,210
The servant of Lady Flint.

597
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,089
- Are you talking about Mak Soon? - Yes, Mak Soon.

598
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:17,520
She was looking for something.

599
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,489
I heard she was looking for her lover.

600
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,529
He went missing after getting involved in Cho Young's matters.

601
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,000
She looked like she was pregnant. It must be that man's child, right?

602
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,330
Probably.

603
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,069
Is Mak Soon trustworthy?

604
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,610
She is a close friend of Cho Young, who grew up with her...

605
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,909
ever since they were little.

606
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,920
But still,

607
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,219
one should not trust someone who has a baby in their stomach.

608
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,619
You never know...

609
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:52,689
what she will do to save her baby.

610
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,158
Let us be real. If she and her lover...

611
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:57,699
rat on Lady Han, those two,

612
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,130
no, including their child, the three of them...

613
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,529
will be able to preserve their lives.

614
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:20,949
My lord. By any chance,

615
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,790
did Young Master Soo Hyun come today?

616
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,420
Young Master Soo Hyun?

617
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,130
Yes.

618
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,329
That is not important right now.

619
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,500
He got caught helping a criminal run away,

620
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,029
so he will be beheaded tomorrow.

621
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:44,480
My lord.

622
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,179
Please allow me to see Young Master Soo Hyun just once.

623
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,179
Goodness. If you get caught, I will be killed as well.

624
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,949
Please. I am begging you.

625
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,790
Here.

626
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,020
Please accept this...

627
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,230
and grant my request.

628
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:04,400
Before helping them run away,

629
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,770
you probably prepared a hideout for them.

630
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,699
It is not too late.

631
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,940
Tell me where Lady Han and her child went.

632
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,980
That is the way for you to live.

633
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,610
Do you really want...

634
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,679
to be dragged...

635
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,580
and be beheaded tomorrow?

636
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,639
Where did you bring that from?

637
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,540
A female servant was here.

638
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,610
Where is she right now?

639
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,139
Is she safe?

640
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,210
She returned for now,

641
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,480
but something feels ominous.

642
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,619
Young Sun.

643
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,690
I need to get out of here.

644
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:08,730
That female servant was pregnant.

645
00:57:17,529 --> 00:57:18,540
My lord.

646
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,699
Thank you...

647
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:23,540
for paying for my mother's medicine for three years.

648
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,409
Now we are even.

649
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,389
My lord.

650
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,730
Please.

651
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,929
Please spare Young Master Soo Hyun's life.

652
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,400
How dare you come here, you servant?

653
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,670
Please.

654
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,270
I will do anything you ask. Please spare his life.

655
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:01,580
I...

656
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,449
I know where Lady Cho Young is.

657
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,889
If you lie,

658
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,929
you will not be safe either.

659
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:19,830
Where is she?

660
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,569
Tell me at once.

661
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:57,739
"My daughter, Cho A, look."

662
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,170
"My sin will find you..."

663
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,880
"and your child..."

664
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,210
"and their children."

665
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:10,380
"To me, you,"

666
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:13,119
"and the children of your children,"

667
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,690
"by the time we forget about everything,"

668
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,159
"the mountain spirit's curse will find us."

669
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,069
"The curse will creep up on us before we know it,"

670
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:32,170
"and we will lose..."

671
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:35,540
"what is precious to us."

672
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:23,219
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

673
01:00:23,549 --> 01:00:24,719
What happened?

674
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,560
I thought my memories were going to be erased.

675
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:29,259
Isn't it up to me whose memories I erase?

676
01:00:29,489 --> 01:00:30,729
Ms. Han, is it true?

677
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,429
Are you really dating Mr. Lee?

678
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,230
"Seo Hae Couple?"

679
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,069
This is my handwriting.

680
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:39,000
You acted like memories weren't important.

681
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,069
Good luck.

682
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:41,969
I feel strange these days.

683
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,380
I feel confused about my feelings.

684
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:46,810
Stop.

685
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,278
Everything you're doing right now.

686
01:00:48,279 --> 01:00:50,210
What are you doing?

687
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,719
Do you now realize...

688
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,520
what was stolen from you?
