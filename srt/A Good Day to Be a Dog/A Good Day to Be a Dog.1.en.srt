1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,889
My family has a secret.

2
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,520
Someone once said,

3
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,829
"There's no such thing as a bad dog."

4
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,590
Yu Na.

5
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,160
So I can never kiss anyone?

6
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:21,520
However, there's such a thing as a bad curse.

7
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,289
Hae Na!

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,610
Hae Na.

9
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,750
- Come on, Hae Na. - Hey, hurry.

10
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:55,949
Hey guys.

11
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,190
Ta-Da.

12
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,659
Hae Na, happy one-year anniversary.

13
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,418
- Gosh, I'm so jealous. - Thanks, babe.

14
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:06,289
Hey. You two should move in together now that she passed the exam.

15
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,599
- Oh, my. - Congratulations, Hae Na.

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,169
- My gosh. - It's a lip-shaped cake.

17
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,310
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, guys.

18
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,350
We're the only couple having their 1st kiss on their 1st anniversary.

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,979
What? "Kiss?"

20
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,650
Oh, no. What should I do?

21
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,069
This time,

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
it looks like it'll be hard to get out of this.

23
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,940
- All right. - Let's party it up.

24
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,038
- Hey, look. - What's going on?

25
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,038
- My gosh. Look at that. - Who did that?

26
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,150
Babe, I'm sorry!

27
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,280
Just like that, another relationship came to an end.

28
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,840
- Hey, wait up. - Hi, cutie!

29
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,780
- Hi. - Hi.

30
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,608
Hello.

31
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,078
- Let's go. - Ms. Han.

32
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,448
- Hello. - Yes, hi.

33
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:34,479
- Hey, I'm telling you. - Stop it.

34
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,349
Hey, I've got big news.

35
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,720
Jun Woo is getting married.

36
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,918
Hey, Hae Na is in this chat too.

37
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,989
- I know. - Hae Na. You're okay, right?

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,729
- Of course, I'm okay... - Hey, why wouldn't she be okay?

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,299
Hae Na, I'm saying this out of concern.

40
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,340
Will you stay single forever and grow old alone?

41
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,069
What can she do? She has ridiculously high standards.

42
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,680
- It's not that... - Anyway, who's the bride?

43
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,280
She looks familiar for some reason.

44
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,649
Who's up for a drink this evening?

45
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,979
Sorry, I'm going to the movies with my boyfriend tonight.

46
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,720
- Today is my one-year anniversary. - I'm getting this today.

47
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,919
Sorry, I've got plans for this evening too.

48
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,460
Traitors.

49
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,760
Hi, guys.

50
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,950
Hello.

51
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,249
- Hello. - Good morning, Mr. Lee.

52
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
He's so hot.

53
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,530
Hi, girls.

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,739
Why? What is it?

55
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,910
Today is our first day as a couple.

56
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,450
Today is the 24th.

57
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:19,090
What? Shall I show you the calendar?

58
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:20,289
Go back to your classroom!

59
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:27,659
- Ta-Da! - Is that for him?

60
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,100
- Hey, let's ask. - What do you think?

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,729
- Isn't this so cool? - Show me.

62
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,229
- Come on. - Hi, guys.

63
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,639
- Where? I can't even see it. - Isn't it so nice?

64
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,509
- I thought this was it. - There's nothing.

65
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,178
- Hey, I got this too. - You bought a perfume?

66
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:44,438
- What? - Hey, that's nuts.

67
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,949
- But this is... - It's the same thing.

68
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,478
- Hey, show me. - Let me see.

69
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,118
- I thought... - It's not there?

70
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,419
- I can't even see it. - Isn't it so pretty?

71
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,049
Guys, do you see this?

72
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,460
You guys are...

73
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:58,929
breaking my heart.

74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,160
Well done.

75
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,699
We have those application forms...

76
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,368
for the volunteer opportunities at school.

77
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,639
Many of you haven't submitted your applications.

78
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,039
Collecting cell phones, sorting recyclables,

79
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,178
taking care of the blackboards. There are still many vacancies.

80
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,510
I'm doing my best...

81
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,079
to help you guys so your student records can look nicer,

82
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,780
so hurry up and apply.

83
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,320
While I'm still talking to you nicely.

84
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,850
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,889
Ms. Han, stop worrying about our student records.

86
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,760
Shouldn't you worry about improving your appearance first?

87
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm all dolled up today.

88
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,329
I'm talking about BUKC.

89
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,129
You need to date, or you won't stop.

90
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,100
What is "BUKC?"

91
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,929
It stands for "Breaking up kissing couples."

92
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,070
Ms. Han. Seriously, why do you do that?

93
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,539
Hey!

94
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:55,849
Is it because you're jealous?

95
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,780
The one who feels jealous is the loser.

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,650
Ms. Han, cheer up.

97
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,359
Hey.

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,759
Yes, wish me luck!

99
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,659
I'll take attendance.

100
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,228
- Min A. - Yes.

101
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,559
- Hyo Jin. - Yes.

102
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
Hey, BUKC.

103
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,710
Don't call me like that, please.

104
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,139
Why must you break up all the couples that are kissing?

105
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,580
Just leave them be.

106
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:25,909
It's disgraceful.

107
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,580
I've never done it, but they do it at school.

108
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,450
"Disgraceful?"

109
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,989
Or is it because you're just jealous?

110
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,720
- What? - You told me...

111
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,359
that you wanted to date, but you were an anti-kisser.

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,329
You said men always dumped you the moment you told them...

113
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,429
you were an anti-kisser.

114
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,629
I told you. I can do anything and everything except for a kiss.

115
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,599
That sounds even weirder.

116
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,369
Just say no to everything.

117
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,070
Why are you so against kissing?

118
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,970
Don't tell me you've really never kissed anyone.

119
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,080
For real?

120
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:02,879
Do you have some kind of disease?

121
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,350
Disease?

122
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,059
Uncle, I got a perfect score!

123
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:16,900
Sure, it's a disease.

124
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,369
What is it?

125
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,199
Come on. What is it?

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,570
Gosh, I don't know. Oh, no!

127
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,070
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

128
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,510
Is your hand okay?

129
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,410
That obnoxious jerk.

130
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,749
Why do you hate Mr. Jin so much?

131
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,720
He's kind of cold, but he's handsome.

132
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,220
He's very popular with the kids.

133
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,119
I don't hate him.

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,989
He's the one who hates me.

135
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,089
Why?

136
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,259
Hey! Bring it back!

137
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,670
That was so cool.

138
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

139
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,320
Hello, ladies.

140
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,090
- Oh. Hello, Mr. Lee. - Hello.

141
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:15,190
That's right. We're all going out...

142
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,489
for drinks later. You'll come too, right?

143
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,689
- Of course, I should be there. - All right.

144
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,929
- You said you had plans... - Yes, I should be there.

145
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,429
We don't go out together often.

146
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,659
Great.

147
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,300
That's right.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,239
We're going to have a barbecue, so eat light at lunch. Okay?

149
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,080
My gosh. He's so sweet.

150
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,180
He's the reason I come to work.

151
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,949
Good for you.

152
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,920
That you have a reason for coming to work.

153
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,488
When will they get here?

154
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,489
They'll be here soon.

155
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,960
There you are. Hello.

156
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,560
My gosh. He's so handsome.

157
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,239
Is Ms. Yoon not here yet?

158
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,498
Oh, she said she had to take care of something.

159
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:05,609
She'll meet us here.

160
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,080
You must be hungry. Let's go inside.

161
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,609
Clearly, she lied.

162
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,079
I'm sure she's busy putting on makeup now.

163
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,149
My gosh.

164
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,849
Oh, my. This place is like paradise.

165
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,719
Hey, you're so adorable.

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,349
Why are you guys all here?

167
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,350
How cute.

168
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,619
Do you like dogs too?

169
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,960
Of course, I do. They're so cute, you know.

170
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,129
You're cuter.

171
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:29,899
Yes, that's it.

172
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:33,800
Hey, let's go.

173
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,070
Let's watch them for just a little longer.

174
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,070
My gosh. They're so cute.

175
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,509
Oh. Mr. Jin, did you hurt your hand earlier?

176
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,190
I'll wait inside.

177
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,529
Gosh, that obnoxious jerk.

178
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,269
It's all cooked now.

179
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,810
Here, handsome teachers. Good job today.

180
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,710
Eat up.

181
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,759
Sorry I'm a little late.

182
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
It looks so good.

183
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,739
Calm down. You're on edge because you're hungry.

184
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,810
How come no one's drinking?

185
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,350
Oh, here.

186
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,488
As young fellow teachers,

187
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,988
we should hang out like this often...

188
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,399
and go on trips together too.

189
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,060
Yes, I'd love that.

190
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,399
My goodness.

191
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,739
It's lonely to be stuck at home after work.

192
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,810
Right?

193
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,739
I don't feel lonely.

194
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,249
Oh, I see. Mr. Jin, you're like a coy cat.

195
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,019
This is my baby. You look like my baby.

196
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,350
Don't you agree?

197
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,989
Is this your cat?

198
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,290
What a pretty cat.

199
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,859
I guess you like cats too.

200
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,029
Yes, I do. But I like dogs more.

201
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,529
It's because...

202
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:49,100
dogs are sweet. You know?

203
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,310
Like him.

204
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,768
Good boy.

205
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,639
You're such a good boy.

206
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,210
Right?

207
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,879
One, two.

208
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,849
That was so impressive. My gosh!

209
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,158
Hold on. I need to use the restroom.

210
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,158
- My gosh. - Ms. Yoon is so cool.

211
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,499
That was really cool. Ms. Yoon is so cool.

212
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,430
Shocking news, guys.

213
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,070
Jun Woo is marrying Doo Na.

214
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,409
Your best friend is marrying your first love.

215
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,810
These rats.

216
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,450
Goodness.

217
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,460
Ms. Han, are you upset about something?

218
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,359
No.

219
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,509
Mr. Lee. You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

220
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,479
What do you think? Take a guess.

221
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,649
If I had a girlfriend, I'd be with her now.

222
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,220
When I'm seeing someone, I go all in.

223
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,820
Then what's your type?

224
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,559
I don't really have a type.

225
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,729
Come on. You must have a type.

226
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,129
I just like...

227
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,440
I tend to fall for women who like me first.

228
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,310
I hate playing games.

229
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:34,969
I like women who are straightforward. "I like you."

230
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,210
"Do you want to go out with me?"

231
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,850
I like it when they ask me out first.

232
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,220
- I have to answer this call. - Okay.

233
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,489
Wait, Seo Won! It's cold outside. Take this.

234
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,029
He hates it when things are complicated.

235
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,359
Keep it simple. Just go for it.

236
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,930
Go for it?

237
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Ms. Han.

238
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,430
Do you know what I like more than dogs?

239
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,399
It's you.

240
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,639
Really?

241
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,970
So...

242
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,249
ask me out first.

243
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,639
Go for it.

244
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,519
Mr. Lee.

245
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,859
Mr. Lee.

246
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,029
Ms. Han.

247
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,070
Yes, it's me.

248
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,069
Ms. Han, are you all right? You seem quite drunk.

249
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,080
No, I'm not drunk at all.

250
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,779
I have something to tell you.

251
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,518
Earlier, you mentioned...

252
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,080
that you like...

253
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,790
to keep things simple...

254
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,190
and that you tend...

255
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,859
to fall for women who like you first.

256
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,600
You also said earlier...

257
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:14,570
that you like women who can tell you their feelings honestly.

258
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,169
What I want to tell you is...

259
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,119
I like you, Mr. Lee.

260
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:45,570
Yes. I'm sure Mr. Lee can embrace a woman like me.

261
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,510
Ms. Han.

262
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,080
Oh, he can talk while kissing?

263
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:44,959
Are you all right?

264
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,600
Mr. Jin, what are you doing here?

265
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,730
Sorry?

266
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,869
Mr. Jin, your lips...

267
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:01,209
Why are you wearing this jacket?

268
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,310
Oh, no.

269
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,280
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

270
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,219
Ms. Han.

271
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:13,949
Ms. Han!

272
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,959
Hey, your purse!

273
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,290
Where is Ms. Han going?

274
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:19,790
I wonder if...

275
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,499
I think her parents are very strict.

276
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,730
She has a curfew.

277
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,800
Doesn't she just live with her older sister?

278
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:33,810
I only have a minute left.

279
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,580
When I kiss a man,

280
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,179
I turn into a dog...

281
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,719
because of that darn curse.

282
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,280
Darn it.

283
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:32,570
Oh, no. What do I do?

284
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,669
Hae Na, don't I look good today?

285
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,800
No, Uncle.

286
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,599
I look better than your dad, right?

287
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,669
No.

288
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:12,540
You're so playful.

289
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,408
I'm leaving now.

290
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:16,080
Okay. Have a good day.

291
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,009
My uncle looked perfectly normal...

292
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,510
when he left after saying goodbye in the morning.

293
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,879
Uncle, I got a perfect score!

294
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,449
But he came back as a dog.

295
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,419
Why do you have a mutt?

296
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,388
He's not a mutt.

297
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,619
He's my uncle.

298
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,129
Is his name Uncle?

299
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,500
Uncle. Give me your paw.

300
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,169
Don't annoy our uncle.

301
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,869
He's really our uncle.

302
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,609
Come on. Stop lying.

303
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:46,709
She's not lying.

304
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,468
My mom told me that our family turned into dogs...

305
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:50,179
when they were kissed.

306
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,310
Then do you turn into a dog when you're kissed?

307
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:55,649
Yes.

308
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,850
I'll believe you if you show me.

309
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,189
What?

310
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,359
You didn't turn into a dog.

311
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,169
I'll turn into a dog in a minute.

312
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,580
Mom! It didn't happen.

313
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,649
What didn't happen?

314
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,689
I didn't turn into a dog when I kissed him.

315
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,790
What?

316
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,409
This stop is Hyunseo Station.

317
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,510
It's the last train departing from Hyunseo Station.

318
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,510
When we see stray dogs on the street,

319
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,480
we always check them out.

320
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,980
Zero,

321
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,580
zero,

322
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,820
seven.

323
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,929
Bang.

324
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,330
Han Yu Na?

325
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,899
What?

326
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,770
Didn't you learn your lesson last time? This again?

327
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:27,669
Who was it this time?

328
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,040
Who did you kiss, Yu Na?

329
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,369
- What about me? - You startled me.

330
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,240
You... It wasn't you?

331
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:37,740
That's not you?

332
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:40,010
Who's this?

333
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,189
That's Hae Na's shoe.

334
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,560
Are you Hae Na?

335
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:02,029
What is this, Hae Na?

336
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,500
- I can't believe this! - What's going on?

337
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:06,669
What is this?

338
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,840
What happened? What is it?

339
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,809
What's she saying?

340
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,379
How would I? She can't talk.

341
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:13,949
She's just barking right now.

342
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,080
What am I going to do now?

343
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:19,389
Okay. Be quiet.

344
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,760
When she wakes up, she'll be completely naked.

345
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,429
When is she going to turn back?

346
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,199
At 6am.

347
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,270
Then she will turn into a dog at midnight.

348
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,439
For how long?

349
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,780
For 100 days.

350
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,010
If she can't break the curse by then,

351
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,350
she'll live her life as a dog for the rest of her life.

352
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,149
Like your uncle?

353
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,590
She managed to fall asleep despite everything.

354
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,119
You've never been a dog before, right?

355
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,189
Of course, not.

356
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,859
It's such a hassle.

357
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,158
Her body size shrank to a tenth of what it used to be.

358
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,629
But the world hasn't changed.

359
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,199
So to her, the world has gotten ten times bigger.

360
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,399
Then she'll only have to pay a tenth of her original food bill.

361
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,100
Good for her.

362
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,868
No.

363
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,740
Hae Na can break the curse just like you did before.

364
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,909
It's not that easy.

365
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,550
I wonder why your family ended up with such a curse. Seriously.

366
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,050
When your descendants find love and are kissed,

367
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,449
they will take a form that is no longer human.

368
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,119
They must prove the sincerity of their oh-so-precious affection...

369
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,659
to turn back into human again.

370
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,628
My curse will be passed down from generation to generation.

371
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,830
Your family will not be able to escape from my curse.

372
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,840
Are you all right?

373
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:34,490
What?

374
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,759
What's wrong?

375
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,030
A letter of resignation?

376
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,199
Have you gone mad?

377
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:44,730
I can't work at the school now.

378
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,369
I'd rather die than go back there.

379
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:48,468
Why not? What happened?

380
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:49,969
Tell me what happened.

381
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,969
I must have been under some kind of spell.

382
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,740
I was certain it was Mr. Lee.

383
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:56,510
What are you talking about?

384
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,609
Yu Na.

385
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,709
I must have been under some spell.

386
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,480
That must have been it.

387
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,020
I was definitely under a spell.

388
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,820
- I was under a spell. - You're scaring me.

389
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:10,990
Let me get this straight.

390
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,730
You thought you had kissed your sweet Korean history teacher,

391
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,790
but it turned out you kissed that obnoxious jerk math teacher?

392
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,260
Because they switched jackets?

393
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,070
Then how did you manage to pass your teacher certification exam?

394
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,869
This wasn't on the teacher certification exam.

395
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,009
What do you think?

396
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,240
Does the dress scream atonement?

397
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,780
Are you going to a funeral?

398
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,579
Why did it have to be Mr. Jin?

399
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,750
He's the teacher I feel the most uncomfortable around.

400
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,520
Anyway, you fulfilled your long-cherished desire.

401
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,589
What?

402
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,219
You had your 1st kiss at the age of 28.

403
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:46,688
Congratulations.

404
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:48,428
That wasn't a proper kiss.

405
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,429
His lips and my lips just happened...

406
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:52,869
to meet.

407
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,300
No.

408
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,168
That's not the right way to put it.

409
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,199
Wasn't that sexual harassment?

410
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,639
You had physical contact without his consent.

411
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,510
I'm a piece of trash.

412
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,619
Gosh. Just go to school now.

413
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,119
Mr. Jin is at school.

414
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Hey, come to your senses.

415
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,790
You do realize that...

416
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,659
you become a dog every night if you don't break the curse?

417
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,129
Darn it.

418
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,698
Hey.

419
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,369
Dab some of this on and get to school...

420
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,270
What are you doing?

421
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,868
Hey, get out of there.

422
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:32,968
I won't go to school.

423
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,138
No, go to school.

424
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,770
No, I can't!

425
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:38,509
Darn it, you little brat!

426
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,709
Go to school!

427
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,949
Why didn't you wait for me?

428
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,878
- What did I do? - I told you to wait up.

429
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,750
Hello.

430
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,709
Good morning.

431
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,600
Your bag.

432
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,600
I brought it for you.

433
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,310
I'm off to do the morning assembly.

434
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,609
- Thanks for doing this. - Sure.

435
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,689
- Ms. Yoon. - What?

436
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,949
Can we talk for a bit?

437
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,230
Did you get home okay last night?

438
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,169
Yes.

439
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:18,809
About yesterday...

440
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,580
Yes, of course. It's a secret.

441
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,449
Anyone can make mistakes when they're drunk.

442
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,550
Right.

443
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,750
It really was a mistake.

444
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
There were no emotions behind it.

445
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,959
It was really, truly, just a mistake.

446
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,560
Of course.

447
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,800
But it was totally a kiss...

448
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:42,939
Okay. I won't say any more.

449
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,340
Seo Won told me...

450
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,939
not to say anything.

451
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,179
Really?

452
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,280
Yes.

453
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,809
Seo Won may be the quiet type,

454
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,219
but he really is a great guy.

455
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,419
Anyway, I think it would be best...

456
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,020
for you to apologize to Seo Won.

457
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,760
He seemed pretty startled.

458
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,389
Yes.

459
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,830
I should do that.

460
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,459
Of course, I should.

461
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,379
He looks like a statue.

462
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,780
How can a person look like that?

463
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,649
That was a nice approach,

464
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,119
but I think you veered off from this point.

465
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,689
Watch.

466
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,070
There. Understand?

467
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,340
- Yes. - Okay.

468
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,850
Hey.

469
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,949
- Did you see Mr. Jin's face? - I did.

470
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,959
Seriously, he just keeps getting more handsome by the day.

471
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,990
I mean, you think,

472
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,659
"He can't get any more handsome than today."

473
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,760
but then, he just gets more handsome the next day.

474
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,500
He just looks the same every day.

475
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,959
He's better than the average lecturer.

476
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:20,129
I know, right?

477
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,128
He's popular with the kids,

478
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:23,740
and he's friends with Mr. Lee too.

479
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,840
So, why doesn't he seem to like me?

480
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,169
Is your hand okay?

481
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,009
Since you head home in the same direction as Ms. Han,

482
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,050
you should go together.

483
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,320
I feel a bit uncomfortable around her.

484
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,520
What? Why?

485
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,858
He said he felt uncomfortable around me,

486
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,990
so I've been avoiding him.

487
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:48,689
Why him of all people?

488
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,770
I'm sorry.

489
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,040
No matter how I think about it, I can't even...

490
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,040
Anyway, I'm really grateful that you kept it a secret.

491
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,750
Honestly, I didn't know you were such a generous person.

492
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,609
Are you sure you're sorry?

493
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,679
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,250
It was really a mistake.

495
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,719
I know.

496
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,119
You mistook me for Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom.

497
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,960
Yes, how did you know?

498
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,029
How could I not know in that situation?

499
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,399
So why on earth were you wearing Mr. Lee's coat?

500
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,569
Do I have to answer that question?

501
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:28,969
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,339
Anyway,

503
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,810
it's fine. It's not a grave sin or anything.

504
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,839
Let's just act like it never happened.

505
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,750
Thank you.

506
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:43,650
Let's forget about it all.

507
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,949
Excuse me, Mr. Jin.

508
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,259
By any chance,

509
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,119
do you like dogs?

510
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,259
The only way to break this darned curse.

511
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,469
Woo Taek.

512
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,869
It's okay.

513
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,179
It's to kiss the other person while I'm in dog form.

514
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,420
Yu Na.

515
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,989
I must kiss this man again today.

516
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,989
This time, as a dog.

517
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,900
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

518
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,269
Well, it's just that I like dogs, so I was wondering...

519
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,468
if you did too.

520
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,869
But why are you getting mad at me?

521
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,270
When did I do that?

522
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:42,739
Right now.

523
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,250
No, I'm not mad.

524
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,449
Mr. Jin.

525
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,819
As an apology,

526
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,529
- I will treat you to dinner. - What?

527
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,928
Hey! Stop!

528
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,029
Come here!

529
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,330
That's Ms. Han.

530
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,469
Why is she...

531
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,239
She must have something to say.

532
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,469
Please let me do that.

533
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,110
- It's fine. - Come on.

534
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,069
I just feel so uncomfortable about this.

535
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,039
There's no need to feel that way.

536
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,210
Well...

537
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,080
My guilt...

538
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,880
My conscience...

539
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,250
It hurts so much.

540
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,630
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,699
Why did she ask about dogs out of the blue?

542
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Mr. Jin.

543
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,380
Are you going out with Ms. Han?

544
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,310
What?

545
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,809
I mean, I saw you guys talking very affectionately.

546
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,880
I was just wondering.

547
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,750
Did that seem affectionate to you?

548
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,920
Well, in a way?

549
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,159
Please throw that out for me.

550
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,529
Hey.

551
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:07,929
Hey!

552
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,400
Did she mean crabs...

553
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,170
and not dogs?

554
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,380
Let's see how you're doing.

555
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,980
Just one second.

556
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,560
Good job.

557
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,020
- Be careful. - It's okay.

558
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:09,520
There we go.

559
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,560
- Good. - Push it in.

560
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:18,860
Dong Chul.

561
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,500
Let's go home. Let's go to my house, okay?

562
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:25,499
This is so upsetting.

563
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,770
It's okay.

564
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,610
Don't cry.

565
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,060
His BUN, creatinine, and other kidney tests look bad.

566
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,020
He will need to get dialysis.

567
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:48,359
But we can't operate on his brain tumour...

568
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,659
because he's too old.

569
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,230
How much longer...

570
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,730
will my uncle be able to live?

571
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,170
Don't worry too much.

572
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,709
Some dogs live for six months...

573
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,310
after being given a life expectancy of one month.

574
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,810
So you better lift the curse soon.

575
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,020
Didn't you see Mom crying her eyes out?

576
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,789
First, you should set up a date with that guy...

577
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,489
and ply him with drinks until midnight.

578
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,359
Once he's wasted,

579
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,889
you can kiss him in your dog form, and it's over.

580
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,729
That's easier said than done.

581
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,830
Just set up a date to meet him.

582
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,199
If your plan fails, we'll be there to help you.

583
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,600
Yes, someone should help.

584
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,710
"We?"

585
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,310
Woo Taek,

586
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,540
you know what?

587
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,309
After lifting my curse,

588
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,778
whenever I feel upset,

589
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:44,219
I want to bite people.

590
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:47,988
Do you want me to bite you?

591
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,250
Gosh, fine.

592
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,029
I'm going to go to my room.

593
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,239
- Okay. - Okay.

594
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,909
Good night.

595
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,060
Don't worry too much.

596
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,560
She'll be able to lift the curse soon.

597
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,000
Woo Taek.

598
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,069
Do you want to...

599
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:37,739
do something with me?

600
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,770
What?

601
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,139
Did you discuss this with her ahead of time?

602
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,509
I know she's family, but she still has portrait rights.

603
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,909
Can you move her face a little to the left?

604
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,719
Gosh. I think she'll get mad.

605
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,690
This will all be a memory once her curse is lifted.

606
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,520
Okay.

607
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,100
My goodness.

608
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,198
Isn't she so cute? Look.

609
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,600
I know she's your sister, but...

610
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,969
- She is pretty cute. - Right?

611
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,080
I can't butter anyone up for the life of me.

612
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,480
Hello.

613
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,889
What are you doing?

614
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,790
Goodness. There was just so much dust on your desk.

615
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,389
It's not good for your lungs. Aren't I right?

616
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:36,799
I was just worried about your health.

617
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,199
I'll take care of my own health.

618
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:40,830
Of course, you should.

619
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,068
How's your diet?

620
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,769
Do you want me to treat you to some meat?

621
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,139
Some meat and soju?

622
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,460
We really don't click.

623
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,089
But I should still try.

624
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,869
Do you not hear your dry hands asking for help?

625
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,169
Sorry?

626
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,769
When you're feeling dry, don't you think some alcohol...

627
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,670
will make your life a lot more shiny?

628
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,270
I don't like humidity.

629
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:26,579
Then you must hate the rainy season.

630
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,210
What do you think of discussing ways to prepare for the humidity?

631
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,880
Grilled intestines and soju?

632
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,500
That's it for today.

633
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,029
- Thank you. - Thank you.

634
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,139
Aren't the students so disobedient?

635
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:55,569
When you're stressed, pigs' feet and soju are the best.

636
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,249
You're eating like a bird.

637
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,619
When you don't have an appetite, chicken feet and soju are the best.

638
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:22,600
This is humiliating.

639
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,310
Why is she down in the dumps again?

640
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,100
I'm free tonight.

641
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,230
My gosh.

642
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:18,889
The operation is happening tonight.

643
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,989
At last.

644
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,670
Mr. Song Woo Taek,

645
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:30,569
it's today.

646
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,239
Excuse me.

647
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,309
Can we get two bottles of soju?

648
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,779
Room temperature, not cold, please.

649
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,980
I'll pass on the alcohol.

650
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,179
Sorry?

651
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,048
How could you not have soju with stir-fried chicken?

652
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,219
It's a must.

653
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,350
- But still... - But still,

654
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:52,790
you should because it's a "must."

655
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,629
Then I'll just have a glass of beer.

656
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,469
Excuse me, can we get a bottle of beer...

657
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:02,770
and the soju bottles?

658
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:14,178
Beer tastes softer when it's mixed with soju.

659
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:17,080
I know the perfect ratio. Do you want to see?

660
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,520
I'm okay.

661
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,449
I get drunk too fast when I drink soju.

662
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,088
I need to take this call.

663
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:31,259
Sure, go ahead.

664
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,469
You have to make him completely drunk...

665
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,298
to the point of him not being able to differentiate...

666
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:40,569
whether he's dreaming or not...

667
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,369
when the dog who kisses him turns into a human.

668
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,110
Got that?

669
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:48,810
Even the man who told me he loved me a million times...

670
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,218
treated me like a monster...

671
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,920
when I turned into a dog in front of him.

672
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,089
But you're dealing with...

673
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,190
an awkward and uncomfortable coworker.

674
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:59,420
You need to make sure he doesn't find out.

675
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:08,670
More.

676
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,969
More.

677
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,150
Cheers.

678
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,779
Sure.

679
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,420
I'm getting drunk.

680
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,999
She'll transform at midnight. Why are we already going?

681
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,798
You don't have anything better to do anyway.

682
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:20,770
If you have a problem with it, get yourself a girlfriend.

683
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:25,110
Do you think I can't?

684
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:34,819
Well...

685
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,190
I can make a rough guess...

686
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,819
as to why you kept trying to meet me.

687
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,630
Sorry?

688
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,699
Since I'm close with Bo Gyeom,

689
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,069
didn't you want to ask me to act as a middleman?

690
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,040
Yes, that's right. A middleman.

691
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:57,279
But I'm not sure if I'll be able to do a good job.

692
00:47:57,639 --> 00:47:58,810
I'm pretty clumsy.

693
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,178
Come on.

694
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:02,079
You don't need to be good.

695
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,449
All you have to do is stay right there.

696
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,849
If you just stay put,

697
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,549
I'll do the rest.

698
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,900
By the way,

699
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:22,029
why do you hate me?

700
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:24,569
Why would I hate you?

701
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,739
My point exactly. Why do you hate me?

702
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:28,139
What did I do wrong?

703
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,710
I've never hated you.

704
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:32,839
Don't make me laugh.

705
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,150
I keep a disappointment notebook inside my heart.

706
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,449
I remember everything.

707
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,779
During our break last year on April 20,

708
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,150
when all the teachers pitched in to buy snacks...

709
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,020
Darn it. We didn't buy blood sausages.

710
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:53,529
You disappeared in a flash.

711
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,369
Did you wear an invisibility cloak or what?

712
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,500
Do you remember or not?

713
00:48:58,339 --> 00:48:59,339
I remember.

714
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,568
Also, on Ms. Cheon's birthday last year,

715
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:03,409
when we went to buy a cake together...

716
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:06,080
I heard the mango cake is good,

717
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,710
but Ms. Cheon likes matcha.

718
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,619
But that one looks good too.

719
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,020
What should we do?

720
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,159
Do you remember or not?

721
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,000
I remember.

722
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,369
See?

723
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,069
So...

724
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,400
Why on earth do you hate me?

725
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:35,509
Why do you feel uncomfortable around me?

726
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,239
It's because whenever I'm with you...

727
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,049
There's something like that.

728
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:46,250
Something like what?

729
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,630
Anyway, it's true that I avoided you because I felt uncomfortable,

730
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,230
but it's not because I don't like you.

731
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,698
I'm sorry if I made you misunderstand.

732
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:07,569
What do you mean by that?

733
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:11,009
And I think you misunderstood something about me too.

734
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,779
I like them too.

735
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,049
What?

736
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,119
That animal.

737
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:20,449
Really?

738
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,960
They're tasty.

739
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:25,619
Sorry?

740
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,659
They're good steamed...

741
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,299
and in stews.

742
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:35,569
The stews are good.

743
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:38,969
Is he picking a fight with me?

744
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,110
Do they not sell soup here?

745
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,579
You have five minutes left. Get out of there.

746
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,650
Gosh. I need to step out for a second. Please excuse me.

747
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,489
Where are...

748
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,798
Mr. Jin, I'm in the alley by the restaurant.

749
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:12,669
Do you think you can step out for a second?

750
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,369
There is a really cute...

751
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,339
Excuse me, can we get a bottle of soju?

752
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:19,839
What?

753
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,778
What?

754
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,790
Should I call Bo Gyeom?

755
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,489
Calling Bo Gyeom.

756
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
What?

757
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,029
My gosh.

758
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,080
Gosh. I can't get used to this alter ego.

759
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,110
I need to end this "Dog-erella" life as soon as possible.

760
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,449
Ms. Han.

761
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,630
Ms. Han!

762
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,069
Ms. Han.

763
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:24,839
Ms. Han.

764
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:43,529
Hey there.

765
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:47,969
How cute.

766
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,980
Then it'll be over.

767
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,380
Ms. Han.

768
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,619
What? "Dogs" are tasty?

769
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,089
That obnoxious jerk.

770
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,948
I won't have to deal with him once I lift the curse.

771
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:44,219
Gosh. I can't see.

772
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,338
Aren't I cute?

773
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:04,509
I'm cute, aren't I?

774
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:09,810
All right. Now, let's get straight to it.

775
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:16,449
What?

776
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,259
Don't come close.

777
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:19,759
What's wrong with him?

778
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:22,830
Did he see a ghost or something?

779
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,400
What? I don't see anything.

780
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,560
Hold on. It wasn't a ghost.

781
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,520
He's afraid of dogs?

782
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,960
Come on. No way.

783
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,759
That can't be it. Please.

784
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,719
Wait, he's really afraid of me.

785
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,889
No, I'm completely doomed.

786
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:09,830
Okay. Focus.

787
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:12,940
This won't be on the test, but let's review.

788
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,569
First,

789
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:16,368
when I kiss a person of the opposite sex,

790
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:17,779
I turn into a dog within a minute.

791
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:20,179
Second,

792
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,219
I stay a dog from 12am to 6am every night.

793
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,650
Third,

794
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,988
if I can't lift the curse within 100 days,

795
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,520
I'll remain a dog for the rest of my life.

796
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,460
Lastly, number four, this is the most important.

797
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,060
How can the curse be lifted?

798
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,159
Yes, that's right.

799
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,629
Fourth, in the form of a dog,

800
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,000
kiss the same person again.

801
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,869
Does everyone understand now?

802
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,408
If you have any questions, leave them on the discussion board.

803
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,509
That's it for today's class.

804
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,850
I heard Ms. Han suddenly disappeared last night.

805
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,190
Did something happen?

806
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:37,588
Did she see me?

807
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:39,059
I'm sure you'll be fine on your own.

808
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,388
You kissed him on accident,

809
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:42,428
so you offered to treat him to a meal,

810
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:43,658
but you left without paying.

811
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:45,528
- In his perspective, you're... - A dine-and-dasher.

812
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:46,928
You dined and dashed.

813
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:48,368
Since you already agreed to help,

814
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:52,068
why don't we meet up regularly so I can receive some tips?

815
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,269
"Regularly?"

816
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,568
Is this Ms. Han Hae Na of Garam High School?

817
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:57,710
Ms. Han. The buses probably stopped running.

818
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:00,079
Hello? It's an emergency.

819
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,749
Oh, my gosh!

820
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,650
Just one glass of beer, please?

821
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:05,420
Were you even listening to me?

822
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:07,350
How many times do I have to say no?

823
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,619
I have been pretty annoying these days.

824
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,219
I probably felt like a leech to him.

825
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,060
Ms. Han, the thing is...
