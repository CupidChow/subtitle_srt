I feel strange these days.

10
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,388
I feel confused about my feelings.

11
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,789
Do you want me to show you?

12
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,218
Please don't avoid me.

13
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,288
I'll wait.

14
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,959
Until you find your missing piece.

15
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,229
Why are you doing this to me?

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,559
You asked me why I was doing this.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,730
It's all because of your cruel, selfish choice.

18
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,069
I think Mr. Lee is preparing for the end.

19
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,038
I'm saying that erasing Ms. Han's memory...

20
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,240
isn't the end.

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,740
I'm sorry. It was too late when I knew it.

22
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:16,909
It's not too late.

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,649
So come slowly.

24
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:26,418
My lord, you said we should go to the sea.

25
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,959
But here we met in the mountains again.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,059
I know where Lady Cho Young is.

27
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,830
Release!

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,330
I must die...

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,270
for everyone to live.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,299
So I will save all of you.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,338
My lady.

32
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,868
Had you not considered me in that brief moment...

33
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,410
you made your decision?

34
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,809
The sunset glow on your face was quite beautiful.

35
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,580
Our playtime is over.

36
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,520
It brought us pain and tears.

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,020
But it also made us laugh and was fun.

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,119
So you must now return home.

39
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:41,259
Are you all right?

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,060
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Ms. Han!

42
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,519
Guess what my colour is when I change.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,389
No matter what colour you are, I'm sure you'll still look pretty.

44
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,400
It's been a while since I ran as hard as this.

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
I ran as hard as I could after the first time...

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,319
I kissed you.

47
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,759
I missed you.

48
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,309
Why did you do that?

49
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,649

50
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,780

Good for them.

54
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,519
We totally bombed our CSAT. Which schools will we apply to?

55
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,060
I should just serve in the military.

56
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:21,330
I'll participate.

57
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,460
You're enlisting?

58
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,799
No, the festival!

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,929
The prize for first place is a laptop.

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,038
It's not about the prize.

61
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,510
I think this might help me with my audition.

62
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,580
She's applying to the Theater and Film Department, right?

63
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,710
Come on, don't lie. You're doing it for the laptop.

64
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,308
Hey, that's not true!

65
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:41,780

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,350

67
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,650
Yes. Take a look at this.

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,559

70
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,059

71
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,390

He doesn't know how to give electronic approval.

77
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,010
I kept waiting, but he never gave me the approval.

78
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,309
So I had no choice but to go to his office.

79
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,809
Then he wasn't there.

80
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,760

Why are you trying to make a birthday party meaningful?

He made me feel incredibly happy...

172
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,710
and caught me by surprise.

173

00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,879
Do you have a death wish?

187
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,389
I'm going to bed now.

188
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,859
Right, Yu Na.

189
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Good luck tomorrow.

190
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,759
I heard Woo Taek was coming over as your boyfriend.

191
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:06,800
Well,

192
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,999
there's not much for me to do.

193
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,739
He's the one who needs luck.

194
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,269
Whatever. I'm going to bed.

195
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,819
(Woo Taek is your son-in-law now.)

196
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,420
You seem different today.

197
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,989
You look handsome.

198
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,159
Mother, here.

199
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,599
Gosh, that's your favourite cake.

200
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,840
You all know what I like.

201
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,639
Oh, my.

202
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,310
It's the Jeju green tea cake.

203
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,008
Woo Taek knows everything about us, doesn't he?

204
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,210
Right.

205
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,419
Father, here.

206
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,879
Gosh, you didn't have to get me anything.

207
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,888
Now that you're here as future newlyweds,

208
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,518
it does feel like he's our son-in-law now.

209
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,659
Gosh.

210
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,659
Woo Taek. You should sit comfortably.

211
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,628
- May I? - By the way,

212
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,529
why did you break up with your ex-girlfriend from college?

213
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:12,999
Well...

214
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:15,268
Mom, why are you bringing that up now?

215
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,399
What's wrong with that? I'm just curious.

216
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,710
I was dumped.

217
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,070
Why?

218
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,409
Was there a problem?

219
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,540
Back then...

220
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,879
"Sweetie, who is she?"

221
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,649
"Why did you help her separate the perilla leaves?"

222
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,190
"Sweetie, why did she tear the kimchi with her hands for you?

223
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,689
"Sweetie, does she not have any hands?"

224
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,290
"Why can't she tie her own shoelaces?"

225
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,460
She was like that.

226
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,600
What's this?

227
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,200
Who was that girl?

228
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,170
You should have tied your own shoelaces.

229
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,470
It was just one time!

230
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,840
But I want to tie her shoelaces for the rest of her life now.

231
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,279
I'll do it for you.

232
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,408
Gosh. I can tie my own shoelaces.

233
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,719
- But still. It's better if I do it. - Gosh, stop it.

234
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,219
- Come on. Don't tickle me. - I know you like that.

235
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,089
Why are you doing that?

236
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,388
Come on. Stop it.

237
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,590
Guys.

238
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,060
You guys are gross.

239
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:19,899
By the way, where's Uncle?

240
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,128
He's on a date.

241
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:22,600
Does he have a girlfriend now?

242
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,839
You know,

243
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,009
he's been seeing a woman. It's been a week.

244
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,139
Anyway, your uncle has nothing to worry about now.

245
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,080
Who knew the price of the stocks he had for 18 years would skyrocket?

246
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,479
- Right. - Who knew she'd be his girlfriend?

247
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,320
So she knows the condition he's in, right?

248
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,790
He can't talk like humans, but at least the curse is lifted.

249
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:43,489
That's better than nothing.

250
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,529
That darn curse.

251
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,090
Dong Chul, did you see last week's episode of "Single's Purgatory?"

252
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,028
It was complete trash.

253
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,559
But the people on that show are so handsome and pretty.

254
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,129
So when they have flings...

255
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,040
It would be a huge hit if we were on that show.

256
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,840
Why don't we star on that show?

257
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,409
Do you want to audition for it?

258
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,050
What's this?

259
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,350
Dong Chul.

260
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,720
Did the stock price go up a lot?

261
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,430
I love bracelets like this.

262
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,659
Look at it sparkle.

263
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,700
Oh, my.

264
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,259
This...

265
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,029
This is perfect for me.

266
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,269
It's so pretty.

267
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Dong Chul.

268
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,769
Are you okay?

269
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,710
(When I choked on the bread, I thought I was going to die.)

270
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,840
(Because of this,)

271
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,849
(I thought I would never get to see you again.)

272
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,080
(I couldn't breathe because of this bread.)

273
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,919
(Chae A!)

274
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,889
(Dog Theme Park, Academy)

275
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,930
- How nice. Good dog. - Does it feel nice?

276
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,930
I'm sorry we can't go on a date on weekends.

277
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,269
It's okay. I like volunteering as a walker.

278
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,440
Woo Taek usually volunteers here.

279
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,639
But he's coming to see my parents before the wedding.

280
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,210
- Hello. - Hello.

281
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,080
Hello.

282
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,149
Woo Taek asked me to fill in for him today.

283
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,790
Do you want to go for a walk?

284
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,619
Shall we?

285
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:02,129
Should we walk that dog too while we're at it?

286
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,060
You want to walk the dog yourself?

287
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,600
Yes.

288
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,139
Mr. Jin.

289
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,509
Yes.

290
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:22,950
Sweetie.

291
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,050
Yes?

292
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,659
Sweetie,

293
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,090
answer me this.

294
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,859
Is there anything you want lately?

295
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,330
Or anything you need?

296
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,330
Or do you have any items that got worn out?

297
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,100
No.

298
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,340
Gosh. We should brush the dog.

299
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,778
There's a brush in the bag.

300
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,109
It should be in the front pocket.

301
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:32,990
Hey, guys.

302
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,490
Thank you for walking them.

303
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,819
There you go.

304
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,060
Wait.

305
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,790
Good job.

306
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you so much for walking them.

307
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,668
Toto, did you have a nice walk?

308
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,939
Toto. Make sure to eat well.

309
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:51,639
By the way, what's this dog's name?

310
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,939
We recently rescued this one. So we haven't named the dog yet.

311
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,139
Why don't you name the dog?

312
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,719
Duk Gu?

313
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,459
Duk Gu?

314
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,059
Duk Gu.

315
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,359
It was nice meeting you. Be good.

316
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,659
Duk Gu. Take care.

317
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,070
I'm glad.

318
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,340
I mean your fear of dogs.

319
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,550
I think you completely overcame it.

320
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,179
But I do get startled...

321
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,990
when I see big dogs.

322
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,850
Gosh. A lot of people feel the same way.

323
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,260
Including myself.

324
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,330
Having someone...

325
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:51,359
I can talk about my fear with is a bigger present for me...

326
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,469
than overcoming the fear.

327
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:57,570
Thank you...

328
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,909
for coming to me as a present.

329
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,330
Thank you...

330
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,199
for coming to me as a present.

331
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:31,969
So...

332
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,939
Why on earth do you hate me?

333
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,040
Why do you feel uncomfortable around me?

334
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,750
It's because whenever I'm with you...

335
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,080
There's something like that.

336
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,320
Something like what?

337
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,199
I like them too.

338
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,730
What?

339
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,830
That animal.

340
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,169
Really?

341
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,939

I sent him a direct message,

353
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,250
but he didn't respond, so I came to meet him.

354
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,820
I see.

369
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,730
Sorry?

370
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,330
There's no such thing as everlasting love.

371
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,129
But I can do it.

372
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,570
Do what?

373
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,040
Forever love.

374
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,379
You seem very distracted right now.

375
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,389
I'm not usually like this.

376
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:13,459
Then please excuse me.

377
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,359
Wait.

378
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,070
Mr. Jin.

379
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,399
Are you really going on "Single's Purgatory?"

380
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,769
- No. - People from the previous season...

381
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,500
of that show were so impressive.

382
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,438
The youngest daughter of a super-rich family, a famous pianist,

383
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,279
and some kind of physicist.

384
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,080
Right, I remember that person.

385
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,009
No wonder you've been single all this time.

386
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,550
You must have been waiting for an opportunity like this.

387
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,780
A physicist would be a good fit for you.

388
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,350
Two science majors will hit it off right away.

389
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,889
That sounds perfect.

390
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,119
Just go on the show and meet someone nice.

391
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,859
My gosh. Mr. Jin, maybe you'll marry someone from a super wealthy family.

392
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,899
Bye, I'm off.

393
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,689
Are you a fool?

394
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,459
Why can't you speak up?

395
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,060
"This man is mine."

396
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,188
"I can't let him participate in 'Single's Purgatory.'"

397
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:22,399
Why can't you say that?

398
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:26,300
What is this? Are you suddenly shooting a drama or something?

399
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:30,669
Come with me, babe.

400
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,569
- Can I contact you at this number? - Yes.

401
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,709
Everyone, we have something to tell you.

402
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,810
Oh, you've finally decided to go public with it?

403
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,879
What? Already?

404
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,919
Gosh. I had so much fun, teasing you like that earlier.

405
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,590
Come on. You should've hidden it from us for at least a year.

406
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,260
If the kids see this, it'll become troublesome.

407
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:52,260
Stop holding hands.

408
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,859
You all knew?

409
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,969
When you become single again,

410
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,770
- please contact me. - No, he won't need this.

411
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,270
Take care.

412
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,209
- Bye. - My gosh.

413
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,850
Hey.

414
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,719
- Make sure you eat something. - Okay.

415
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:22,760
I heard you passed the first round to get into Hanguk University.

416
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,020
Are you getting ready for the essay exam?

417
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,159
Yes.

418
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,560
Are you...

419
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,060
possessed by a ghost that really wanted to study...

420
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:32,969
but couldn't before death?

421
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,840
Do I still look like Ji A to you?

422
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,379
Just kidding.

423
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,879
I knew you were just kidding.

424
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:59,560
Hey. What's that?

425
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,389
A website for secondhand items.

426
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,629
The vice principal left behind a board game. I listed it on the site.

427
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,070
To sell it?

428
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,199
No. To find it.

429
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,240
- Find what? - A fox.

430
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,070
The vice principal? Why?

431
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:16,709
Just because.

432
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,879
I want to say goodbye.

433
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:21,179
What do you mean?

434
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,619
Don't worry.

435
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,919
I just want to see him. That's all.

436
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,760
Why do you need to see him though?

437
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,389
Just go and rehearse your scenes.

438
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,669
(Milk)

439
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:51,409
Here, eat.

440
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Aren't you leaving?

441
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,050
My gosh.

442
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,109
Duk Gu.

443
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,080
He had diarrhoea for a few days, so I was a little worried.

444
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:33,219
I'm glad we quickly found someone who wants to adopt him.

445
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,350
Yes, I'm glad too.

446
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,830
Duk Gu, don't worry.

447
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,560
You'll adjust to your new home soon.

448
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,429
Duk Gu.

449
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,000
Hold on.

450
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,240
Come here.

451
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Let's go.

452
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:57,939
Go on in.

453
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,550
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

454
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,879
The dog looks different from the pictures.

455
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,050
He's bigger than I thought, and his coat looks dry and dull.

456
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:10,419
You should take him to the vet first.

457
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
What?

458
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:12,990
I heard he'd been having diarrhoea.

459
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,530
Oh, that's nothing. Fasting for a few days will cure it.

460
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,169
Intestinal inflammation?

461
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,580
Will he be okay after being hospitalized for a week?

462
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,840
Yes.

463
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,480
I should've gone with you.

464
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:34,850
You're busy.

465
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,519
Is all the prep for the play coming along well?

466
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,449
Yes, of course. Everything is going well.

467
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,790
But why won't you tell me what it's about?

468
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,490
Do you want to see me dying to know?

469
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,730
If you're that curious...

470
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,560
(Shadow Play)

471
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,169
I'll tell you right before you pass out from dying to know.

472
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,399
That's now.

473
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,340
I really am dying to know right now.

474
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,368
You can't die.

475
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,209
Oh, no. Then shall I take you to the hospital?

476
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,949
Hae Na. I'm serious right now, okay?

477
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,020
I can't tell you yet.

478
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,719
I was just teasing you. But can't you just tell me?

479
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,520
All right, let's do it.

480
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:17,490
Ready?

481
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,530
Action.

482
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,980
Closer. A little closer.

483
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,740
Quiet down. Hush.

484
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,709
Hey! How much closer do we need to be?

485
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,379
I don't want to do this either.

486
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,819
All right. We're just practicing now.

487
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,020
We'll try that again from the scene where Da Eun pulls the string.

488
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,290
Okay.

489
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,330
(Garam's Night)

490
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,638
Cut. We'll stop there.

491
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,169
Guys. Let's practice the tree scene.

492
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,419
All right. Yul will jump up on the desk.

493
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,760
That was perfect.

494
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,129
What's with him?

495
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,500
Ready, action.

496
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Go.

497
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:42,510
Is it too hard?

498
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,579
- No, I got this. - You're good, right?

499
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,708
Okay, tilt your tail outward. Just a little more.

500
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:50,050
Yes, perfect. That looks perfect.

501
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,279
We're done.

502
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,820
- Yes! - It looks perfect.

503
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,949
- Nice. - Thank you, Ms. Han.

504
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,389
- I'm a little scared. - No, be quiet.

505
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:00,659
Be quiet, Uncle Seo Won.

506
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,198
- We're almost there. - Okay.

507
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:05,129
Turn left.

508
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,030
- Where are you taking me? - Gosh.

509
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,669
- We've arrived. - Okay.

510
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,300
One, two, three!

511
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:13,969
Ta-Da!

512
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,209
Did you make this?

513
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,980
No, I bought it.

514
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,310
But I heated it up in the microwave with my own two hands.

515
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,850
Happy birthday, Uncle Seo Won.

516
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,050
Thanks.

517
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,320
Come on. Sit down.

518
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,889
- You too. - Okay.

519
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,929
- Hey, this looks delicious. - Right?

520
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,389
- Shall we eat? - Yes.

521
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,198
Thanks for this meal.

522
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,530
Eat as much as you want.

523
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:41,128
You heated it up to perfection.

524
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:43,540
Right? I prepared this feast for you.

525
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,909
You were a little kid.

526
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,340
When did you grow up so much?

527
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,510
Stop it.

528
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,280
Hey, remember?

529
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,408
Whenever we were having cake,

530
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:55,350
you ate all the strawberries and chocolate.

531
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,580
I did?

532
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,050
I only got the bread part and the icing.

533
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,990
Come on. What are you talking about?

534
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:02,050
Yul.

535
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,859
You were always glued to your mom.

536
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,389
You used to giggle whenever you heard the word "poop."

537
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,730
Where did that little boy go?

538
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,230
Hey, Uncle.

539
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,629
I'm right here.

540
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,399
He was so adorable.

541
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:18,899
What about now?

542
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:21,770
He was so adorable.

543
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,310
What about now?

544
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,250
Eat up.

545
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,980
Okay.

546
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,119
(Garam's Night Festival)

(A duel with the goblin)

548
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,859
- Abracadabra! - You lost.

549
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,169
Pick one.

550
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,669
You guys are so compatible that you can get married in three months.

551
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,179
Hey, what is this? It's huge.

552
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,409
- I want this. - I'll take three.

553
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,949
I can tell at a glance that you're single.

554
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,689
This talisman will help you pass the CSAT.

555
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,689
Even that guy buys these from me.

556
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,090
Hey, lady ghost!

557
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,030
A talisman? No way!

558
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,030
They've been hopping around like that all day.

559
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,429
- Hey! - You guys, seriously!

560
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,069
The biggest event and the pride of Garam High,

561
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,039
it's Garam's Night Festival. I'm at the festival now.

562
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,270
- Over there. - Hey!

563
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,810
Let's meet the ones at the center of the festival.

564
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,270
- Hey! - What is this?

565
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,379
May I interview you? Please say a few words.

566
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,579
Hello, I'm looking for a bachelor ghost.

567
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,479
Hopefully, he's over 188cm tall...

568
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,080
- and looks like Gong Yoo. - Hey!

569
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,019
No wonder you're a lady ghost. You're too picky.

570
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,618
- You're so annoying. - Cut it out.

571
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,718
"Every moment I spent with you shined."

572
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,560
"Because the weather was good, because the weather was bad,"

573
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,918
"and because the weather was good enough."

574
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,289
That's Gong Yoo's line.

575
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,760
- Peekaboo! - Hey!

576
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:52,260
Yes, this interview is...

577
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,669
- Gosh, they scared me. - Sorry about that.

578
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,169
I have a talisman that can repel ghosts.

579
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,439
Follow me.

580
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,069
- Hey! - Wait up!

581
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,240
(Ghost House)

582
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,909
What shall we do after the festival today?

583
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,178
I should go home early.

584
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,419
I'll be quite tired.

585
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,989
But today is...

586
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,690
It's the day of the festival.

587
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,630
It's a fun, happy day.

588
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,860
Oh, right. My students' play will start at 8pm.

589
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,060
Come and watch it.

590
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,429
I'll see you later.

591
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,239
I told you to hold her hand and go public with it.

592
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,880
Hey, Ji A.

593
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,710
How come your eyes look so sad?

594
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,420
- No. - Hello.

595
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,250
Hi.

596
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,520
I'm not sad.

597
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,960
What's this?

598
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,960
Don't cry, Mr. Jin.

599
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,339
Hey, I'm not sad. Ji A.

600
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,480
Hey, what are you doing there all by yourself? Come on.

601
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,379
- Hey! - Let's go.

602
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,779
Come on.

603
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,250
- Come here. - Oh, no.

604
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,330
(Garam's Night Festival)

605
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,060
- What are you looking at? - Stop.

606
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,299
- Hey. - Stop it.

607
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,339
Holly Molly.

608
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:43,310
Are you here for the item?

609
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,690
By any chance,

610
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,830
is the price negotiable?

611
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,589
You look familiar.

612
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,000
Weren't you trapped in a derelict house somewhere last year,

613
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:09,639
Mr. Vice Principal?

614
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,170
Darn it. How did you know?

615
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,210
(Garam's Get Talent)

616
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,429
- Ms. Cheon! - I love you!

617
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,509
Oh, my!

618
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,710
- Yes! - Yes!

619
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:08,190
The kids' costumes and makeup look so good.

620
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,299
Right? I was so surprised.

621
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,928
(Ghost House)

622
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,770
- Hello. - Hi.

623
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,699
You know,

624
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,239
we've been so busy lately.

625
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,569
When was our last date?

626
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,139
Not sure. I don't even remember.

627
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,480
Then,

628
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,179
tonight...

629
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,250
One moment.

630
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:34,319
My uncle is here.

631
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,520
- Your uncle? - Yes.

632
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,360
He recently broke up with the woman he was seeing, so he's depressed.

633
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,029
That's why I told him to come to the festival.

634
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,900
I'll come with you. I want to meet him.

635
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,529
Do you want to?

636
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,670
- Hi. - Hello.

637
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:55,270
Uncle.

638
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,210
You're here.

639
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,509
Oh, Uncle.

640
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,219
This is my boyfriend.

641
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,549
- This is my uncle. - Hello.

642
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,790
Did you check out the festival?

643
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,560
(I saw her just now.)

644
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,429
Right.

645
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:20,299
You said she also taught at this school.

646
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:22,369
(I just saw her, but I already miss her.)

647
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,170
Gosh, Uncle.

648
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,639
It's okay.

649
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,170
One moment.

650
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,139
Hey, Da Eun.

651
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,080
Okay, I'll be there in a moment.

652
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:39,149
I think my students need my help. What should I do?

653
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,650
Go and help them. I'll be here.

654
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,589
Take good care of him.

655
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:45,219
Uncle, enjoy the festival...

656
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,360
and cheer up.

657
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,960
Don't worry.

658
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,569
You have to come and watch the play at 8pm.

659
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,650
About Mr. Lee.

660
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,389
Where is he now?

661
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,719
No idea.

662
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,520
I really don't know, I swear.

663
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:19,860
Don't look for him.

664
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:23,199
He has completely forgotten about the secular world.

665
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,468
(Holly Molly)

666
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:29,029
They don't make this anymore, right?

667
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,769
That's right.

668
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,369
This is really fun.

669
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:33,839
I know.

670
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,739
It's such an exciting game.

671
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,080
You'll never find...

672
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:42,380
another board game...

673
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:44,049
like this.

674
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,319
Darn, you.

675
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,520
Wait!

676
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,428
(I was able to speak up until recently.)

677
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,690
(But at this school,)

678
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,730
(I met a jerk who looked like a skinny fox.)

679
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,670
(That jerk took my voice away and made me bark like a dog.)

680
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,369
(I feel like I've been shot in the head.)

681
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,909
Vice Principal?

682
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,279
(It's him. That jerk!)

683
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:19,850
(Get him!)

684
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,360
- Hello. - Please wait for your turn.

685
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,919
- Hello. - Hello.

686
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,130
- Wait for your turn to enter. - Hello.

687
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,860
Hello.

688
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:02,988
What's this? A special event of some sort?

689
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,159
No, I'm not sure either.

690
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,420
Why do you keep following me?

691
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,980
(You remember me, right?)

692
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,690
- Hold on. - Who are you?

693
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,389
(Give me back my voice.)

694
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,529
You're the guy...

695
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,600
But why are you still barking?

696
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,830
(What are you talking about?)

697
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:40,929
(It's because of you.)

698
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,569
That's enough.

699
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,679

(Garam's Get Talent)

701
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:15,159
I didn't know my powers were this great.

702
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:16,830
You can undo everything, right?

703
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,639
Of course.

704
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,239
Do I have to show you how powerful I am once again?

705
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Sit down.

706
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,290
Open your eyes.

707
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,750
Open your eyes and look at me.

708
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,960
Relax.

709
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,089
Relax. Okay.

710
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:51,000
Say "A."

711
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,699
Okay?

712
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,068
Open your mouth wide and say "A."

713
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,600
Try it.

714
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,569
(Are you joking?)

715
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:02,139
(Cut the nonsense.)

716
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,309
It's okay. Calm down.

717
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,880
Hey, it's okay.

718
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,509
Your vocal organs are intact.

719
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,980
You just need to do repeated practice. Next,

720
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,380
"B!"

721
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:17,920
For B, you have to put your lips together and go "B!"

722
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:19,589
(Is this a joke?)

723
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:21,129
(You hoaxer.)

724
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,860
It's okay. Next,

725
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:24,929
"C!"

Thank you.

729
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:55,609

00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,258
You thought I was Mr. Lee.

736
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,159
There's so much dust on your table.

737
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,769
It's not good for your health.

738
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,239
I was just worried about your health.

739
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:00,569
I'll take care of my own health.

740
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,170
Chicken feet and soju are the best when you don't have an appetite.

741
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,440
Think of this as our home.

742
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,940
The most peaceful and safest place...

743
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,839
in the world.

744
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:29,489
Ms. Han!

745
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,199
Ms. Han!

746
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:37,639
Wait.

747
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,210
I like you.

748
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Did you resent me...

749
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,469
back then?

750
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,839
What do you mean?

751
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,319
I told you not to come close because I was scared of Cocoa.

752
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,819
It was slightly upsetting.

753
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,520
Should I do something for you?

754
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,119
I feel sorry.

755
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,060
Well, it's all in the past,

756
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,960
and I didn't know about your fear back then.

757
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,529
It's okay.

758
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:22,630
Then what about today?

759
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,369
What should I do for you?

760
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,339
To be honest,

761
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,210
I feel worse today.

762
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,509
Well...

763
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,679
Thank you...

764
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,549
for the gift.

765
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,150
It was the best gift...

766
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,219
I've ever received.

767
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,089
Did you watch it?

768
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,929
How was it?

769
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:55,299
Well...

770
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,670
Right.

771
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,139
I liked that part the most.

772
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,569
Which part?

773
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,179
When I took one step toward you,

774
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:07,610
and you took one step toward me as well.

775
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,380
Uncle,

776
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,319
eat this all by yourself this time.

777
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,350
I'll let you this time.

778
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,860
Happy birthday.

779
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:56,659
The present-like moments passed by,

780
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:00,360
and we lived normal lives as well.

781
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,069
This one looks more elegant. What do you think?

782
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:08,009
Look at it.

783
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:10,439
Come on. Look at it.

784
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,209
Which one is better?

785
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,249
Hey! Look at this.

786
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,908
Which one is better?

787
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,278
You're so pretty. I can't stop looking at you.

788
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:19,219
You must be crazy.

789
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:24,290
I just wanted to try speaking in dog language.

790
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,659
I wanted to experience...

791
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,230
how my dog, Ppomi, felt.

792
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,100
It seems Ppomi needs me more than you do.

793
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,170
As a wonderful pet,

794
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:39,699
I mean,

795
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,239
as a pet owner,

796
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,679
I will treat my dog well.

797
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:49,310
You can keep that bracelet.

798
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,489
Goodbye.

799
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,190
Dong Chul.

800
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,629
Mi Sun, what is love to you?

801
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,258
Even as I fold these,

802
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:07,159
I keep thinking of her.

803
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,269
Her hobby is flamenco.

804
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,838
I feel like I can hear the sound of the flamenco music.

805
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,239
I'm trying to think of...

806
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:15,468
- what I can do as a hobby... - Dong Chul. Fold these.

807
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:18,008
I feel like it'd be nice to share the same hobby.

808
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:19,508
I guess...

809
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,349
I'm just picturing my future...

810
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,448
with her.

811
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:25,579
But I'm not sure if I should contact her or not.

812
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,250
I'm so conflicted right now.

813
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,630
Dong Chul!

814
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,350
I thought you renounced the world.

815
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,219
But you seem to be earthbound.

816
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:06,589
Ttaeng Pal, that punk,

817
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:09,589
just doesn't listen, does he?

818
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,670
I did well on the CSAT.

819
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,799
Did you come all the way over here just to tell me that?

820
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,009
I just wanted to tell you...

821
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,279
that I was doing fine.

822
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,319
I was curious.

823
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,290
I didn't get to see you smile before you went away.

824
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:39,889
I am moving forward.

825
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:45,699
So...

826
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,299
you should do the same.

827
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,219
Let's get some air.

828
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,150
Should we fly that as well?

829
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,819
But you gave me that to fly when I am sick.

830
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,520
I changed my mind.

831
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,190
Do not get sick.

832
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,860
Neither your body nor your heart.

833
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,460
Do not hurt any part of yourself.

834
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,270
I am going to fly that away...

835
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,469
so you will never have to use it.

836
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,139
Okay. Let us do that.

837
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,339
Duk Gu.

838
00:59:36,009 --> 00:59:37,940
So you are Duk Gu.

839
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,739
Hi, Duk Gu. I'm Yu Na.

840
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,150
Paw.

841
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:44,350
Good boy.

842
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,319
What kind of snack do you think he'll like?

843
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,449
- Which one did you like? - What?

844
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,589
Cocoa, which one did you like?

845
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,690
My goodness.

846
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:03,299
Duk Gu, should we play tag?

847
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:39,239
Duk Gu.

848
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,639
Duk Gu, keep going.

849
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,549
(Thank you for watching "A Good Day To Be A Dog.")
