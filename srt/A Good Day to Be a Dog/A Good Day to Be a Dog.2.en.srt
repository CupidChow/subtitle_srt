Catch that scoundrel!

11
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,428
Stop right there!

12
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,329
Move! Out of my way!

13
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,329
- Gosh! - Oh, no.

14
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,940
- Are you all right? - I am fine.

(Episode 2)

19
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,340
Gosh, where did she go?

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,430
Come on. No way.

21
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,600
That can't be it. Please.

22
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,430
How could he be afraid of me? I mean, I'm so tiny.

23
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,949
No, calm down.

24
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,619
I shouldn't attack him like a zombie would.

25
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,889
I should flaunt my cute charms.

26
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,460
I won't hurt or bite you.

27
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,960
I pay my taxes and donate to charity. I'm a good dog.

28
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,630
Is she not here?

29
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,359
She is somewhere around here.

30
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,199
She must've turned into a dog already.

31
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,638
I wonder if she's managed to lift the curse.

32
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,069
- My gosh. - Let's go.

33
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,769
Gosh, this is nuts.

34
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,579
Hey, what are you doing up there?

35
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,479
Bo Gyeom.

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,910
- Mr. Lee? - Hey, are you drunk?

37
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,120
Why did you go up there?

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,319
There's a rat.

39
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,519
What? A rat?

40
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,549
A rat?

41
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,229
My gosh!

42
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,299
Come here.

43
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,630
Hey, where did you come from?

44
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,500
You're so cute.

45
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,999
Where's your home?

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,569
You are my home.

47
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,840
Does this dog belong to the people at this house?

48
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,079
No, I'm all yours.

49
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Jjong!

50
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,888
- My gosh. Where have you been? - Here.

51
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,019
Goodness. Where did your collar go?

52
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,258
Well, I'm not sure what happened,

53
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,130
but it looks like the situation has been sorted out.

54
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,590
Right, Jjong?

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,129
- Let's go. - Okay.

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Bo Gyeom.

57
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:30,999
That huge rat kept jumping down here.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,869
It was coming at me to eat me alive.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,749
A rat? Come on.

60
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,450
Hey, how much did you drink?

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,820
Goodness. You drank so much that you've lost yourself.

62
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:45,949
Which one was the math teacher?

63
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,090
The one who was on that thing.

64
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,389
How do you know?

65
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,859
She was drooling over the one standing.

66
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,929
- He's the Korean history teacher. - I see.

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
By the way, do you have to be handsome to be a teacher these days?

68
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,600
Clearly, that's not the case for veterinarians. Right?

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
You little...

70
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,340
Hold on. Where is Ms. Han?

71
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:04,939
What?

72
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,809
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

73
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,950
Mr. Jin Seo Won is calling.

74
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,559
Hey, don't pick up.

75
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,859
Don't answer it.

76
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:26,729
I should text him.

77
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,199
"Mr. Jin, I'm sorry."

78
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,999
"Something urgent has come up,"

79
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,669
"so I had to leave."

80
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,840
So your first attempt failed miserably.

81
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,479
Don't number them.

82
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,739
There won't be a 2nd or 3rd time.

83
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,780
Next time, I'll be sure to succeed.

84
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,850
It's not something you can control.

85
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,549
But don't you think Mr. Jin is so weird?

86
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,119
Why is he that afraid of such a little dog?

87
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
I guess he has a traumatic memory about dogs.

88
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,830
But I'm super cute.

89
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,629
Seriously, what should I do now?

90
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:09,169
What can you do?

91
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,868
You have to kiss him again to lift the curse.

92
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,009
Right, but how am I supposed to kiss him?

93
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,640
He absolutely hates dogs.

94
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,478
Kiss him when he's asleep.

95
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,350
- But how? - Date him.

96
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,679
Hae Na can't date him just because she needs to.

97
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,618
No, I have Mr. Lee.

98
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:26,918
Last night, Mr. Lee held me like this and said, "You're so cute!"

99
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,159
He held me and caressed like this.

100
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,390
Did you see that?

101
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,189
Right, because you were a dog. He wouldn't treat you like that now.

102
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,169
Don't worry, Uncle.

103
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:41,739
I'll get it all sorted out.

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,999
I highly doubt that.

105
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,238
The situation has gotten even worse.

106
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,438
What do you mean?

107
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,779
You kissed him by mistake.

108
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,849
So you offered to treat him to a meal,

109
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,080
but you left without paying.

110
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,549
- In his perspective, you're... - A dine-and-dasher.

111
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,989
- Yes, you pulled a dine and dash. - Yes, you dined and dashed.

112
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,288
That was on point.

113
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,119
- Only jerks do stuff like that. - Yes, total jerks.

114
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,660
He probably doesn't even want to see her again.

115
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,160
A dine-and-dasher?

116
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,829
- Hey, come here. - Come here!

117
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,168
- Hey! - Come here!

118
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,400
Get back here!

119
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,700
Did she see that?

120
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,309
- Hello. - Hello, good morning.

121
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,679
Good morning.

122
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,749
Won. You haven't forgotten about our date after work today, right?

123
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,820
A date? What are you doing tonight?

124
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,720
He called me last night...

125
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,189
and made me drive him home.

126
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,890
So he's taking me out tonight.

127
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,859
Mr. Jin, did you drink last night?

128
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,729
Yes.

129
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,070
Anyway,

130
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:24,039
what did you and Ms. Han talk about that you drank so much?

131
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,970
You and Ms. Han went out for drinks alone?

132
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:29,609
Why?

133
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,178
We had a situation.

134
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,309
What kind of situation?

135
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,979
Oh, I see.

136
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,690
She must've dragged you out and forced you to drink.

137
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,590
Ms. Han and I are in the same department, so I see her every day.

138
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,729
And I must say, she's quite immature.

139
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,560
It's tiring to be around her.

140
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,159
- Ms. Yoon. - Yes?

141
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:53,499
You're talking behind her back when you don't even know her well.

142
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,470
It doesn't look nice.

143
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,040
Right.

144
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,139
I rarely say stuff like that.

145
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,310
I should go and get ready for my class.

146
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,180
You said Ms. Han suddenly disappeared last night.

147
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,519
Did something happen?

148
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,220
I have to go to the print room.

149
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,590
Okay.

150
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:22,399
(Teacher's Office)

151
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,269
You said something came up. Did you get everything sorted out?

152
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,170
Yes, my sister called me out of the blue.

153
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,109
I'm really sorry.

154
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,639
Did something else happen?

155
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,210
Something else, like what?

156
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,220
It's nothing.

157
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,989
Send me your bank account info.

158
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,519
I said I'd treat you but ended up leaving without paying.

159
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,319
Send the money to Bo Gyeom. He paid for it.

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,489
Oh, right. Why did Mr. Lee suddenly show up?

161
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,259
- You saw him? - No, I did not.

162
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,300
You said he paid.

163
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,409
Oh, you must've called him to set me up with him. Right?

164
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,210
Yes.

165
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,849
Then if you've decided to help me,

166
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,580
how about we meet up regularly so you can give me some pointers?

167
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,079
"Regularly?"

168
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,720
Yes. Will that be too much of a hassle for you?

169
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,019
Yes, it'll be a hassle.

170
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,290
Just think that you're giving alms to build good karma.

171
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,560
Please help me.

172
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,040
Then I'll help you just this once.

173
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:39,869
Really?

174
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:44,409
Bo Gyeom and I are supposed to go somewhere this evening.

175
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:46,680
Do you want to go instead of me?

176
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,879
You won't come with us?

177
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,619
- No, of course not. - Why not?

178
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,989
Why should I tag along?

179
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,389
If it's just the two of us, it'll look too much like a date.

180
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:58,019
I thought you wanted a date with him.

181
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,859
Yes. I do, but...

182
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,858
If it's just the two of us, my heart might race like crazy.

183
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:06,470
What if I have a heart attack and die?

184
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,810
I didn't know you liked him that much.

185
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,639
Well, that was just an example.

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,119
Fine.

187
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,090
I'll tag along, then.

188
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,930
But the rest is up to you.

189
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,899
Thank you.

190
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,079
("The Girl's Dream")

191
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,180
("Z World")

192
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,320
Two guys coming here together?

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,019
- Ms. Han. - Gosh.

194
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,590
- Ms. Yoon. - What are you doing here?

195
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,959
What about you?

196
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,289
Did Mr. Lee call you here?

197
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,529
No, Mr. Jin.

198
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:08,759
I see.

199
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,359
Did Mr. Jin invite you too?

200
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,229
No, Mr. Lee called me here.

201
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,169
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

202
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,868
You're interested in Mr. Lee, aren't you?

203
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:18,970
Sorry?

204
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,940
Come on. It's just us here now. You can tell me.

205
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,710
Well, I...

206
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,350
I'll help you so you can go out with him.

207
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,279
No, it's okay.

208
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,080
Why not? You both look like puppies. You'd make a cute couple.

209
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
Mr. Jin!

210
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,019
We'll have so much fun here.

211
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,859
Have you played this room escape game before?

212
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,189
No.

213
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,399
Ms. Yoon wanted to come here too.

214
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:45,830
Did you invite Ms. Han?

215
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,200
- Yes. - I see.

216
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,239
But you two aren't that close. Am I wrong?

217
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,869
You are wrong. We're very close.

218
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,139
Right?

219
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,810
Yes.

220
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,549
Put this on. Put your hands on each other's shoulders...

221
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,749
and follow me.

222
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,489
Put this on like this?

223
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,659
Walk slowly and follow me.

224
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,699
- Are we going the right way? - Solve the problem...

225
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,228
using the hidden clues...

226
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:22,898
and escape the room within the given amount of time.

227
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:23,999
I'm scared.

228
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,369
What?

229
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,609
Maybe it's something super simple, like 1234.

230
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,609
No, never mind.

231
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,149
Let's have a look around.

232
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,420
There must be some hints.

233
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,649
Shall we look for them?

234
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:46,989
Could this be a clue?

235
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,830
Oh, maybe. Try solving it.

236
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,710
You sure are a match teacher.

237
00:13:58,739 --> 00:13:59,769
Wait.

238
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,710
Look, here. I think there's something here.

239
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,479
My gosh!

240
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,710
But it's too high.

241
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,419
Seo Won, can you lift me up?

242
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,550
I think there's something up here.

243
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:14,989
No, you're heavy.

244
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,689
Hey, don't waste your time solving that math problem.

245
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,459
I think we have to open this thing. Right?

246
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,090
- Yes, totally. - Yes.

247
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,430
Mr. Jin, then can you lift me up?

248
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,100
Well...

249
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,869
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

250
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,710
Oh, there's something.

251
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,810
Gosh, no!

252
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,550
Stop that!

253
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,190
Hold on.

254
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,850
Gosh, get that thing out of my sight!

255
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,119
- No! Go away! - Look, we found it.

256
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,350
You have five minutes left.

257
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,518
We really don't have much time left.

258
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,888
- Hurry up and open it. - Oh, no.

259
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,258
Ms. Han, do you see anything over there?

260
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:26,329
No, nothing. I really have no idea. What should we do?

261
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,029
Oh, no. We're stuck here.

262
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,129
We only have four minutes left.

263
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,639
What do we do?

264
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,440
(Art Room)

265
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,850
What?

266
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:48,919
- He figured it out. - What?

267
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,549
- We can escape. - What?

268
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,789
- We can escape this room. - What happened?

269
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,290
- Mr. Jin. - How did you do that?

270
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,560
Yes, I think I can buy time until midnight.

271
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,358
I'll be sure to lift the curse today.

272
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,429
You just wait, Yu Na. I'll...

273
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,460
Ms. Han.

274
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,470
(Escape Room)

275
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,169
Why did you come out alone?

276
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,540
They went to the restroom.

277
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:10,800
I see.

278
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,209
I'm really sorry about earlier.

279
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,440
It gave me such a scare.

280
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
It's okay.

281
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,809
I want to apologize, so how about some chicken and beer? It's on me.

282
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,879
Are you in?

283
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,379
The three of you can go without me. I should get going.

284
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,920
What? Why?

285
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,889
- I'm a little tired. - I see.

286
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,759
Then come with us and sit next to us for just a few minutes. Okay?

287
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,758
No, I'm off.

288
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,790
Wait!

289
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,759
Just one beer. Please?

290
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,129
To tell you the truth, I don't like to drink.

291
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,300
Drinking often will help you increase your tolerance, you know?

292
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,899
- No, I do not like to drink. - Come on. Drink just a bit.

293
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,710
Just a little bit. Please?

294
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,080
Can you not hear me?

295
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,779
How many times do I have to say no?

296
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:57,049
Well, I just want to get to know you better.

297
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,749
Why, all of a sudden? Because of Bo Gyeom?

298
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,659
Yes. You said you'd help me date him.

299
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,759
That's why I came here.

300
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,869
Right. I understand...

301
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,500
that this was a lot for you.

302
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,169
I happened to hear the other day...

303
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,139
that you were uncomfortable around me.

304
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,980
"For some reason."

305
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,850
Why do you feel uncomfortable around me?

306
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,579
I didn't mean it like that.

307
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,389
What are you, a nutcracker?

308
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,989
And what am I, a walnut?

309
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,020
You keep picking on me and at me...

310
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,530
over and over!

311
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,530
I need to at least know the reason...

312
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,230
to do something about it.

313
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,609
Forget it. I'm off.

314
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,350
Ms. Han, the thing is...

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,030
Bye.

316
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,449
Why did I suddenly lash out at him like that?

317
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,219
I must say, I've been quite clingy.

318
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,990
He probably thinks I'm like a leech.

319
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:56,369
What? How come there are three glasses?

320
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,740
Gosh, Mr. Jin said to me that he was too tired.

321
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,080
Did he suddenly perk up once I left?

322
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,850
Ms. Han, why did you leave?

323
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,378
Come and join us if you change your mind.

324
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,550
(Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom)

325
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,350
It's not about whether or not I want to join you.

326
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,030
Gosh, wait. No!

327
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,189
Wait! One moment.

328
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,000
(Ms. Han Hae Na)

329
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,820
That math teacher is a bit too harsh too.

330
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,218
He didn't have to be that cold.

331
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,789
Even the neighbourhood dogs might be mad...

332
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,990
if they get rejected that many times. Darn it.

333
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,189
Right?

334
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,188
Why does he hate me so much?

335
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,829
I really don't get it.

336
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,859
I had never done anything wrong to get in Mr. Jin's bad graces.

337
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,330
You had never done anything wrong?

338
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,469
Hey, didn't you say...

339
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,810
he was scared of dogs?

340
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,769
You know what?

341
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,239
It might be the curse. Ever since you two were young,

342
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,579
the neighbourhood dogs liked you...

343
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,249
and kept following you around when you hadn't done a thing.

344
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,279
Right.

345
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,618
Why do dogs love us?

346
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,349
- We never did anything nice. - Exactly.

347
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,449
That teacher is terrified of dogs.

348
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,989
But think about it.

349
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,560
All kinds of dogs from the area must circle around her.

350
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,290
Let me give you an example.

351
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,530
Let's say you're terrified of pigeons.

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,830
Now, picture yourself...

353
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,100
with someone who has ten pigeons on his shoulders.

354
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:11,300
Sometimes, one of the pigeons gets on his head and flutters its wings.

355
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,169
They also poop from time to time.

356
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,639
That's crazy.

357
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,480
Come to think of it, that day...

358
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,219
We have mini gimbap and tteokbokki.

359
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,550
Darn it. We didn't buy blood sausages.

360
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,858
What? Where did he go?

361
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,129
That day too.

362
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,070
I heard the mango cake is good,

363
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,740
But that one looks good too.

364
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,139
What should we do?

365
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,810
Right. That time too.

366
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,580
I'll get going.

367
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,520
You're right.

368
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,158
He's so scared of dogs.

369
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,419
But dogs are always around me.

370
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,830
He can't run away from dogs when people are around.

371
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,928
Woo Taek, you're a genius.

372
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,770
It's nothing. Let's eat.

373
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,369
What a genius.

374
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,679
You guys aren't allowed to come near me now.

375
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:38,719
Let's go to a coin karaoke room.

376
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:40,358
- That sounds great! - Right?

377
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,489
Did you find a group for the music assignment?

378
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,600
We have an assignment?

379
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,830
- I told you about that. You dummy. - What?

380
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:47,800
- Hey. - Who is it?

381
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,040
- Someone's smoking a cigarette. - No way.

382
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,439
In their school uniforms? They're so brazen.

383
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:53,540
Let's go.

384
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,079
It's Ms. Han. Ms. Han!

385
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,779
- Ms. Han. - Ms. Han.

386
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,349
Ms. Han. Over there.

387
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,079
Can you scold those guys from Kyungwon High School?

388
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,419
They're smoking in front of our school.

389
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,918
- Is that so? - They do this all the time.

390
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,688
The smell of their cigarettes is driving us crazy.

391
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,059
Okay. I'll talk to them.

392
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,159
Really?

393
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:24,840
- That jerk. - How about the Internet café?

394
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,240
The Internet café?

395
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,310
It's those guys.

396
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,850
You guys.

397
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:42,619
You're students. You shouldn't be smoking in front of our school.

398
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,760
Just keep moving, lady.

399
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,669
I'm a teacher at Garam High School.

400
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,070
So what? You don't teach at our school.

401
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,639
You guys go to Kyungwon High School, right?

402
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,299
Which grade? Which class are you in?

403
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,908
- Put that out now. - I will...

404
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,740
put it out after I smoke one more cigarette, ma'am.

405
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,550
Gosh, you jerk.

406
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,649
Hey.

407
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,780
You're such an idiot.

408
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,419
- What did I do, you jerk? - Did you just smile?

409
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,119
She's about to cry because you keep teasing her.

410
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,389
You shouldn't make women cry.

411
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,530
Don't you agree?

412
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,359
Ma'am.

413
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,530
Are you crying?

414
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,429
Hey, what are your names?

415
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:29,168
Why aren't you wearing your name tags?

416
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,300
Ma'am.

417
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,199
You just touched my chest, right?

418
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:34,609
Isn't this sexual harassment?

419
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,678
Is it allowed for a female teacher...

420
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,139
to touch male students' chest like this?

421
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,708
How dare you?

422
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,879
Should we report her?

423
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:42,350
Awesome.

424
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,219
No.

425
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,090
We should touch hers and call it even.

426
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,520
Ma'am.

427
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,659
Then excuse me.

428
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,469
She asked you what your names were.

429
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,629
Let go of me.

430
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,030
Your name.

431
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,629
Mr. Jin.

432
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,439
Their names are Seo Chang Soo,

433
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:38,840
Min Kyung Seok,

434
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,669
and Do Jae Min.

435
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,219
Get out of my way. Darn it.

436
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,959
Are you all right, Ms. Han?

437
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,398
Yes.

438
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,169
Kids these days aren't scared of teachers.

439
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,199
Okay. Thank you.

440
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,639
- I'll see you at school later. - Okay.

441
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,699
Ms. Han.

442
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:40,698
Is something wrong?

443
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,000
You don't look so good.

444
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:43,969
What is it?

445
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,270
What's wrong?

446
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,139
Hello.

447
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,779
I went to sleep pretty late last night.

448
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,080
I'm feeling a bit tired.

449
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,719
You should've gone to sleep early then.

450
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,929
Why did you suddenly disappear on me last night?

451
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,830
I ate so much chicken talking about the weather because of you.

452
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,429
Sorry.

453
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,899
If you're sorry,

454
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,840
buy me a soufflé cheesecake.

455
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,639
Okay.

456
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,408
I also like...

457
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,679
soufflé cheesecakes very much.

458
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,219
I'll buy you one too.

459
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,889
Don't you like tiramisu?

460
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,419
Ask him now.

461
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,459
No. I'm good.

462
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,399
- Hello. - Hello.

463
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:48,899
- No way. - Hello.

464
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,369
(Knock before entering the teacher's office.)

465
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,689
- Hello. - Hello.

466
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,619
"Peace Under Heaven" is a full-length novel.

467
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,218
But when the novel was serialized back then,

468
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,789
there was a subtitle.

469
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,959
It's in the 3rd paragraph on Page 243.

470
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,629
"'Ho' Will Be the Downfall of the Qin Dynasty."

471
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,330
Turning into a dog every night...

472
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
is too tiring. Seriously.

473
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,629
Mr. Jin.

474
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,199
What are you doing here at this hour?

475
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,300
This is my free period too.

476
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,300
Are you feeling better?

477
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,379
I was a bit startled this morning.

478
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:38,379
But I'm all right now.

479
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,080
That was pathetic, right?

480
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,179
A teacher being scared of students.

481
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,080
No.

482
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,350
That was understandable.

483
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,589
The kids were watching,

484
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,759
but I had to teach.

485
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,589
I didn't even know what else I could do.

486
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,359
If it had been a dream, I would've wet myself...

487
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,100
Anyway...

488
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,939
I'm fine now.

489
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,139
If it had been in my dream,

490
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,040
I would've wet myself too.

491
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,399
Sorry about yesterday.

492
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,230
Sorry I suddenly got mad.

493
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,169
I was sorry too.

494
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,399
Now that I think about it,

495
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,699
it was only natural for you to misunderstand.

496
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,879
Something...

497
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,149
happens to me when I'm with you...

498
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,619
It must seem like I'm avoiding you.

499
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,149
But the thing is...

500
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,219
I actually...

501
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,740
Give him a foot massage.

502
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,909
Block well, or else you'll break a bone.

503
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,659
Mr. Jin.

504
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,230
Sorry.

505
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,628
I don't know what it is,

506
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:42,740
but if it's hard to talk about, you don't have to tell me.

507
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,040
Seeing how hard you're trying to explain things,

508
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,139
I can tell you're not doing it because you don't like me.

509
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,480
Everyone has their own story,

510
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:58,879
and we can all have a secret we keep inside our hearts.

511
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,159
Then, I'll get going now.

512
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,429
Ms. Han.

513
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,840
Thank you for understanding.

514
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,080
You're welcome.

515
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
And...

516
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,250
I'll try harder to be a bridge between you...

517
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,850
and Bo Gyeom.

518
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,919
Okay.

519
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,389
Good luck.

520
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,689
Good luck.

521
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,500
Oh, Mr. Jin. I have a question for you.

522
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,240
The code you figured out in the first room yesterday.

523
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,570
How did you do that?

524
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,648
Another word for king in Korean is "Imgeum."

525
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:01,850
So, I took the first syllable.

526
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,179
The Chinese character for dragon in the 12 zodiac signs is "Jin."

527
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,889
"Reverse a word."

528
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,090
W, A, R.

529
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,619
It's a war.

530
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,490
Then, the clues that are left...

531
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,629
Im, Jin, and war.

532
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,030
Gosh, no way. The Imjin War.

533
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:24,040
By the way, those rooms were made so well they make you want to escape.

534
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:27,909
I don't get why Bo Gyeom wanted to go there with me alone.

535
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,340
It gives me the creeps.

536
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,320
The Jeonggye Monument on Mount Baekdu...

537
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,050
was placed to indicate the border between Joseon and the Qing Empire.

538
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,218
The message engraved in stone states that the Yalu River to the west...

539
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,830
and the Tomun River to the east are the borders.

540
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,388
The Jeonggye Monument on Mount Baekdu could be on the test.

541
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:51,158
Be sure to memorize it. Got it?

542
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,530
- Yes, Mr. Lee. - Yes, Mr. Lee.

543
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:54,929
That's it for today's lesson.

544
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,000
For next class,

545
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,169
we're going to have a fun discussion.

546
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:02,039
The topic will be,

547
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,908
"If you could go back in history..."

548
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,740
"to reverse something that happened,"

549
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,679
"when and where would you go?"

550
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,280
Got it?

551
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,988
Mr. Lee, will we be graded on this too?

552
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,520
I will be sure to grade you, punk.

553
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,119
Gosh, I'm in trouble. What do I do?

554
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,960
Mr. Lee, what about you?

555
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:21,630
When and where do you want to go?

556
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:23,659
For me,

557
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,630
I'll go back to 1592.

558
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,199
Why?

559
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,540
An inescapable and unchangeable misfortune started then.

560
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,210
(Year 1592)

561
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,580
- Get them! - Get them!

562
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,710
Chase them down!

563
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:36,199
Oh, gosh.

564
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:37,869
Let's eat.

565
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,610
There we go.

566
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,080
What should I do with you?

567
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,040
So, did you set a time to meet?

568
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,150
I haven't yet. But I should.

569
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,409
What about the dog thing?

570
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,319
Did you talk about it?

571
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,089
The thing is,

572
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,360
it seemed like he wanted to keep his fear of dogs a secret.

573
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,389
Why?

574
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,799
I saw Mr. Jin smile today.

575
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,670
That was the first time...

576
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,739
I saw him smile.

577
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,040
Why would that even matter?

578
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,380
Hey.

579
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,750
Just get to know him quickly and lift the curse.

580
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,080
Okay?

581
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,929
Hello?

582
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,600
Hey. Why is it so hard to reach you?

583
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,739
Everyone has their own story,

584
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:29,080
and we can all have a secret we keep inside our hearts.

585
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:45,600
We're out of ramyeon.

586
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,298
Uncle!

587
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,069
I'm going to the convenience store. Do you want anything?

588
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:55,770
What? Where did he go?

589
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,239
I'll be expelled if I get caught smoking once more.

590
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,350
Just get expelled, then, you idiot.

591
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,179
Darn it.

592
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:04,949
Hey, find out about that guy.

593
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,549
Let's gather the guys and trample on him.

594
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,420
Shall I find some dirt on a Garam High kid?

595
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,460
Don't just talk about it and do it.

596
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,389
You frustrating punk.

597
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,069
It's just full of selfies.

598
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,440
Hey, she's pretty.

599
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,869
What? Is it this?

600
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,679
It's this punk, right?

601
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,150
Doesn't he kind of look like me?

602
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,250
- Hello. - Welcome.

603
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,029
What was that?

604
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:53,670
Hi, buddy.

605
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:55,600
Can you come over here for a second?

606
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,500
Please call the police for me.

607
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,219
Yes. Hello?

608
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,589
Is this Ms. Han Hae Na, a teacher at Garam High School?

609
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,389
Yes. What is this about?

610
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:24,699
This is Hyunseo Patrol Division.

611
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:27,630
Yes, I see.

612
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,639
You are the homeroom teacher for Choi Yul, correct?

613
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,270
The patrol division?

614
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,210
(Hyunseo Patrol Division)

615
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,480
Gosh, what'll we do?

616
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:47,020
My goodness.

617
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:52,319
I told you to call your parents!

618
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,330
Why won't you answer?

619
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,428
You should answer when an adult speaks to you.

620
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,259
Don't you have any parents? Are you an orphan?

621
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,529
Ma'am.

622
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,369
Please calm down.

623
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,939
From what I hear,

624
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,069
it was your son and his friends who started picking on him first.

625
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,170
He should apologize.

626
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,179
I didn't hit him. I only dodged out of the way.

627
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,980
He just tripped over his own foot and fell down.

628
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:15,150
Don't lie to me.

629
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,149
My baby.

630
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,679
What'll we do about my baby's face?

631
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,389
"Baby?"

632
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,860
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

633
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,388
Mom, give it a rest.

634
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,589
You stay out of this.

635
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:30,299
Hey.

636
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,299
Where are your parents?

637
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,600
Where are they?

638
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:34,969
I don't have any.

639
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,400
See?

640
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:41,469
This is why you can tell when kids don't have proper family education.

641
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,278
You go around beating people up...

642
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,839
since you haven't learned anything at home.

643
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,449
Excuse me.

644
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,678
You speak too harshly.

645
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,719
Ms. Han.

646
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,119
It looks to me that you're a young female teacher...

647
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,588
who can't even control her own students.

648
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:02,059
You should educate them better.

649
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,730
Don't cause other people's kids any harm.

650
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,359
I guess so.

651
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,798
I must've seemed like an easy target as a young, female teacher.

652
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,040
I was threatened by this student this morning.

653
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,338
This is a serious criminal offence,

654
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,909
and I can press charges, right, officer?

655
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:17,310
Yes, that's right.

656
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,209
This morning, your son...

657
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,778
was smoking and got caught by me.

658
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,179
That must be why he took it out on my student.

659
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,779
If you feel so wronged,

660
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,920
should we convene...

661
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,619
a school violence committee to handle this?

662
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,089
What? A school violence committee?

663
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,560
Do you have any proof? Do you?

664
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:41,400
Excuse me for a moment.

665
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:49,770
He still has the pack he was smoking this morning.

666
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:53,649
Kids can do stuff like that.

667
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,909
No, they can't.

668
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,980
It's a teacher's job to teach kids that.

669
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:00,520
And a parent's job too.

670
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:08,690
You little punk.

671
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:10,600
Why are you hitting me?

672
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,060
- Thank you. - Thank you.

673
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,170
You didn't get hurt, did you?

674
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:22,170
I'm fine.

675
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,779
I'm sorry. Because of me...

676
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,210
No.

677
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,549
I feel sorry about you getting involved this morning.

678
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:34,549
But why didn't you call your parents?

679
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,089
Did you think you'd get in trouble?

680
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,560
Well, I really couldn't.

681
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,290
They live in Australia.

682
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,758
Why didn't you tell me that?

683
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:45,600
You should've mentioned it during individual counselling.

684
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,029
Well...

685
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,400
Then do you live alone?

686
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:51,969
No.

687
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,369
I live with a relative.

688
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,040
And why didn't you call that person?

689
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,210
Things might get out of hand.

690
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,350
He'll worry so much even though it's no big deal.

691
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,850
Still, you should tell him.

692
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,750
Next time.

693
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:09,489
How will you get home? I'll go with you.

694
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,860
I think the buses have stopped running.

695
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,559
Gosh. Hey.

696
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,069
When did it get so late?

697
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,738
Yul, I'm really sorry,

698
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,000
but you can get home by yourself, right? I forgot something at home.

699
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:28,239
I'll get going. Bye.

700
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:31,339
Ms. Han!

701
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,008
Don't follow me.

702
00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:37,679
Okay? Don't.

703
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,920
Bye.

704
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,360
Pick up now.

705
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:49,888
Hello? Woo Taek, I'm in big trouble right now.

706
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:51,060
Ms. Han, what's going on?

707
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,069
I'm sorry.

708
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,239
Your phone. What do we do?

709
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:58,999
I'll get it out for you quickly.

710
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,169
No, it's okay.

711
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,908
I dropped it on purpose. I meant to throw it away.

712
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,709
You were talking on the phone until just now.

713
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,738
I'll get it out for you in no time.

714
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:05,979
It's really fine.

715
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,778
I never liked this phone to begin with.

716
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,008
I was going to buy a new one.

717
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,218
Gosh, I feel so relieved.

718
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,118
Still, if you throw this out here...

719
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,650
No, it's fine.

720
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,589
You should get home soon.

721
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,719
Bye.

722
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:20,789
It looks like a perfectly fine phone.

723
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:21,889
Bye!

724
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,389
See you tomorrow!

725
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,569
Why won't she say anything?

726
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,698
You can't resist

727
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:32,099
Your sister is totally drunk.

728
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,468
- Come and get her! - I am right here

729
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,909
Why are you doing this?

730
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,339
Gosh, midnight... Why are you so heavy?

731
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,210
- Got to go, got to go - Then go home already.

732
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,350
Gosh, no. We're friends.

733
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,489
Why are you still here?

734
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:54,789
Ms. Han, your phone.

735
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,259
Hey, what time is it?

736
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,130
It's midnight.

737
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,360
A dog...

738
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,029
I told her to come and get her sister. Why did she hang up?

739
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:39,670
Oh, it's past midnight.

740
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,710
I don't want to kiss

741
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,810
But my lips keep pouting

742
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,080
Did you eat garlic scapes?

743
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,319
Yul. Wake up.

744
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:00,960
Come to your senses.

745
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,759
Are you awake?

746
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,600
Let's run away for now.

747
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:12,440
That's a dog.

748
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,210
Ms. Han...

749
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:16,110
is a dog?

750
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:19,880
Wait.

751
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,080
Ms. Han. Wait.

752
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:27,790
Ms. Han. Wait.

753
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:31,360
Got you!

754
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:32,989
These darn short legs.

755
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:42,969
You really are a puppy.

756
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,299
This is a puppy.

757
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,710
How can a person change into a dog?

758
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,880
No, I must've seen the wrong thing.

759
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,719
Yes, you saw the wrong thing.

760
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,719
That's not true.

761
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,420
I'm sure she changed right before my eyes.

762
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,929
Does that mean this puppy is really Ms. Han?

763
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,500
Is that you, Ms. Han?

764
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,600
No, I'm not.

765
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:18,069
No. This makes no sense.

766
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,369
This is just a puppy.

767
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,039
It's not Ms. Han.

768
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,109
Right. I'm a puppy. Bark!

769
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,009
So, please. Just let me go.

770
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,420
What do I do?

771
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:40,219
Should I go to the police station first?

772
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,230
No, they'll think I'm crazy.

773
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,259
Should I report it to 911?

774
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:48,100
The hospital?

775
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:50,900
A research lab?

776
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,639
Ms. Han.

777
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:00,350
What am I supposed to do?

778
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,080
Please say something.

779
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,420
You can just let me go.

780
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:18,000
Your dog is very well-behaved.

781
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:21,630
Yes.

782
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,009
Your dog is opening the window.

783
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,310
Ms. Han. Hang on for just a bit.

784
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,810
Ms. Han. Wait for a little while.

785
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,290
How do I get out of here?

786
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,239
Still, she's a guest in our house.

787
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,299
I should at least serve some tea...

788
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:36,770
Do dogs drink tea too?

789
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,489
Aren't you going to drink it?

790
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,429
I don't want to.

791
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,100
Do you live by yourself, Ms. Han?

792
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:10,639
I think your family will be worried.

793
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,040
Do you want me to contact them?

794
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
I brought all your stuff.

795
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,589
Your clothes, your bag,

796
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,989
and your phone.

797
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,960
(Draw your unlock pattern)

798
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,630
It's locked.

799
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,210
(Draw your unlock pattern)

800
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,449
It's unlocked.

801
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:56,819
Ms. Han.

802
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,389
It's really you.

803
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:04,960
Ms. Han.

804
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
How did you become a dog?

805
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,839
What if you can't ever return to your normal self?

806
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,009
Say something, please?

807
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:24,779
Ms. Han!

808
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,949
My gosh.

809
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,600
(Hae Na)

810
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
Hello?

811
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:51,810
Why is a man picking up?

812
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:53,810
Ms. Han.

813
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:00,380
Did she fall asleep?

814
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:23,839
How cute.

815
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,040
I can't believe there's a dog on my bed.

816
00:52:28,509 --> 00:52:29,909
Right. A picture.

817
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,460
No, this is Ms. Han.

818
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,860
It's illegal to take a picture of her without her permission.

819
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:49,400
Still, just one...

820
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,509
The puppy is so cute,

821
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,210
but she's Ms. Han.

822
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,020
She must be tired.

823
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,368
I'll act like I'm sleeping...

824
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,069
then get out of here once he falls asleep.

825
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:58,040
What? Is he sleeping?

826
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,489
Goodness.

827
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,170
What do I do?

828
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,679
I see. Okay. Nice.

829
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:39,799
My biggest strength...

830
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,610
is that I give up easily.

831
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:05,499
First, I'll wait until it's 6am.

832
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,429
Then when I turn back into my human form, I'll leave.

833
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:13,799
I can't fall asleep, no matter what.

834
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,440
I can't fall...

835
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,650
Who is that?

836
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,560
Ms. Han?

837
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,130
Is this a dream?

838
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:02,310
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

839
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:03,568
You got caught...

840
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:05,210
by a student in your class?

841
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,750
On top of that, he's Mr. Jin's nephew.

842
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,549
Why is there a dog?

843
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:13,250
Mandeuk? Please be understanding of his presence for just a day.

844
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,719
What? Mandeuk went home?

845
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:18,259
Ms. Han, are you free tonight?

846
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:20,920
Didn't you say you weren't finished grading the assessments?

847
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,460
Did you wait long?

848
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:24,460
Thank you for today.

849
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:26,960
I know you helped me in various ways.

850
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,400
What's going on between them?

851
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,199
About how there's nothing between us?

852
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:31,799
No feelings whatsoever?
