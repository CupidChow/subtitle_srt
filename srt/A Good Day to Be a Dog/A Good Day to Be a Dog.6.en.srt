It's Ms. Han. Ms. Han!

11
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,388
Did she not see me?

12
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,458
- Hey. Maybe, it's because of you. - Me?

13
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,160
I think something is going on between you two.

14
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,528
- Do you need a hand with that? - No.

15
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:00,458
You should go and help Ms. Yoon instead.

16
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,560
You know, your ideal type.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,699
Ji Won, you should grow taller.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,700
What are you guys doing right now?

19
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,199
Actually, we were practicing our acting.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,538
You're getting ahead of yourself when you're not even sure.

21
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:11,208
Why are you getting involved with her students?

22
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,308
The bully won't repent,

23
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,909
and the victim will keep feeling anxious.

24
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,109
Then what about her emotional scars?

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,279
Ji Won plucked up her courage to tell us,

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,979
but it's not going as well as we thought.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,409
When I see Ji Won,

28
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,849
I'm reminded of myself when I was young.

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,588
When you want to cry, it's okay to cry a little.

30
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:26,648
Hey, Yu Na.

31
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,259
The operation will begin in five minutes.

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,619
This contains the original video of the bullying incident.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,558
Please kindly check.

34
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,299
Regardless of the anti-bullying committee's decision,

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,428
I hope you can reflect on what you did.

36
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,969
Just because you turn into a dog, it doesn't mean you're a hero.

37
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,568
I'm meeting Jin Seo Won tonight.

38
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,139
Just make sure you guys record everything.

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,568
If I play the video and say in tears that he sexually harassed me,

40
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:48,178
it'll be the end of Jin Seo Won.

41
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:49,909
I know kids these days are manipulative,

42
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,808
but your threats were on another level.

43
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:53,550
But you know what? I beat students like you.

44
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,279
How does it feel?

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,350
To go from an assailant to a victim.

46
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,719
The school trip is next week?

47
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,889
Hey, Yul. I am pressed for time.

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,329
You want to bring Cocoa to our house?

49
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,659
Yes, just during night.

50
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,758
The plan is simple.

51
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,359
Wake Math up at 3am.

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,999
While he's half-asleep, she'll kiss him.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,499
If the plan fails, you will return her to us at 5am.

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,039
Darn it. I can't believe this.

55
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,319
Hey, Yul.

56
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,229
Where are you going so early in the morning?

57
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,229
Get me some ice cream on your way home.

58
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,739
Hey, by the way...

59
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,169
You look like you shrank overnight.

60
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,609
Drink more milk so you can grow taller.

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,590
(Episode 6)

62
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,289
Ms. Han.

63
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,560
Where did she go?

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
What?

65
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,069
Didn't you step out just now?

66
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:28,809
Well... Uncle Seo Won,

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,079
have you seen Cocoa by any chance?

68
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,949
She's probably in your room.

69
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,190
Oh, that's right. Jun Seo came by earlier and took her.

70
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,090
Wait.

71
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,259
Weren't you wearing something else earlier?

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,960
What do you mean?

73
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,460
Ms. Han, are you free for lunch today?

74
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,928
With the thing involving Ji Won...

75
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,799
and helping me overcome my fear of dogs too,

76
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,470
you've helped me a lot.

77
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,070
I feel like this is too little compared to what you've done for me.

78
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,910
No, it's delicious.

79
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,309
Mr. Jin, by the way...

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,419
What time do you normally go to bed?

81
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,789
At around 11pm?

82
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,819
But when I have to prepare materials for my class,

83
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,959
I stay up late.

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,989
No!

85
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,169
I mean, you shouldn't do that.

86
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,340
You should go to bed early.

87
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,509
You need to take care of your health.

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,609
You should also ventilate your room often too.

89
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,410
You don't keep your room door locked, do you?

90
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,179
No.

91
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,249
Oh, I do lock it before I go to bed these days because of Cocoa.

92
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
What?

93
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,520
- Why? - Just in case.

94
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:27,129
It's not like a dog knows how to open doors.

95
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,059
I don't think you need to lock your door.

96
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:32,100
Right?

97
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,808
Cocoa helped you out big time, you know.

98
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,770
Do you have no intentions of becoming friendly with Cocoa?

99
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,879
You probably don't want to do that.

100
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,220
I have to say, she's pretty cute.

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,850
You saw her?

102
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,928
Yul's door was left ajar at night,

103
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,160
so I peeked in while going to the bathroom.

104
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:01,729
And...

105
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,499
you thought she was cute?

106
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,938
I see, Cocoa is cute.

107
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,438
I've never seen Cocoa,

108
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,780
so I don't know whether or not she's cute.

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,450
I see. She's cute.

110
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,899
Hey, who is she?

111
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,599
You know, her name is Min Ji A. The transfer student.

112
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Yes, Ji A.

113
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,199
She's a returning student who's three years older than us.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,498
She became a shaman just a month ago.

115
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,200
I hear she is right on the nose about things.

116
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,140
What should I ask her about?

117
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,069
- What did she say? - I got a reading.

118
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,608
- Is she really good? - She's amazing.

119
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,809
Hurry up and get in line.

120
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,330
That thing.

121
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,629
You got a transplant when you were little.

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,498
Hey, for real?

123
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:49,699
Why? What is she talking about?

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,739
- Her heart? - Her heart?

125
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,369
The owner of it is the reason you stopped studying.

126
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,679
All the things she wants to do and enjoy...

127
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,109
and all the places where she wants to go.

128
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,780
There are many things she wants to do.

129
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,450
Is she with me now?

130
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,989
She's not a bad kid.

131
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,330
Just do whatever you want to do...

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,429
so she can enjoy life a little before she leaves you.

133
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:19,869
Well...

134
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,270
When will she leave me?

135
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,499
In about ten years.

136
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,340
After that, you'll start studying again.

137
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,109
- Hey, I'm scared. - She's really good.

138
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,420
Could you please let her know that I'm grateful to her for the heart?

139
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,090
She already knows.

140
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,220
Oh, how much do I owe you for this reading?

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,619
Nothing.

142
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,888
The spirit told me not to get greedy for money...

143
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,560
because I'm still a student.

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,729
Well...

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,238
Then please accept this at least.

146
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,340
(Choco Pie)

147
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,839
- Oh, my. - I got goosebumps.

148
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,509
- Hey, I want a reading too. - See you later.

149
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,180
- Did you hear that? - She's really good.

150
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,920
Are these all yours?

151
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,060
Can I have one?

152
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:18,889
This one too.

153
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,259
Thanks.

154
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:26,330
You'll be summoned to someplace soon.

155
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,700
Where?

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,070
A place where you'll feel uncomfortable.

157
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,638
I see you sitting on your knees.

158
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,810
I see. Really?

159
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,580
Be careful.

160
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
It's not real. Getting too involved will only lead you to trouble.

161
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,720
You keep being entangled with a dog that has a story.

162
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,050
What?

163
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
- Hey. - What?

164
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:50,559
Have you had a reading with the transfer student?

165
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,589
- No. - She's really good.

166
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,959
She really is psychic. She's so accurate.

167
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,059
Everyone keeps cutting in front of me, so I haven't done it yet.

168
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,599
Hey, hurry up and get it done.

169
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,128
- You won't regret waiting in line. - Is she that good?

170
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,470
- She's amazing. - Let's go now.

171
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,499
Did you see Ms. Cheon's footwork?

172
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,509
- Hi, Jun Seo. - Hello, Mr. Jin.

173
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,279
Cocoa snores a lot when sleeping.

174
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,979
Is it okay?

175
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,710
Cocoa snores?

176
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,979
You didn't know?

177
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,920
No.

178
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,619
Have a nice day.

179
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,029
Bye.

180
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,300
Hey, who is Cocoa?

181
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,128
Jun Seo's dog.

182
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,869
The dog that helped me with its collar camera.

183
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,869
Oh, I see.

184
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,869
How do you know that his dog snores?

185
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,269
There's a bit of a situation,

186
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,080
so the dog sleeps at my place at night.

187
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,739
Really?

188
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,489
Hey.

189
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,720
Do you not hear a thing once you fall asleep?

190
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:00,430
That's exactly what I wanted to ask you, Ms. Han.

191
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:09,869
The school trip begins tomorrow, Yul.

192
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,040
Tonight is my last chance.

193
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,700
Wake up. Hey, wake up!

194
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,220
Fine. I shall take the bull by the horns.

195
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,259
What should I do?

196
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,259
Would he still be afraid of me?

197
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,369
No way. He had that training, so he should be...

198
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,470
Well, never mind.

199
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,840
Then...

200
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,340
Shall I try flaunting my cute charms?

201
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,550
Well, it doesn't look like it's working.

202
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Then how about this?

203
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,290
This is my specialty.

204
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:58,979
That didn't work either.

205
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,289
Cocoa helped you out big time, you know.

206
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,190
Do you have no intentions of becoming friendly with Cocoa?

207
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,300
You probably don't want to do that.

208
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Yes.

209
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,850
Come closer.

210
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,310
A little closer.

211
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,149
Pluck up your courage.

212
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,290
I won't bite you. I'm cute.

213
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,119
Closer.

214
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:46,629
Just a little closer.

215
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,330
What?

216
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,340
Hello.

217
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,440
Hey, Bo Gyeom. Are you really going to sleep at my place tonight?

218
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,680
Yes, we have to meet with the others early in the morning.

219
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,350
What? Mr. Lee is here?

220
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,080
What? What will happen now? What should I do?

221
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,259
Gosh, seriously.

222
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,100
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

223
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,609
Are you stealing the dog?

224
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,310
No, this is my dog.

225
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,749
Oh, my bad.

226
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,850
Then you must be Jun Seo's sister.

227
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,690
Oh, yes.

228
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,889
Gosh, you came so early.

229
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,820
Why don't you come in for a cup of tea?

230
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,489
No, that's okay. I go to work early,

231
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,129
so I have to rush home to drop off Cocoa and go to work.

232
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,729
All right, then. Take care.

233
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,899
All the things you have to do for your dog.

234
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,739
I know. She's my family.

235
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:39,909
Right.

236
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,239
Be careful...

237
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,080
not to lose her.

238
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:48,519
Sorry?

239
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,649
There are many dogs in the world, but there's only one Cocoa.

240
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,220
That's why some people do all sorts of things...

241
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,290
to find their lost dogs.

242
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,830
Make sure the time you have left with her is meaningful.

243
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,139
Pardon me?

244
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,070
No dog can outlive a person.

245
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,159
Hey.

246
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,669
You said you'd just go in and get Hae Na. What took you so long?

247
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,169
- Someone was there. - Gosh, hurry up and get in the car.

248
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,800
- I think we've been busted. - Get in the car.

249
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Gosh.

250
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,108
- I'm getting a bad feeling. - Me too.

251
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,639
He struck up a conversation with me at this early hour.

252
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,920
You have to stay on your toes.

253
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,389
Don't get caught by anyone.

254
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,330
You know, about History...

255
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
What?

256
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
It's nothing.

257
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,869
Have a good trip, and be careful.

258
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,740
Have your blanket ready in advance at night.

261

- Hey. - Come on.

- Let's go. - Come on.

Hey, wait up!

267
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,059
- Mr. Lee! - Mr. Lee, when did you arrive?

268
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,428
- We thought you weren't coming. - We thought you couldn't make it!

269
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,958
- Come on. Let's go inside. - We should hurry.

270
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,398
We'll unpack and meet here again in an hour.

271
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,669
- Okay. - Okay.

272
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,809
Hey, stop!

- Hey, where is it? Is it here? - Yes, right there.

275
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,439
Okay, it's this room here.

276
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,949
Oh, are you our roommate too?

277
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,378
Get up.

278
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,590
I'm happy she's our roommate.

279
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,118

280

What do you mean?

281
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,929
Ms. Han! Why are you standing there?

282
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,830
Oh, you go upstairs first. I'll tidy up.

283
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,139
Excuse me.

284
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:02,309
Do you have a vacant room?

285

No, we don't.

287
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,320
Even a storage room would do.

288
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:10,918
Sorry?

289
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,149
A storage room. I said even a storage room would do.

Ms. Han.

291
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,378
You brought all this?

292
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:40,149
I sure did. I've always wanted to buy stuff like this.

293
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
And...

294
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,219
Ta-da! I brought this too.

295
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
You don't hear anything, right?

296
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:56,129
This is called a dog whistle. Only dogs can hear the sound.

297
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,459
Isn't it so cool?

298
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,169
Can you really not hear it?

299
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,209
No, I can't.

300
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:16,020
That's... Don't bother putting it there.

301
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,520
Why not?

302
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,889
Are you just going to pee on the street then?

303
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,260
Oh, is it okay to do it as a dog?

304
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,590
Anyway, thanks.

305
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,629
Come on. This is nothing.

306
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,730
I couldn't help you break the curse because I ended up falling asleep.

00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,739
- For you. - Hey, girls.

365
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,169
This place looks fun.

366
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,908
A night market?

367
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,009
(It's the perfect weather to check out this night market.)

368
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,108
Shall we go out later?

369
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,510
We can sneak out for a bit in the evening.

370
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,280
- What if we get caught? - We'll get some penalty points.

371
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,080
Isn't this place too far though?

372
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,879
It'll take an hour to get there.

373
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,850
Let's go. Please, let's go.

374
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:36,990
How do we get there?

375
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,490
Isn't this such a nice photo?

376
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,429
The lighting was nice.

377
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,330
Didn't you bring your camera?

378
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,359
(Garam High School, Grade 11 - Class 3 and 4)

379
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,600
Watch out.

380
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,070
- Okay. - Okay.

381
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,540
Uncle Seo Won.

382
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,050
Uncle Seo Won, can you give me some pocket money?

383
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:10,359
- Spend it mindfully. - Nice!

384
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,189
I will spend it mindfully.

385
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,359
- Is that Cocoa? - What?

386
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,500
Oh, this...

387
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,168
Don't tell me you brought Cocoa here.

388
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:21,199
What?

389
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:24,600
Was it yesterday? I saw a dog that looked like Cocoa.

390
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,139
Jun Seo, wait up!

391
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:32,879
Is that everyone?

392
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,449
This is nice.

393
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:10,949
- Wake up. - What? Why?

394
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Are we going someplace else?

395
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:15,250
Why do you keep dozing off all day like a sick baby chick?

396
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,959
What would you even know...

397
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,599
when you slept comfortably in your comfy bed?

398
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,658
What?

399
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,399
You're talking as if you slept on the street or something.

400
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:32,540
Let's go for a boat ride. We came all the way here anyway.

401
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,709
A boat ride?

402
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:36,340
That sounds nice.

403
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,609
Shall we?

404
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,948
Come this way. Each person can take one.

405
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,050
- Isn't the water deep? - No, not at all.

406
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,889
One moment. Oh, boy.

407
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,859
Can you put that in the middle here?

408
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Yes, that's it.

409
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,000
You're going with me.

410
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,070
But...

411
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,369
- Then I'll take this one. - Sure.

412
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,139
Enjoy your boat ride.

413
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,070
Oh, thank you.

414
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,709
It's okay. I got it.

415
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,530
This time, things may work out between those two.

416
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:34,368
I noticed that Ms. Han wouldn't even look at Mr. Lee these days,

417
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,730
so I assumed she had given up on him,

418
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:37,699
but I guess I was wrong.

419
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,139
I think she changed her night watch time so they could be partners.

420
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,649
You changed your night watch shifts, didn't you?

421
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,959
I can't wake up after midnight once I fall asleep.

422
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,490
Come on. Didn't you switch because you wanted to do it with me?

423
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:02,959
Gosh, no.

424
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,469
By the way, I called you last night.

425
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,369
Why?

426
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,939
One of the students had a bad stomachache.

427
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,409
You have the first-aid kit.

428
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,708
I'm sorry. Is the student okay now?

429
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:23,320
Yes. He's fine. I got the medicine from another teacher.

430
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,879
By the way,

431
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,790
I guess you can't wake up easily once you fall asleep.

432
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,820
What if someone kidnaps you and you don't even feel it?

433
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,230
You need to be careful in this big, scary world.

434
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,990
No, there's a pine caterpillar!

435
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:05,990
Ms. Han, you might fall into the water!

436
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,289
This is it.

437
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,759
It's okay. It's just a small bug. You're fine.

438
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,770
It's humongous! It has like 500 legs!

439
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,469
You're okay.

440
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,070
- Hey, look at them! - No!

441
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,300
You're okay.

442
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,839
- Ms. Han, it's okay. - Look!

443
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,408
- They're holding hands! - Quiet down!

444
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:26,709
- "I'm so scared!" - Come on.

445
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:29,379
- Look at them holding hands! - Look!

446
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,790
What are you doing?

447
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,418
You're okay.

448
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:39,830
- Come on, let go of her hand! - What's going on?

449
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,069
(Seoju Resort)

450
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,929
You want to switch the night watch duty for tomorrow again?

451
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:52,469
No way. I already switched with you for tonight.

452
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,280
I really can't stand the night watch that late at night.

453
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,080
You have to stand watch with the department head tomorrow.

454
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:06,550
I don't want to do it either.

455
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,189
I'll make all the questions for the final exam.

456
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,490
I'll also edit them myself.

457
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,060
It's still a no.

458
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,689
Standing watch with him alone at night?

459
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,300
Gosh. No way.

460
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,159
Gosh, come on.

461
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,240
Is there a major reason Ms. Han can't stand watch at night?

462
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,980
Or is it because she wants to stand watch with me again?

463
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:31,909
That must be it, right?

464
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,109
- Look. There's a cat. - What? A cat?

465
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:37,949
I don't see any cats.

466
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:41,919
What? What happened to my straw?

467
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,060
I don't have a straw.

468
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,389
Hey, I must have dropped it somewhere.

469
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,290
Darn it.

470
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,369
Go to sleep early, everyone.

471
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
You cannot leave the resort without permission.

472
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,240
Got it?

473
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:07,949
It's a swallow.

474
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,350
A welcome guest...

475
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,549
or a reunion.

476
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,690
Hello.

477
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,758
- Yi Young. - Yes.

478
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,129
- Hee Jin. - Yes.

479
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,329
- Hyun Young. - Yes.

The deer is looking away.

482
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:32,400
They have met, but they haven't recognized each other?

483
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,179
Hello.

484
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:43,949
All four of you are here, right?

485
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,350
Song Da Eun, Chu So Hyun, Kwon Ri Ae.

486
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,389
What? They're already sleeping?

487
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,460
Ms. Han.

488
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,830
Did you have a dog when you were young?

489
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,270
What?

490
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,639
I see a puppy from you.

491
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:09,409
You must be tired. You should get some sleep.

492
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,480
Sleep tight.

493
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:30,429
Hey.

494
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,460
Hey, how come the girls aren't here?

495
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,969
That's what I saw after I was done with my shower.

496
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,670
Where did they go?

497
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,670
Yes!

498
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,609
- This is so fun. - Hey, you try this.

499
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,739
- I'll show it to you. - Try it.

500
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,809
Hey. It looks like we got caught already.

501
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,110
- I'll decline the call. - Decline it.

502
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,920
I did it.

503
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,250
The person you reached is unavailable.

504
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,989
- Please call another time. - These brats.

505
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,658
Hey, Ms. Cheon. I'm sorry.

506
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,758
Can you stand the night watch in my place?

507
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,698
Some of my students left the resort without permission.

508
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,000
- I owe you one. - Ms. Han.

509
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,670
Are you going somewhere?

510
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,310
(I want to walk this path, Hwangnidan-gil, with you.)

512
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,779
It's bigger than I thought.

513
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,219
Should we split up?

514
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,909
I'll take Set A.

515
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,020
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,029
I'm sorry.

517
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,969
Ms. Han.

518
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,869
You couldn't find them, right?

519
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,239
I couldn't.

520
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,838
This is bad. It'll be midnight soon.

521
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:25,940
What?

522
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,679
I'll go that way and look for them.

523
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,919
I think it's better to look for them together.

524
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,949
What? I...

525
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,259
To find them faster, we must split up.

526
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:41,159
If the girls see us and split up to run away,

527
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,359
one person won't be able to find them all.

528
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,830
They won't run away from us. We're not cops.

529
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,869
To students, we are like cops.

530
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,369
Then let's go that way.

531
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,670
Wait up.

532
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,210
Are you unwell?

533
00:37:58,909 --> 00:37:59,909
I have a stomachache.

534
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,350
- Should I call an ambulance? - No.

535
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,489
I need to go number two.

536
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,650
Don't follow me.

537
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,029

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,670

539
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,710
What? Where did she go?

540
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,750
Ms. Han?

541
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,549
Gosh. Why isn't she answering?

542
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:40,048
Ms. Han hasn't come back yet?

No. She probably hasn't found her students yet.

544
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:43,619
Gosh. Still?

545
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,159
She must find them quickly. This is not good.

546
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,759
(Seoju Resort)

547
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,298
Sir, you should go and check.

548
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,068
Then can you stay in the lobby?

549
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:58,298
I'll call you as soon as I find Ms. Han.

550
00:38:58,299 --> 00:38:59,339
Okay.

551
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,139
Let's go.

552
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,670
- This is so good. - It's not hot.

553
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,170
Let's go there next.

554
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,298
- You want this one? Not that one? - This is tasty.

555
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:34,769
Hey. You girls are from Garam High School, right?

556
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,770
It's him!

557
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,239
Hey, girls! Stop right there!

558
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,179
Stop right there! Hey!

559
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:42,449
You brats!

560
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,580
Gosh. Hey, Seo Won.

561
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,479
- Nice. - Hello.

562
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,689
- Hello. - You brats.

563
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,690
I came all the way here to find you guys.

564
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:50,259
Goodness.

565
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,190
You little brats. You must be out of your minds.

566
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:57,060
How dare you sneak out like this?

567
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,699
You'd better brace yourselves.

568
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,529
You guys will face disciplinary action.

569
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,600
Ms. Han isn't answering her phone?

570
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,770
No.

571
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,540
You should go back to the resort. I'll keep looking for her.

572
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,310
- Okay. - Bye, girls.

573
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,290
Why isn't she answering her phone?

574
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:33,060
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

575
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,040
Cocoa?

576
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Yes!

577
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,150
Oh, right.

578
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,219
What? What's going on?

579
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:55,619
No!

580
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,330
Mr. Jin!

581
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,000
Help me!

582
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:45,799
Where is this place?

583
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,770
Who is that old lady?

584
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,779
Broth?

585
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,679
No way. That can't be.

586
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,730
Is that cheongju, commonly used to get rid of meat odor?

587
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,560
No way. I must be wrong.

588
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,770
Sauce?

589
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:36,719
What's going on right now?

590
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:47,799
Ms. Han.

591
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,639
Ms. Han. It's me.

592
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:20,730
This is where she transformed.

593
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,580
I told her to be careful.

594
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,920
Where did she go?

595
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,369
(Granny's Restaurant)

596
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,270
All right.

597
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,710
I must run away.

598
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Ppoppi.

599
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:48,750
Ppoppi!

600
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,449
Ppoppi...

601
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,279
Ppoppi.

602
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,049
Ppoppi.

603
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:57,060
Ppoppi!

604
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Ms. Han.

605
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:01,929
Ms. Han!

606
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:11,799
Where is she?

607
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,580
Ms. Han.

608
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,250
Ms. Han.

609
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,060
Where are you, Ms. Han?

610
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,699
If you can hear me, say something.

611
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:45,839
Ms. Han?

612
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,239
Where is she?

613
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,580
Yul!

614
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,250
Oh, no.

615
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Ms. Han.

616
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:02,190
Hold on. Ms. Han.

617
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,159
What should I do?

618
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,730
Ms. Han. I'll go down there.

619
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,630
- Wait. - No!

620
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,159
No. You'll get hurt too.

621
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:15,670
It's too high.

622
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,739
- Yul. - Darn it.

623
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,569
I won't be able to reach you, right?

624
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,569
Ms. Han. Wait.

625
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,610
I'm a genius.

626
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,650
Ms. Han. Here.

627
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,920
Bite this.

628
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:36,549
Bite it.

629
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,960
I mean, please.

630
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,790
Here. Be careful.

631
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:45,730
Great.

632
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,929
That's it.

633
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,270
That's it.

634
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,409
Are you okay, Ms. Han?

635
00:47:55,969 --> 00:47:58,008
Please wait there.

636
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,909
I'll make sure to get you out of there.

637
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:16,589
Help!

638
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,730
Hello. Excuse me.

639
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,170
It's 6am now.

640
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,810
Excuse me. Is anyone out there?

641
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,420
Who are you?

642
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:40,350
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your clothesline?

643
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:06,139
Ms. Han!

644
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,650
Mr. Jin!

645
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,920
- I'm right here, Mr. Jin! - Ms. Han.

646
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,190
Grab my hand.

647
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,060
One, two,

648
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,159
three.

649
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,869
Are you okay?

650
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,159
You came all the way here to find the girls?

651
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,190
Yes.

652
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,960
What about your cell phone? You weren't answering your phone.

653
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,130
I lost it.

654
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,139
You weren't injured that badly considering the fall you took.

655
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,679
You were lucky.

656
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,389
I was worried.

657
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,799
My uncle found her.

658
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:40,670
What a relief.

659
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,609
Well, I left the flea market to find the girls.

660
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:45,908
Then before I knew it,

661
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,480
I was heading into the area I didn't recognize.

662
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,989
(Looking for my puppy, Name: Ppoppi, super cute and white)

663
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:56,449
I see.

664
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:58,618
What is it?

665
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,089
(Looking for my puppy, Name: Ppoppi, super cute and white)

666
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:04,230
I just realized that I had a huge misunderstanding last night.

667
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:05,830
Pardon?

668
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:08,199
Nothing.

669
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,900
I should treat Ms. Cheon to a nice meal.

670
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,339
She must have stood the night watch in both of our places.

671
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,579
Ms. Han.

672
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,710
It looked like you wanted to stand watch with Bo Gyeom last night.

673
00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:23,509
It's a shame that you couldn't do that because of the girls.

674
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:26,118
That's not it.

675
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,548
I wanted to switch not because I wanted to do it with him,

676
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:29,690
but because I can't...

677
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:33,159
Anyway,

678
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,089
it's not what you think.

679
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,670
Mr. Jin.

680
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,770
I asked for your help with something a long time ago.

681
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:49,239
A very long time ago,

682
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:54,079
I asked you to help me get close to Mr. Lee.

683
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,009
It wasn't that long ago.

684
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,089
Well, you don't need to help me anymore.

685
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:04,619
Why is that?

686
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,860
Am I not helpful at all?

687
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:11,730
It's not that.

688
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,569
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

689
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,839
It just happened that way.

690
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:57,409
That's it.

691
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:00,650
To be pulled away from each other,

692
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,880
you must get close first.

693
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,159
My lord.

694
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,489
You're also a teacher here, right?

695
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,029
I haven't seen you at school, though.

696
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:18,920
You let a stranger, an old lady at that, drag you away?

697
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,489
Well, I mean,

698
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,630
there was nothing I could do.

699
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:26,329
If you trust people that easily, you will end up...

700
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,529
in big trouble someday.

701
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,739
Wait. Could they be my students?

702
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,279
You girls!

703
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,350
You're not hurt, are you?

704
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,989
All right. I'm happy that you're not hurt.

705
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,818
If you guys pull this stunt ever again...

706
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:53,689
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

707
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,130
We won't ever do that again.

708
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:57,059
Once we go back to school,

709
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,499
you'll be punished based on the school policy.

710
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,529
So prepare for that.

711
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,429
- Okay. - Okay.

712
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,000
All right. You can go.

713
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,170
- You tell her. - You tell her.

714
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,110
What is it this time?

715
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,750
I see. You have it?

716
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,179
That's a relief. I'll be there to pick it up later.

717
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,449
Okay.

718
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,750
Ms. Han.

719
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,388
Everyone is waiting for you. Let's go inside.

720
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,330
One of my students left her wallet at the market.

721
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,159
She left her wallet?

722
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,270
Yes. She left it at a food truck or something.

723
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:38,270
Then you need to go and retrieve it.

724
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:41,309
They have free time until ten o'clock.

725
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,069
So I'll make time to go and pick it up.

726
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,610
Do you want to come with me?

727
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,080
If you go alone, you might end up falling off another bridge.

728
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,790
I should accompany you.

729
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,830
What?

730
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,000
Ma'am.

731
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:16,839
Ma'am. I think I found your Ppoppi.

732
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,610
Ppoppi!

733
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,779
Gosh. My baby.

734
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,889
Gosh. You brat.

735
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,189
Gosh, you brat. Where have you been?

736
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,989
Come here. Gosh, Ppoppi.

737
00:56:35,389 --> 00:56:38,230
Yes, this is my Ppoppi.

738
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,869
Gosh. Thank you so much.

739
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,000
Ppoppi. Where have you been?

740
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:48,839
Here's the wallet.

741
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,408
Thank you.

742
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:51,409
- Thank you. - Bye.

743
00:56:56,779 --> 00:57:00,150
Wait. Yul complained about not bringing a cap.

744
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,920
Then why don't I buy one for him?

745
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,360
I owe him a lot.

746
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,889
You do?

747
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:13,028
He's such a nice kid.

748
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,199
He never forgets to collect phones from other students before class.

749
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,699
Should I buy you one too?

750
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,610
Maybe, something like this.

751
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,989
How many caps do you plan on piling up?

752
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,659
I'm sorry.

753
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:43,290
Gosh. Darn it.

754
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,029
I lost all of my stakes again today. Darn it.

755
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,500
Come on.

756
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:54,810
What about this one?

757
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,540
Or something like this?

758
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,690
A bright color would look better on you.

759
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:19,100
Apologize to my sister.

760
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,799
How could you change all of a sudden like that?

761
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,468
Why would I apologize to her?

762
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:25,170
Ask anyone. Your sister is the weird one, not me.

763
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:29,040
Do you think we wanted to be born this way?

764
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,210
"We?"

765
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,380
I see. Do you transform too?

766
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:39,480
Han Yu Na's sister.

767
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:42,650
This is interesting.

768
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:45,460
Is that her boyfriend?

769
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:47,259
I wonder if he knows...

770
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,960
his girlfriend is a monster.

771
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,600
Thank you.

772
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:56,869
Ta-da.

773
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,900
(A delicious cotton candy store)

774
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:03,469
We have to get going soon, but it won't take long to eat this.

775
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,049
Gosh. It's been so long since I had cotton candy.

776
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:15,049
Right. Did you see that clip?

777
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:18,259
When you feed anything to raccoons, they always wash their food first.

778
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:20,389
So someone gave cotton candy to a raccoon.

779
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,289
The raccoon put it in the water.

780
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:25,659
As soon as the cotton candy touched water, it vanished.

781
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,368
So the raccoon was stirring the water with its paws.

782
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:31,769
But the raccoon had the biggest despairing look on its face.

783
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:32,900
Seriously. The look on its face...

784
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,909
You should have seen it. Seriously.

785
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:45,150
I didn't watch the clip.

786
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:51,719
Come on.

787
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,860
Wait.

788
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:15,739
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

789
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:17,880
A woman who turns into a dog every night.

790
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,839
You look familiar.

791
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,548
I knew it.

792
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:23,809
- Bring him home tomorrow. - Bring whom?

793
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,279
Who do you think? Her boyfriend.

794
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,420
Ms. Han.

795
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:31,889
Actually, I was going to call you separately.

796
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,019
There's something I want to tell you.

797
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,258
Wait.

798
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:38,299
Can I tell you something first?

799
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,230
Wait. That was real?

800
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:42,630
Hey, Yo Sub. I have a job for you.

801
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:44,199
Girls.

802
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,068
I didn't go there to see you.

803
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,540
I went to see your girlfriend.

804
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:50,069
If I see you ever again, I won't let it slide.
