(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,148
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,480
(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,578
(Congratulations on not being a dog. It's okay. You're a human now.)

10
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,648
Then does it mean you're really dating Math?

11
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,419
Don't smile too often and give it away.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,218
You said you weren't going to notify the school yet.

13
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,358
Can we stop here and go back?

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,789
The two of them ought to face the loss just like I did.

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,498
They must suffer just like I did.

16
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,028
They must be madly in love or something.

17
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:06,568
Did they have to publicly display their affection at school?

18
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,198
This has nothing to do with us, though.

19
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:12,008
Good grief. Of course. It's been over a century...

20
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:13,640
since my dating DNA got activated.

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,839
Why was my face on that wall?

22
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,478
That memory. Could it be my memory?

23
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,409
Today, I'm here as a person, not a dog.

24
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,020
It feels very different.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,678
Is Yul not at home now?

26
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,220
He's doing a sleepover at his friend's place.

27
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,118
I actually just left something here the last time I came.

28
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,190
Let me look for that.

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,958
Why won't this open?

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,959
It must be broken.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,360
Just push down harder.

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,630
Do you want to watch a movie?

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,369
There was one I wanted to watch.

34
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,270
Ms. Han. I've just realized that we're not at school now.

35
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,009
Then can I do what I want to do?

36
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,309
I fainted a few days ago.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,350
I need to know why that happened.

38
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,619
You abandoned a field full of grass because of a dead woman.

39
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,190
Just to live an aimless life here.

40
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,319
The dead woman doesn't even want that though.

41
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,819
Bo Gyeom.

42
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,620
A piece of iron that has once tasted blood...

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,789
keeps wanting to taste blood again, so it continually attracts blood.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,799
But I'm not sure how the master feels.

45
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,269
What's gotten into you?

46
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,739
You got a nice toy for yourself.

47
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,150
Leave now.

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
Okay.

49
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:12,449
I'll leave.

50
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,080
Mr. Jin is a nice guy, though.

51
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,749
Is this absolutely necessary?

52
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,559
Cho Young's blood hasn't even dried up yet.

53
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,270
Well, you're a mountain spirit, after all.

54
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
Your duty isn't to punish people.

55
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,899
You ought to watch over the living...

56
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,369
I had left the mountain.

57
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,640
I am no longer a mountain spirit.

58
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,919
(Episode 10)

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,859
It must be good.

60
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,660
You're not going to have some?

61
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,729
I'll have some after I wipe your lips.

62
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,809
You're still carrying that with you.

63
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,280
By the way,

64
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,650
have you noticed Bo Gyeom acting strange these days?

65
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,419
Mr. Lee?

66
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,459
I briefly saw him yesterday.

67
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,330
It felt strange. It was like he was a different person.

68
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,229
Is something going on with him?

69
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,059
Wait.

70
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,900
Maybe, he's upset because you went there empty-handed.

71
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,470
Could that be it?

72
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,140
Are you okay?

73
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:15,710
Drink this.

74
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,679
If there's any place you want to go, we should go to all of those places.

75
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,160
Then we should go to the Han River.

76
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,019
We should also go camping.

77
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,760
Gosh, where else? Where should we go?

78
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,070
Hey, what's wrong?

79
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,340
That's odd.

80
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,140
What is it?

81
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,150
Usually, dogs run up to me because they love me.

82
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,650
But these days, I feel like they avoid me.

83
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,520
Maybe, it's because your curse has been lifted.

84
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,359
Yes! Let's go to an amusement park too.

85
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,999
- How about tomorrow? - Sure.

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,739
- Are you sure you're okay? - Yes. I'm fine.

87
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,939
- I don't think you're fine. - No.

88
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,609
Hey.

89
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,119
Your temperature is above 39°C.

90
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,220
You're not going anywhere in this condition.

91
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,220
I have a date. We're going to the amusement park.

92
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,220
Perfect, right?

93
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,489
Hello?

94
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,419
Hello. My name is Jin Seo Won.

95
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,790
Yes. Hello.

96
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,229
How is Ms. Han?

97
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,729
I think she's coming down with a flu.

98
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,769
But she was adamant about going on her date.

99
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,470
I know I'm asking a lot, but I had to call you.

100
00:08:55,739 --> 00:08:57,170
Please take good care of her.

101
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,608
I'm running really late right now.

102
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:01,440
We should definitely grab a meal with Hae Na someday.

103
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,710
Okay.

104
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Right.

105
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,008
I think I will be coming home very late.

106
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,320
Have a nice time together.

107
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,850
Good luck.

108
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:37,009
My boyfriend is handsome even in my dream.

109
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:40,979
Do you want to lie down with me?

110
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Pardon?

111
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,290
Hurry.

112
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,350
It's warm here.

113
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,359
My arm is hurting now.

114
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,080
My bed feels so snugly now.

115
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,989
My boyfriend smells good too.

116
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,909
Where are you going?

117
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,649
Come here.

118
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,540
It feels snugly here.

119
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,258
- This is from the old times. - Gosh.

120
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,570
Are we on a field trip or at a fashion week?

121
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,700
Did you catch a cold?

122
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:21,810
Get away from me.

123
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,408
Come on.

124
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,979
Look. This is the travel journal from the Qing Dynasty.

125
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,819
Are you all right?

126
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,580
- Did you catch a cold? - Are you okay?

127
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:31,819
I'm okay.

128
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,889
You gave it to him, didn't you?

129
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,289
- No. - Is that so?

130
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,119
This is an ancient map.

131
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,329
- I see. It's so yellow. - Right.

132
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,599
The mountains look so round.

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,899
- Totally. - Right.

134
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,029
Look at the mountain here.

135
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,139
- Keep looking around, girls. - Okay.

136
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,810
Aren't they too small?

137
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,210
- Totally. - Right.

138
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,710
Hey, which way should we go? Check this out.

139
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,100
Open up.

140
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,700
Your pupil, Young Master Soo Hyun, is here.

141
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,920
Sir, this is Soo Hyun.

142
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,960
Mak Soon.

143
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,060
Come here.

144
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,960
Yes, my lady.

145
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,430
My baby is moving.

146
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Gosh.

147
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,680
This is fascinating, my lady.

148
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,950
- Is it? - Yes.

149
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,759
Min Ji A.

150
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,759
Oh, them?

151
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,060
It happened a while ago.

152
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,009
You really have good hunches.

153
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,109
But they said it was a secret for now.

154
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,479
What secret?

155
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,409
The two of them dating.

156
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,220
- You didn't know? - No.

157
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,960
Hey.

158
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,300
- So it's this dog. - What do you mean?

159
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,139
The dog with a story that you're entangled with.

160
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,970
I am... What?

161
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,920
Hey.

162
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,889
Those are the shoes for a corpse.

163
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,930
The shoes used while dressing the corpse.

164
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,930
Had I known if there were shoes for corpses,

165
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,269
I would have gotten a beautiful pair for her too.

166
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,800
Why do you keep wiping the floor of this abandoned house?

167
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,739
So I could move in here.

168
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,279
You are a fox. Then act like one. You ought to go to your den.

169
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,810
It is cold in the den.

170
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:52,950
Wait.

171
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,220
Is this the warm spot?

172
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,790
Gosh. This floor is so warm.

173
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,159
It fascinates me how humans can come up with such novel things.

174
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,699
You will burn the fur on your tail.

175
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,800
What? Did my tail come out again?

176
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,399
Goodness. It did not come out.

177
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,869
By the way,

178
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,909
I do not know what these are for.

179
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,949
Why did you keep them if you do not know what they are?

180
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,520
Once I master my ability to change into a human form,

181
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,350
I will come down where humans live.

182
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,560
Ttaeng Pal.

183
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,359
Humans are ungrateful, cruel beings.

184
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,030
Do not think of joining them.

185
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,699
But when will we get that stone? Was it called a flint?

186
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,469
It has been over a year already.

187
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,969
She must have forgotten about it. No need to wait for that.

188
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,580
I know that he has secretly been waiting for it.

189
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,889
Stop right there!

190
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,619
Move!

191
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,560
Stop!

192
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,490
Get out of my way.

193
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,300
- Stop! - Move!

194
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:20,869
Move!

195
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,800
Watch where you are going.

196
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,040
Stop!

197
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,550
- Are you all right? - I am all right.

198
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,350
This way!

199
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,359
- Come here after you put that away. - Okay.

200
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,439
Apply this on your wound from the fall you took the other day.

201
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,949
Could you please say this instead?

202
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,590
"I picked it up on my way here. Put it on you."

203
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,859
When I was younger, my lady did not treat me...

204
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,999
like a servant.

205
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,070
She treated me like her friend. Then she was scolded quite harshly.

206
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,839
So I think it will be better if you treat me...

207
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,139
coldly instead of showing good manners toward me.

208
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,250
I will do it my way.

209
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,050
Here. Apply it on you.

210
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,899
You got hurt the other day because of me.

211
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,469
If you do not apply this,

212
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,040
I will feel guilty and hurt my conscience.

213
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,280
Gosh. I am a lowly servant.

214
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,310
I cannot possibly cause any harm on a nobleman of your status.

215
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,750
Then as for this,

216
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,149
I will accept it reluctantly.

217
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,740
That stings.

218
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,509
Mak Soon.

219
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,570
Yes, my lady.

220
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,709
I could not fall asleep, so I am here to chat with you.

221
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,250
And you will fall asleep here again?

222
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,178
Why? Do you not like it?

223
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,449
It is not that.

224
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,619
Are you hurt?

225
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,629
Why are you applying doenjang, not your ointment?

226
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:04,829
That ointment...

227
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,730
should not be used for something like this.

228
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,339
Then when should it be used?

229
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,039
When I am in so much pain that I feel like I would die,

230
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,638
I would apply the ointment...

231
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,409
sparingly.

232
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,850
Who gave you the ointment?

233
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,719
Have you decided on your baby's name?

234
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,790
Not yet.

235
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,260
"Duk" is the common syllable in the other names,

236
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,889
so it should be something with "Duk."

237
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,199
Will it be a baby boy?

238
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:46,770
From the way it has been kicking, I think it is a boy,

239
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:47,969
but I am not sure.

240
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,379
Duk...

241
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,350
Sleep well.

242
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,419
Gosh, I cannot even see a thing.

243
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,019
Oh, no!

244
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,320
Are you all right?

245
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:06,560
Yes, I am okay.

246
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,770
How come it still has not healed?

247
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:21,540
Did you use the ointment?

248
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,439
Did you throw it out?

249
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,379
No, I did not.

250
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,369
Here.

251
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:26,469
Earlier...

252
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,109
Did I handle it well?

253
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,449
I do not understand what you meant when you said to treat you coldly.

254
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,550
You had me fooled too.

255
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:41,449
Is that so?

256
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,790
But...

257
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,199
why that look on your face?

258
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,209
Do not be too good at it.

259
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,480
At what?

260
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:08,179
Well...

261
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,118
Being cold...

262
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,520
and mean to me.

263
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,689
I liked it better when you were awkward around me.

264
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,159
You are soaked.

265
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,929
Are you not cold?

266
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,128
I am cold.

267
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:27,300
I am all soaked. I will freeze to death.

268
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,939
Oh, no.

269
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:38,379
I did not see you, like a fool.

270
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,679
My gosh.

271
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,320
This happened because I was distracted, like a fool.

272
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,159
This...

273
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,189
will warm you up.

274
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:52,790
Then you will get soaked.

275
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,699
Hence, I am a fool.

276
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,500
Are you not cold?

277
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,369
I am not cold at all.

278
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,320
Do you happen to know who Lee Won Hwa is?

279
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,159
He is Prince Eunsung's great-grandson.

280
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,859
He is a member of the royal family, albeit in a collateral line.

281
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,070
Earlier today,

282
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:35,740
he was killed while being arrested for plotting treason.

283
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Lee Won Hwa's wife...

284
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:45,439
is here for postpartum care at the moment for she is expecting soon.

285
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,879
We will arrest her right away. Consider yourself informed.

286
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:03,760
Mak Soon!

287
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,399
- Lock the door. - Yes, sir.

288
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,070
What is the matter?

289
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,240
Where is Master?

290
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,369
He is one of the envoys visiting Qing.

291
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,379
He left early in the day yesterday.

292
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,850
Lady Han, the wife of the traitor, Lee Won Hwa.

293
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:22,750
Come out at once. We must tie you up!

294
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,249
- My lady. - Hurry.

295
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,419
- This way, my lady. - You must get out of here.

296
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,919
Please get out and hide.

297
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,289
Mak Soon.

298
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,989
Keep her safe.

299
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,189
This way, my lady.

300
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,530
Hurry.

301
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,359
My goodness.

302
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,699
Gosh! What is going on?

303
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,000
My goodness. Stop!

304
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,639
- Oh, gosh. - Get them!

305
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,639
Check everywhere!

306
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,239
Gosh, my goodness.

307
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,579
- You cannot go in there. - Sir.

308
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,208
What is this about?

309
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,909
- Let go! - My gosh.

310
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,448
Gosh, sir.

311
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,678
- Sir, please. - Sir!

312
00:26:58,679 --> 00:26:59,750
Move!

313
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,689
My lady.

314
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,330
They went that way!

315
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,399
- Get them! - Go!

316
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,840
Be careful, my lady.

317
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,309
- Get her! - Go.

318
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,340
If she gets caught, they will kill her.

319
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,108
Get her!

320
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,949
- Find her! - Search the area!

321
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,050
- Get her! - Go!

322
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,859
It is that way!

323
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:40,250
Young Master.

324
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,919
What just happened?

325
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,290
Go and keep Lady Han safe.

326
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,659
I will find out what is going on.

327
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,730
Can you not go?

328
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:54,869
There must be a way.

329
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,699
But...

330
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:01,510
We will meet again.

331
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,639
Be safe.

332
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,050
What is your name?

333
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,330
I am Cho Young.

334
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,619
Who is this lady?

335
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:52,290
Light a fire using a flint.

336
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,230
A flint?

337
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,629
You will not find it here.

338
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,869
Then I will bring one next time.

339
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:06,669
You have been waiting for her too.

340
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,879
The flint?

341
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:14,179
Her fate has abandoned her.

342
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,619
She lost her husband overnight...

343
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,350
and ended up here, chased by a pack of wolves.

344
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,619
Being a distant relative of the royal family...

345
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,990
made her the perfect prey for the wolves.

346
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,859
What about the child?

347
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,699
Will it live?

348
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,769
It has already died.

349
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,899
Oh, dear.

350
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,270
My goodness.

351
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:43,409
My lady!

352
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,250
My lady.

353
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,350
My lady!

354
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,449
Someone is here to look after her.

355
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,389
Go and bring her to me.

356
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,790
Yes, my lord.

357
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,359
Even if we take this to her, she will not eat it.

358
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,069
All day long, she just...

359
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,300
sits there with a blank look on her face like a dead person.

360
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,570
At night, she groans and whimpers in pain...

361
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,909
as if her intestines are torn.

362
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:18,859
Why did you save me?

363
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:22,469
Had you let me die,

364
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,540
you would not have had to deal with all this nuisance.

365
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,439
If you wish to jump to your death, do it someplace else.

366
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,649
There is nothing I hate more than the smell of a rotting corpse.

367
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,109
Hey, fox.

368
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,420
Fox, where are you?

369
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,650
Ttaeng Gu, do not worry too much. Be good, okay?

370
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,480
Go, Ttaeng Gu.

371
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,408
Remember the fox that used to bring us fish from time to time?

372
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,210
I have not seen that fox for the past few days.

373
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:17,079
It is so fascinating, is it not?

374
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,049
I mean, a fox bringing us fish...

375
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,639
My lady, come out for a moment.

376
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,650
Do you think this dog got lost?

377
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,420
He is adorable, is he not?

378
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,130
I have lived for many years,

379
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:05,259
but I have never seen someone climb this cliff three times...

380
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,369
to die.

381
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,409
Why is it that you so persistently wish to die?

382
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,739
My newborn baby...

383
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,509
went to the underworld all alone.

384
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,549
My baby must be looking for me.

385
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,319
Your child did not go to the underworld.

386
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,949
For a little while,

387
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,759
its soul was hovering around you.

388
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,790
Then it ended up in the body of this dog on the verge of death.

389
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,199
Nonsense.

390
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:42,199
Your mother does not recognize you.

391
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,199
On top of being awfully stubborn,

392
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,839
she cannot even see.

393
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:07,790
I am sorry for being late.

394
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,060
Many things have happened.

395
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:19,909
Is this the flint you spoke of?

396
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
If you are close to the mountain spirit,

397
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,920
are you the nine-tailed fox or something?

398
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,060
Yes, I am the nine-tailed fox.

399
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,699
So you had better keep your liver safe.

400
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,389
Leave it.

401
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,799
I will make the water flow toward where you are staying.

402
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,810
Can the nine-tailed fox do that?

403
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,020
Gosh, seriously.

404
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,589
He does all the cool things.

405
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,630
And here I am making the water path all by myself.

406
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,199
If only I had one more tail.

407
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,929
Gosh, my back.

408
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,330
Duk Gu.

409
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,270
Duk Gu.

410
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,710
I suppose he went out again.

411
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:13,290
Did you make it in the past few days?

412
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,150
Yes.

413
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:17,159
I am not sure if it will fit him.

414
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:22,589
What is it?

415
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,659
You look like...

416
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,130
you have regained the will to live.

417
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,299
I am relieved.

418
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,709
Because of your feeble master,

419
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,310
you must have been very worried.

420
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,940
I am sorry.

421
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:39,139
No. Do not be sorry, my lady.

422
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:42,079
Still no word...

423
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,549
from Young Master Soo Hyun?

424
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,480
I am sure I will hear from him soon.

425
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:58,830
This man is...

426
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,830
He climbed over the hills for over ten years...

427
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,869
to bring all sorts of rare delicacies to the shrine.

428
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,839
Oh, dear.

429
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,440
I wonder what happened.

430
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,679
Those cherished by the mountain spirit all perish so soon.

431
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,029
It was you, was it not?

432
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,339
A face as bright as the moon.

433
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:16,170
You were curt and abrasive,

434
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,480
but your gaze was sweet.

435
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,049
You are the mountain spirit that saved my mother.

436
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,480
My mother...

437
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,460
spoke a lot about the person who saved her.

438
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,060
It was all in vain.

439
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,929
What is the point of saving lives...

440
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:42,000
when you only live for another 10 or 20 years?

441
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,170
A small amount of affection, and she disappeared,

442
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,440
forgetting about the kindness I showed.

443
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,750
You too should stop being a bother...

444
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,520
and leave this mountain.

445
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,000
My lady, that is enough.

446
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,239
I will do it.

447
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:22,639
No, let us do it together.

448
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,480
But...

449
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,520
why do I not see the mountain spirit these days?

450
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:38,790
I was also curious about that, so I asked Duk Gu to look for him.

451
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:46,330
Then I will be heading back down now.

452
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,830
Would it not be dangerous to go back to the village?

453
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,040
Who would recognize a servant like me?

454
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,810
Also, three months have already passed.

455
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,739
You are right. Go ahead.

456
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,319
It is not too late.

457
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:14,589
Tell me where Lady Han and that girl went.

458
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,730
Do you really want to be dragged...

459
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,199
and be beheaded?

460
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,069
Duk Gu.

461
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,299
Duk Gu, where are you?

462
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:29,670
Duk Gu.

463
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,509
Duk Gu!

464
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,790
My lord.

465
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,889
My lord.

466
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:49,960
My lord.

467
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,540
My lord!

468
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,839
My lord.

469
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,150
My lord.

470
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,380
My lord!

471
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,190
My lord!

472
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,690
My lord.

473
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:26,529
My lord.

474
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,299
I looked for you everywhere.

475
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:37,409
In the spring,

476
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,449
my mother picked azaleas and made flower cakes for me.

477
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:44,080
In the summer,

478
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,790
we sat next to each other and dipped our feet in a creek.

479
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:49,989
In the winter,

480
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,560
she made sure my hands were warm...

481
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,589
by putting them under her armpits.

482
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,060
It was not in vain.

483
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,540
The ten years you gifted my mother...

484
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,179
was the most precious gift I could receive.

485
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,339
But she is no longer here.

486
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,880
Even if someone passes,

487
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,449
the memories remain.

488
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:22,350
What is so great about those memories?

489
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:24,819
Then I will gift them to you.

490
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:29,230
Warm, beautiful,

491
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,830
and happy memories.

492
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:34,799
I do not need them.

493
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,298
Memories are shared between people,

494
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:39,639
so it will be a great present for me too.

495
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:41,639
I said I do not need it.

496
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,239
No matter how stubborn you are,

497
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,440
you will not be able to beat me.

498
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:48,350
Hey.

499
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:52,750
I am as stubborn as a mule.

500
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,029
You are just asking me to play with you.

501
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,830
I am too busy for that.

502
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,569
I am sure you have a lot of time.

503
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:15,409
That is why you showed up every time I stood on that cliff.

504
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:17,480
I already told you...

505
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,980
that it was because I hate the smell of rotting corpses.

506
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,650
Oh, I see.

507
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:57,679
The glow...

508
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,219
of the setting sun is on your face.

509
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,429
Why are you so red?

510
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,609
What is it this time?

511
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,009
Playing with a doll.

512
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,480
But...

513
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,350
my head is on such a hard surface.

514
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:28,650
Hold on a second.

515
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,860
Should we fly that as well?

516
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:45,529
But you gave me that to fly when I am sick.

517
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,799
I changed my mind.

518
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,299
Do not get sick.

519
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,009
Neither your body nor your heart.

520
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:57,710
Do not hurt any part of yourself.

521
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,049
I am going to fly that away...

522
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,179
so you will never have to use it.

523
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,980
Okay. Let us do that.

524
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,819
But we have to go somewhere where there is water.

525
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,789
If it falls in the mountain,

526
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,159
it can catch on fire.

527
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,790
Why did you give me something so dangerous?

528
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,130
That is why I gave you the flints only now.

529
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:21,830
Yes.

530
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,900
I see.

531
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:28,670
Then...

532
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:31,179
let us go to the sea to do it.

533
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,480
The sea?

534
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,380
Have you ever gone there?

535
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:38,920
No, I have not.

536
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,350
It is an endless expanse of blue...

537
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,489
where waves constantly come...

538
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,889
and go.

539
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:52,029
Then should we go tomorrow?

540
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,969
Sure.

541
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,810
What should we do now?

542
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,319
What about playing house?

543
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,819
How do you do that?

544
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,049
It is where Duk Gu becomes our child,

545
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,730
I become Duk Gu's mother, and you become Duk Gu's father.

546
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,000
Then...

547
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,869
does that mean I am your husband?

548
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,250
The glow of the setting sun...

549
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,850
is on your face again.

550
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,360
Are you feeling sick?

551
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,100
We are playing house.

552
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,969
Seeing you makes me blush.

553
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,339
Then how can I also have the sunset glow on my face?

554
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,920
We are just acting right now,

555
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,420
so this will be okay.

556
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,960
Now, you also have...

557
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,960
a beautiful sunset on your face.

558
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,819
Duk Gu.

559
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:28,150
Duk Gu!

560
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:32,489
Duk Gu is chasing a squirrel right now.

561
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:35,489
Again?

562
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,369
Are you ready to go?

563
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,169
We can leave once Mak Soon returns,

564
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,469
so I can leave Duk Gu with her.

565
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,509
Did she go down to the village again?

566
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,679
Yes.

567
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:55,679
She is probably agitated.

568
00:51:57,009 --> 00:52:00,020
She cannot even sleep properly for she is worried about her lover.

569
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:06,560
About Mak Soon...

570
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,999
Is Mak Soon trustworthy?

571
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,500
She is a close friend of Cho Young, who grew up with her...

572
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:16,799
ever since they were little.

573
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,469
I saw her in the village the other day.

574
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,509
She was looking for something.

575
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,580
I heard she was looking for her lover.

576
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,049
But still,

577
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,480
one should not trust someone who has a baby in their stomach.

578
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,388
Let us be real. If she and her lover...

579
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:38,258
rat on Lady Han, those two,

580
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:40,360
no, including their child, the three of them...

581
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:42,589
will be able to preserve their lives.

582
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:48,330
Never mind.

583
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,069
Right.

584
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,409
I heard the sea breeze is strong.

585
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:34,250
She was hiding deep in the mountains.

586
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,850
No wonder we could not find her.

587
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,549
Do not let it get loose.

588
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,489
It is so pretty.

589
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,659
Duk Gu's mother is prettier.

590
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,139
Where is the lantern?

591
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,880
The swordsmen are here.

592
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,830
My lord.

593
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,139
Cho Young.

594
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:37,779
Let us play...

595
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,210
one last game before going to the sea.

596
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,920
What is it?

597
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,500
That way!

598
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,669
- Stop her! - Hey!

599
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,770
That way!

600
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,299
She and her child...

601
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,069
are related to a criminal.

602
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,369
If you do not bring her to us,

603
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,810
you will die.

604
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:53,980
Shoot!

605
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:58,880
My lord.

606
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:30,830
My lord.

607
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:34,969
If I stay hidden for too long,

608
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,810
or if I do not appear even after the game is over,

609
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,549
please forget about me.

610
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,350
You have a face as bright as the moon...

611
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:49,719
and speak bluntly,

612
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:52,560
but your gaze is sweet.

613
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,130
My mountain spirit.

614
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,900
(Nana Animal Hospital)

615
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:22,949
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

616
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,919
I am the one...

617
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,520
who put that curse on you.

618
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,850
What did you do to Ms. Han?

619
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:31,389
I couldn't believe it even after seeing it.

620
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:32,718
It just doesn't make sense.

621
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:34,119
Why do you think he cursed your family?

622
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:35,489
I wonder that myself.

623
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,830
Why us?

624
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,000
Why are you doing this to me?

625
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,199
Why are you messing with my family?

626
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,600
I am changing...

627
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:44,299
how Jin Seo Won feels about you.

628
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,040
I am going to get rid of every ounce of affection he has for you.

629
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:49,940
Where is Ms. Han?
