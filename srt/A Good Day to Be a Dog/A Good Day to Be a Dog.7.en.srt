(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,949
She's a returning student who's three years older than us.

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,318
She became a shaman just a month ago.

12
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,818
I hear she is right on the nose about things.

13
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,889
Do you have no intention of becoming friendly with Cocoa?

14
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,928
You have to stay on your toes.

15
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,998
Don't get caught by anyone.

16
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,599
This time, things may work out between those two.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,928
I think she changed her night watch time so they could be partners.

18
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:05,929
It's a swallow.

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,270
A welcome guest or a reunion.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,898
Hey, how come the girls aren't here?

21
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,940
That's what I saw after I was done with my shower.

22
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,139
You couldn't find them, right?

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,808
I couldn't. This is bad.

24
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,809
It'll be midnight soon.

25
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,879
- Are you unwell? - I need to go number two.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,948
Don't follow me.

27
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,208
Hey. You girls are from Garam High School, right?

28
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,978
Stop right there! Nice.

29
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,479
This is where she transformed.

30
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,020
Where did she go?

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,449
Who is that old lady?

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,459
Ms. Han!

33
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,089
Ms. Han hasn't come back yet?

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,989
Where is she?

35
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,989
What's going on right now?

36
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,959
If you can hear me, say something.

37
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,229
Please wait there. I'll make sure to get you out of there.

38
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:42,699
- Help! - Ms. Han!

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Grab my hand.

40
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,009
Two, three.

41
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:46,940
- Are you okay? - Yes.

42
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,039
You were lucky. I was worried.

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,709
Mr. Jin.

44
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,149
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,319
My lord.

46
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,819
Han Yu Na's sister. This is interesting.

47
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,219
I wonder if he knows...

48
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,759
his girlfriend is a monster.

49
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,759
Gosh, are there any fun stories to cover?

50
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,139
"This Woman Turns into a Dog Every Night?"

51
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,810
(This Woman Turns into a Dog Every Night)

52
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,709
(The whole family is cursed.)

53
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,150
(So my ex's sister also turns into a dog when she's kissed.)

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,418
He sure wasted his time, writing this detailed post about nonsense.

55
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,479
This crazy jerk.

56
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,729
I think I recognize him.

57
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,729
Who is he?

58
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,600
Isn't this Jin Seo Won?

59
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,009
You know what? I never liked you the moment I saw your face.

60
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,739
She turns into a dog...

61
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,780
Wait. She's the woman?

(Episode 7)

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,569
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

64
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,639
It just happened that way.

65
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,079
That's it.

66
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,818
Guys, your class is starting.

67
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,078
Get back inside.

68
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,250
- Okay. - Okay.

69
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,989
- Ms. Han. - Mr. Jin.

70
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,259
- You can go first. - You can go first.

71
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,100
Did you rest up?

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,900
Yes. Thanks to you.

73
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,568
What about you?

74
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,768
- Me too. - Hey.

75
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:00,970
You should already be in class.

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Get back inside.

77
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,009
I should get to my class now.

78
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,750
Mr. Jin, shouldn't you be in class?

79
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm on my way.

80
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,799
I'm working as a journalist now.

81
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,499
I'd like to cover your story on my channel.

82
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,369
Please write back.

(Modern Cinderella, How Actress Enters Pyeongchang-dong)

87

This is Hwani from Mystery Hwani.

88
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,988
I would like to reveal a shocking personal life...

89
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,289
of an actress who's beloved for her pure and innocent image.

90
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:05,210
What about my mom?

91
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,570
Yu Na went out with her.

92
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,580
She couldn't eat anything all day.

93
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:13,350
I told you not to play with my uncle's face like that.

94
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,150
Your uncle loves this.

95
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,249
- Right? - Uncle.

96
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,820
Don't wag your tail.

97
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,020
Is he okay?

98
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,689
There was blood in his stool because of pancreatitis.

99
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,129
He has been low on energy for the past few days.

100
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,770
But he's doing a lot better after getting the IV fluids.

101
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,070
So don't worry.

102
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,539
He doesn't have much time left, right?

103
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,109
Time flows differently for humans and dogs.

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,510
I'll go out and clean up the shop.

105
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,249
Hae Na.

106
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:54,859
You know that you need to break the curse soon, right?

107
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,600
Uncle, you can't get sick this often.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,809
You're worrying Mom.

109
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,070
Uncle.

110
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,910
I think I finally understand how you must have felt then...

111
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,049
and how tough this must have been for you.

112
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,049
My feelings right now are precious that I want to protect them.

113
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,460
But to do that,

114
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,390
I need to tell him the truth.

115
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,460
I'm really scared.

116
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,400
What should I do, Uncle?

117
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,439
He and I have finally gotten close now.

118
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,650
We had a heart-to-heart talk.

119
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,780
We joked around too.

120
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,320
Will I be able to tell him the truth?

121
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,590
Yes.

122
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,859
I will talk to him for 30 minutes...

123
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,600
and show him my transformation.

124
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,600
Okay. I'll make sure to tell him today.

125
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,590
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

126
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,499
Seo Won.

127
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,169
Do you still live here?

128
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,179
I have no interest in catching up with you.

129
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,140
Is that so?

130
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,350
I'm here as your friend because I'm worried about you.

131
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,419
- I got nothing to discuss with you. - Hey.

132
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,189
Are you still upset about what happened in the past?

133
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:07,749
Are you that petty?

134
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,789
Right. I saw your picture online.

135
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,859
Your girlfriend is super gorgeous.

136
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,499
What?

137
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,039
I heard what you've been doing with your life.

138
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,770
You create trashy videos.

139
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,780
Are you not busy?

140
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,749
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

141
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,219
Look at this punk. You grew up a lot.

142
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,519
I had always been taller than you.

143
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,619
Why don't you live a proper life now?

144
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,259
You're a grown-up too.

145
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,779
Gosh. The residents might file a noise complaint.

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,550
How does it feel to hear that after such a long time?

147
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,190
Does it jog your memory?

148
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,060
Hey. You know what this is, right?

149
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,029
(The guy next to her seemed like her boyfriend.)

150
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,700
You're doing well now. You got a girlfriend.

151
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,439
Now that you have a girlfriend,

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,869
things must get rowdy with you two like some horny dogs.

153
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,009
It's like that, isn't it?

154
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,310
Stop this nonsense, and leave.

155
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,989
Fine. I should do what you say.

156
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,090
See you around, my friend.

157
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:52,989
Darn it.

158
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:12,979
What is this?

159
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:31,129
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

160
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,810
Hello, Mr. Jin.

161
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,340
I fell asleep early last night. So I missed your call.

162
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,279
It's fine. Did you get home safely last night?

163
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,550
I saw you leave in a hurry.

164
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,080
Pardon?

165
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,649
When you got off work.

166
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,619
I was wondering if you got home safely.

167
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,290
Gosh, of course. I got home safely.

168
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,529
Have a nice weekend then. I'll see you around.

169
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,700
Hey, are you sure it was here?

170
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,899
Did someone take my clothes overnight?

171
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,840
I made sure I hid them.

172
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,810
Gosh. They were one of my favourite outfits.

173
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,809
They were my clothes.

174
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,849
Exactly. I wanted to come back last night to find the clothes.

175
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,748
But you went clubbing, so I couldn't.

176
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,149
Come on.

177
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,019
What is it?

178
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,859
- It's Mom. - What about her?

179
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,090
- She's at our house. - Why?

180
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,700
Well, remember?

181
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,970
When you kissed Math, you didn't turn back because he was asleep.

182
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,738
So I asked Mom why it was like that.

183
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,970
Then she asked me who was under the curse and got suspicious.

184
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,508
- What do we do? - Let's go home.

185
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,810
- This way. Let's go. - We must go home. Let's hurry.

186
00:11:58,989 --> 00:11:59,989
Mom.

187
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,060
Gosh. You should have called if you were coming over.

188
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,759
Where have you two been in the morning?

189
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,028
- We went out for a walk. - Yes.

190
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,430
We love going out for a walk in the morning.

191
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,899
- Right. - I feel so refreshed.

192
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,399
What?

193
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,939
So you didn't go back to retrieve...

194
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,210
your clothes on the street from last night?

195
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,940
- What? What are you talking about? - No.

196
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,979
Spill it. Which one of you is it?

197
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,449
- What do you mean? - What? Which one of us?

198
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,810
So you're not going to talk.

199
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,050
Fine. Then I can wait here until midnight.

200
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,920
- Mom. - Mom.

201
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
You!

202
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,789
Who is it? Did you get a boyfriend? When did it happen?

203
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,689
No, Mom. I don't have a boyfriend.

204
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,589
I'm so tired. I'll go inside and get some sleep.

205
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,498
- Gosh. - Who is it?

206
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,228
- Just tell me. - No, Mom. You got it wrong.

207
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,868
Who is it? Tell me.

208
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,898
- Who is it? Just tell me. - No, Mom.

209
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,340
Who is it?

210
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,080
I knew it.

211
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,420
- Mom. - You know who it is, right?

212
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,148
- Who is it? - No. I don't know him.

213
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,690
Bring him home tomorrow.

214
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,119
Bring whom?

215
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,420
Who do you think? Her boyfriend!

216
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:46,759
What?

217
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,830
She kissed a guy who wasn't her boyfriend yet?

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,300
No! Of course, he's her boyfriend.

219
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,869
I have so many questions for him.

220
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,440
Tell him to come here tomorrow. Got it?

221
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,489
- What's this? - What?

222
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,529
Is this a celebratory party for my first kiss? Or...

223
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:25,399
is it my last meal?

224
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,170
Hey, try this.

225
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,669
How is it? The seasoning is perfect, right?

226
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,340
What on earth are you thinking?

227
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,940
Don't worry. I already handled it.

228
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,550
Yul.

229
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,580
Ms. Han.

230
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,489
How did you know where I lived?

231
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,619
What's up with the suit?

232
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,060
Gosh. You're here, my future brother-in-law!

233
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:54,459
"Future brother-in-law?" Hey, go back home now.

234
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
- This is a huge mistake. - Gosh.

235
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,858
- Mom! - Wait, Yul.

236
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:58,258
My future brother-in-law is here!

237
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:59,599
- No! - He's here.

238
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,769
Wait. I...

239
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,540
Welcome.

240
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,340
Welcome. Come inside.

241
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,139
This way.

242
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
Hello, Mother.

243
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,619
It's nice to meet you.

244
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,749
Welcome.

245
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,720
Right. Here.

246
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,420
You didn't have to.

247
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,829
Gosh. No way! He got your favourite!

248
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,999
Seriously. This is crazy.

249
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,269
How thoughtful you are.

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,340
- Thank you. - Sure.

251
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Come inside.

252
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,648
Have you gone mad? You've really lost it.

253
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,978
What choice did I have?

254
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,089
Have you gone mad?

255
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,388
I'll be arrested. He's a minor.

256
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,589
He's not your real boyfriend. He's just acting as one.

257
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,019
But still!

258
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,359
What? Why is he sitting at the table?

259
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,430
Come. Let's eat.

260
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:13,940
I wonder if the food is to your liking.

261
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,478
This is very good, Mother.

262
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,009
School lunches...

263
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,249
"School lunches?"

264
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,879
He works at a company that provides school lunches.

265
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:27,049
You must be sick of school lunches...

266
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,419
since you eat that all the time. Right?

267
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,989
Yes. That tends to happen.

268
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,629
A company that provides school lunches?

269
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,060
What exactly is your position in that company?

270
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,628
Mom, it's not good manners to ask such personal questions now.

271
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,999
Gosh. She's so nosy.

272
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,769
Well,

273
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,509
your name is Yul, correct?

274
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,970
Yes. That's right.

275
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,509
How old are you?

276
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay.

277
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,720
Didn't you say...

278
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,420
you were born in the Year of the Dog?

279
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,859
Yes.

280
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,759
- In the Year of the Dog? - Yes.

281
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,760
- He's the same age as you? - Yes, we're the same age.

282
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,129
You're 30?

283
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

284
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,270
Gosh. You don't look like you're 30.

285
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,839
You look so much younger than your age.

286
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,239
- Seriously. - Gosh.

287
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,409
Right.

288
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,580
He looks ten years younger than you.

289
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,089
Everyone, would you believe me if I told you there was a line...

290
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,020
that made girls say yes when you ask them out?

291
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,618
You're too afraid to ask them out?

292
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:38,529
Then your dating life will go nowhere.

293
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,128
Single people with zero activities will get nowhere.

294
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,358
We're supposed to make our own chances.

295
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,269
You talk about the weather a lot when you go on dates, right?

296
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,469
Open the conversation by talking about the weather.

297
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,139
"The weather is great."

298
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,070
Then the girl next to you will be thinking this.

299
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,609
"Gosh. Come on."

300
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:57,139
Then say this line when they least expect it.

301
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,379
Sit comfortably.

302
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,719
Okay.

303
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,589
How did you meet my daughter?

304
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,358
- We met at school. - At school.

305
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,259
Well, his company provides school lunches.

306
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,889
- That's how... - Okay. Be quiet.

307
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,830
How long have you known her?

308
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,199
We met at the beginning of the school term.

309
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,699
You're dating her even when you know everything about her, right?

310
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,270
Yes.

311
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:29,709
What do you think about people turning into dogs?

312
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
It's super fascinating.

313
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,080
And she's so cute.

314
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,649
I'm not weird out by that. I'm really fine with that.

315
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,259
I'm sorry to bring you here at the last minute...

316
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,520
and ask you so many questions.

317
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,490
It's okay.

318
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,530
As her parent, I'm bound to worry for her.

319
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,469
On top of that, my girls are very different from other girls.

320
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:59,340
Well, when things are going well, you will be happy together.

321
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,708
But if things were to go south between you two...

322
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,409
and you have a bad breakup,

323
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,550
there are so many things we have to worry about.

324
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,149
Actually, it's beyond worrying.

325
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,149
I'm afraid that...

326
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,389
their ex-boyfriends might expose my girls' secret to other people...

327
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,090
or that they might show up...

328
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,459
and pick on my girls when my girls have finally met someone great.

329
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,030
Love life is a complicated and difficult matter to handle.

330
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,969
So it feels like...

331
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:34,310
I've given my girls such a big disability to deal with.

332
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,310
So...

333
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,049
even if you say that you're completely fine with this,

334
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,320
we'll have a hard time accepting...

335
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,790
or trusting you.

336
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,189
I understand.

337
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,429
But...

338
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,629
I only told you that because it really didn't bother me.

339
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,699
That's how I truly feel.

340
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,139
It's fascinating that people can turn into dogs.

341
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,040
But I don't think it's weird.

342
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,109
Actually, it's the opposite.

343
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,350
I don't want Hae Na to feel insecure about this.

344
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,419
A while ago,

345
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,050
she said no man could possibly like her...

346
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:19,219
because of who she was.

347
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,189
But I completely disagree.

348
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,389
She has a warm heart.

349
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,959
She's funny and cute.

350
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,530
She certainly deserves to be loved.

351
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,540
I guess you love Hae Na very much.

352
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,169
"Love?"

353
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,899
My heart suddenly feels...

354
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,399
Are you all right?

355
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:07,770
Oh, yes.

356
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,770
"The weather is great,"

357
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,070
"and I like you."

358
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,310
And it's game over.

359
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,579
You can start dating.

360
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,009
You can do it too.

361
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,218
Like my videos, and leave many comments.

362

365
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,339
Happy birthday, brother.

366
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,408
I really wanted to visit you guys in Korea this time,

367
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:47,840
but I can't take off enough time.

368
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,810
I think I can take some time off next month.

369
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:51,280
Yul is doing well, right?

370
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,449
All right. Just visit us when you can.

371
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,010

Please excuse me for a moment.

375
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,789
You can take the call in that room over there.

376
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,830
Okay.

377
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,359
Ouch, my legs.

378
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Hi, Uncle Seo Won. What's up?

379
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,699
What time will you be home?

380
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,469
I'm not sure. Why?

381
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,040
I was thinking of going out for dinner.

382
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,479
I'll eat alone if you'll be home late.

383
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,980
Hey, Uncle. Are you kidding me?

384
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,550
You shouldn't have dinner alone on your birthday.

385
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:28,709
All right, then.

386
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,219
- Call me when you're on your way. - Will do.

387
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:36,458
Ma'am.

388
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,289
You and your uncle must be very close.

389
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,459
Hae Na is close to her uncle too.

390
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,060
Yes, we're close.

391
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,859
There's something I want to check with you.

392
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,230
Sure.

393
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:48,769
You and Hae Na truly love each other, right?

394
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,369
You two are in a relationship, right?

395
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,740
I think so. Yes.

396
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,010
Then why is it that Hae Na...

397
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,879
hasn't been able to break the curse yet?

398
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,208
Pardon me?

399
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,708
- You guys have kissed, right? - Yes.

400
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,320
- When she was in her dog form too? - Well, that's...

401
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:05,080
- Sleep here tonight. - Sorry?

402
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,250
She must break the curse tonight.

403
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,759
Only then can I stop worrying.

404
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,260
Ma'am, that's...

405
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:14,730
Please do it for me.

406
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,080
No.

407
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,480
Ma'am.

408
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,649
Ma'am!

409
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,889
You truly love Hae Na, right?

410
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,230
So would you please do it for her, just this once?

411
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,659
Just for one night.

Mom.

413
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,800
This is just wrong, Mom.

414
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,069
- Mom, please... - What do you mean it's wrong?

415
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,638
Mom, I have something to tell you.

416
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,770
Be quiet.

417
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,209
Mom, I'm sorry.

418
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,149
The guy I kissed...

419
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,350
is someone else.

420
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,149
He doesn't know anything.

421
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,149
What?

422
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,919
Then who is he?

423
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,389
- My gosh, I'm really sorry. - No, it's okay.

424
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,458
I'm so sorry again.

425
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,159
It's okay. Please don't be sorry.

426
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,600
I feel so bad. My goodness.

427
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,969
Gosh, get home safely.

428
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,909
It's all my fault for raising my daughters wrong.

429
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,310
I raised my daughters wrong.

430
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,709

431
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,580
Ms. Han, hold on.

432
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:43,149
I'm really sorry, Yul.

433
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,619
You can go home now.

434
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,449
I'm really sorry. I mean it.

435
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,859
Anyway, I'm really sorry for everything. And thank you, Yul.

436
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:54,859
What on earth did I do to you? I'm too embarrassed to face you.

437
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,159
No, Ms. Han.

438
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,800
It's really okay.

439
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,669
It was fun.

440
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,000
And it was nice.

441
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,969
I know she's my sister, but what was she thinking, bringing you here?

442
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,539
I really had a good time though.

443
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,480
Do you want to take a taxi?

444
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,750
Can you go home by yourself?

445
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,350
Ms. Han, I'm not a kid.

446
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:19,050
It's not like you're in your 30s or 40s.

447
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,689
Just cab home. I'll give you money for your taxi fare.

448
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,520
I have a lot of free time today.

449

452
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,669
I see.

453
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,000
- Do you want to join us? - Can I come too?

454
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,340
Yes, that'd be great!

455
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,780
But it's a family dinner.

456
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,480
Wouldn't it be weird for me to tag along?

457
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,750
Ms. Han.

458
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,080
You have to break the curse.

459
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,850
Do it today.

460
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,590
Okay.

461
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,859
Then I'll go in and get changed quickly. Wait here.

462
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,389
Sure.

463
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,159

00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,040
(A female teacher's secret)

545
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Oh, right.

546
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,909
Yul is not mad at us, right?

547
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,820
He hates hanging out with me anyway.

548
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,990
Thank you for everything today.

549
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,889
Thanks to you, I had a fun birthday.

550
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,830
No, don't say that. I should thank you, if anything.

551
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,300
I had so much fun today.

552
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,669
Oh, here.

553
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:28,669
Okay.

554
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:38,379
- Well... - Well...

555
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,449
Go ahead.

556
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,459
It's nothing important.

557
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,559
It's your birthday today,

558
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,199
but I couldn't even prepare a proper gift, so I feel bad.

559
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,169
But I like this.

560
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,119
Actually,

561
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,920
I was going to call you separately.

562
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:18,790
Why?

563
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,929
There's something I want to tell you.

564
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,199
What is it?

565
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:28,230
You see, I...

566
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,009
Ms. Han, I thought...

567
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,279
long and hard before deciding to tell you this.

568
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:42,610
Ms. Han,

569
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,080
I think I...

570
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,770
Ms. Han.

571
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,270
Wait.

572
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Yes?

573
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,009
Can I tell you something first?

574
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,049
Sure.

575
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:18,080
Let me quickly run to the restroom first.

576
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:33,670
Mr. Jin.

577
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,839
Please listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

578
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,839
Don't be too surprised.

579
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,880
Please listen carefully and make your decision.

580
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,889
I...

581
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,630
turn into a dog.

582
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,069
That's too depressing. Gosh.

583
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,449
That's right. I turn into a dog. So what?

584
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:26,020
I sound like I want to fight.

585
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,718
By any chance,

586
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,520
have you seen a person who turns into a dog?

587
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,429
That's me.

588
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,759
I sound like a crazy woman.

589
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,170
Just be honest.

590
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,440
Pluck up your courage.

591
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,610
I turn into a dog,

592
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:50,779
and I...

593
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,080
like you.

594
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,779
Hurry up. Finally, she's out.

595
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,949
I'm sorry.

596
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,159
Mr. Jin.

597
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,940
There's something I want to tell you.

598
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,239
Okay.

599
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,310
The thing is, I...

600
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,489
I'll drink this and tell you.

601
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,299
Well...

602
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:47,529
Mr. Jin.

603
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:49,670
I...

604
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:54,040
The thing is, I...

605
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,739
I...

606
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,009
The truth is...

607
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,850
- I turn... - If it's hard for you to tell me,

608
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,549
you don't have to say it.

609
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,409
So I am...

610
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:09,409
not an alien,

611
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,350
and I'm certainly not a ghost.

612
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:16,150
Ms. Han, where did you say your place was?

613
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,029
Oh, my.

614
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,529
How pretty.

615
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,080
Hydrangeas...

616
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,250
change colour depending on where they're planted.

617
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,819
Hey, hydrangea.

618
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:53,460
What will be your new colour?

619
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,730
Let's find out what your new colour will be.

620
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,509
The colour isn't changing.

621
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,219
Guess what my colour is when I change.

622
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,029
No matter what colour you are,

623
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,060
I'm sure you'll still look pretty.

624
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,580
Hello, welcome in.

625
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,480
Can I get a whole chicken to go?

626
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,719
What flavour?

627
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,789
Whatever's the most popular.

628
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,350
Our three-flavour set is good.

629
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,258
Then I'll get the three-flavour set.

630
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:32,860
Okay. Coming right up.

631
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,189
- One three-flavour set to go! - Okay!

632
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,199
That'll be 21 dollars. Thank you.

633
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,170
How is your restaurant doing lately?

634
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,429
I guess we're doing fine.

635
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,839
Do your children not help you?

636
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,509
They're busy with their own lives.

637
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,509
I guess I'm not that great of a son either.

638
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,279
- You must have a son. - I have two daughters.

639
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,678
But they're a pain in the neck.

640
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,718
Why?

641
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,980
It's hard to explain, but they just are.

642
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:02,089
But if they resemble you, they must be beautiful.

643
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,289
Goodness. You're handsome yourself,

644
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,619
but you have a good eye.

645
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,989
Do you happen to have any pictures of them?

646
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,900
Don't a lot of parents with daughters...

647
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,299
have them as their wallpaper?

648
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:16,499
Jeez.

649
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,600
Do you want to see?

650
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,009
Yes, I do.

651
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,770
My daughters are so pretty.

652
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,079
Since a handsome guy like you is asking,

653
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
I'll show you.

654
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:27,980
Let me find...

655
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,219
Why do you want to see my daughters' faces?

656
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,849
I just asked because I thought they'd be pretty...

657
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,150
if they resembled the both of you.

658
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,318
That is true.

659
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:40,588
I hope you sell a lot.

660
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:41,888
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

661
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:43,190
- Bye. - Take care.

662
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,428
Ms. Beautiful.

663
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,569
Goodness. You're so unwary.

664
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,000
Anyway, your younger daughter is in serious trouble.

665
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,739
Why?

666
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,150
Why are you taking that?

667
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,920
I'm going to give it to your brother at the hospital.

668
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,618
He's too old now, and he has weak teeth.

669
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,650
How is he supposed to chew on those?

670
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:12,489
Do you think he can eat it if I soak it in water...

671
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,130
and mix it in with his feed?

672
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:15,690
Maybe.

673
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,259
Her brother?

674
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,509
Hey, Yo Sub,

675
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,869
do me a favour.

676
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:32,440
(Nana Animal Hospital)

677
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,409
Yes, I arrived.

678
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,250
But is this okay? I...

679
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,489
Okay. You don't have to curse.

680
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,888
All right.

681
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:47,989
I'll call you later.

682
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,569
- How may I help you? - Hello.

683
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,868
My dog keeps dry heaving.

684
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,639
I think an examination needs to be done.

685
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,839
Is that so?

686
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,069
- Let me take a look. - Okay.

687
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,310
All right.

688
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:07,349
- Let's go. - It's okay.

689
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,810
- We'll take a look. - Okay.

690
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,319
Come on.

691
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,540
How cute.

692
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,779
What are you doing here?

693
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:33,420
Something's in here.

694
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,259
What?

695
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,100
I don't know.

696
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:39,130
I can just sense something.

697
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,170
But why do you keep using informal language?

698
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:45,600
You're younger than me.

699
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,469
What's wrong with being young?

700
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,239
By the way,

701
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:58,880
how did you know I would be summoned somewhere...

702
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,719
and beg on my knees?

703
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:02,589
I could just see it.

704
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:04,989
What you said before...

705
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,129
You know, about how getting too involved...

706
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,860
when it's not even real will lead me to trouble.

707
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,429
Did you run into trouble?

708
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:18,068
Okay.

709
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,239
Then have fun handling it.

710
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,209
You need to teach me how to handle it...

711
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,569
to call yourself a true shaman.

712
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,480
Can you unlock this?

713
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,679
Move out of the way.

714
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,429
I'll ask Mr. Lee.

715
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,000
Mr. Lee.

716
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,000
What are you doing here?

717
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,009
This is no fun.

718
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,509
Let's go.

719
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,110
Linked arms...

720
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,559
Hello. Can we ask...

721
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,129
- No. - We're not buying anything.

722
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,230
I have a religion.

723
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:23,369
They're a part of that generation after Generation Z,

724
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,739
Generation Alpha, aren't they?

725
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:27,739
- They're so rude. - There's such a thing?

726
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,869
You idiot.

727
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:31,310
Like this. Gosh.

728
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,810
Hey.

729
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,278

Hey, what did that man say?

756
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:39,610
He asked about Ms. Han.

- Show him. - Here.

What? You think I'll be pressed for charges?

Go ahead and report me.

761
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,790
I'll be acquitted anyway.

762
