10
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:51,388
My lord.

11
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,990
If I stay hidden for too long,

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,620
please forget about me.

13
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,089
Dong Chul.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,660
Please do something.

15
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:03,828
Despite your attempts, if you fail to forget about me,

16
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,468
I will find you then.

17
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:06,629
You should live your own life.

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,038
Have a comfortable, peaceful life.

19
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,039
I don't want to.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,198
Because it looks like you're suffering.

21
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:13,208
Neither your body nor your heart. Do not hurt any part of yourself.

22
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,409
I'm on your side.

23
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,910
I'll help you.

24
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,610
How on earth did it happen?

25
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,380
Was there an incident like this in the record our ancestors kept?

26
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:21,379
I'm not sure. I don't think I came across anything like this.

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,020
Yu Na and I will comb through the record.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,490
I put that curse on you.

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,250
The curse that turns you into a dog.

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,519
I couldn't believe it even after seeing it.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,659
It just doesn't make sense.

32
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,030
Why do you think he cursed your family?

33
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,189
I wonder that myself.

34
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,288
Why us?

35
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,199
Why are you doing this to me?

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,360
Why are you messing with my family?

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,530
I'll lift the curse that was put on your family.

38
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,440
I have one condition, though.

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,039
How Seo Won feels about you.

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,610
Back to the time when he had no feelings for you...

41
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:47,038
whatsoever.

42
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,109
Make your choice.

43
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,410
I'll give you one day to decide.

44
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,880
Your uncle...

45
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,050
You should save him.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,549
Even if our memories are gone,

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,649
our feelings will remain,

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,919
so I'll go to you.

49
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,648
If you take a step back,

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,990
I'll take two steps toward you.

51
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,589
Even if I get a little lost,

52
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,019
I'll be okay because I've walked the path before.

53
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,728
Did you not say the palace people were still looking for her...

54
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,058
because of her baby of royal blood?

55
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,330
Is Mak Soon trustworthy?

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,768
She is a close friend of Cho Young, who grew up with her...

57
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,130
ever since they were little.

58
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,400
I will find out what is going on.

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,539
Be safe.

60
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,008
But still,

61
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,078
one should not trust someone who has a baby in their stomach.

62
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,509
Did Young Master Soo Hyun come today?

63
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,409
He got caught helping a criminal run away,

64
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,779
so he will be beheaded tomorrow.

65
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,779
Please allow me to see Young Master Soo Hyun just once.

66
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,380
It is not too late.

67
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,150
Tell me where Lady Han and her child went.

68
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,319
A female servant was here.

69
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,659
Where is she right now?

70
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,989
I need to get out of here.

71
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,959
My lord. Please.

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,829
Please spare Young Master Soo Hyun's life.

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,299
How dare you come here, you servant?

74
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,370
I know where Lady Cho Young is.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
"By the time we forget about everything,"

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
"the mountain spirit's curse will find us."

77
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,879
"The curse will creep up on us before we know it,"

78
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,280
"and we will lose what is precious to us."

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,009
Ms. Han!

80
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,150
Did you eat?

81
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,620
Yes.

82
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,668
You told me the other day...

83
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:00,169
there was a show you wanted to watch.

84
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,440
What show?

85
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,180
Would you like to watch it with me next weekend?

86
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,650
Why would I watch a show with you?

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,249
What happened?

88
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,479
What do you mean?

89
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,879
Ms. Han...

90
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,059
I thought my memories were going to be erased.

91
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,689
Well,

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,530
Isn't it up to me whose memories...

93
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,900
I erase?

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,869
You said you could start over even if the memories were gone.

95
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,869
Good luck.

96
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,629
(Episode 12)

97
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,270
Have a good day.

98
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,498
What do you think?

99
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:03,900
It's so pretty.

100
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,629
It's been so long since I last saw a rainbow.

101
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,210
What if my memories get erased?

102
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,309
If that happens,

103
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
I won't even get lost. I'll go to you right away.

104
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:24,720
Was there a time...

105
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,689
you ever seduced a woman in your life?

106
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,590
Well, no.

107
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,799
If you want to seduce me,

108
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,470
you can buy me sweets.

109
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,780
What else?

110
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,549
Food...

111
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,650
You can keep buying me food.

112
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,059
I'm easy to win over.

113
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,160
So you'd better seduce me.

114
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,929
Ms. Han.

115
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:47,530
This is for you.

116
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,439
Gosh. What's that?

117
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,679
This looks good.

118
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,809
Thank you.

119
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,809
Please enjoy.

120
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,049
What a surprise.

121
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,989
Do you like it?

122
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,590
Do you want it?

123
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:12,759
You're not going to eat it?

124
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,129
I might have eaten too much at lunch. I'm quite full.

125
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,169
Thank you.

126
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,790
Mr. Jin.

127
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,019
Yes.

128
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,830
Your desk was quite dusty.

129
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,629
It's not good for your health.

130
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,659
I was worried about your health.

131
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,969
I will...

132
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,540
take care of my own health.

133
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,570
I'll take care of my own health.

134
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,909
Of course, you should.

135
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,179
How's your diet?

136
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,749
Do you want me to treat you to some meat?

137
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,279
Some meat and soju?

138
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,550
Have you been eating well?

139
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,060
How about some meat and soju for dinner?

140
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,659
Just the two of us? You and me?

141
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,729
Yes.

142
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,269
Why don't we have meat with everyone else another time?

143
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,649
- Okay. - Okay.

144
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,909
Do you not hear your dry hands asking for help?

145
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,210
Do you not hear your dry hands asking for help?

146
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,949
When you're feeling dry, don't you think some alcohol...

147
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,850
will make your life a lot shinier?

148
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,489
How about...

149
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,960
grilled intestines and soju?

150
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,368
- Ms. Han! - Ms. Han!

151
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:40,969
- We just finished. - Bye.

152
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,639
- Bye! - Bye! Let's go!

153
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,479
- Ms. Han! We just... - Ms. Han!

154
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,629
What's wrong with him?

155
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Ms. Han.

156
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,009
Here.

157
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,779
I'm okay.

158
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,389
Thank you.

159
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,259
Well, Ms. Han.

160
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,420
There's something I want to tell you.

161
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,389
- Would you like to have dinner... - Ms. Han.

162
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,060
Do you want a ride?

163
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,200
Yes.

164
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,259
(Walk Dong Chul)

165
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:08,999
It's time for his walk.

166
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,999
Dong Chul.

167
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,229
Let's go out for...

168
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:15,639
Dong Chul!

169
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:18,970
Mi Sun.

170
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,340
Uncle Dong Chul.

171
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,840
Uncle Dong Chul.

172
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,080
Is it really him?

173
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:26,609
Yes.

174
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,350
I'm so relieved.

175
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,080
This really is a miracle.

176
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,350
Miracles really do exist.

177
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,019
How on earth did it happen?

178
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,590
Was there an incident like this in the record our ancestors kept?

179
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,229
I'm not sure.

180
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:41,960
I don't think I came across anything like this.

181
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:45,200
Yu Na and I will comb through the record.

182
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,930
Well,

183
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:50,040
is it like getting the last present?

184
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,470
You know,

185
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,040
right before people die, they get...

186
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,909
Gosh. Don't say that. It's bad luck.

187
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,850
By the way,

188
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,180
doesn't this scene feel familiar?

189
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,690
Right.

190
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:42,488
"Seo Hae Couple?"

191
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,189
(The day of Seo Hae Couple's trip to Seohae)

192
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,729
This is my handwriting.

193
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,159
Uncle Seo Won.

194
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,600
What's this?

195
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,170
That's Cocoa.

196
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,369
You want to drink Cocoa?

197
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,080
This is Cocoa?

198
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,649
This is such a cute puppy.

199
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,749
How cute.

200
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,619
Hey.

201
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,790
Do you not remember anything?

202
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:16,019
Remember what?

203
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,790
This is such a cute puppy.

204
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,759
I'm going to take this.

205
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,499
So cute.

206
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,748
- Hello, Mr. Lee. - Hey, Ms. Han.

207
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,050
- You're here early. - Yes.

208
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,289
Did you get home safely yesterday?

209
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,619
Yes, thanks to you.

210
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,589
Hello, Ms. Han.

211
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,759
Hello.

212
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,759
Gosh.

213
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:01,268
The parent observation day is in two days.

214
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,839
Please prepare for the class thoroughly.

215
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,309
There's an integration class with Korean History and Literature.

216
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,070
I hope everything is going well with the class.

217
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,580
The parents are important visitors of the school.

218
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:15,248
Please pay special attention to the cleanliness of the school,

219
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,748
both indoors and outdoors.

220
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,420
- Your class is in charge, right? - Yes.

221
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,960
I would like another class to join her class for this.

222
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,690
Which class...

223
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:24,920
What?

224
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,789
My class will help.

225
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,930
Sounds great.

226
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,898
- Hey, sweep that. - Stop that.

227
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,669
- I can't do it. Move. - Lift your feet.

228
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,499
- Come on. Hurry up. - I got it.

229
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,899
- Do you want this? - Seriously.

230
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,978
Stop it.

231
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:44,080
- I told you to stop it. - Don't move.

232
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,979
- Guys, cut it out. - Hurry.

233
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,509
Seriously. Stop it.

234
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,720
Hey, I told you to stop...

235
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,340
Are you okay?

236
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:28,859
- Date her! - Date her!

237
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,389
Everyone will find out at this rate.

238
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,859
What?

239
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,190
I thought they were dating.

240
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,330
What?

241
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,859
You told me that.

242
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I did?

243
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:41,869
When?

244
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:46,869
Ms. Han.

245
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,580
The kids teased us because of what I did earlier.

246
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,909
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,979
No, it's okay. You were trying to help.

248
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,619
By the way,

249
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,950
you really like this cake.

250
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,659
Not me. You...

251
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,529
I like it too now.

252
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,459
You know, stuff like this happens.

253
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,629
When you like someone, you start like the things they like.

254
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,699
How fascinating.

255
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,070
I really like cakes like this too.

256
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,669
I know.

257
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,080
Ms. Han.

258
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,209
Can I talk to you in private?

259
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,679
Sure.

260
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,459
Shall we talk outside?

261
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,569
Ms. Han. During our integration class...

262
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,010
Guys, don't run in the halls... Gosh.

263
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,840
- I'm sorry. - Sorry!

264
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,909
Wait, Ms. Han.

265
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,219
Gosh, it's all over your hair now.

266
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,590
Are you okay?

267
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,060
What are you doing right now?

268
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,580
Ms. Han.

269
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,949
Yes.

270
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,580
I like you.

271
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,159
I...

272
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,330
like someone else.

273
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,459
So...

274
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,129
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,340
This piece, "Dear Won's Father,"

276
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,539
has a lot of lessons...

277
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,648
the students can draw from in terms of literature and history.

278
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,449
So it's quite important to both subjects.

279
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,418
That's how I felt.

280
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,050
Why are you staring at me?

281
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,459
I liked what you said, so I was just listening to you.

282
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,629
Is that so?

283
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,428
- All right. - All right.

284
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,500
First of all, as you know...

285
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,868
Go ahead.

286
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,540
- Okay. So this is... - I'll listen.

287
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:35,310
a letter from a widow.

288
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,250
What do you want?

289
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,889
Who knows?

290
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,159
Are you actually going to date her?

291
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:55,899
Well, that might be fun too.

292
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,000
Stop.

293
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:02,740
Stop what?

294
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,300
Everything you're doing right now.

295
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,369
You acted like memories weren't important.

296
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,280
Do you now realize...

297
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,109
what was stolen from you?

298
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,310
But the thing is,

299
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,949
you didn't earn her love all on your own.

300
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
What?

301
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,590
I'm talking about how you two got tangled up in the curse.

302
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,159
It was all because of that kiss.

303
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,359
Do you still not get it?

304
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,730
I plotted all of it.

305
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:34,699
Ms. Han.

306
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,070
I threw her...

307
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,010
your way.

308
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,980
Mr. Jin, what are you doing?

309
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,359
Are you all right?

310
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,129
Come on. What is this?

311
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,770
You said you were confident.

312
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,840
I guess you were just bluffing.

313
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,740
You said you were easy.

314
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,010
Clearly, you lied.

315
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,510
Fine, I admit it.

316
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:56,320
I wasn't as "easy" as I thought.

317
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,490
Don't give up on me, though.

318
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,689
I'll think about it.

319
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,659
Come on. What's there to think about?

320
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,060
Don't ask or think. Just go for it.

321
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Okay?

322
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,730
Why did you guys fight?

323
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,500
I thought you two were close.

324
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,209
I think there was some misunderstanding.

325
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,679
Misunderstanding about what?

326
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,850
By the way, are you worried about me now?

327
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,609
No, I'm not.

328
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,779
I can tell from your eyes that you're really worried.

329
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
No, I'm not.

330
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,219
Ms. Han.

331
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,030
Would you go out with me?

332
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,500
Let's date.

333
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Uncle Seo Won!

334
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,520
Are you dating Ms. Han?

335
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,790
Tell me. Are you two seeing each other?

336
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
No.

337
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,490
Right?

338
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,329
Gosh, what's with Min Ji A?

339
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,060
Yes, I knew it wasn't true.

340
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:51,629
Why would Ms. Han date you?

341
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:53,899
What did Ji A...

342
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:56,169
say to you?

343
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,740
She said you and Ms. Han were seeing each other.

344
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,389
- Yu Na. - Hey, you're here.

345
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,719
Mr. Lee wants to go out.

346
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:20,760
Okay, then go out.

347
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,629
I mean, not as friends.

348
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,230
He asked you out?

349
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:27,469
My gosh.

350
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,669
So you'll date History?

351
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,740
Look at you.

352
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:37,439
I know you like him, but don't take things too quickly.

353
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:38,639
You know what a kiss will do,

354
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:40,409
right?

355
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,109
Yes, I know.

356
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:45,379
So I told him I'd think about it.

357
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,250
What did he say to that?

358
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,389
He said we should just go on three dates and see,

359
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:50,760
so I said yes.

360
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,219
Why don't you just date him?

361
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,990
Actually, no.

362
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,199
Saying okay right away will make you look too easy.

363
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:59,369
Wait about three days...

364
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,340
before you tell him that you will date him.

365
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,639
My gosh.

366
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:06,409
Congratulations.

367
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,740
Yu Na.

368
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,109
Earlier in the day, Mr. Jin...

369
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,820
Yes, go on.

370
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:23,659
You know,

371
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,459
the calendar on my desk.

372
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,530
There's "Seo Hae" written on it.

373
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,199
Did you write that?

374
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,929
No. Why? Do you want to go to the beach?

375
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,270
What's with you?

376
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,949
- Hi. - Hi.

377
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,359
Ji A.

378
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,689
Can you spare me a moment?

379
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,669
So, you're saying you remember everything?

380
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,340
Yes.

381
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,669
How come you're the only one...

382
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,810
I don't know.

383
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,780
Are you the only one who remembers what happened between you two?

384
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,850
Why?

385
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,090
What happened?

386
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,189
It involves Ms. Han's personal problem,

387
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,389
so I can't tell you more.

388
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:39,869
You should go back inside.

389
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:41,899
Okay.

390
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,678
- She's not here, right? - Ms. Han isn't here.

391
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,879
- How come she's not here? - Where is she?

392
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,189
Did she leave for the day?

393
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:00,889
- Did she? - I guess she left.

394
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,859
- There she is. - Let's go in.

395
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,859
Ms. Han, is it true?

396
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,730
What?

397
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:09,230
Is it true that you and Mr. Lee are dating?

398
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:11,899
What?

399
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:13,299
Why are you so flustered?

400
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,600
- It must be true! - My gosh!

401
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,938
- Congratulations, Ms. Han. - My gosh.

402
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,069
- You rock. - I'm telling you.

403
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,010
You and Mr. Lee look so cute together.

404
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,270
You brats.

405
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:23,740
Go back to your classroom at once!

406
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Yes, sir.

407
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,550
Congratulations, Ms. Han!

408
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,208
- My gosh. - So it's true.

409
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:29,879
- Who knew? - What did I tell you?

410
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,820
- Is it really true? - Well...

411
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:38,790
Congratulations, Ms. Han.

412
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,730
Good morning, Mr. Jin.

413
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:11,959
Mr. Jin.

414
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:13,929
Yes.

415
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
You forgot this.

416
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,770
I said...

417
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,879
I'd go straight to you without getting lost at all,

418
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,850
but I'm afraid I'd get a little lost.

419
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:39,689
Pardon me?

420
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,760
I think I steeped this for too long.

421
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,090
It'll taste bitter.

422
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:00,438
(Letter "Dear Won's Father")

423
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,070
While relocating a grave...

424
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,209
in Andong in 1998,

425
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,949
they found this letter.

426
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,148
This letter...

427
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:10,678
was hurriedly written by Won's mother, who buried it...

428
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,119
with her deceased husband while mourning his passing.

429
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,888
From this letter, we can learn a lot...

430
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,060
about the everyday language of the nobility in the 16th century.

431
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,889
All right. Could you kindly read the interpretation of it to us?

432
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,399
"I cannot go on living without you."

433
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,209
"I would like to follow you,"

434
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:36,939
"so please come and take me."

435
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,350
"My love for you will not die for as long as I am alive,"

436
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,449
"and no matter what I do,"

437
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,290
"I cannot seem to shake off my endless sorrow."

438
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:03,669
What are you doing here?

439
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:07,310
Everyone eventually dies, you know.

440
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,209
"Why did you leave me behind all alone?"

441
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,949
"My sorrow knows no bounds."

442
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,480
"When you read this letter, please appear in my dream at least."

443
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,060
Most people would react like this...

444
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,429
when they lose someone they love.

445
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,990
Like Won's mother and her letter.

446
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,399
So why...

447
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,040
Who is it that you resent so much?

448
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,540
It's Ms. Han and Mr. Jin, right?

449
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,219
That's why you erased Ms. Han's memories...

450
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:54,949
and broke them up.

451
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,129
It's none of your business.

452
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,540
Then tell me...

453
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:13,570
how I died.

454
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,139
Did they kill me or something?

455
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,999
Hello.

456
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,129
Hello.

457
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,438
Hi. Wait.

458
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,980
Why are you tailing the vice principal?

459
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,080
I'm not tailing him.

460
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,480
Hey, you're making it look so obvious.

461
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:58,080
(Garam)

462
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,429
Gosh, you scared me.

463
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,800
What's up?

464
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,129
Do you have something to tell me?

465
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,919
I'm doing this for your uncle's sake.

466
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,949
Math.

467
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,949
Hey, how did you know?

468
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,659
No one else at school knows about it.

469
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,830
Your uncle must be...

470
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,459
so lonely too.

471
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,199
Hey, what do you mean?

472
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:48,899
Hey, how did she find out?

473
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,369
No idea.

474
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,310
I guess she really is psychic, after all.

475
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:09,219
Are you obsessed with board games or something?

476
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,219
Oh, those?

477
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,500
No one would play them with me though.

478
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,730
But you bought all these.

479
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,529
Oh, boy.

480
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,270
The mountain spirit wouldn't even look at the games that humans play.

481
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,109
Then how about I play with you?

482
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,209
Really?

483
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,909
But if I win,

484
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:37,949
tell me the name of one of the mountains.

485
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,889
My lady, no.

486
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:41,219
No.

487
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,789
Yes, sure thing.

488
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,189
That's no problem at all.

489
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,820
Which one do you want to play?

490
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:51,899
So if Mr. Lee shows up, we have to stop him, right?

491
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,770
Yes.

492
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:55,699
But why?

493
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:03,409
Anyway, okay.

494
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,980
Shoot.

495
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,750
Nice!

496
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,850
Here I go.

497
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,560
Oh, shoot.

498
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:19,420
Darn it!

499
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,960
Hey, hurry up.

500
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,449
Nice.

501
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,679
Right, I have to put it on top.

502
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,089
I was going to pick that one.

503
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,270
Oh, no. This won't come out.

504
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:07,610
Let's play something else now.

505
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,489
That was so thrilling.

506
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,560
It was the best game I had ever played.

507
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,060
I won,

508
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:35,690
so tell me now.

509
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,630
Pardon me? Oh...

510
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,969
What's wrong with me? What did you say?

511
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:41,730
The mountain where I died.

512
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,739
Where is it?

513
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:00,889
Hey, Song Woo Taek.

514
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:05,219
What?

515
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,889
We're friends.

516
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:10,699
Right?

517
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:14,929
Yes.

518
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,139
But...

519
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,210
I can't help but wonder.

520
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,279
Wonder what?

521
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,210
Well...

522
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,549
I wonder what would happen...

523
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:33,619
if we were to cross the friendship line.

524
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,159
What?

525
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,190
Can you not take hints?

526
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,659
Then...

527
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,270
You mean, we could really...

528
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,500
I'm stepping out for some air.

529
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,698
Hey, wait.

530
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:51,738
What?

531
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,040
You're pranking me again, right?

532
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,039
You'll make fun of me tomorrow...

533
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,139
and laugh at me again. Right?

534
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,310
Woo Taek.

535
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,810
Yes?

536
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,480
We're friends.

537
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,850
Once we cross the line,

538
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,489
there's no going back.

539
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,790
Yu Na, the thing is,

540
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,460
I have many friends even besides you.

541
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,069
Even if I lose you as a friend,

542
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,529
I'll be okay.

543
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,269
But...

544
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,469
I don't know what to say.

545
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,909
All right, then.

546
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:46,929
We're moving way too fast.

547
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:53,060
Okay, I'll come now. Got it.

548
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,899
By any chance, is today the day?

549
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,369
Your first date with him.

550
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,009
Don't make such a fuss over it.

551
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,278
Don't you think Mr. Lee would surprise you...

552
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,150
by making a bold move right away?

553
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,850
Hey, stop it.

554
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:10,118
Why?

555
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,619
Are you embarrassed?

556
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,198
Think about it. What if Mr. Lee...

557
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,899
holds your hand on your first date with him...

558
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,440
and hugs you?

559
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,339
Then he'd stare at you passionately and say,

560
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,339
"Tonight, I don't want to let you go."

561
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,329
Before we head in,

562
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,929
I'll go and use the restroom.

563
00:39:58,259 --> 00:39:59,298
Sure.

564
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:00,769
Then I'll pick up some snacks.

565
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,869
- Okay. - All right, then.

566
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,069
Are you ready to order?

567
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,080
Get the caramel flavor.

568
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,409
You have a knack for tailing me.

569
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,080
I'm good at everything.

570
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,449
This is on me.

571
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:18,549
What?

572
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:22,219
All right, sure.

573
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,690
Thanks for this.

574
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,850
It's been a while since I watched an old movie. It was fun.

575
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,750
- Right? I had fun too. - Yes.

576
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,119
Seo Won.

577
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,259
What?

578
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,230
Mr. Jin.

579
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:44,069
Did you come to watch a movie?

580
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,710
Yes.

581
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,679
Did you watch the same movie...

582
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,839
Then have fun.

583
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,610
Let's go, Ms. Han.

584
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,170
We're here.

585
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,839
Isn't that your sister?

586
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,408
Yes, you're right.

587
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,939
- It was delicious. - I know, right?

588
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,949
You know my sister?

589
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,980
Of course.

590
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:33,250
You can enter your house holding your sister's hand.

591
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,750
I'll get going.

592
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,060
- Okay. See you tomorrow. - See you.

593
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,060
You're so cute, Song Woo Taek.

594
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,130
Hey, you lunatic!

595
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,270
My gosh.

596
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,469
Go!

597
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,069
- Yu Na. - What? Yes.

598
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,969
Go already!

599
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
Gosh.

600
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:01,709
- What's up with him? - Hey, come home earlier.

601
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,179
Why do you stay out so late? You're a girl!

602
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,419
Why are you getting angry?

603
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,259
And why were you guys holding hands? Are you in first grade?

604
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:19,759
I'm exhausted.

605
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,500
Hey, where is the skirt you borrowed last time?

606
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,069
You said you weren't going to wear it because it's short.

607
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:27,670
I found it.

608
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,610
It's cold outside.

609
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:33,909
I think this will look nice with boots.

610
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:43,589
Yu Na.

611
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,389
Are you dating someone?

612
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:51,000
You're right. This is too short. You can have it.

613
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,960
- Yu Na. - What?

614
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,369
Have you ever met Mr. Lee?

615
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,469
Me? History?

616
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,810
I don't think so.

617
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,310
Why? Did he talk about me?

618
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,610
How was your first date?

619
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,618
I mean, it was just our first date,

620
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,119
so we just got to know each other, that's it.

621
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,290
That's not right.

622
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,619
I thought it was super fun.

623
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,199
Yu Na.

624
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,969
Did you go on a date with Woo Taek today?

625
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,069
Are you dating Woo Taek?

626
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,339
- Good night. - Hey.

627
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:38,739
Hey!

628
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Mr. Jin.

629
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,230
Yes?

630
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:06,069
Did you get home all right yesterday?

631
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,710
I realized I didn't get to say goodbye.

632
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:12,610
I did.

633
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,520
Did you enjoy the movie?

634
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,219
No.

635
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,460
The person who should've been sitting next to me...

636
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,290
was sitting with another man in front of me.

637
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,169
Why do you want to go there?

638
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,000
She said she wanted to experience her past life.

639
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,969
- By yourself? - Yes.

640
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,909
No, you can't. It's too dangerous.

641
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,310
Ji A, do you want me to go with you?

642
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:49,980
I want to go too.

643
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,678
No, you'll only be a burden.

644
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,419
What? A burden?

645
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,750
I'm so disappointed.

646
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,359
Take me with you. I'm good at hiking.

647
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,690
I'm a hiking king.

648
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,130
- Take us with you. - Let us join you.

649
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,839
If you get tired and start complaining, I'm going to leave you.

650
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,670
"Get tired?"

651
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:16,369
What does that mean?

652
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,639
I have never experienced that feeling in my life.

653
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,449
You too?

654
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,429
Ms. Han, aren't you leaving?

655
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,060
I will.

656
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,190
(Trip to Seohae)

657
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,929
Mr. Jin.

658
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:15,130
- Yes? - Seohae...

659
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:18,239
Are you going to Seohae over the weekend?

660
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:21,440
- Do you... - The thing is,

661
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,440
I happened to look at your calendar.

662
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:28,610
I had the same thing written on my calendar.

663
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,190
Do you want to go?

664
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:38,790
Sorry?

665
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:41,230
Over the weekend to Seohae.

666
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,630
Where did you get that?

667
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:56,210
Someone gave it to me.

668
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,679
I...

669
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,150
just thought it was cute.

670
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,150
It looks familiar too.

671
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,380
Isn't it cute?

672
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:08,920
I miss her.

673
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,860
There was a dog...

674
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,860
named Cocoa who looked like this doll.

675
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,529
I see.

676
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:25,339
Then did she go somewhere far away?

677
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,310
She's close by,

678
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,540
but she must've forgotten about me.

679
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,909
Do you think...

680
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,049
she'll like me again?

681
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
Yes.

682
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:49,889
Definitely.

683
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,130
Of course.

684
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,139
Skip.

685
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,580
I'll do it too.

686
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,799
What? Hae Na.

687
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,810
What?

688
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,040
Are you two actually dating?

689
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:13,779
I mean, she tried to kiss me...

690
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,979
while we were eating chicken gizzards.

691
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,520
Hey, that's...

692
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,689
I was just so jealous of you,

693
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,520
so I involuntarily...

694
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:24,960
You were jealous of me?

695
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,020
When?

696
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,790
I wonder that myself.

697
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,480
The clam pasta here is good.

698
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,750
Is this place famous?

699
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:52,319
I think it's pretty average.

700
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,460
(Vice Principal)

701
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:09,299
Darn it.

702
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:13,000
Is everything okay?

703
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:15,270
It's nothing.

704
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:16,369
Eat up.

705
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,759
Walk properly.

706
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,718
I'm tired.

707
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,060
You're so heavy.

708
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:43,170
How high up are we going?

709
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,170
Help. Darn it.

710
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,069
Hey.

711
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,810
Yul.

712
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:52,009
You can go. I can't go any further.

713
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:54,179
Get ahold of yourself!

714
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:57,580
Hey!

715
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:09,889
What did you mean...

716
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:11,900
when you said my uncle is probably lonely?

717
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:17,400
He is.

718
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,710
His girlfriend lost her memories of him.

719
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:24,139
Lost her memories?

720
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,980
Who did?

721
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,049
My uncle has a girlfriend?

722
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,060
What? It's Yul.

723
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:39,960
Go ahead and answer it.

724
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,330
Hey, Yul.

725
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Ms. Han.

726
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,330
Can you hurry over to my house right now?

727
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,670
This instant. Please hurry.

728
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:52,069
Right now?

729
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,139
What's the matter?

730
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:55,969
Gosh, it's urgent.

731
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,979
All right, then. Can you send me your address?

732
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,449
I'll go as fast as I can.

733
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:02,949
Okay.

734
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Thank you.

735
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,548
We did it.

736
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:10,588
- It's going to work no matter what. - Really?

737
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:12,059
Just trust me.

738
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,290
- Will everything work out? - Just trust me.

739
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,060
Is something wrong?

740
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,529
It's Yul.

741
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,900
He wants me to go to his house as soon as possible.

742
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,400
Then you should go.

743
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:25,699
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

744
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:38,179
Yul is not home right now.

745
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,449
Good job.

746
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,690
Hey.

747
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,289
- Where are you going? - Don't mind her.

748
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,859
She's probably gathering herbs. Leave her be.

749
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,560
- Gathering herbs? - I don't know.

750
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:53,099
But she is by herself.

751
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,729
We should wait to hear back.

752
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,198
Should we wait for this first?

753
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,469
Gosh. I could be a counselor.

754
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:13,980
Yul.

755
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,190
Yul.

756
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,119
Yul...

757
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:22,889
Mr. Jin.

758
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,940
Isn't this Yul's place?

759
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,639
Did he send the wrong address?

760
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:42,750
Uncle, Ji A told me everything.

761
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:44,819
Don't worry. I'll help you out.

762
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:48,750
Yes.

763
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,690
This is where Yul lives.

764
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:53,759
Sorry?

765
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,429
I'm his uncle.

766
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:58,860
Sorry?

767
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,730
He must've pulled a prank.

768
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,369
Why would he do that?

769
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,298
I'm sorry.

770
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:08,009
No, I'm sorry.

771
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:10,610
I interrupted your free time.

772
00:55:15,549 --> 00:55:16,549
Ms. Han.

773
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,790
Do you want some ramyeon?

774
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:34,589
My lord.

775
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:39,119
It's my first time coming here, right?

776
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:47,460
I don't know how this might sound to you,

777
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:52,270
but it feels like I've been here before.

778
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:57,069
I feel strange these days.

779
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,040
My head...

780
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,750
and my heart...

781
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:05,219
disagree.

782
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,750
They're both a part of me,

783
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,549
but they keep saying different things.

784
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:20,798
I'm wondering if I should visit the doctor...

785
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,330
to check if something is wrong with me.

786
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,469
These days,

787
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:31,839
I feel confused about my feelings.

788
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:42,520
Do you want me...

789
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:45,060
to show you?

790
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,330
Yes.

791
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:21,190
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

792
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,650
How am I supposed to face him?

793
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,259
Are you avoiding me?

794
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,059
I know it's probably confusing and hard at the moment,

795
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,290
but I'll wait.

796
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,299
Until you find your missing piece.

797
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,730
It seems Mr. Lee is preparing for the end.

798
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:35,799
The end?

799
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,798
It means erasing Ms. Han's memories...

800
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:39,170
wasn't the end.

801
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:43,069
I don't know what you're thinking, but nothing will go your way.

802
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,139
We're going to end up together anyway.

803
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,509
Will you feel the same way...

804
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,310
even after suffering death and misery?
