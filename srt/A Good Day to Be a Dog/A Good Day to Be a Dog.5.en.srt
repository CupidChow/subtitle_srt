(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,943
Are you going to get a ride from Bo Gyeom instead?

10
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,244
Would you like to go by my car, then?

11
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:53,373
Ms. Han, get out!

12
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,443
- You've deviated from the path. - He's never driven...

13
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:55,514
on an expressway before.

14
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,244
Re-routing the path.

15
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:58,245
Are you all right?

16
00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:59,715
I think we're late.

17
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:00,784
Shall we run?

18
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,114
Something feels off here.

19
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:04,554
You must have had a change of heart.

20
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:07,053
Since you're all here, you should check out the ocean. It's nearby.

21
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:08,694
Even as I was watching...

22
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,723
the tides coming in and out, I had no idea...

23
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,695
that the small moon up there was pulling the ocean.

24
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,864
You'll be pulled away from him sooner than you think,

25
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:18,404
Hey, so I did some thinking.

26
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:19,863
You should get some help...

27
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:21,374
- from that student. - Ms. Han.

28
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:22,704
You said they lived together.

29
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,274
Don't be nervous.

30
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,874
I'm a dog now anyway.

31
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,474
Those happy...

32
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,775
and heart-fluttering moments.

33
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:30,814
And how I kept thinking of him.

34
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:33,415
Once I break the curse, will everything go back to normal?

35
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:34,984
What? Why didn't I change?

36
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,885
Uncle Seo Won, are you all right? Are you okay?

37
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,623
Why do you think it didn't work? What did I miss?

38
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:40,885
I think you're doomed.

39
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:42,494
What do you mean it won't work?

40
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,195
He needs to be fully alert.

41
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:45,624
There is only one way out of this.

42
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,394
What? You still carry this around.

43
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,965
Mr. Jin. Your fear of dogs.

44
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,204
I'll help you overcome it.

45
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,405
How will you help me?

46
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,704
Do you want to try meeting up with me outside of school?

47
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:01,644
(Episode 5)

48
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:51,925
Mr. Jin.

49
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,624
Think of this...

50
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:55,995
as our home.

51
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,634
The most peaceful and safest place...

52
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,335
in the world.

53
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:07,675
This is our roof.

54
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:31,465
(Ms. Han Hae Na)

55
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,305
Ms. Han.

56
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,504
Thank you for today.

57
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,444
(Lee Bo Gyeom)

58
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,914
Hae Na, you got a message.

59
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,515
Just let her sleep.

60
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:53,485
It's your sweet Korean history teacher.

61
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:54,895
Who?

62
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:58,465
It's pretty late. Let's see what he wrote in the message.

63
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:00,623
Don't check my message.

64
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,394
I'm going to check it.

65
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:03,435
Hey.

66
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,864
If you read someone else's message without permission,

67
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,634
you violate the Communications Privacy Protection Act.

68
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:09,935
Who is this dog?

69
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:11,604
Is this Hae Na?

70
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:13,645
I do see some resemblance.

71
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:18,245
What? Did he get caught by him too?

72
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:19,585
No way.

73
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,844
Oh, no.

74
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,655
- No. - Are you serious right now?

75
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,423
When did he catch you?

76
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:27,683
I said, no.

77
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,825
He doesn't know.

78
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,194
You're causing all kinds of trouble day by day.

79
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:36,163
No. Be quiet. Stop talking.

80
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:37,835
I want snacks. Walk me. No.

81
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,635
"No?"

82
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,375
Then what's up with this picture?

83
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:44,275
Why would he send you a photo of a dog at 1am?

84
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:45,705
Who knows?

85
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,044
Han Hae Na.

86
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,344
You've got a mouth. Start talking.

87
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,284
- She still can't talk, though. - Right.

88
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,755
"Ms. Han, look at this."

89
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,154
"The dog is pouting because I didn't give snacks."

90
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:03,494
"So cute, right?"

91
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:05,924
"Do you look like this when you get upset?"

92
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,335
What's this?

93
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:10,965
It's so obvious he's into her.

94
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,434
He's flirting with her.

95
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,465
"I'm not sleeping yet."

96
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:15,934
"And I'm thinking about you."

97
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,974
But why now of all times?

98
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,275
Look.

99
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,514
Hae Na has been spending time with Math to lift the curse.

100
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:25,944
From History's point of view, he's like...

101
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:27,544
"What is this?"

102
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,885
A woman who had a thing for him is spending time with another man.

103
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,224
Something inside him must be triggering him.

104
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,694
The tactic to make him jealous worked,

105
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,824
although it was unintentional.

106
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:39,895
Right.

107
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:41,565
Gosh, are you happy?

108
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:42,793
Goodness.

109
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:44,635
- Don't touch my bottom. - Good job.

110
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,534
Being too interested in men is a problem.

111
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,304
Gosh. It looks great.

112
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:54,775
The Office of Education chose us, as the school-violence-free school.

113
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:58,214
We won the video contest, sponsored by the Ministry of Education.

114
00:05:58,215 --> 00:05:59,815
(Winner of the School Violence Prevention Video Competition)

115
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,815
Ever since my appointment here,

116
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,825
school violence has been eradicated completely.

117
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,994
Gosh, sir.

118
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:14,594
You were appointed here only recently.

119
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,274
Hey, that part is crooked.

120
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,875
Pull the upper string more.

121
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:24,604
A bit more!

122
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:29,515
Gosh.

123
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:31,284
Hey!

124
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:32,744
Pick up the trash!

125
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,215
- I'm sorry. - Sorry.

126
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:39,354
Why is the vice principal upset?

127
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,054
Gosh, who knows?

128
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:43,625
It's Ms. Han.

129
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:44,765
Ms. Han!

130
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,135
Did she not see me?

131
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,344
Hey. Maybe, it's because of you.

132
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,744
- Me? - Yes.

133
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,875
I think something is going on between you two.

134
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,414
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:11,114
Bo Gyeom, do you really not know?

136
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:12,955
Know what?

137
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,125
You're so clueless.

138
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:18,765
Me?

139
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:23,465
Let's clean up here.

140
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:26,234
Me?

141
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:31,075
Wait.

142
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:32,804
Why did I avoid them?

143
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,215
Come on, girls.

144
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:44,585
Remove your makeup at school. Okay?

145
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,524
Han Jae Hee.

146
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:48,695
- Yes? - Come here.

147
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,354
- Me? - Come.

148
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,594
You little brat!

149
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,695
I've been watching you since you were a child actress.

150
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,134
- Can we take a selfie? - Sure.

151
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,234
All right.

152
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,973
Guys, congratulations.

153
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:08,344
I saw the banner. I knew you guys would win.

154
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:10,114
Thank you.

155
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:11,683
I'm a fan, you know.

156
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:12,714
I like your videos,

157
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:13,744
subscribed to your channel, and get notifications.

158
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,054
What will you upload next time?

159
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,854
We'll have the Ideal Type World Cup with the teachers.

160
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:19,955
That sounds fun. Will I be in it?

161
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:22,354
We'll start with the male teachers first.

162
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,923
By the way, have you seen Mr. Jin and Mr. Lee?

163
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,625
They were in front of the school gate.

164
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,434
Let's go already.

165
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:30,934
Wait.

166
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:32,434
Mr. Lee.

167
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,233
We're filming a YouTube video for the Ideal Type World Cup.

168
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,534
Can you help us?

169
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,145
- The Ideal Type World Cup? - Yes.

170
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,144
Sure. That sounds fun.

171
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,145
Yes.

172
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:42,544
You should join us.

173
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,913
I'm not sure.

174
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:48,255
Can you help us film the video for our channel this once? Please?

175
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,554
- Mr. Jin. - Please.

176
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:52,923
Hey, don't carry that by yourself.

177
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:53,954
- No. - Come on. Give me that.

178
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,554
Mr. Jin, can you help us just this once?

179
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,194
Just this once.

180
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,025
- Just this once. - Just this once.

181
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,694
- Just this once. - Just this once.

182
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:04,534
- Just this once. - Just this once.

183
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:05,864
- Just this once. - Just this once.

184
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,034
This is our music teacher,

185
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:08,505
Ms. Yoon Chae A.

Do you think Math will be able...

188
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,073
- to overcome his fear of dogs? - Ms. Han Hae Na.

What?

190
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:17,414
- Sure. - I wonder who will be the winner.

191
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,014
The winner of the Ideal Type World Cup...

192
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,554
chosen by Mr. Jin Seo Won is...

193
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,553
Ta-Da!

194
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:28,323
- It's Ms. Yoon Chae A. Oh, my. - Gosh.

195
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:29,655
- No way. - Let's give it up for her.

196
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,095
She is indeed beautiful, right?

197

You get why she won, right? Next.

198
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,533
Oh, no. What a bummer.

199
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,434
- This makes no sense. - Girls will be heartbroken. Right?

200

But it's only a game.

201

00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:46,444
Okay?

00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,543

She's in the video production club.

209

- Isn't she so pretty? And... - I don't know her.

210

- we have... - Uncle Seo Won.

211
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,095
- Ms. Han Hae Na. - Why did you pick Ms. Yoon?

212
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,235
I thought there was something between you and Ms. Han.

213
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:11,464

No. I didn't.

310
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:37,454
She might've been afraid of retaliation,

311
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:38,464
so she could have not opened up.

312
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,365

Hey.

325
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,044
Why did you do that earlier?

326
00:16:29,745 --> 00:16:31,115
You were acting strange today.

327
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,485
Is that what you think too?

328
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,485
It's strange how everyone seems to be okay with that.

329
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,294
Well,

330
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:45,054
the thing is,

331
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:49,563
acting aggressively like that...

332
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:50,895
won't solve anything.

333
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:54,605
We can't do anything without clear evidence.

334
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:57,074
And there's a protocol for these kinds of matters.

335
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,875
What if something worse happens?

336
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,544
Are you saying we should wait until then?

337
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,284
Why are you getting so worked up about this? This isn't like you.

338
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,555
Or are your personal feelings involved in this?

339
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:17,494
No.

340
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,294

Oh, that? The key to the storage in the gym.

347
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:45,754
She said she was going to organize the supplies.

348
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,855
Did you have her do that?

349
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,055
No.

350
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:51,624
She wanted to gain...

351
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,764
more voluntary points for her school record.

352
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,125
She wanted to do it.

353
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:58,434
I see. Have a good day then.

354
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:07,144
I saw it too.

355
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,273
- Her knee got busted so badly. - It did?

356
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:11,614
Yes! It was bleeding. It looked really bad.

357
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:12,845
But what's taking her so long?

358
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,355

359
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:16,815

00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,504
- Bye. - Bye.

367
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:39,875
Bye.

368
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,674
- She scared me for a second. - Gosh.

369
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,943
Hey, can you finish the story?

370
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:46,913
- Right. - Hey, it was no joke.

371
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:49,253
She fell really hard, and everyone looked at her.

372
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,114
It was bleeding badly. You could see her bone.

373
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:52,284
- Gosh. - No way.

374
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,453
- That's not possible. - I'm serious.

375
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:55,084
- I'm serious. - You're exaggerating it.

376
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:57,454
I really saw her bone right here. I swear.

377
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,764
Aren't you going home, Mr. Jin?

378
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,895
- Don't mind me. - Have a good evening then.

- Hey, is she hiding here? - No way.

398
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,074
Maybe, she's hiding because she's scared.

00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,135
I wasn't too sure.

407
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:48,234
- What a waste of time. - I'm so annoyed.

408
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,145
One of the comments said...

409
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:57,875
my acting was better than Jae Hee's.

410

That's when it all began.

411
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:06,285
Funny, right?

412
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,295
All she does is look at me.

413
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,095
When the other girls do mean things to me,

414
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:17,934
she just quietly looks at me to see...

415
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,734
what kind of face I'm making.

416
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,434
Then she'd say this.

417
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,545
"This is boring."

418
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:32,075
Then the other girls would hit me harder...

419
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:34,714
to win points with Jae Hee.

420
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:41,055
She recorded the whole thing with her phone...

421
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:43,724
and said she'd tell the teachers...

422
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,325
we were just shooting a school violence prevention video...

423
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:50,434
if we got caught.

424
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:01,545
Thanks for telling us, Ji Won.

425
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:04,444
I'll help you.

This is the video the kids made.

436
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,513
Well, must we make all this fuss, just relying on the words...

437
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:14,714
of the girl claiming to be a victim?

438
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:16,983
I hear Hyun Jae Hee finds the accusations extremely unfair...

439
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,254
and is bawling her eyes out.

440
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:23,723
Her mother is very worried, thinking the other kids set her up.

441
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:24,954
It wasn't a setup.

442
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:28,395
We should be able to find a video of her bullying Ji Won on her phone.

443
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:30,993
Then should we schedule...

444
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,034
an anti-bullying committee meeting?

445
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,835
Why is that necessary?

446
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,704
We'll just persuade that student to leave the club.

447
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:40,105
If we separate them, all will be fine.

448
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:41,944
No.

449
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,444
It's not fine.

450
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,585
The bully won't repent, and the victim will keep feeling anxious.

451
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:51,514
Once they graduate, they'll face more difficult challenges.

452
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,355
This isn't a big deal.

453
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,625
It's not a big deal?

454
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,325
Aren't you being too relaxed about it because it's happening in school?

455
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,924
Who is being too relaxed about the issue?

456
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:03,934
As you know,

457
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:06,605
we were recently selected as a school without bullying.

458
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:13,145
Sir, what is it that you want to protect?

459
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,115
A school that is truly bully-free?

460
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:20,045
Or one where we must pretend it's bully-free when it's not?

461
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:24,914
I'm not really sure.

462
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:28,585
Do you know how hard it is...

463
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,565
to restore the school's reputation once it's tarnished?

464
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:38,964
Then what about her emotional scars?

465
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,855
Are you all right?

466
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:07,895
Yes.

467
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:10,035
May I sit here for a moment?

468
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,174
Ji Won plucked up her courage to tell us,

469
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,244
but it's not going as well as we thought.

470
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:36,424
Bullying at school is a sensitive issue, you know.

471
00:25:37,194 --> 00:25:39,494
So I guess the school and the other teachers...

472
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:41,595
all want...

473
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:44,065
to solve the issue...

474
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:46,234
in a fair, careful manner.

475
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:54,474
I think that's something I struggle with.

476
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:57,744
Being fair.

477
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,484
When I see Ji Won,

478
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:09,954
I'm reminded of myself when I was young.

479
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:12,625
That's why.

00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,905
We're going to the Internet café. Do you want to come with us?

482
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,774
I have to go to the kindergarten to pick up my nephew. Sorry.

483
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:28,375
Hey.

484
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:31,514
Your friends want to hang out with you. Just come with us.

485
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:32,714
I really have to go.

486
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:34,585
Hey, Jin Seo Won.

487
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,184
I saw something very interesting the other day.

488
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:41,724
You trembled with fear when you saw a tiny dog in the street.

489
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:43,824
Come on. Don't lie.

490
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:45,724
It was this tiny? Then it must've been a rabbit.

491
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,764
- Goodness. - No, it was a tiny mini Maltese.

492
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,565
My gosh.

493
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:52,094
What about it?

494
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:53,635
Aren't you embarrassed? You're all grown up now.

495
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,934
Whether or not I'm afraid of dogs,

496
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:59,274
why is that any of your business?

497
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:03,474
Oh, he's afraid of dogs, but he doesn't fear people.

498
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,615
Right, it's none of my business.

499
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:09,355
But you really get on my nerves, you jerk.

500
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,625
Trample all over him.

501
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:20,723
I never liked you.

502
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,224
There were many witnesses.

503
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,733
You jerk. From your face to...

504
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,135
Some joined in.

505
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:29,605
Hey!

506
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:31,335
You guys saw nothing.

507
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:33,204
While some chose to turn a blind eye to it.

508
00:27:34,474 --> 00:27:35,575
Go home already.

509
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:37,214
Hey, go.

510
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:42,754
Don't look back. Hurry up and leave.

511
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:45,115
Even your face irks me.

512
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:53,565

00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:09,744
Bye.

516
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:12,174
I kept you waiting long, didn't I?

517
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:13,914
I'm sorry.

518
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:15,815
Uncle Seo Won, pick me up and carry me.

519
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:17,585
Shall I?

520
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:23,825
Uncle Seo Won, are you all right?

521
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,325
Yes, I'm fine.

522
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:32,565
Yul.

523
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:36,305
I don't think I can carry you home today.

524
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,835
Yul.

525
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:40,575
I'm sorry, Yul.

526
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:47,684
Uncle Seo Won.

527
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:49,514
Don't cry.

528
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,895
When I don't think I can handle the pain,

529
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,464
I try to desensitize myself from it.

530
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,595
I feel like...

531
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,305
I wouldn't be able to survive otherwise.

532
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:15,674
Just because you say you're okay,

533
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,885
it doesn't mean you're really okay.

534
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:35,865
Mr. Jin.

535
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:41,764
When you want to cry,

536
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:44,375
it's okay to cry a little.

537
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:48,944
I'll give you some privacy.

538
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:00,855
Wait.

539
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,724
Can you stay here for just a few moments?

00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:12,655
You're running late?

547
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:18,194
Okay, I'll wait for you. That's fine. All right.

548
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,305
Let me know when you're leaving.

549
00:31:21,164 --> 00:31:23,734
Okay, all right.

550
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,385
Darn it.

551
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:35,645
Gosh.

552
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:05,645
Hey! You stupid dog!

553
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:07,944
My phone. Hey!

554
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:11,885
Hey!

555
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:14,224
Get back here, you stupid dog!

556
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,355
Darn you!

557
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,224
Hey!

558
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,875
Darn you, stupid dog!

559
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,375
Darn it!

560
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,484
This contains the original video of the bullying incident.

561
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:45,414
Please kindly check.

(Garam High School)

563
00:32:53,895 --> 00:32:56,463
Mr. Jin, why would I bully Ji Won?

564
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:57,734
She's a nobody.

565
00:32:58,535 --> 00:32:59,565
Oh, right.

566
00:33:00,964 --> 00:33:03,605
I think she feels insecure around me.

567
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:06,645
- She feels insecure? - Yes.

568
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:11,315
She seems to think it's my fault that her acting is so bad.

569
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:14,845
I must say, it baffles me. But I should be the bigger person...

570
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:16,615
because I'm a celebrity.

571
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,825
Are you sure you aren't the one who's insecure?

572
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:25,825
Sorry?

573
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:27,825
Me?

574
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,635
Mr. Jin, I really didn't bully her.

575
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:32,535
I came to see you...

576
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:35,734
because I was hoping you'd reflect on what you did...

577
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:38,575
and sincerely apologize to Ji Won.

578
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:42,575
Regardless of the anti-bullying committee's decision,

579
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,115
I hope you can reflect on what you did.

(Teachers' Meeting Room)

581
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,335
We don't even know where that video came from.

582
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:13,245
Is the anti-bullying committee meeting really necessary?

583
00:34:13,774 --> 00:34:17,813
It was filmed in the club room, so we should investigate it.

(Ant-bullying Committee Meeting)

585
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:23,415
What is it?

586
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,115
Don't worry too much.

587
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:28,955
Close the door behind you.

588
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,024
Yes, Mom.

589
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:37,035
No.

590
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:39,334
It is not true.

591
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,134
There's nothing controversial about it.

592
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:43,205
Jae Hee.

593
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:47,544
I can totally do the movie.

594
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:50,015
- Why can't you do it? - Forget it.

595
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:52,774
Hello?

596
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:54,415
Mom?

597
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:05,624
Jae Hee, are you all right?

598
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,225
How did you lose your phone?

599
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:15,734
That piece of...

600
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:21,044
What should I do with that scumbag, Jin Seo Won?

601
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:28,885
Darn it! What the...

602
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:31,955
I was trying to keep to myself. Why must he make things get out of hand?

603
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:33,583
What is his deal?

604
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,254
That darn scumbag!

605
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:37,055
Hey.

606
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,294
Darn it. Hey, you tell me.

607
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,294
Should I keep quiet?

608
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:46,964
No. But right now, the situation is looking...

609
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:50,074
You see, the anti-bullying committee is investigating it.

610
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:51,834
We should lie low, don't you think?

611
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:55,205
I agree. Let's not cause trouble.

612
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:02,544
You guys are useless.

613
00:36:02,984 --> 00:36:04,015
Jae Hee.

614
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:18,535
Why hadn't I thought of that?

615
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,734
There is a way.

616
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,405
- Hello. - Hello.

617
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:34,444
What is the most sensitive issue...

618
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:38,455
involving a male teacher and a female student?

619
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,154
Let's meet up...

620
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:43,893
after the supplementary class later this evening.

621
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:45,055
We'll come up with a plan together.

622
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,234
(Nana Animal Hospital)

623
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:56,135
Aren't you getting a real kick out of turning into a dog?

624
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:59,135
Just make sure you put this on me properly later.

625
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,043
Just because you turn into a dog,

626
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:06,374
it doesn't mean you're a hero like Ant-Man or Spider-Man.

627
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:08,885
By the way, I'm really curious about something.

628
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,885
Do you gain special abilities when you turn into a dog?

629
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:16,725
Well, my sense of smell becomes more sensitive.

630
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:19,424
Then it'll be easy for you to find good restaurants.

631
00:37:20,024 --> 00:37:22,365
You should eat well so you can run around like a dog again.

632
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:24,095
I put a lot of duck meat in this.

633
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:27,035
Get that out of my face.

634
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,834
Ppo, let's eat.

635
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,834
Come and eat. Try this. Here.

636
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:34,604
It's delicious. Try it.

637
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:46,423
Hello?

638
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:48,725
Mr. Jin. It's me, Jae Hee.

639
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,354
Can I see you now?

640
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,655
I have something to tell you.

641
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,064
Now?

642
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,964
If you need to talk to me about something, we can talk tomorrow.

643
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:01,205
It's getting late.

644
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:03,035
I'll drop out as of tomorrow.

645
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:06,035
I feel really bad for what happened,

646
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:07,544
and before I drop out,

647
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:10,345
there's something I really want to tell you.

648
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:14,414
- Only you look good in this. - You look pretty too.

649
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,014
No, let's post the fourth one.

650
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:17,015
I don't like the fourth one.

651
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:18,885
You look pretty in it. It's a good picture of you.

652
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:22,954
Nice! Way to go!

653
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:24,023
Jae Hee isn't here.

654
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:25,124
Jae Hee is calling.

655
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:27,064
Gosh, they reek of perfume.

656
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:28,124
(Jae Hee)

657
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,365
Hi, Jae Hee.

658
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:30,995
Hey, where are you now?

659
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,935
We're waiting for you in front of the convenience store.

660
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:36,905
I see. I'm meeting Jin Seo Won tonight.

661
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:38,434
- Okay. - Come to the botanical garden.

662
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:40,003
Jae Hee, what did you say? Say it to me.

663
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:41,173
- Say it again. - So what's the plan?

664
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:42,404
- Hey. - Give it back.

665
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,575
I was talking to her.

666
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:45,044
- Jae Hee, what did you say? Where? - Okay.

667
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:48,483
I'm meeting him at the botanical garden by the Han River,

668
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:49,515
so meet me there now.

669
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:52,115
I see. The botanical garden by the Han River?

670
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:53,984
Okay, got it.

671
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:56,483
Just make sure you guys record everything.

672
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:59,293
If I play the video and say in tears that he sexually harassed me,

673
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:00,994
it'll be the end of Jin Seo Won.

674
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:02,893
- Okay. - What? Those little...

675
00:39:02,894 --> 00:39:05,064
- They're... - Ouch, what is this?

676
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:09,463
My gosh! That scared me. What the...

677
00:39:09,464 --> 00:39:10,804
- Gosh. - How adorable.

678
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:13,305
- What's going on? - There's a puppy here.

679
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:14,644
A puppy?

680
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:15,944
Oh, no. I'm busted.

681
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,114
The puppy is gone now.

682
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:22,615
I'll get ready with the others and meet you there.

683
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:25,484
Hey, didn't the dog have a camera attached to its hat?

684
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:27,055
I don't know. I didn't see it.

685
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:41,834
Does it work?

686
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:43,634
Yes, it's here.

687
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:44,805
Where?

688
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:47,074
I'm meeting him at the botanical garden by the Han River,

689
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,705
so meet me there now.

690
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,015
I see. The botanical garden by the Han River?

691
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:53,015
Just make sure you guys record everything.

692
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:54,984
If I play the video...

693
00:39:55,314 --> 00:39:57,414
and say in tears that he sexually harassed me,

694
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:58,754
it'll be the end of Jin Seo Won.

695
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:02,253
My gosh. This young brat wants to take it to the end.

696
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:03,655
Hey, hurry up and call Math now.

697
00:40:04,495 --> 00:40:08,194
(Ms. Han Hae Na)

698
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:10,334
Why isn't he picking up?

699
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:18,905
(Teacher Han Hae Na)

700
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:29,785
Hello?

701
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:34,385
Who is this?

702
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:41,665
My uncle isn't here.

703
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,234
Why?

704
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,435
Did something happen to my uncle?

705
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,915
Yes.

706
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:05,254
Ms. Han, you look like a detective.

707
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:07,524
Let's go.

708
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:12,224
If I get close to him...

709
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:14,423
and say I was sexually assaulted,

710
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:15,964
it'll be the end of Jin Seo Won.

711
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,134
"Sexually assaulted?"

712
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:18,564
Okay. Got it.

713
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:21,604
Hyun Jae Hee must be crazy.

714
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,035
How dare she mess with my uncle?

715
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,845
Being a teacher is not the easiest job.

716
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,044
- Yu Na. - Yes.

717
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:34,845
Put this on just in case.

718
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:39,115
Now, you are a moving security camera.

719
00:41:44,095 --> 00:41:45,294
Is this the right place?

720
00:41:51,294 --> 00:41:53,063
Wait. That's my uncle's car.

721
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:54,305
- This one? - Yes.

722
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:56,674
That means he was here.

723
00:41:57,705 --> 00:41:58,874
But how do we find him?

724
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:00,905
- Let's split up for now. - Okay.

725
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:07,144
I smell perfume.

726
00:42:08,644 --> 00:42:09,714
It's this way.

727
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:21,124
Uncle, where are you?

728
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:35,874
By the way,

729
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:37,575
what was that earlier when we were on the phone?

730
00:42:38,044 --> 00:42:39,075
What?

731
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:41,415
You mentioned a dog.

732
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:45,055
Earlier, while we were talking on the phone, there was a dog.

733
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:47,854
- A dog? - Yes.

734
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:51,495
By any chance,

735
00:42:51,854 --> 00:42:53,055
was it a white dog...

736
00:42:53,564 --> 00:42:54,794
about this big?

737
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,095
Yes.

738
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:58,865
How did you know?

739
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:00,435
Gosh.

740
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:04,535
The dog that snatched my phone...

741
00:43:05,575 --> 00:43:07,204
also looked like that.

742
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:08,345
Really?

743
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:10,845
That dog had a camera on its head.

744
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:13,015
What?

745
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:14,314
What if it filmed us?

746
00:43:14,415 --> 00:43:15,484
Hey,

747
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:17,483
how is that even possible?

748
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:19,584
She's right. What are you talking about?

749
00:43:20,254 --> 00:43:21,555
Darn it.

750
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:36,405
Mr. Jin.

751
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:39,374
What is it that you wanted to say?

752
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:43,074
I got cut from all the films...

753
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:45,415
I was supposed to be in because of you.

754
00:43:47,484 --> 00:43:49,185
I'm telling you that my life is doomed.

755
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:52,385
What are you going to do about it?

756
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:55,555
Is that why you called me?

757
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:02,995
I'm only 18 years old, Mr. Jin.

758
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:06,265
If you're an adult,

759
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,205
no,

760
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,374
if you're a teacher,

761
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:15,644
shouldn't you not be trampling on a student's budding career?

762
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:18,144
Aren't I right?

763
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:22,785
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin.

764
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:26,655
I am so...

765
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:30,194
I'm so sorry.

766
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:33,124
I'm so sorry.

767
00:44:35,694 --> 00:44:37,495
Please forgive me just once.

768
00:44:43,165 --> 00:44:45,035
What? I found them.

769
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:48,143
What?

770
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,245
What are they doing?

771
00:44:58,055 --> 00:44:59,155
Mr. Jin!

772
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:03,354
Let's run away.

773
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:06,555
Hey.

774
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:07,894
Catch that dog.

775
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:11,894
- Hey. - Hey.

776
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:14,365
Stop right there!

777
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:20,305
Mr. Jin!

778
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:24,144
What?

779
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:25,644
What are you doing here?

780
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:29,115
I'm here to help you.

781
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:34,725
Darn it.

782
00:45:44,394 --> 00:45:47,035
Hey, stop right there!

783
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:49,405
Hey!

784
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:28,805
Did you find her?

785
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,373
She's not on that side either?

786
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:32,374
Where in the world did she go?

787
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,244
Oh, my gosh!

788
00:46:35,245 --> 00:46:36,415
What was that?

789
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:38,313
- What in the world? - What?

790
00:46:38,314 --> 00:46:39,983
It turned on all of a sudden.

791
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:41,624
The light turned on all of a sudden.

792
00:46:42,555 --> 00:46:44,893
Why did you have to make so much noise over that?

793
00:46:44,894 --> 00:46:46,455
It turned on all of a sudden.

794
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,894
- You're so annoying. - Gosh.

795
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:50,734
Doggie.

796
00:46:53,135 --> 00:46:56,435
Doggie, where are you?

797
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:28,265
Mr. Lee.

798
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:31,374
Goodness.

799
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:35,004
What is our school's celebrity doing at a place like this?

800
00:47:35,874 --> 00:47:39,115
I came to meet someone, but I got lost.

801
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,084
Who?

802
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,515
Seo Won?

803
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,155
I know kids these days are manipulative,

804
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:56,924
but your threats were on another level.

805
00:47:58,095 --> 00:48:00,135
You shouldn't disrespect your teachers like that.

806
00:48:00,405 --> 00:48:02,205
It is very unpleasant to hear.

807
00:48:08,104 --> 00:48:09,575
So what are you going to do?

808
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:12,174
Who knows?

809
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:14,915
What should I do?

810
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:22,084
Gosh. Should I...

811
00:48:24,754 --> 00:48:26,225
punish you or something?

812
00:48:30,694 --> 00:48:32,394
But we shouldn't do that these days.

813
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:37,234
These days, if a teacher harms a student,

814
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:40,745
they receive disciplinary action and lose their teaching license.

815
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,115
But you know what?

816
00:48:49,984 --> 00:48:51,115
I beat...

817
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:54,354
students like you who need it to come to their senses.

818
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:58,524
Are you insane? What's wrong with you?

819
00:49:02,964 --> 00:49:04,135
How does it feel?

820
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:09,935
Are you scared that I'll hit you?

821
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:15,405
Doesn't it feel scary not knowing what I'll do to you?

822
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:23,214
I'm asking you how it feels...

823
00:49:25,785 --> 00:49:27,955
to go from an assailant to a victim.

824
00:49:41,905 --> 00:49:44,135
Why are you doing this to me, Mr. Lee?

825
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:47,004
Why did you treat Ji Won that way?

826
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:56,044
Darn it.

827
00:49:58,455 --> 00:50:00,285
Did she get beaten, knowing the reason why?

828
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:19,705
What is she doing?

829
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:21,975
She hid herself well.

830
00:50:23,274 --> 00:50:24,475
Is nature calling?

831
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,444
Jun Seo's dog,

832
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:32,015
Cocoa, had on a stroll camera.

833
00:50:32,515 --> 00:50:33,615
"A stroll camera?"

834
00:50:34,524 --> 00:50:37,824
Apparently, it's a way to capture footage from a pet's-eye view...

835
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:40,394
while they're taking a stroll to watch at home.

836
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:45,165
But he said the students from the club were in the footage.

837
00:50:45,265 --> 00:50:46,793
He called me right away...

838
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,305
after hearing "sexual assault" coming out of their mouths.

839
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:52,604
Did you come here by yourself in a taxi?

840
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:54,944
Of course. Who would I come with?

841
00:50:57,845 --> 00:50:59,444
Everything's over now, right?

842
00:51:00,714 --> 00:51:02,415
Wait, Honey.

843
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,455
There are too many people in the parking lot.

844
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:07,385
What's up with you? You're creeping me out.

845
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:08,754
Let's go someplace else.

846
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:10,753
I know a lot of good places.

847
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:12,725
- What? You're scaring me. - Come on.

848
00:51:12,854 --> 00:51:14,893
You have so much to say today, don't you?

849
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:16,095
Let's go home now.

850
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:17,765
Okay.

851
00:51:24,305 --> 00:51:25,734
What a long day.

852
00:51:36,415 --> 00:51:37,714
(Winner of the School Violence Prevention Video Competition)

853
00:51:43,285 --> 00:51:44,424
Gosh.

854
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:48,165
Come down already.

855
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,995
- Hurry up. - Hurry up.

856
00:51:52,365 --> 00:51:53,365
Jun Seo.

857
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,865
Hello, Mr. Jin.

858
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:58,975
Thank you for yesterday.

859
00:51:59,274 --> 00:52:01,274
Sorry? For what?

860
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:03,674
I want to say thank you to Cocoa as well.

861
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:05,615
How do you know Cocoa?

862
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:07,845
Yul told me.

863
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:09,345
I see.

864
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:13,915
All right, then.

865
00:52:21,294 --> 00:52:23,964
Okay, guys. Turn in your phones.

866
00:52:25,564 --> 00:52:26,694
Good.

867
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:28,635
Good.

868
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:30,435
Good.

869
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:35,805
No, I have to feed Cocoa.

870
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,044
Gosh.

871
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:41,544
Cocoa!

872
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:43,115
Darn it.

873
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:45,714
He should just worry about feeding himself.

874
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,384
Hey, did you see the bulletin board?

875
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:49,424
There must be something going on. What is it? Tell me.

876
00:52:49,524 --> 00:52:50,994
I don't know. Do you?

877
00:52:50,995 --> 00:52:53,124
- No. I'm sleepy. - What is it?

878
00:53:01,064 --> 00:53:02,234
Do your work properly.

879
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:04,135
Sorry.

880
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,745
I really don't want to do this.

881
00:53:11,115 --> 00:53:12,873
What is this?

882
00:53:12,874 --> 00:53:14,915
Jae Hee messed everything up.

883
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:18,884
This is all because of Ji Won.

884
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:21,084
Why are you dropping everything on the floor?

885
00:53:22,524 --> 00:53:24,754
Let's just make Ji Won do this. Why do we have to do this?

886
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:28,023
It's her fault for getting on Jae Hee's bad side.

887
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:29,765
We were just cannon fodder.

888
00:53:31,064 --> 00:53:34,535
Hey, isn't your dad associated with our school in some way?

889
00:53:34,935 --> 00:53:38,405
Hey, then you should ask your dad to help us.

890
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,774
- Okay? - Yes, you should ask him.

891
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:44,575
Are you the only ones with dads?

892
00:53:47,544 --> 00:53:49,015
My dad is the chair here.

893
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:51,584
You guys need to be taught a lesson. Voluntary service isn't enough.

894
00:53:51,714 --> 00:53:53,615
- Ms. Yoon. - It's not what you think.

895
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:55,884
- We were just joking. - Yes, Dad.

896
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:57,893
- Ms. Yoon. - Ms. Yoon.

897
00:53:57,894 --> 00:54:00,023
- Ms. Yoon. - Ms. Yoon, we were just joking.

898
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:01,394
- I'm sorry. - Ms. Yoon.

899
00:54:02,024 --> 00:54:03,124
Thank you.

900
00:54:03,894 --> 00:54:05,194
Thank you for the drink.

901
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:08,435
If you're ever going through a hard time, please tell us.

902
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:11,535
Ji Won.

903
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:15,873
Are you filming something?

904
00:54:15,874 --> 00:54:16,904
Yes.

905
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:19,873
We decided to film The Ideal Type World Cup that Mr. Lee...

906
00:54:19,874 --> 00:54:21,444
and Mr. Jin did last time with some other teachers.

907
00:54:22,714 --> 00:54:23,785
Then will I do it too?

908
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:25,615
Of course.

909
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:27,685
We'll go to you for an interview soon.

910
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:30,055
Okay. You are welcome to come any time.

911
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,424
They're waiting for you. Go on.

912
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:37,665
Let's go.

913
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,535
By the way, Ms. Han.

914
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:47,745
I never picked Ms. Yoon.

915
00:54:50,174 --> 00:54:53,144
They told me Bo Gyeom chose you as number one...

916
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:55,944
and that I shouldn't choose the same person,

917
00:54:56,515 --> 00:54:57,885
so I told them to do whatever.

918
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:02,284
Are you telling me because you were worried...

919
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:03,825
that I would make you last place?

920
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:06,995
No, I was just trying to tell you the truth...

921
00:55:07,524 --> 00:55:08,893
You said being second is also meaningful,

922
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:11,064
but I guess you wanted to come in first as well.

923
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,635
No, I just wanted to tell you the truth...

924
00:55:16,205 --> 00:55:17,305
I wanted to tell you...

925
00:55:17,674 --> 00:55:19,774
Ms. Han!

926
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:24,273
You weren't even the teacher in charge,

927
00:55:24,274 --> 00:55:25,944
but you did a lot to help

928
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:27,615
I'm so grateful.

929
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:30,415
I would like to treat you to a meal if that's okay.

930
00:55:31,785 --> 00:55:34,385
Ms. Han did much more than me.

931
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:48,535
Then why don't we get together tonight for a drink?

932
00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:51,534
Since the school trip is next week,

933
00:55:51,535 --> 00:55:54,444
we could also get closer to one another before we go.

934
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:58,674
The school trip is next week?

935
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:03,015
I see. See you.

936
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:14,365
Hey, Yul.

937
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:17,734
I am pressed for time.

938
00:56:18,394 --> 00:56:20,464
Uncle, please, just once.

939
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:22,964
We won't bother you. Please, just once.

940
00:56:23,064 --> 00:56:25,333
Just this once, please?

941
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:26,874
You want to bring Cocoa to our house?

942
00:56:26,935 --> 00:56:28,374
Yes, just during night.

943
00:56:28,874 --> 00:56:30,574
I don't know if there's a ghost in their house,

944
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:32,015
but Cocoa barks all night long.

945
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:34,144
They received complaints, and the cops came...

946
00:56:35,615 --> 00:56:37,144
Are you sure it'll be fine at our house?

947
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:38,314
Well, of course.

948
00:56:38,814 --> 00:56:41,285
He asked me to sleep with Cocoa for just a few days until they move.

949
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:44,524
Uncle, who is Cocoa?

950
00:56:45,095 --> 00:56:48,165
The dog that saved you from danger.

951
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:55,035
Fine,

952
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:57,504
but you have to sleep with her in your room.

953
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:00,274
Don't bring her out of your room. Got that?

954
00:57:00,944 --> 00:57:02,274
Of course.

955
00:57:05,975 --> 00:57:07,044
Is this the right place?

956
00:57:07,785 --> 00:57:09,084
- He's right there. - Yes.

957
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:17,825
- Ms. Han! - Be quiet.

958
00:57:19,095 --> 00:57:20,354
The plan is simple.

959
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:22,563
- Wake Math up at 3am. - Wake him up.

960
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,793
While he's half-asleep, she'll kiss him.

961
00:57:23,794 --> 00:57:24,994
Kiss him.

962
00:57:24,995 --> 00:57:26,334
- Then she'll leave. - She'll leave.

963
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:29,104
If the plan fails, you will return her to us at 5am.

964
00:57:29,265 --> 00:57:30,904
- Do you understand? - Yes, I understand!

965
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,035
Be quiet.

966
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:33,805
Here.

967
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:35,444
Ms. Han.

968
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:38,714
- Hae Na, you got this. - Stay calm.

969
00:57:38,745 --> 00:57:40,774
- You got this. - Good luck.

970
00:57:40,984 --> 00:57:43,285
- Oh, no. I'm so worried. - It's okay.

971
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:45,254
- I'm so worried. - Gosh. Me too.

972
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:48,685
- Good luck. You can do it. - Good luck.

973
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:52,554
- I'm nervous for her. - Shut it. You're making me nervous.

974
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:53,655
- Gosh. - That hurt.

975
00:57:55,464 --> 00:57:57,464
(Energy Drink)

976
00:59:02,524 --> 00:59:04,734
(Awaken Gum)

977
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:40,935
Darn it. I can't believe this.

978
00:59:59,214 --> 01:00:00,415
Hey, Yul.

979
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:06,325
Where are you going so early in the morning?

980
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:58,475
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

981
01:00:59,015 --> 01:01:02,814
Do you have no intentions of becoming friendly with dogs?

982
01:01:03,444 --> 01:01:05,114
She's a returning student who's three years older than us.

983
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:06,483
She is possessed.

984
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:08,084
She is right on the nose about things.

985
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:09,225
Be careful.

986
01:01:09,226 --> 01:01:11,495
You keep being entangled with a dog that has a story.

987
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,024
You have to stay on your toes.

988
01:01:14,194 --> 01:01:16,124
Don't get caught by anyone.

989
01:01:16,294 --> 01:01:17,825
Don't you think they'll start dating?

990
01:01:18,435 --> 01:01:20,865
They changed their night watch time so they could be partners.

991
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,205
Han Yu Na's sister?

992
01:01:23,734 --> 01:01:24,805
Interesting.

993
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:26,404
Ms. Han isn't here yet?

994
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:27,534
Ms. Han.

995
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:29,644
We need to find her quick. This is bad.

996
01:01:31,274 --> 01:01:32,274
Mr. Jin!
