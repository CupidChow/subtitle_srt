(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,189
What happened?

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,648
I thought my memories were going to be erased.

11
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,819
Isn't it up to me whose memories I erase?

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,718
You said you could start over even if the memories were gone.

13
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,729
Thank you.

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,289
How about some meat and soju for dinner?

15
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,359
Just the two of us? You and me?

This is my handwriting.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,429
Hey, I told you to stop...

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,169
Ms. Han. I like you.

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,808
I'm sorry. I like someone else.

21
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,838
Stop. Everything you're doing right now.

22
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,140
Do you now realize...

23
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,508
what was stolen from you?

24
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,309
Mr. Jin, what are you doing?

25
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:20,648
Ms. Han, is it true?

26
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,249
Is it true that you and Mr. Lee are dating?

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,779
You have a knack for tailing me.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm good at everything.

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,349
Why do you want to go there?

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,058
She said she wanted to experience her past life.

31
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:30,220
By yourself? No, you can't. It's too dangerous.

32
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,530
Are you going to Seohae over the weekend?

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,860
Do you want to go?

34
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,659
Where did you get that?

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
Someone gave it to me.

36
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,668
I miss her.

37
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,100
She's close by, but she must've forgotten about me.

38
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,369
Do you think she'll like me again?

39
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,038
What did you mean...

40
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,270
when you said my uncle is probably lonely?

41
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,639
His girlfriend lost her memories of him.

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,708
Hey, Yul.

43
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,349
Can you hurry over to my house right now?

44
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,350
It's urgent.

45
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,049
All right, then. Can you send me your address?

46
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,479
I'll go as fast as I can.

47
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,850
Mr. Jin.

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,648
Uncle, Ji A told me everything.

49
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,119
Don't worry. I'll help you out.

50
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,169
It's my first time coming here, right?

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,410
I don't know how this might sound to you,

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,449
but it feels like I've been here before.

53
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,859
I feel strange these days.

54
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,359
My head...

55
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,299
and my heart...

56
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:44,900
disagree.

57
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,299
These days,

58
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,410
I feel confused about my feelings.

59
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:54,810
Do you want me...

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,410
to show you?

61
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,350
Yes.

62
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,819
Now!

63
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,499
Now!

64
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,869
You guys kissed?

65
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,909
(Episode 13)

66
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,910
Already?

67
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,679
But how come you haven't changed?

68
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:41,979
You haven't turned into a dog.

69
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,950
You're still in your human form.

70
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,749
Right? I don't get it either.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,890
Why haven't I changed?

72
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,460
You broke the curse a while back.

73
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
With...

74
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,229
Math.

75
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,529
Uncle, what are you talking about?

76
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,168
What do you mean Math helped her break the curse?

77
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,629
She's dating History.

78
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,200
What? Am I mistaken?

79
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,070
Uncle, you're still so out of it.

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,450
Or maybe she simply doesn't know what a real kiss is.

81
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,178
You know, when two people's lips meet,

82
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,149
that soft, cushiony feeling...

83
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,319
You know what I'm talking about.

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,219
My gosh, that feeling.

85
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,589
But then again, what would she even know?

86
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,659
If she doesn't turn into a dog after kissing someone,

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,188
what's the point of... Gosh, it makes no sense.

88
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:28,428
I'm telling you. She doesn't even know what a kiss is.

89
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,760
They didn't actually kiss.

90
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,569
Mr. Jin, about earlier...

91
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,970
(Mr. Jin, about earlier...)

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,739
I like you.

93
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,910
Do you want to go?

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,679
Over the weekend to Seohae.

95
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,650
Do you think...

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,650
she'll like me again?

97
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,129
These days,

98
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,200
I feel confused about my feelings.

99
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,520
- Mr. Jin, hello. - Hello.

100
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,200
Mr. Jin.

101
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,559
Hello.

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,969
- Hello. - Hello!

103
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,200
Ms. Han, you're so pretty.

104
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:47,739
- Hello. - Hello.

105
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,010
- Hello. - Hello.

106
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,210
- Hello. - Hello, Ms. Han.

107
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,710
Hello.

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,470
If it's -1, it becomes 28. If it's -2, it should be 250.

109
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,668
So if it's 3, the answer should be 29.

110
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,270
- That's right. - My gosh, Mr. Jin.

111
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,169
I totally get it now.

112
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,978
I'll come and find you if I have more questions.

113
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,140
- Sure. - Thank you.

114
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,950
How am I supposed to face him?

115
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:41,559
Are you avoiding me?

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,359
Please don't avoid me.

117
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,169
It hurts my feelings.

118
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,369
Well, it's just...

119
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,010
I know it's probably confusing and hard at the moment,

120
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,080
but I'll wait.

121
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,879
Until you find your missing piece.

122
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,160
Until you figure out how you really feel.

123
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,160
In any case,

124
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,830
don't avoid me.

125
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,179
My missing piece?

126
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,638
(Teacher Hae Na)

127
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,680
My gosh.

128
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,950
Hae Na really is a teacher.

129
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,220
(Han Hae Na, we love you!)

130
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,859
(Dear my Korean teacher)

131
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,340
(Seo Hae Couple)

132
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,879
Look at this.

133
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,080
I was right, after all.

134
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,019
Yes, hi.

135
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,259
I'm at your school now.

136
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,059
I need to show you something. Come to the schoolyard after your class.

137
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Excuse me.

138
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,170
You can't come in here unless you're a student or work here.

139
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,879
I smell a dog.

140
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,549
I'm here to see Han Hae Na, the teacher.

141
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,649
Do you know where I can find her?

142
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,618
Ms. Han Hae Na?

143
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,690
Oh, let me explain.

144
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,960
She's my niece.

145
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,600
(Seo Hae Couple)

146
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,509
I see. You're here to see Ms. Han.

147
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,580
Look.

148
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,210
This. Do you want this?

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,249
Are you a fan of stuff like this?

150
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,379
Here, I've got something else for you.

151
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,850
I have this too. This is my all-time favourite.

152
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,359
There's plenty more over there.

153
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,190
Shall we go over there, then? Come with me.

154
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,999
Hey, didn't the vice principal give you that thing?

155
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,909
You should wear it when you have a date.

156
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,139
He said it was very helpful for couples.

157
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,950
So? Is the relationship progressing?

158
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Well, that's...

159
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh, right. Is Mr. Lee okay with it?

160
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,888
- What? - You know what I'm talking about.

161
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,430
A relationship without kissing.

162
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
I haven't asked him.

163
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,170
But...

164
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,239
I think I'm okay with it now.

165
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,070
You were so against it. Why did you change your mind?

166
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,540
I'm not really sure.

167
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,979
You broke the curse a while back.

168
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,350
With Math.

169
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,190
"Seo Hae Couple?"

170
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,060
This is my handwriting.

171
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,629
I said I'd go straight to you without getting lost at all,

172
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,970
but I'm afraid I'd get a little lost.

173
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,569
There was a dog...

174
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,300
named Cocoa who looked like this doll.

175
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,409
She's close by,

176
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,609
but she must've forgotten about me.

177
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,790
I was afraid Ms. Han would regain her lost memories.

178
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,830
So I did that to scare her a little.

179
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,499
Didn't I do the right thing?

180
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,970
Gosh.

181
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,369
Should I not have done that?

182
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,378
(I'm in trouble.)

183
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,179
(My voice sounds strange.)

184
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,408
(The jerk who changed my voice like this.)

185
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:36,550
(I must find him as soon as possible.)

186
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,590
Forward.

187
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Good.

188
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,029
(That skinny jerk who looks like a fox.)

189
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,470
(He must still be somewhere on the school grounds.)

190
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,470
(Help me get my voice back!)

191
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,100
Uncle!

192
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Uncle.

193
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,810
Uncle, are you all right?

194
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,479
(Hae Na!)

195
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,550
What?

196
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,449
Uncle, speak.

197
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,320
Why are you barking like this, all of a sudden?

198
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,220
(What should I do?)

199
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,389
What on earth is he trying to say?

200
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,359
Uncle, you have your phone on you, right?

201
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,600
Type it out and show me.

202
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840
You forgot how to write?

203
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,470
What happened?

204
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,350
Where did you get this?

205
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,319
(It was him, this jerk!)

206
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
(I snatched this from him and ran away.)

207
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,320
This man...

208
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,119
took your voice away?

209
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,159
Why did the vice principal do such a thing?

210
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,158
Goodness. Okay, Uncle.

211
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,729
I'll ask the vice principal.

212
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,769
Do you think you can go home alone?

213
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,239
All right, then. I will ask the vice principal.

214
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,670
(Good luck!)

215
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:15,909
Yes, I got this.

216
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,409
(Vice Principal)

217
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,580
(Seo Hae Couple)

218
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,989
I'll wait.

219
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:08,899
Until you find your missing piece.

220
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,899
Until you figure out how you really feel.

221
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,550
Why are you doing this to me?

222
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,020
Why are you messing with my family?

223
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,429
You asked me why I was doing this.

224
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,270
The choice you made.

225
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,439
Make your choice.

226
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:53,240
Will you break the family's curse?

227
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,010
Or will you choose your beautiful love over it?

228
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,679
It's all because of...

229
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,090
your cruel, selfish choice.

230
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:09,060
Now...

231
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,119
and back then too.

232
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,909
My choice?

233
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,409
What do you mean?

234
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,119
You abandoned Jin Seo Won.

235
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,149
So Mr. Jin...

236
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:42,889
and I...

237
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,129
That's why my uncle turned back into his human form.

238
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,629
But how do you know...

239
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:01,980
I want it all back.

240
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,179
I want my lost memories back.

241
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:10,949
Memories of what?

242
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,589
How Mr. Jin and I...

243
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,850
Your memories of the Young Lady you served and grew up with?

244
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,889
Or how you pushed her to the edge of a cliff?

245
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,159
What are you talking about?

246
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,869
I suppose oblivion...

247
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:34,469
is a blessing to you, not a curse.

248
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,350
I still remember it so vividly.

249
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,480
Her pretty, rosy cheeks...

250
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,820
turned pale in an instant.

251
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,530
The blood oozing from the wound.

252
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,730
On that cold soil,

253
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,770
the blood quickly lost its warmth.

254
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,980
Come to that place.

255
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,850
Find that soil.

256
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,790
In that mountain.

257
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,719
Oblivion seems to be a blessing to you.

258
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,189
I'll take that blessing away from you at that very spot.

259
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:29,929
Okay, I'll go to that place.

260
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,600
I will go back and turn it back.

261
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,240
To me, oblivion...

262
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,740
is a horrible curse, not a blessing.

263
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,549
I don't know what you're thinking,

264
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,409
but it will not go as you think.

265
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,119
We might be distant for a while,

266
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,189
but we will meet again in the end.

267
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,669
That's why you abandoned it.

268
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,080
You abandoned the green forest because of the girl who died.

269
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,780
Only to dance with a sword like an executioner here.

270
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,820
Cho Young.

271
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,719
You and I...

272
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,500
were over a long time ago.

273
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:49,100
Those who sinned were born again...

274
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,139
and want to love again.

275
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,649
No matter how much I curse them and erase their memories,

276
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,359
they want to love again...

277
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,129
persistently.

278
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,469
Even if they die and fall into a fire pit,

279
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,909
will they stay the same?

280
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,459
(Don't slam the door.)

281
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,570
- Guys, it's this classroom. - It's hilarious.

282
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,368
- What is it? - Oh, my gosh.

283
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,669
- Hi. - Are you recording?

284
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,968
- What are you filming? - What's the video for?

285
00:24:00,969 --> 00:24:02,010
- Hey, look. - What's this?

286
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,779
- Hi. - Hello.

287
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,449
We decided to go to an expert who can advise us.

288
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,619
- What is it? - What are you doing?

289
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,090
What is it? Are you filming Ji A?

290
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,330
Our club wants to make a video about a horror story.

291
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,800
There's an abandoned haunted house in Mount Hyungi.

292
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,230
Who said...

293
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,030
that there's something like that in the mountain?

294
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,899
Actually, the vice principal recommended the place.

295
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,509
He said we would capture something incredible.

296
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,070
Did he tell you to take me with you?

297
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:38,609
No. It was our idea to recruit you.

298
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,980
It's okay. It's not dangerous at all.

299
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,178
Ms. Han will accompany us too.

300
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,750
- Ms. Han? - Yes.

301
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,760
- Mount Hyungi? - The vice principal has been there.

302
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,030
All right. I'll go and help you.

303
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,090
Thank you, Ms. Han.

304
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,230
Ji A, where are you going?

305
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,840
Ji A.

306
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:13,949
Why are you going there?

307
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,409
Don't follow me.

308
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,209
I think...

309
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,949
Mr. Lee is preparing for the end.

310
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,750
The end?

311
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:56,719
I'm saying that erasing Ms. Han's memory...

312
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,659
isn't the end.

313
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:02,330
What more is he planning to do?

314
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,159
Ms. Han...

315
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,330
shouldn't go there with the students.

316
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,770
Mount Hyungi.

317
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,270
It's the place Mr. Lee purified as a mountain spirit.

318
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,179
And it's where I died in my previous life.

319
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,708
Previous life?

320
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:24,919
I saw you and Ms. Han in your previous life for a moment.

321
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,449
I didn't know why I saw it at that time.

322
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,189
The deep shadow of the past life...

323
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,030
is cast in the present life.

324
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,530
On all of us.

325
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,500
You just keep going forward.

326
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:48,270
What about you?

327
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,179
I need to know...

328
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,750
what this shadow wants to tell me.

329
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,260
(Ms. Han)

330
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,149
I'll go.

331
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:31,949
To Seohae.

332
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,490
You wanted to go Seohae before.

333
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,730
But why is it Seohae of all places?

334
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,129
Because we...

335
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,500
are Seo Hae Couple?

336
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:53,010
It was written on the calendar.

337
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,439
Thinking about it, that's the only answer.

338
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,280
You were so sweet to the point that it felt strange.

339
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,320
But it wasn't unfamiliar to me at all.

340
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,090
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:15,560
It was too late when I knew it.

342
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,129
It's not too late.

343
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,770
So...

344
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,240
come slowly.

345
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,840
And don't fall.

346
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:35,980
Before that,

347
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,980
I should go somewhere.

348
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:41,520
I want to find...

349
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,359
missing pieces there.

350
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,060
You don't have to find them.

351
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,399
We can start over.

352
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,500
Don't go.

353
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,840
I really want to make a choice for ourselves this time.

354
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,570
I'll go with you then.

355
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,878
It's scary.

356
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,448
- It's scary. What? - It's strange.

357
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:07,708
- I don't want to go. I'm not going. - Stop!

358
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,178
Don't make a fuss. You're making me scared too.

359
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,279
I know.

360
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,619
- It can't be true, right? - Oh, Ms. Han.

361
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,218
Hi, guys.

362
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,619
- Hello. - Hello.

363
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,919
Everyone is here, right? Let's go.

364
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:20,729
Did you bring a chocolate bar and a cucumber?

365
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,289
I even brought ssamjang.

366
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,499
You're well prepared.

367
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,659
Hurry up and come.

368
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,040
We've finally arrived.

369
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:39,079
It's a little spooky.

370
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,050
Let me go a little closer.

371
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:57,760
- Oh, my goodness! - Gosh.

372
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,830
We are going to die.

373
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,898
Hey, you scared me.

374
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,168
Why did we come here?

375
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,169
Are you okay?

376
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,800
Hey, stick with her.

377
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,740
I think it looks too dark on camera.

378
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,709
But it doesn't have the eerie vibe when it's bright.

379
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,949
Is it recording well?

380
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,550
- Yes. - Yes.

381
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,820
Why did you follow us here?

382
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,260
Uncle.

383
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:30,060
I...

384
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:32,830
have to protect someone.

385
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,699
Ji A.

386
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,369
There...

387
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:41,969
is nothing here, right?

388
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:50,080
He's hanging even when he's dead.

389
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
What?

390
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,459
Oh, he opened his eyes.

391
00:30:58,219 --> 00:30:59,330
He's looking at us.

392
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:00,759
Stop lying.

393
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,289
- Hey. - Hey.

394
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,560
She's lying.

395
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:08,698
- Guys. - Hey.

396
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:09,939
Out of my way.

397
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,199
Hey.

398
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,310
- Guys. - Hey!

399
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Guys.

400
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,310
Where are you?

401
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,800
Guys.

402
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,939
Don't worry, Ji A.

403
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,369
I'll protect you.

404
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm not scared of ghosts.

405
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,449
He's not a ghost.

406
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,879
He's a fox.

407
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:57,250
What?

408
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
The vice principal.

409
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,520
Those guys.

410
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:04,990
I told you it was incredible.

411
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,230
Here we go again.

412
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,169
Cover your ears.

413
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,609
Cover my ears?

414
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,840
Ms. Han.

415
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:28,810
Mr. Jin.

416
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,649
Are you hurt?

417
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,689
I sprained my ankle a little when I almost slipped earlier.

418
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,689
No, it's fine. It's not that bad.

419
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,359
It's a relief.

420
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,129
I was worried.

421
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,760
Can you walk?

422
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,439
I lost...

423
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:56,040
something very precious.

424
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:03,719
Do you...

425
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,350
remember something?

426
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,419
Well...

427
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,990
Maybe for about five seconds?

428
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,560
Look at you.

429
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:16,959
You're this sad about five seconds of memory.

430
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,469
What will you do when you remember everything then?

431
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:24,000
Do you not resent me?

432
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,669
I don't.

433
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,340
Apparently, it was my choice.

434
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,310
It was mine as well.

435
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,990
Gosh, where is everyone?

436
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,040
I think we passed by this spot before.

437
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,049
Oh, right.

438
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,850
It was me, right?

439
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,719
Cocoa.

440
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,460
Did I look that cute to you?

441
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:56,560
Of course.

442
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:58,659
When did you think I was cute?

443
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:01,569
Always.

444
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,939
You must've lifted the curse easily then.

445
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,639
It must've been an instant because I was cute.

446
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:10,480
It wasn't easy.

447
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,310
I...

448
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,409
am scared of dogs.

449
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Why?

450
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,719
Is it weird?

451
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,389
Neither of us is weird.

452
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,529
That's just how we are.

453
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:02,560
Mr. Jin. I can't run anymore.

454
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,960
Mr. Lee.

455
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,159
My lord.

456
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:39,230
You show up every time I am standing on the cliff.

457
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,799
You have so much time,

458
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,339
Mr. Mountain Spirit.

459
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,779
You said we should go to the sea.

460
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,409
But here we met in the mountains again.

461
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:01,889
Cho Young.

462
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
How...

463
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,690
have you been?

464
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:47,969
The evening glow...

465
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,440
is cast on your face.

466
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,569
You will disappear in the end...

467
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,139
leaving all these memories only.

468
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:36,409
Like the sun that disappears after the evening glow.

469
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,889
Like the waves that come and go.

470
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,589
Your momentary life will also disappear in the end.

471
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,699
I do not want to hurt you even one bit, my lord.

472
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,799
However,

473
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,670
if I go into your heart and disappear,

474
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,400
I will leave a scratch in the end.

475
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:01,509
Even tens of thousands of wishing lanterns...

476
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,509
will not be able to stop it.

477
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,279
Do you still want to come into my heart?

478
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:11,449
Do you still want me to come into your heart?

479
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,150
We are just fooling around.

480
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,360
Let me go into your heart just for a moment.

481
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:21,029
Fine.

482
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,029
No one can stop you when you are being stubborn.

483
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,810
I...

484
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,639
I know where Lady Cho Young is.

485
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,889
If you lie to me,

486
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,230
you will not be safe.

487
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:55,630
Where is she?

488
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,000
Say it right now.

489
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,380
I do not know anything.

490
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:14,580
I know nothing.

491
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:23,759
Please spare my life.

492
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:25,659
I...

493
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,589
am pregnant.

494
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,299
Please save me.

495
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,980
I...

496
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,719
will bring her...

497
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:54,889
to the village myself.

498
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,469
That...

499
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,569
Where did you bring that from?

500
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,310
A female servant was here.

501
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,210
Where is she right now?

502
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,750
Is she safe?

503
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,080
She returned for now,

504
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,889
but something feels ominous.

505
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,389
Young Sun.

506
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,389
I need to get out of here.

507
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,569
That female servant...

508
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,429
was pregnant.

509
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,810
My lord.

510
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:54,778
Thank you...

511
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,819
for paying for my mother's medicine for three years.

512
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,520
Now we are even.

513
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,089
My lady.

514
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,589
My lady. You must leave now.

515
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:56,440
Duk Gu.

516
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,080
Where did she go?

517
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,269
My lady.

518
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,369
Mak Soon.

519
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,908
Drag her out.

520
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,009
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

521
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,380
Do not come after us.

522
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,449
Are you all right?

523
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:48,749
Get them!

524
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,850
Go!

525
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,029
- Get them! - Get them!

526
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,199
Stop them!

527
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:08,429
Release!

528
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:03,690
My lady.

529
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,860
My lady.

530
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,299
Mak Soon.

531
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,400
My baby is gone.

532
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,839
But we can save your baby.

533
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,279
I must die...

534
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,679
for everyone to live.

535
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:32,779
So...

536
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,420
I will save all of you.

537
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:36,920
No.

538
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,389
No, my lady.

539
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,289
My lady.

540
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,290
My lady!

541
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,199
My lord.

542
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,639
Mak Soon.

543
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,850
Have I been...

544
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,790
at least somewhat sweet to you?

545
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,759
Will you...

546
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,130
be able to tell our child...

547
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,600
that I had been a sweet man?

548
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:01,839
Yes.

549
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:06,139
I see.

550
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,310
That is all I need to hear.

551
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:12,520
No.

552
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,850
No, my lord. You cannot leave me.

553
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,089
No!

554
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:23,230
Mak Soon!

555
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,830
Let us go down now.

556
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,900
- All right. - Gosh. Oh, my back.

557
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,659
Let us meet again.

558
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,360
That is all I ask.

559
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,670
I only wish to see you again.

560
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,239
Even when this life is over,

561
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,380
I just wish...

562
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:19,819
to see you again.

563
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,880
Was that your decision?

564
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,089
I am asking if you plunged yourself into the sword.

565
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:31,290
Was it truly your decision to throw away your life...

566
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,960
and to abandon me?

567
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,190
I wanted to save her baby.

568
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,429
My baby never had the chance...

569
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:44,170
to enjoy a ray of sunshine or hear a whisper of the wind.

570
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:47,909
I did it for my baby's sake.

571
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,889
Had you not considered me in that brief moment...

572
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,589
you made your decision?

573
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,299
It flew up high indeed.

574
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,369
I mean, the kite you cut off.

575
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:22,940
That kite crossed my mind.

576
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:27,650
Had I known that I would end up being the sword,

577
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:31,850
cutting your heart...

578
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,889
into pieces,

579
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,389
like that kite,

580
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,489
I would have...

581
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,299
cut off my feelings for you in the first place.

582
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,929
That crossed my mind.

583
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,190
Will you go even without saying goodbye?

584
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,799
Duk Gu's father.

585
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:26,139
The sunset glow on your face...

586
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:30,469
was quite beautiful.

587
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:37,049
Will you allow me to see it one more time?

588
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,699
Our playtime is over.

589
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,040
It brought us pain...

590
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,750
and tears.

591
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,049
But it also made us laugh...

592
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,219
and was fun.

593
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:20,989
So you must now...

594
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,460
return home.

595
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:15,770
Where are you going?

596
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:18,610
Come here.

597
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,770
Mr. Jin.

598
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,480
Ms. Han?

599
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,388
What's this?

600
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,420
What?

601
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:08,630
Hey, it's a little dog.

602
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,060
Didn't he tell you to grab the seat like this...

603
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,670
and look manly when driving in reverse?

604
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:41,360
Are you all right?

605
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:44,900
How many caps do you plan on piling up?

606
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,549
This is nice.

607
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,549
So I am...

608
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:12,360
Guess what my colour is when I change.

609
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,020
No matter what colour you are,

610
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,360
I'm sure you'll still look pretty.

611
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,469
Are you okay?

612
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:24,639
You jerk.

613
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,139
Ms. Han!

614
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,270
Wait.

615
00:58:43,889 --> 00:58:45,319
- Mr. Jin. - What do you mean?

616
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,339
It's been a while since I ran as hard as this.

617
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:43,080
I ran as hard as I could after the first time...

618
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:47,480
I kissed you.

619
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:04,639
I missed you.

620
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,080
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

621
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,310
Thank you...

622
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,920
for coming to me as a present.

623
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
What's that?

624
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:54,250
A website for secondhand items.

625
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,749
The vice principal left behind a board game.

626
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,089
- Wait! - I put it up online.

627
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,759
- To sell it? - No.

628
01:00:58,889 --> 01:00:59,960
To find it.

629
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,130
There are only ten days left.

630
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,460
I'm talking about Mr. Jin's birthday.

631
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:05,258
He made me feel incredibly happy...

632
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:06,330
and caught me by surprise.

633
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,130
I want to go above and beyond to do what he did for me.

634
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:10,799
There's a teacher named Mr. Jin Seo Won, right?

635
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,739
Are you really going on that dating show?

636
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,869
People from the previous season of that show were so impressive.

637
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,270
Are you a fool?

638
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:18,540
Why can't you speak up?
