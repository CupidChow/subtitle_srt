(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,919
My family has a secret.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,589
When I kiss a man,

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,648
I turn into a dog.

12
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:54,919
When is she going to turn back?

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,218
At 6am.

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,329
Then she will turn into a dog at midnight.

15
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:59,389
By the way,

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,060
why on earth do you hate me?

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,959
Why do you feel uncomfortable around me?

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,770
It's because whenever I'm with you...

19
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,429
Anyway, it's true that I avoided you because I felt uncomfortable,

20
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:08,800
but it's not because I don't like you.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,669
(Yu Na: You have 5 minutes left. Get out of there.)

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,169
Gosh. I need to step out for a second. Please excuse me.

23
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,978
The only way to break this darned curse.

24
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,910
I must kiss this man again today.

25
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,280
This time, as a dog.

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,410
What?

27
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:21,520
What's wrong with him?

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,418
No way.

29
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:24,789
He's afraid of dogs?

30
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,990
Seriously, what should I do now?

31
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,190
Won.

32
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,020
You haven't forgotten about our date after work today, right?

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,558
Then if you've decided to help me,

34
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,330
how about we meet up regularly so you can give me some pointers?

35
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,330
Just one beer. Please?

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,199
Can you not hear me?

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,940
How many times do I have to say no?

38
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,538
What are you, a nutcracker?

39
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,569
You keep picking on me and at me over and over!

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,739
Hey, didn't you say...

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,308
he was scared of dogs?

42
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,509
But think about it.

43
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,279
All kinds of dogs from the area must circle around her.

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,479
You're students. You shouldn't be smoking in front of our school.

45
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,050
Hey, what are your names?

46
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,250
We should touch hers and call it even.

47
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,589
She asked you what your names were.

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,859
Are you feeling better?

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,529
I was a bit startled this morning.

50
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,729
But I'm all right now.

51
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,530
Sorry about yesterday.

52
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,859
I was sorry too.

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,898
Now that I think about it,

54
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,069
it was only natural for you to misunderstand.

55
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,299
I don't know what it is,

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,799
but if it's hard to talk about,

57
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,569
you don't have to tell me.

58
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,478
Everyone has their own story,

59
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,749
and we can all have a secret we keep inside our hearts.

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,179
Is this Ms. Han Hae Na,

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,619
- a teacher at Garam High School? - Ms. Han.

62
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,078
I think the buses have stopped running.

63
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,079
I'll get going.

64
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,850
Hello? Woo Taek, I'm in big trouble right now.

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,030
Why are you still here?

66
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,660
How can a person change into a dog?

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,229
Do you live by yourself, Ms. Han?

68
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,169
I think your family will be worried.

69
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,639
How do I get out of here?

70
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:50,539
First, I'll wait until it's 6am.

71
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,370
Then when I turn back into my human form, I'll leave.

72
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,409
I can't fall asleep, no matter what. I can't fall...

73
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,809
What now? What am I going to do now?

74
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,949
Can you explain what's going on here right now?

75
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,048
He found out?

76
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,380
Your student found out?

77
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,719
There's more.

78
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,889
He's the nephew of the math teacher.

79
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,689
Hey, don't you think it's bizarre?

80
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,719
It sure is unusual,

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,859
but I didn't think it was bizarre.

82
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,419
You looked so cute.

83
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,359
Why do we have a dog here?

84
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,459
That's Mandeuk.

85
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,859
He's going to stay here for the day.

86
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,600
Thank you for today.

87
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,729
I know you helped me in various ways.

88
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,970
Was it that obvious?

89
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,469
You probably think I'm weird.

90
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,568
We're not weirdos.

91
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,809
It's just the way we are.

92
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,108
What's this?

93
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,409
I thought that maybe if you kept that,

94
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,109
it would help you build up an immunity against dogs.

95
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,079
You see, you can't change like that.

96
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,279
Playing innocent to my face...

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,418
and wagging your tail behind my back.

98
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,489
Be careful.

99
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,060
Who cares if they date?

100
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,529
Why do you live in a place like this?

101
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,559
I don't know what I was in my previous lifetime,

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,900
but I just love to be around nature.

103
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,460
I'll go home when I'm done.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,030
A wedding invitation?

105
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,999
Should we get them a present?

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,899
Could you two get something?

107
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,340
I'd like to drop by a pharmacy.

108
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,609
I get really sick when I take an express bus.

109
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,310
Would you like to go by my car, then?

110
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,910
I won't let that happen.

111
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,679
This weekend, shall we carpool to the wedding?

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
Are you happy now?

113
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:07,949
- Hello. - What are you doing here,

114
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:08,949
Ms. Cheon?

115
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,649
I'm taking Ms. Han's spot.

116
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,750
Did I make you wait?

117
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,859
Today, you look really...

118
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:15,960
awesome.

119
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,430
Shall we go?

120
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:24,829
(Yoon invited Han, Lee, Jin.)

121
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,970
Here's the carpool group chat.

122
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,400
Drop a text when you're nearby.

123
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,539
(Episode 4)

124
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,609
Well,

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,210
Ms. Han.

126
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,049
Are you going to get a ride from Bo Gyeom instead?

127
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,950
Well, she said everyone was going in one car.

128
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,118
Well,

129
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,419
don't get the wrong idea, please.

130
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,089
The thing is,

131
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,918
Bo Gyeom likes to sleep in.

132
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,090
So he's often late to his meetings.

133
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,729
Being 30 minutes late is a given. I've waited for him up to 1 hour.

134
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,030
You're making a long trip.

135
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,660
You can't miss the wedding.

136
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,260
Right.

137
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,970
If you still want to go with Bo Gyeom after knowing this,

138
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,400
I won't stop you any longer.

139
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,169
I won't get a ride from him then.

140
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,710
I'll go with you.

141
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,738
I don't want...

142
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,539
to be late to the wedding either.

143
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:13,309
We will...

144
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,879
never be late to the wedding.

145
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,049
Okay.

146
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,890
Shall we?

147
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,520
- Sure. - Okay.

148
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,728
(The 1st Metropolitan Circular Expressway)

149
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,330
I thought they rented a bus for the teachers.

150
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,970
Why are you looking into the directions?

151
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,499
I'm going to drive there.

152
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,710
What? You'll drive?

153
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,010
Yes.

154
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,340
Why?

155
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,840
To attend the wedding.

156
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,109
But you're a novice driver.

157
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,650
What's today's day?

158
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:51,989
Thursday.

159
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,418
I have...

160
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,020
thirty-seven hours left.

161
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,600
Uncle,

162
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,129
you only have one life left too.

163
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,369
So you're getting a ride from Mr. Jin?

164
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,979
Yes.

165
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,539
Why? What about Mr. Lee?

166
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,379
Well,

167
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,320
Mr. Jin asked me to go with him first.

168
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,280
Why does that matter?

169
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,749
I'm a teacher, you know.

170
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,919
I should prioritize the promises I made first.

171
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,789
What does that have to do with being a teacher?

172
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,759
If you go with the guy you like, you'll be able to eat...

173
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,429
sausage and rice cake skewers at the rest stop...

174
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,340
and feed him...

175
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,868
when he's driving.

176
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,070
That's the perfect opportunity for that. Gosh.

177
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,938
The sausage and rice cake skewers?

178
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,780
You think they're tasty? I never liked them.

179
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,080
Something feels off here.

180
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,679
You're hiding something.

181
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,520
Gosh, I'm not hiding anything.

182
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,090
You must have had a change of heart.

183
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,220
- Do you like Mr. Jin now? - No.

184
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:09,160
Why are you brushing my hair in the middle of the night?

185
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,499
Gosh, I need to get a draft for that.

186
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,769
But why are you brushing my hair?

187
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,470
When I turn into a dog at night, you can brush my fur instead.

188
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,010
I think your hair turns into fur.

189
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:25,249
Yu Na.

190
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,619
Did you know you've been acting like Woo Taek lately?

191
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,349
Have you gone mad?

192
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,689
- Have you gone mad? - Hey.

193
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,659
You crossed the line when you said I had been acting like Woo Taek.

194
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,959
No! Be careful with your hair!

195
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,330
No! Be careful! Hey!

196
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,199
Hello. I'm the Tough Guy. Here's the video I prepared today.

197
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,928
It's how to look cool while driving.

198
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,769
That's what I'm going to teach you today.

199
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,599
Let's say you just got your driver's license,

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,799
but you're going on a date with a woman.

201
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,608
If she finds out that you're a novice driver,

202
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,938
your date won't go anywhere.

203
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,139
Then what should you do?

204
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,709
Here's the first tip and the most important tip.

205
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,179
You must lower the window first.

206
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,809
Lower the window first.

207
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,150
Then put your arm on the windowsill.

208
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,248
If you have a tattoo on your arm, that's great.

209
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,118
But a lot of you probably don't have a tattoo.

210
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,489
So you can wear a fake tattoo sleeve instead.

211
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:11,289
Flex your arm hard, so your tendon shows.

212
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:12,789
Then put it on the windowsill.

213
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,900
Doesn't this look cool? Then here's what she will think.

214
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,269
"Gosh, I want this guy to be mine."

215
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,129
That's what she'll think.

216
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,868
So you're done with the first step.

217
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,200
Here's the next step.

218
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,550
(Checking the system)

219
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,050
Are you happy now?

220
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,619
About what?

221
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,319
There she is. Hello.

222
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,420
Hello.

223
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,290
What are you doing here, Ms. Cheon?

224
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm taking Ms. Han's spot.

225
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,559
What?

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,729
I'll sit up front.

227
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,540
You're not coming, are you?

228
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,969
You go ahead.

229
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,840
I forgot something and can't join you.

230
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,340
What did she forget?

231
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,409
She'll be late if she doesn't leave now.

232
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,810
Did she forget something important?

233
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,350
Did I make you wait?

234
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,859
Oh, not really.

235
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,129
Today, you look really...

236
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,759
awesome.

237
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:09,070
Ms. Han, you also look...

238
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,239
Do I look like a pickled radish?

239
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,009
Yes.

240
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,950
Shall we go?

241
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,989
If we leave now, we should...

242
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,529
The windshield wiper...

243
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,159
All set.

244
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,779
Should I play some music?

245
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,739
Music?

246
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,479
Sure.

247
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,878
Here's the video I prepared today.

248
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,679
It's how to look cool while driving.

249
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,419
That's what I'm going to teach you today.

250
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
- Let's say you just got... - Why is this playing?

251
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
your driver's license,

252
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,460
- but you're going on a date... - Hold on.

253
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,858
Didn't he tell you to grab the seat...

254
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,389
like this and look manly when driving in reverse?

255
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,470
(Yul)

256
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,009
It's Yul.

257
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,810
- What is it? - Uncle.

258
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,638
Did you really get on the expressway?

259
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,810
No, not yet.

260
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,210
Hello, Yul.

261
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:01,720
What? Ms. Han, you're with him?

262
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,450
Ms. Han, get out!

263
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,220
He's never driven on an expressway before.

264
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,858
He got your driver's license only three months ago!

265
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:10,459
- Get out! - You've deviated from the path.

266
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,590
This isn't the path?

267
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:13,889
Re-routing the path.

268
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,060
You've deviated from the path.

269
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,830
- Re-routing the path. - Ms. Han! Get out of his car!

270
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,499
You might die!

271
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:22,970
Hey, I'm hanging up.

272
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,310
Is this not this way?

273
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,439
Re-routing the path.

274
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,580
Was I supposed to turn earlier?

275
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,220
Why am I having a hard time seeing the directions?

276
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,959
(From Seoul to Seosan, Starting the GPS guidance)

277
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,919
(Seoul)

278
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,330
(You've deviated from the path.)

279
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,229
(You've deviated from the path.)

280
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:50,528
(Seosan)

281
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,999
(You've reached your destination.)

282
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,440
You've reached your destination.

283
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,379
I will now end the GPS guidance.

284
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,519
We're here.

285
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,820
Are you all right?

286
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Of course.

287
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,289
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, no.

288
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,129
Driving here must have been tiring for you.

289
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,899
No, it must have been more tiring for you.

290
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,029
Should we get out?

291
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,739
Yes.

292
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,040
Let's check first.

293
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,779
I think we're late.

294
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,050
Shall we run?

295
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,889
Let's hurry.

296
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,070
Hold the door, please.

297
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,498
I guess we're not late.

298
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:30,700
(Garam High School)

299
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,999
How cute.

300
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,070
Ms. Han.

301
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,239
Here.

302
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,950
You look pretty.

303
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,148
Next,

304
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,119
the bride and groom will enter.

305
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,560
Please welcome them with a big round of applause and cheer.

306
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,659
I've come here to officiate the wedding.

307
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,628
But after seeing such a beautiful bride...

308
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,229
and a handsome groom up close,

309
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:42,769
I can't help but be amazed.

310
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,508
- Yoon Ji looks so beautiful today. - If you agree with me,

311
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,069
- She chose the perfect dress. - I will congratulate...

312
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,710
this good-looking couple...

313
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,408
- with all of my heart. - Gosh.

314
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,639
- I'm envious. - On that note,

315
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,550
- Find a good guy and marry him. - I will scream...

316
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,220
I wonder if any man will find someone like me lovable.

317
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,850
Next, we'll celebrate their matrimony with a song.

318
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,030
What?

319
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,869
Mr. Jin is going to sing today?

320
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,510
When you told me you loved me

321
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,750
And accepted me

322
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,250
I confidently said that

323
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,260
I couldn't have asked for more

324
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,260
But my growing desire

325
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,459
Brings shame to me

326
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:49,299
But I spend my day, thinking

327
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,439
And worrying about you

328
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,310
I can be quite jealous

329
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,310
I can easily get scared

330
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,349
I can't believe that you're smiling at me

331
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,320
Standing next to me

332
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:12,389
I am too elated

333
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,230
And too emotional

334
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,199
So I can't go to sleep because I'm worried that

335
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,340
Everything will disappear when I wake up

336
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,580
This is it.

337
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,010
- Thank you. - Okay.

338
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,919
You have given me the present of being with you

339
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,719
I love you

340
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,330
Thank you.

341
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,639
What? Is it over?

342
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,609
Gosh, Mr. Jin. What a surprise.

343
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,350
You were an amazing singer.

344
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,290
I sang because Mr. Bong asked me.

345
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:13,820
But I was a bit nervous.

346
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,959
No way. It didn't show at all.

347
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,790
Weren't you too late to listen to him sing?

348
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,090
No, I wasn't.

349
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,169
The bride and groom are here!

350
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,770
Dig in.

351
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,608
Look at you guys.

352
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,239
Look at you, Song Yi.

353
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,679
Thank you all for coming.

354
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,209
Our teacher couple is finally getting married.

355
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:41,609
Congratulations.

356
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,649
By the way,

357
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,418
you should all try dating someone from school.

358
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:45,590
It's quite a thrill.

359
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,049
Who knows?

360
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,719
Maybe, our school might have another teacher couple.

361
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,619
Goodness, Mr. Jin.

362
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,358
You were cooler than me.

363
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,389
Congratulations.

364
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,429
Since you're all here, you should check out the ocean. It's nearby.

365
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,429
- Sounds good. - Shall we?

366
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,499
We can have grilled clams too.

367
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,628
That sounds great.

368
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:02,699
Why don't we all go?

369
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,040
Mr. Jin.

370
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,438
Did you drive here?

371
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,540
Yes. Why do you ask?

372
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,980
- I have a favour to ask you. - Okay.

373
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,949
You'll find the life-sized cut out boards upstairs.

374
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:14,949
Can you put them in your car?

375
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,580
- Sure. - Thank you.

376
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:20,550
Mr. Jin.

377
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,520
Are you done with your meal?

378
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,219
Yes, I am.

379
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,459
Where are you going?

380
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,958
To my car.

381
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,199
Oh, really?

382
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,030
You see, something urgent has come up for me.

383
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,638
Can you please give me a ride to the terminal?

384
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:36,669
Now?

385
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,310
Yes, something urgent has come up.

386
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,840
Ms. Han. You'll come with us to check out the ocean, right?

387
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:43,280
Yes, sure thing.

388
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,949
My gosh. It's been years since the last time I saw the ocean.

389
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,379
- It'll be fun. - I know.

390
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,079
Gosh, I thought...

391
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,090
Mr. Jin?

392
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:57,189
Okay. Let's hurry, then.

393
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,389
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

394
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,868
- Are you drunk? - Where did Seo Won go?

395
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,270
Oh, I just saw him leave with Ms. Yoon.

396
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,439
What?

397
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,810
Ms. Yoon practically dragged him out as if she was arresting him.

398
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,310
I see.

399
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,750
Let me call Seo Won.

400
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:29,359
If they've left, we should just go without them.

401
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,729
Do you think I can squeeze in with the three of you in your car?

402
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,059
Yes, you can come with us.

403
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,929
I totally forgot that I had to go home to take my dog out for a walk.

404
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,350
Hello?

405
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,550
I heard you left with Ms. Yoon.

406
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,990
No, it's not that. Something urgent has come up for Ms. Yoon.

407
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,859
Then Ms. Han will come with me in my car.

408
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,199
Ms. Han, you can come with me!

409
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,270
The next bus won't leave until two hours later.

410
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,409
But you said it was urgent.

411
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,239
Let's just go to Seoul, then.

412
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,310
Really?

413
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,909
Thank you so much.

414
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,689
But is this the right way?

415
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,459
Mr. Jin, are you all right?

416
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,260
Gosh, there are so many cars...

417
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
- You've deviated from the path. - Oh, no.

418
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,938
Hold on. Let me make a U-turn first.

419
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:52,939
Okay.

420
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,279
- Are you all right? - Yes.

421
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,250
Re-routing the path.

422
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,300
How old were you when you saw the ocean for the very first time?

423
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,669
Was it when I was six years old?

424
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,869
I don't really remember.

425
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:31,010
When I saw the ocean for the first time, I was so fascinated.

426
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,209
I thought the high and low tides were fascinating too.

427
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,479
That's true. When the tide goes out,

428
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,520
it happens very quickly. I remember being surprised by it.

429
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,790
Yes.

430
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,159
Once, I sat and did nothing...

431
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,389
but watch the ocean for days.

432
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,260
Even as I was watching...

433
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,330
the tides coming in and out, I had no idea...

434
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,570
that the small moon up there was pulling the ocean.

435
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:00,709
If you were the moon,

436
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:03,310
would you feel that it's unfair?

437
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,250
Moving toward the ocean and away from it again...

438
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:09,580
regardless of your will...

439
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,750
because of something...

440
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,389
that you don't even know much about.

441
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,790
I've never thought of it that way.

442
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,199
But not moving at all...

443
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,429
would be boring.

444
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,770
It would be, right?

445
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,109
Let's go have some grilled clams.

446
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,919
Oh, I'm not really hungry right now.

447
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,888
Come on. Who eats grilled clams to fill themselves up?

448
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:48,148
People eat them to enjoy the beach vibes to the fullest.

449
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,389
Oh, I see.

450
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,990
All right. We got to see the ocean,

451
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,500
so let's hurry back to Seoul before the rush hour begins.

452
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,570
Okay.

453
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,290
You'll be pulled away from him sooner than you think,

454
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,290
regardless of your will.

455
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,590
Just like me.

456
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,520
You've reached your destination.

457
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,520
I will now end the GPS guidance.

458
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,290
We've arrived.

459
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,689
Are you all right?

460
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,790
Yes, I'm fine.

461
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,060
Oh, Mr. Jin.

462
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,530
You must be hungry. I'm hungry too.

463
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,040
Shall we have dinner together?

464
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,439
But you said you had to take care of something urgent.

465
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,209
It's already been sorted out.

466
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,649
My stomach is a little upset right now.

467
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,350
Well, then we'll have dinner together another time.

468
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,790
Thank you.

469
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,639
(Group Chat)

470
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,520
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

471
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,990
Ms. Han, did you get home safely?

472
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,719
Sorry about today.

473
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,418
Something urgent came up for Ms. Yoon.

474
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:39,629
What was the urgent matter...

475
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,100
(Mr. Jin Seo Won)

476
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,240
Don't worry about it. Thank you for today.

477
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:57,179
(Don't worry about it. Thank you for today.)

478
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,750
Whatever, I don't know.

479
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,179
What don't you know?

480
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,050
Whatever, everything.

481
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,320
Hey, so I did some thinking.

482
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,919
You should get some help from that student.

483
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,560
- Who? - Math's nephew.

484
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,260
You said they lived together.

485
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:20,030
How exactly could he help me? And why would I ask him for help?

486
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,699
Well, it's simple.

487
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,339
All he has to do is secretly put you in Math's room.

488
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,368
Math would be asleep.

489
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:28,569
Walk up to him in your dog form, kiss him,

490
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,340
and leave the room in your human form.

491
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,709
Okay?

492
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,820
But the thing is,

493
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,419
how shall I bring it up to him?

494
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:44,658
Well, he already knows your secret anyway. Just ask him.

495
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:45,760
But then,

496
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,959
I'd have to tell him about the kiss too.

497
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,459
Tell him.

498
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,269
Gosh, then he'll lose all his respect for me.

499
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,099
His homeroom teacher got drunk and kissed his uncle.

500
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,469
My gosh. I'm so embarrassed.

501
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,868
Hey, what's better? Being embarrassed for a moment?

502
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,939
- Or living as a dog until you die? - Hey!

503
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,378
Stop brushing my hair, or I'll lose all my hair.

504
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,849
Will you end up like Uncle because you can't break the curse?

505
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,050
I'm going to break the curse.

506
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,719
I will.

507
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,929
(Combo)

508
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,570
Gosh.

509
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,139
Hey.

510
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,510
So you know all about our family curse?

511
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,878
Oh, that's a family curse?

512
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,879
Yes.

513
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,750
Anyway, we came to see you...

514
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,559
to find out whether or not we can trust you.

515
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,259
Do you turn into a dog too?

516
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,290
Yes.

517
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,100
It doesn't happen when the full moon rises, does it?

518
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,128
Hey, we're not werewolves.

519
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:04,040
It only happens briefly at dawn when you're under the curse.

520
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,569
Are you here to advertise it?

521
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,339
He already knows everything anyway.

522
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,408
He doesn't know everything.

523
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,678
He only knew 1 thing, and you're telling him like 10 things.

524
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,608
- Me? When? - Ever since we sat down.

525
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:17,020
Anyway, how is the curse activated?

526
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:19,249
Oh, it happens when you kiss...

527
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,149
Hey, you're short!

528
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,489
Why do you have so many questions?

529
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,590
Anyway,

530
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,388
you don't need to know all the details.

531
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:30,800
Anyway, you're Ms. Han's sister. You're really pretty too.

532
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,629
Really?

533
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:36,399
Be more specific. What part?

534
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,609
Just overall. You'll look really cute when you turn into a dog.

535
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,480
Is that a compliment?

536
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,379
No, he's saying you look like a dog.

537
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,320
(College Admission Seminar at Garam High School)

538
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,428
Move! Hands off!

539
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:02,490
Hey, get this!

540
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,760
- Hey. - Hello!

541
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:16,840
So you kissed someone.

542
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,609
Yes.

543
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,050
Who?

544
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:26,850
Mr. Jin Seo Won.

545
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,250
Oh, I see.

546
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,020
My uncle.

547
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,399
Does that mean you two have been deceiving me this whole time?

548
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,458
No. We did not deceive you, per Se.

549
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,000
I knew there was something going on between you two.

550
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,599
There wasn't really anything going on, but...

551
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,500
You kissed him when there was nothing going on?

552
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,320
That night, I was dead drunk,

553
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,919
so I made a mistake. It really was just a mistake.

554
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,060
So you two aren't dating,

555
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,230
but you kissed him?

556
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:16,240
Anyway...

557
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:19,269
In order to break the curse,

558
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,040
I have to kiss Mr. Jin again when I'm a dog...

559
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
I have to kiss him again.

560
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,649
That said,

561
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:31,649
would you be able to...

562
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,389
let me into your home when your uncle is asleep?

563
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,959
Let's do it tonight.

564
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,659
Thanks, Yul.

565
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:44,760
Ms. Han, by the way,

566
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,830
once you break the curse,

567
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,770
will you no longer turn into a dog?

568
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,500
That's right, for the time being.

569
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,310
But...

570
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,939
if I meet someone new...

571
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,780
So it's something you have to go through...

572
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,419
each time you date someone.

573
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:09,320
Then how about you just date my uncle?

574
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,760
What?

575
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:11,919
Why?

576
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,429
Do you not like my uncle?

577
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:15,830
No, it's not that.

578
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:21,770
I mean, who'd like me?

579
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,600
It's bizarre,

580
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,510
a person turning into a dog.

581
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,570
It doesn't bother me.

582
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,379
You're cute, Ms. Han.

583
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,290
You can go.

584
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,060
I can go?

585
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,389
I need some time to think.

586
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,399
Go.

587
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:53,969
Okay, I'm off.

588
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,969
Thanks.

589
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,690
Uncle Seo Won.

590
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,750
What's up?

591
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,989
- You're still up. - Yes.

592
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,290
I still have a lot to do.

593
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,989
You should go to bed.

594
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,290
Okay.

595
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,610
Uncle Seo Won.

596
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:38,380
Why do you keep bugging me?

597
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,449
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

598
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,610
What's with you today?

599
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,219
Well, you must be tired. You should go to bed.

600
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,190
You don't want dark under-eye circles on that handsome face.

601
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,790
Just go to bed.

602
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,489
Go to bed already!

603
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,929
Why is he so rude today?

604
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,000
Why won't he go to bed?

605
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:06,769
(Teacher Han Hae Na)

606
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,009
Ms. Han.

607
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,839
You'll have to wait a bit longer.

608
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:26,360
Hey, boy.

609
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:31,830
Ms. Han!

610
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,630
What's our target doing?

611
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,929
He fell asleep at last.

612
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,199
He's fast asleep now.

613
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,869
What will she wear if this succeeds?

614
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,310
Sunglasses?

615
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,949
Sunglasses.

616
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,949
- Running shoes? - Here.

617
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,750
- A hat? - Here.

618
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,089
- Did you bring her tracksuit? - Here.

619
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,250
Underwear.

620
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,460
- This is mine. - No wonder.

621
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,388
We'll move in swiftly, get the job done,

622
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,989
and leave. Got it?

623
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:03,960
But in case this fails,

624
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:05,900
do we have a plan B?

625
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,139
No, we do not.

626
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,710
Follow me.

627
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:03,920
Don't be nervous.

628
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,159
I'm a dog now anyway.

629
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,909
But we've gotten quite close thanks to the curse.

630
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,649
Those happy...

631
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,080
and heart-fluttering moments.

632
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,250
And how I kept thinking of him.

633
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,650
It must've been all because of the curse, right?

634
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,060
You look pretty.

635
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,869
Will I stop feeling butterflies...

636
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,710
once I break the curse? Will everything go back to normal?

637
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,350
There are no pulps.

638
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,049
What?

639
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:16,489
Why didn't I change?

640
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,489
Shall I try it one more time?

641
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,330
How come it's not working?

642
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,380
Uncle Seo Won, are you all right? Are you okay?

643
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:42,448
What's wrong? What happened?

644
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:43,750
There's a dog in my room.

645
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,420
What? What dog?

646
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,448
There's no dog here.

647
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,250
It must've been a dream.

648
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,420
You scared me.

649
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,159
You're okay, right?

650
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,559
You'll be fine.

651
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,529
I'm going to bed.

652
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,230
Good night.

653
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,480
Did it fail?

654
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,880
Why?

655
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,290
It's okay.

656
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,759
It's all right.

657
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,360
We'll try again.

658
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,439
Yu Na.

659
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,969
Why didn't it work?

660
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,069
Why do you think it didn't work? What did I miss?

661
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,480
Did I not touch his lips?

662
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,948
No, I'm sure I did.

663
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,709
Of course, you did.

664
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,580
Then why didn't it work?

665
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,159
I see.

666
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,059
I must not transform right away.

667
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,860
I probably won't transform later at midnight.

668
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,060
That's it. I see.

669
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What a relief.

670
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,170
You transformed.

671
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,020
Do we have to ask Mom about it?

672
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,690
Never.

673
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,988
She gave you an earful...

674
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:31,819
when you kissed your boyfriend.

675
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,389
But if she finds out I kissed someone by mistake while drunk,

676
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,100
she'll tear me to pieces.

677
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,630
Should I ask her in a roundabout way?

678
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,899
Mom has a sharp eye. That won't work on her.

679
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,540
Then do you have any other plans?

680
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,480
But...

681
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,449
if you do ask her,

682
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,719
can you ask her about that as well?

683
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:07,659
What?

684
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,139
If there are any side effects...

685
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:28,049
that come along with the transformation.

686
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,350
Side effects?

687
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
For example,

688
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,389
a sudden fast heartbeat.

689
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,319
Could it be a heart attack?

690
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:41,290
Arrhythmia?

691
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,290
A heart attack?

692
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,069
I think you're doomed.

693
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,339
What do you mean it won't work?

694
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:53,969
It won't work.

695
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,009
He needs to be fully alert.

696
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,779
(Nana Animal Hospital)

697
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:01,210
So...

698
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,080
Mom took a look at our ancestors' records.

699
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:17,698
There was a record about how nothing happened...

700
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,500
after one of our ancestors kissed someone who was asleep.

701
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,900
So if they're unconscious, there's no point.

702
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:27,569
Does there need to be love for the curse to be lifted?

703
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,940
I don't think so.

704
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,379
Why is the curse so detailed?

705
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,579
Who decided it wouldn't work...

706
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,919
if the person is asleep, passed out, or dead?

707
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,080
That's what I'm saying.

708
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,790
It was probably the person who put the curse on us.

709
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,488
Who is that punk?

710
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:44,619
How dare you say that?

711
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,489
There is probably some spirit that we're not aware of.

712
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:49,928
Shamanism?

713
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,059
Forget that.

714
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,699
I think our mother's suspicious. She asked if you had the curse.

715
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:56,028
- So? - For now,

716
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:57,600
I said no.

717
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,169
But you never know when she'll barge into our house,

718
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,810
so don't let your guard down.

719
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,880
She said the curse can't be lifted easily with tricks.

720
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,480
What should we do?

721
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:13,549
Hey, just be honest with him and ask for help.

722
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,389
That's easier said than done.

723
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,289
And we can't just reveal our secret to anyone.

724
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,589
Did you already forget?

725
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:22,429
Babe.

726
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,730
What? You said you were in your room.

727
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:54,860
He promised to help me lift my curse, but that jerk...

728
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:58,928
Honestly, before that,

729
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,230
I thought you didn't have a problem with your love life.

730
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,198
He said I was terrifying and creepy,

731
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,069
but I begged him with tears for him to make that promise.

732
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:14,049
After being cooped up in a motel bathroom until 6am,

733
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:17,779
she bought a hatchet to hurt him with it.

734
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,048
I ached all over after trying to stop her.

735
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:24,690
In the end, it all ended with you losing...

736
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,130
- your severance pay. - Gosh!

737
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,960
Don't trust anybody.

738
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,429
Don't trust anyone. Not even Math or History!

739
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,629
- But Mr. Jin is different... - You...

740
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,339
Fine, I won't.

741
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:40,770
There is only one way out of this.

742
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,210
Tell him you'll help him overcome his fear of dogs.

743
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:51,719
Mr. Jin, would you like to overcome your fear of dogs?

744
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,350
I'll help you.

745
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,389
I knew it. You also think I'm weird.

746
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,029
This is why I didn't want to tell you I was afraid of dogs.

747
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,730
I knew it.

748
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,770
We are not capable of understanding each other.

749
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,639
What if he says that?

750
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,679
I doubt he would.

751
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,278
It feels like...

752
00:46:24,279 --> 00:46:26,849
I'll be hurting his feelings just to lift my curse.

753
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,150
It can't be helped.

754
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,389
If you don't want to get hurt, you have to hurt others.

755
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,029
Be selfish.

756
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,730
I don't want to do that.

757
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Why not?

758
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,139
Have you developed feelings for him?

759
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,909
No, it's not like that.

760
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,380
Isn't your school going on a trip soon?

761
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:56,049
He's right. You better lift your curse soon.

762
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,080
Your whole school might end up finding out.

763
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,790
Gosh! How infuriating!

764
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:25,239
No, that's a bone. Give it to me.

765
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,639
Stop chewing.

766
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:28,250
It's okay. Just let her be.

- Ms. Han! - Ms. Han!

776
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,289
- Why were there essay questions? - Ms. Han!

777
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,229
- What in the world? - Ms. Han, it was so hard.

778
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,429
The answer is always in the question.

779
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,169
- Mr. Jin! - Mr. Jin!

780
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,399
Mr. Jin, the questions were too hard.

781
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,599
Mr. Jin, is C the correct answer?

782
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,269
Your exam was the hardest.

783
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,869
That's why it's an exam.

784
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:05,440
- Go on. - Come on, Mr. Jin.

785
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,330
What? You still carry this around.

786
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,040
Do you think it's effective?

787
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:35,110
I'm not sure.

788
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,489
It's okay if they're that far away.

789
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,159
I see.

790
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well...

791
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,799
I'm not sure how this question will sound to you,

792
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,699
but...

793
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:10,779
what exactly is it about dogs that scares you?

794
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,580
When you look at dogs, how do you feel?

795
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:23,489
They're cute, and I'm glad to see them.

796
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:28,029
So you think the dog won't attack you, right?

797
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,159
- Right. - But how are you sure of that?

798
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,900
You don't even know the dog.

799
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,199
I just trust that it won't.

800
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,569
Then what if that dog...

801
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,199
were a tiger?

802
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,569
Will you still trust it?

803
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:46,839
No.

804
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,679
To me, dogs are like that.

805
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:04,460
Then...

806
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,670
was it like that for you ever since you were a child?

807
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:12,440
Something happened when I was ten.

808
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:15,270
Whenever I see dogs,

809
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,710
I feel...

810
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,020
Ms. Han.

811
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:29,549
When we went to the escape room,

812
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,790
do you remember how you pulled my hair?

813
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,230
I was honestly a bit envious.

814
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,400
You expressed that you were scared and needed help...

815
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,069
with your entire body...

816
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,509
without hesitation.

817
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,580
I can't do that.

818
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:56,350
I just fall apart by myself.

819
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:05,089
Hey,

820
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,429
I want to try my best to help Mr. Jin...

821
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,489
overcome his fear of dogs.

822
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,199
Yes, that is how you'll survive.

823
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,500
I need to deal with my curse,

824
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:18,170
but I also just want to help him.

825
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,670
Look at you.

826
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,210
Well, you know, I'm a teacher,

827
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:27,350
so it's my job to teach others,

828
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,819
but also to help students who need help.

829
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:32,580
Is Math a student?

830
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,819
That's not what's important.

831
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:44,699
What? What is it?

832
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,230
Never mind.

833
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,670
But what are you doing?

834
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,480
Your hair grows so fast. I need to shave you.

835
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,850
- I'm not letting you. - Darn it.

836
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,218
- No, I'm practicing right now. - Not a chance.

837
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:10,088
- No, I can do a better job. - No way.

838
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:12,020
- No, you have to get a shave. - No!

839
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,389
Mr. Jin.

840
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,500
- I'll help you. - Sorry?

841
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,560
Your fear of dogs.

842
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:22,770
I'll help you overcome it.

843
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,298
I mean, it's not like we'll only be at school all the time.

844
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:30,569
We also have get-togethers, field trips, and excursions.

845
00:53:30,779 --> 00:53:33,310
But I'm often surrounded by dogs.

846
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,548
I feel sorry that you'll have to feel uncomfortable...

847
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,880
because of me every time that happens.

848
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:40,819
I know avoiding you would be helping you, but...

849
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,758
Then I would feel sorry.

850
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:47,319
No, you don't have to feel that way at all.

851
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,830
How will you help me?

852
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,159
Sorry?

853
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,130
Do you have a plan?

854
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:54,330
Well...

855
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,639
Do you want to try meeting up with me outside of school?

856
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,210
- Outside of school? - Yes.

857
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,949
- Sure. - Really?

858
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,689
Then,

859
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,319
if you're free tomorrow after the exams...

860
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:20,830
Sure.

861
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,790
You made a promise.

862
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,190
Should I just stay home?

863
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,029
One, two, three,

864
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,170
four,

865
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,770
five. You did it!

866
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,279
The more I look at it, it's cute.

867
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,650
Right?

868
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:24,420
Okay, let's go. Next.

869
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,589
What do you think that dog is saying?

870
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,630
"I'll bite you to pieces."

871
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:42,829
No.

872
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,199
"Hey, don't come here. I'm scared."

873
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:48,839
Dogs that are easily scared bark like that.

874
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,210
Hey.

875
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,420
Why do you think that dog was like that?

876
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,690
"I'll bite you to pieces?"

877
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,860
No.

878
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:10,029
"Hey, come over here. I'm so glad to see you."

879
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:13,029
Dogs that are friendly are energetic like that one.

880
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,869
Look. What about them?

881
00:57:23,469 --> 00:57:25,339
This time, it's really "I'll bite you to pieces."

882
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,639
No.

883
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,580
You must think dogs will nip you if they bark,

884
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,048
but dogs are diverse...

885
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,889
just like people...

886
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:42,630
What? Let's keep moving.

887
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:44,929
- They're fighting. - No, they're not.

888
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,900
There aren't a lot of dogs here.

889
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,770
You're right.

890
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,310
Good job today.

891
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,440
I took things too fast, didn't I?

892
00:57:58,009 --> 00:57:59,940
- No. - Come on.

893
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,310
You look just like my students after I move too fast during class.

894
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:09,219
I know that expression too.

895
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:11,389
Right? You know it, don't you?

896
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:17,130
If you look in the mirror right now, you look just like our students.

897

898
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,650

Can you help me?

Why are you getting involved in the matters of another class?

910
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,909
Does it matter whose class it is?

How would she feel?

912
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:51,749
Just because you can transform into a dog...

913
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:55,049
doesn't mean you become a superhero like Ant-Man or Spider-Man.

914
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,790
Why didn't we think of that?

915
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,419
What would a male teacher...

916
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,190
be the most sensitive about when it comes to female students?
