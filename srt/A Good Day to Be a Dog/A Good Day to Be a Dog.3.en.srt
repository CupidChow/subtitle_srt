(All animals were filmed under expert supervision.)

9
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,090
I'm sure Mr. Lee can embrace a woman like me.

10
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,990
- Ms. Han. - What?

11
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,259
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,629
Ms. Han!

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,060
I only have a minute left.

14
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:02,529
When I kiss a man, I turn into a dog.

15
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,399
When is she going to turn back?

16
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,699
At 6am.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,898
Then she will turn into a dog at midnight.

18
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,739
- For how long? - For 100 days.

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,068
If she can't break the curse by then,

20
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,569
she'll live her life as a dog for the rest of her life.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,338
The only way to break this darned curse.

22
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:16,338
I must kiss this man again today.

23
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:17,809
This time, as a dog.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,780
By the way, why on earth do you hate me?

25
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,479
Why do you feel uncomfortable around me?

26
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,350
It's because whenever I'm with you...

27
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,989
Anyway, it's true that I avoided you because I felt uncomfortable,

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,390
but it's not because I don't like you.

29
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,119
(Yu Na: You have 5 minutes left. Get out of there.)

30
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,559
Gosh. I need to step out for a second. Please excuse me.

31
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,899
Ms. Han.

32
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:40,729
What? What's wrong with him?

33
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,309
Hold on. He's afraid of dogs?

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,440
Seriously, what should I do now?

35
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,038
He absolutely hates dogs.

36
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,709
Did something else happen?

37
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,948
Won. You haven't forgotten about our date after work today, right?

38
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:54,379
Then if you've decided to help me,

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,149
how about we meet up regularly so you can give me some pointers?

40
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,149
Just one beer. Please?

41
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,020
Can you not hear me?

42
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,890
How many times do I have to say no?

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,258
Why do you feel uncomfortable around me?

44
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,699
What are you, a nutcracker?

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,629
And what am I, a walnut?

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,768
You keep picking on me and at me over and over!

47
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,298
Hey, didn't you say he was scared of dogs?

48
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,668
But think about it.

49
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,268
All kinds of dogs from the area must circle around her.

50
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,608
You're students. You shouldn't be smoking in front of our school.

51
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,239
Hey, what are your names?

52
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,310
We should touch hers and call it even.

53
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,750
She asked you what your names were.

54
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,948
Are you feeling better?

55
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:34,959
I was a bit startled this morning. But I'm all right now.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,589
Sorry about yesterday.

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,888
I was sorry too.

58
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,029
Now that I think about it,

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,130
it was only natural for you to misunderstand.

60
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,900
I don't know what it is, but if it's hard to talk about,

61
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,630
you don't have to tell me.

62
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,538
Everyone has their own story,

63
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,809
and we can all have a secret we keep inside our hearts.

64
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,038
Is this Ms. Han Hae Na, a teacher at Garam High School?

65
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,038
Ms. Han. I think the buses have stopped running.

66
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,109
I'll get going.

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,979
Hello? Woo Taek, I'm in big trouble right now.

68
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,049
Why are you still here?

69
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,690
How can a person change into a dog?

70
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,359
Do you live by yourself, Ms. Han?

71
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,060
I think your family will be worried.

72
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,460
Do you want me to contact them?

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,130
How do I get out of here?

74
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,198
First, I'll wait until it's 6am.

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,999
Then when I turn back into my human form, I'll leave.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,900
I can't fall asleep, no matter what.

77
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,569
I can't fall...

78
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,239
Oh, no. I'm doomed!

79
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,449
What now? What am I going to do now?

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
Who is that?

81
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,519
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,160
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

83
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,530
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Han - Happy birthday, dear Ms. Han

84
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,859
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,710
Did you buy this cake?

86
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,509
Yes. I know that you like tiramisu.

87
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,810
Thank you.

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,609
Or perhaps, I should've given you this instead.

89
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,079
Why are you holding a dog bone?

90
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,840
Eat it.

91
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,780
My dog, Mandeuk, loves this!

92
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,320
- Do you want to play with this? - I hear dogs like rubber.

93
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,248
Bite it.

94
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,020
We must put a leash on her if we want to train her.

95
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,618
All right. Give me your paw.

96
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,960
This outfit looks great on you. Right?

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,499
No, I'm not a dog.

98
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,669
I just happen to turn into a dog briefly!

99
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,570
A while ago, I saw a huge rat.

100
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,070
That was you, right?

101
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,289
Ms. Han?

102
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,660
Is this a dream?

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,799
Wait. What are you doing here, Mr. Jin?

104
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,809
What are you doing here here, Ms. Han?

105
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,679
Ms. Han, are you back?

106
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,450
Uncle.

107
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,850
"Uncle?" What do you mean?

108
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,689
Can you explain what's going on here right now?

109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,029
(Episode 3)

110
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,629
Ms. Han, you turned into a dog yesterday.

111
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,919
Just a moment ago,

112
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,989
I witnessed something with my own eyes.

113
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,720
Was there an incident?

114
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,660
Did you make a mistake?

115
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,160
Uncle, come on. What do you think I am?

116
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,329
Something crazy happened yesterday.

117
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,069
Well, in the middle of the night yesterday,

118
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,339
I had to go to the police substation to get Yul.

119
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,369
A police substation?

120
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,239
Ms. Han, how could you tell him that?

121
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,808
Why did you end up at the police substation?

122
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:47,939
Did you get into trouble?

123
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,039
The guys from Kyungwon High School...

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,650
started a fight with Yul.

125
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,548
Did they hurt you?

126
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,580
No. Yul is completely fine.

127
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,090
It was nothing. Ms. Han came and sorted everything out.

128
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,900
Why did you call Ms. Han, not me?

129
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,199
What if they found out that you were my uncle?

130
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,469
Who knows what they might do?

131
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,770
They might try to find dirt on you or something.

132
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,640
Why are you worried about me? I'm your guardian.

133
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,239
You should have called me instead.

134
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,108
Please don't scold him.

135
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,679
- I'm his homeroom teacher. So... - Let me talk to Yul for a second.

136
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,950
But why did you come all the way to our house?

137
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,220
Oh, that.

138
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,118
Well, I...

139
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,159
Ms. Han was out drinking.

140
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,288
But she had to rush over to the station for me.

141
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,889
That's right. So when we got out of the police substation,

142
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,058
we got into a taxi because I wanted to drop him off at home.

143
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:46,228
But once I got into a taxi, the tension in my body relaxed.

144
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,969
Then I started to feel the alcohol in my body.

145
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,400
So I ended up falling asleep in the taxi.

146
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,069
I don't know where she lives.

147
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,710
There was no way I could talk to a dog.

148
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,879
A dog?

149
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
Ms. Han was...

150
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,520
like a drunk dog.

151
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,859
Right. I was like a drunk dog yesterday.

152
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,390
Why did you drink so much?

153
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,298
Were you upset because of what happened with...

154
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,999
the boys from Kyungwon High School? Is that why you drank?

155
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,470
That's right.

156
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,499
I was very upset, so I had a few drinks.

157
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,580
Ms. Han was sleeping in your room.

158
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,350
Then you should have slept outside.

159
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:35,419
Of course, I did.

160
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,648
That's odd. I clearly remember sleeping on the sofa.

161
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,090
It must have been uncomfortable.

162
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,359
You must've come back into your room when you were half-asleep.

163
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,258
Right.

164
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,689
I probably did that when I was half-asleep, Uncle.

165
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,899
Do I sleepwalk?

166
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,769
Maybe, it's your homing instinct.

167
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:54,840
Seriously. You're so smart. No wonder why you're a teacher.

168
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,040
That was why.

169
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,779
Ms. Yoon.

170
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,550
Didn't you say you were coming out to exercise?

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,519
Just wait.

172
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,220
I was told he usually went out for a jog around this time.

173
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,570
What's going on with them? Why are they coming out together?

174
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,040
Well, Ms. Han.

175
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,940
Can you not tell people that Yul is my nephew?

176
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,978
Gosh, of course.

177
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,450
It might be uncomfortable for Yul if people find out.

178
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,820
I'm really sorry about what happened yesterday.

179
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,888
Things like this seem to happen often whenever I'm with you.

180
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,489
What's going on?

181
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,960
Had I not been so wasted from drinking too much...

182
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,930
So you got wasted?

183
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,159
I'm sorry...

184
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,269
for getting worked up earlier.

185
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,170
He got worked up?

186
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,639
By the way, I'll keep your secret no matter what.

187
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,210
His secret?

188
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Go away.

189
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,320
Ms. Han.

190
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,649
I think you should cut down on drinking.

191
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,119
Lately,

192
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,820
there have been a lot of dangerous incidents.

193
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,060
Okay.

194
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,830
I'll see you at school then.

195
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,618
(Nana Animal Hospital)

196
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,790
He found out?

197
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,129
Your student found out?

198
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,600
There's more.

199
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,200
He's the nephew of the math teacher.

200
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,930
What? His nephew?

201
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,398
Hey, you.

202
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,738
- Are you out of your mind? - Gosh.

203
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,199
That hurts! What are you doing?

204
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,169
- Do you have to ask? - What are you doing?

205
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,469
You still haven't learned your lesson...

206
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,738
after that major incident you had.

207
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:15,878
Woo Taek, stop Yu Na.

208
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,879
Hey, it's not like you had a perfect record either.

209
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,049
Your ex-boyfriend threatened to expose your secret,

210
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,310
so you had to buy his silence.

211
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,949
Why are you bringing up that jerk right now?

212
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,919
- Why are you bringing him up? - Hey, Hae Na. Stop her.

213
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,560
Seriously, Woo Taek. Why did you bring that up?

214
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,028
- That traitor. - You little...

215
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,430
Were you talking about me just now?

216
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,190
Yul, let's eat.

217
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:05,960
So cute.

218
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,369
You're always watching dog clips.

219
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,269
That's because I can't have dogs because of you.

220
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:21,239
Can't we get a puppy?

221
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,040
I have enough on my plate, taking care of you.

222
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,850
What are you doing?

223
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,019
Picture this.

224
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,720
When you get home,

225
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,489
our puppy will greet us like this every day.

226
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,629
I wouldn't want to come home then.

227
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,779
Darn it.

228
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,379
Come here.

229
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,749
Get this butt poke instead.

230
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,320
Come here. Let's eat.

231
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,050
I'll clean up after the dog.

232
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:08,988
- Eat before the food gets cold. - I'll walk the dog too.

233
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm serious.

234
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,519
Sit down.

235
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,830
I'll think about it during our meal.

236
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Really?

237
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,930
Okay.

238
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,830
If you can eat ten bowls of rice.

239
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,670
Dig in.

240
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,509
Thank you for the food.

241
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,040
How can I eat ten bowls of rice?

242
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,940
Eat up.

243
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,279
Look at this. Isn't this cute?

244
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,249
That's kind of cute.

245
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,960

(Come and play with us, woof!)

248
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,648
Gosh, Yul is a nice kid. He's not going to tell anyone.

249
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:07,978
How can I trust him?

250
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,580
You can trust him.

251
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,249
Drop me off here.

252
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,590
Take this.

253
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,590
What's this?

254
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,699
Give that to the math teacher.

255
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,159
You said he was terrified of dogs.

256
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,768
Who knows? If he carries that around,

257
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,070
he might be able to develop an ounce of tolerance toward dogs.

258
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,909
Don't forget to be careful.

259
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,039
Dogs come to you whenever they see you.

260
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,310
If the math teacher sees that, he might be terrified.

261
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,349
Good luck.

(College Admission Seminar at Garam High School)

263
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,729
Does she really think he's going to carry this thing?

264
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:00,629
What's that?

265
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,570
Mr. Lee.

266
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,970
Gosh, this is so cute.

267
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,839
Wait. This puppy...

268
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,239
sort of looks like you.

269
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,149
Really?

270
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,850
It makes sense, though. You do have the puppy face.

271
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,690
I like dogs because they are loyal.

272
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,988
Once they consider someone as their master,

273
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,330
they stay loyal until death.

274
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,600
Are you like that too?

275
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,070
Once you like someone, do you stay faithful to that person?

276
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,999
Of course.

277
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,300
Mr. Jin.

278
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,009
- Mr. Jin. - Yes?

279
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:49,749
Did you have a nice weekend?

280
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,149
Yes.

281
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,350
How?

282
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,519
Pardon?

283
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,220
Tell me how you enjoyed your weekend.

284
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,629
Is there something you want to say to me?

285
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:04,560
Mr. Jin.

286
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,399
Do you have a girlfriend?

287
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,769
No.

288
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,040
Then I'll cut to the chase.

289
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,379
As colleagues, I want us...

290
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,180
to open up to each other and talk about everything...

291
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,249
without any secrets.

292
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,879
What do you think about that?

293
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,950
Sure.

294
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,888
Then...

295
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,389
on that note, why don't we tell each other a secret?

296
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,790
You might not know,

297
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:38,129
but my buttocks are asymmetrical.

298
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,940
So we've become close enough to share a secret with each other.

299
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,540
Right?

300
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,340
What?

301
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,659
Gosh, that's so cute!

302
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,859
- No way. - What a cute dog.

303
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:13,969
Oh, my.

304
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,010
I knew it. Ms. Dog Magnet.

305
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,040
Dogs love you.

306
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,909
Why do we have a dog here?

307
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:27,010
Hey. That's Mandeuk.

308
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:31,080
He's going to stay here for the day.

309
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:34,520
Gosh. My daughter begged me to look after him today.

310
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm sorry. Should I get you something to wipe with?

311
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,730
Gosh, it's fine.

312
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,149
Sir, I'm sorry. I'm actually allergic to dog hair.

313
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:02,980
All of a sudden?

314
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,649
It started this spring.

315
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,218
Gosh. Oh, no.

316
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,820
Then...

317
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,189
you should take some medicine.

318
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,419
Well,

319
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,388
it looks like he feels out of place too.

320
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:15,259
Why don't we put him in the cage for a moment?

321
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,060
Gosh, no. Mandeuk hates enclosed places.

322
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,800
- Mr. Jin. - Yes.

323
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,869
Why are you blocking the door?

324
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,980
I left my phone in my car.

325
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,040
I didn't know you drove here.

326
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,779
That's great.

327
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,909
If you're going to the parking lot, can you go to my car...

328
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:37,919
and pick up Mandeuk's bag? It has his stuff inside.

329
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,250
You'll see a bag with his food and his plates.

330
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,290
- Okay. Sure. - Thanks.

331
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:12,550
Mr. Jin.

332
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,189
Why are you so jumpy?

333
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,519
Mandeuk must be hungry.

334
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,159
Can you feed him some food and water?

335
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,859
You want me to do it?

336
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,260
I'm very busy right now.

337
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,260
- Please do that for me. - Wait.

338
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:06,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin.

339
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:08,669
I'm late for my class.

340
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,149
- Hello. - Hello.

341
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,929
You won't tell anyone my secret, right?

342
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,730
Of course, I won't.

343
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,969
But are you okay at school?

344
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,000
You don't turn into a dog at school?

345
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,399
No, I'm okay at school.

346
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,240
Hey, don't you think it's bizarre?

347
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:51,139
I mean, me changing like that.

348
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:55,449
It sure is unusual, but I didn't think it was bizarre.

349
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,780
- Really? - Yes.

350
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,919
You looked so cute.

351
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,619
When will you change like that again? I want to see it again.

352
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,359
I don't really want to change like that.

353
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,489
Why not? I'll throw a ball for you,

354
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,659
and we'll play tug too.

355
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,429
Please?

356
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,810
I bought tons of these too.

357
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,750
Stop it, seriously.

358
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,679
Don't eat too much of it.

- Nothing. - Take it easy.

00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,639
- Bo Gyeom. - Yes?

363
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,909
Can you leave this on my desk?

364
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,109
Me? Why?

365
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,749
Do it for me, please.

366
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,219
Do it yourself.

367
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,679
I'll buy you that cake you liked.

368
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,649
My gosh.

369
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,559
Hey, I have money too.

370
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Bo Gyeom, please.

371
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,529
Why are you so clingy today?

372
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,560
Bo Gyeom.

373
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,760
- It's me. - Okay, so what?

374
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,560
You know what I'm talking about.

375
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,100
No, I don't know.

376
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:22,969
Hey.

377
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,040
It's me, Won.

378
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,310
Seriously, what's with you today?

379
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:36,780
What's wrong with you? Gosh.

380
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,020
Real Cheese Choco Fondant Cake.

381
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
I'll buy you that cake.

382
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,679
Hi!

383
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,709
My gosh.

384
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,718
Your cuteness is your only sin.

385
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,179
Right?

386
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,959
- Thank you. - No problem.

387
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,159
Go.

388
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,530
- My gosh. - So cute!

389
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,699
Isn't that dog so cute?

390
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:05,540
Oh, boy.

391
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,270
Well done.

392
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:09,939
Come on.

393
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:14,179
Come here. Was that fun?

394
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,949
Good job.

395
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,260
Hello.

396
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,889
He's not at his desk again. Is he teaching a class now?

397
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,158
(Class Schedule)

398
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,830
What? He doesn't have a class now.

399
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,770
How come Mr. Jin is nowhere to be seen today?

400
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,208
I wonder too.

401
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,609
I haven't seen his handsome face in the office all morning.

402
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:54,089
During breaks, girls come looking for him with snacks in their hands.

403
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,789
"Where is Mr. Jin?"

404
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,320
Record the answer and just play the recording.

405
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,389
"I don't know. He's not here."

406
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,560
"I don't know. He's not here."

407
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,629
"But we have a dog here."

408
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,800
Oh, not anymore.

409
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,429
Did Mandeuk leave?

410
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,570
Yes, the vice principal just left with Mandeuk.

411
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,638
Mandeuk has to take a nap,

412
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,080
but his favourite cushion is at home.

413
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,909
Mandeuk really went home?

414
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,349
When I passed the teacher certification exam,

415
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,320
I bet my mom had no idea I'd end up cleaning dog poop.

416
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,750
Hey.

417
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:28,889
Hey!

418
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:45,270
What? Mandeuk went home?

419
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:51,909
I see. Mandeuk went home.

420
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:53,750
I see.

421
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,688
As for the exam questions, we'll finish them by Wednesday...

422
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:01,919
and check each other's questions for errors.

423
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,820
Then who will edit the exams?

424
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,458
We normally go by seniority.

425
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:10,030
Oh, I'm still wrapping things up for the school trip.

426
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:14,230
I'll be too swamped if I had to edit the exams too.

427
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,770
I'll do it.

428
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Okay, then. Please take care of it for us, Ms. Han.

429
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,510
Yes, consider it done.

430
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,189
Ms. Han, I'm saying this for your own sake.

431
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,290
- Be careful. - What do you mean?

432
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,060
I saw it.

433
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,699
- What did you see? - Why do you seem so surprised?

434
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,330
Right, I understand why you're surprised.

435
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,469
Shall I say it? Or do you want to say it first?

436
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,369
Well...

437
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,809
I'm not sure what you saw and when it happened, but...

438
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,850
You see, you can't change like that.

439
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,519
Playing innocent to my face...

440
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,750
and wagging your tail behind my back.

441
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,060
Ms. Yoon, I can explain everything.

442
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,490
I'm not planning on telling anyone else.

443
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:18,760
Thank you.

444
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,569
Such unsavoury rumours...

445
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,639
will only damage Mr. Jin's reputation.

446
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:26,468
You see, many rumours...

447
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:29,740
are completely baseless.

448
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,010
A casual visit turns into a date.

449
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,379
After a couple of at-home dates, people say you're cohabiting.

450
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,820
Pardon me?

451
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,618
I'm not really sure where you stand,

452
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,250
but Mr. Jin and I are getting to know each other better.

453
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,959
Oh, I see.

454
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,760
We're sort of seeing each other.

455
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,199
We tell each other our secrets.

456
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,398
In any case... About Saturday morning,

457
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,639
I understand things happen.

458
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,510
Right, Saturday morning.

459
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,340
We're all adults here.

460
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,649
Things can happen when you're drunk.

461
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,550
I'm cool about these things.

462
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,449
Ms. Yoon, I went there that day because...

463
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,249
I had a bit of a situation.

464
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,959
I swear, nothing happened.

465
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,590
What situation?

466
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,629
I can't really tell you the details.

467
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,959
But I swear, nothing happened.

468
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:26,699
Please believe me.

469
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,198
So there's nothing going on between you two?

470
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,270
That's right.

471
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,138
You have no feelings for him?

472
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:34,269
No feelings at all, whatsoever.

473
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,340
All right, then. You'd better not go back on your word later on.

474
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:43,050
(Garam High School)

475
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,659
What was that? Why did I have to explain everything to her?

476
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,760
Who cares if they date? What does she want from me?

477
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:03,699
Hey, you.

478
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,510
Hey, I sneaked out because I didn't want to clean dog poop.

479
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,070
Why do you have to clean dog poop again?

480
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,740
He's back. Mandeuk.

481
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,479
- What? - I want Mandeuk's life.

482
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
He's back, with his favourite cushion.

483
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,789
Wait, check this out.

484
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,060
- Look at this! - What is this?

485
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,859
Hey, come here. Look at him.

486
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,359
(Knock Before Entering Teacher's Office)

487
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,609
- Mr. Jin. - Yes, sir.

488
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,609
Where have you been all day?

489
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,949
Right, the report. I'll send it to you now.

490
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,689
Guys! Move aside!

491
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,719
Move! Step aside.

492
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,020
Guys, step aside!

493
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,990
- Sorry, guys. - What's going on?

494
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:47,570
- Ms. Yoon. - Yes?

495
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,169
Are you done editing your exam questions?

496
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,909
Yes, I finished that long ago.

497
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,550
Gosh. I'm struggling to come up with questions for PE.

498
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,990
Mr. Jin, what's the matter?

499
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,889
Don't tell me it's because of the dog.

500
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,590
Gosh, no way.

501
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,060
Mandeuk!

502
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,138
Oh, the sprinklers above your desk must be broken too.

503
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:18,240
Water keeps dripping, right?

504
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,909
Yes, this is...

505
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:25,240
Mr. Jin, are you all right?

506
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:28,149
I'm fine.

507
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,719
Of course, he's fine.

508
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,520
It'd be absurd for a grown man to be afraid of dogs.

509
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,560
Are adults not allowed to be afraid of dogs?

510
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,790
- Sorry? - Pardon?

511
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,730
Oh, right. Ms. Han.

512
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,629
Didn't you say earlier that you were allergic to dog fur?

513
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:48,530
My gosh. I guess my allergy is gone. Oh, my!

514
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:52,169
Do allergies disappear like that?

515
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:29,609
Meet the new teachers who are joining us...

516
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,439
starting this semester.

517
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,250
Hello, everyone.

518
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,780
Hello. I'm Cheon Song Yi, and I teach English.

519
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,459
Hello, I'm Han Hae Na.

520
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,339
Stop!

521
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,409
- Go for it! - Yes, that's it!

522
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,279
Good boy.

523
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,719
House!

524
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,020
Sir.

525
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,420
- Yes. - This.

526
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,020
Oh, thank you.

527
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:29,659
Hey, Mandeuk.

528
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,330
You did well today.

529
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,339
Hey, Mandeuk. You did well today.

530
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,080
Hey, Seo Won. You haven't forgotten about that cake, right?

531
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,350
All right.

532
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,020
- Are you here to buy cake? - Yes.

533
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,319
I've been torn for the past 30 minutes.

534
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,460
Thankfully, it's still available.

535
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,929
Yes, but I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.

536
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:48,799
Knowing you shouldn't do something makes you want to do it more.

537
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:52,198
I can't have chocolate at night.

538
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:54,509
Because I know that, I crave it every night.

539
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,610
- How about I help you? - Sorry?

540
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,850
I'll take them all.

541
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:06,650
Sure.

542
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,230
- Oh... - Thank you.

543
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you.

544
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,639
All right, then.

545
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,449
Thank you for today.

546
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:40,290
Sorry?

547
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:43,219
I know you helped me in various ways.

548
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,429
Was it that obvious? I thought I meticulously hid it.

549
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,600
You did. No one else could tell.

550
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,469
That I'm afraid of dogs.

551
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,869
I figured it was the thing you couldn't tell me the other day,

552
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,810
so I tried my best to help you in subtle ways.

553
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,310
So it was helpful, right?

554
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,350
Yes, for sure.

555
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
But...

556
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:14,150
you probably think I'm weird.

557
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,619
Gosh, no.

558
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,790
I'm much weirder...

559
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,529
Mr. Jin, but I was wondering...

560
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,630
why you had to keep it to yourself.

561
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,299
Could you tell me?

562
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,310
It's just that...

563
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:38,380
being afraid of dogs as a grown man...

564
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,210
is embarrassing.

565
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,179
Come on! I've done way more embarrassing things.

566
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,319
I got dead drunk and kissed you.

567
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,420
I pulled your hair out at the room escape café.

568
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,959
Then I got drunk again and slept in my student's room for ten hours.

569
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,699
See? I beat you.

570
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,869
Tell me something else you're embarrassed about.

571
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,670
That's only fair.

572
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,969
I've done all sorts of embarrassing things,

573
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,409
but you never once avoided me...

574
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,880
or thought that I was a weirdo.

575
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,250
I feel the same way.

576
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:25,690
We're not weirdos.

577
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,900
It's just the way we are.

578
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,940
- What's this? - What?

579
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,850
Hey, it's a little dog.

580
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,480
What do you think?

581
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,158
I thought that maybe if you kept that,

582
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:35,529
it would help you build up an immunity against dogs.

583
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,900
Like a vaccine of sorts.

584
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,699
Was this vaccine...

585
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,900
clinically tested and approved?

586
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:46,940
You're my first test subject.

587
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:51,580
You can give it back if you don't want it.

588
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,210
Take this.

589
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,119
I realized...

590
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,219
there's no one at home to eat this.

591
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,089
Eat it during the day.

592
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:04,759
Not at night.

593
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,420
During the day.

594
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:09,230
I promise to eat it during the day.

595
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,000
I owe you for today,

596
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,000
and you gave me a vaccine dog.

597
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:19,699
I'd feel better if I gave you something.

598
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,869
You should.

599
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:25,908
A good night's sleep would do great for your skin,

600
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,480
and your popularity.

601
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,409
I doubt I'm popular.

602
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,649
You know you are.

603
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,549
The whole universe knows.

604
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,259
You keep a journal, don't you?

605
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:41,360
"Today, yet again, I was awesome."

606
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,429
"Today, yet again, I was cool."

607
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:47,830
I don't keep a journal.

608
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:25,869
What's up with her?

609
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,940
She'll turn into a dog soon.

610
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,639
She can't have chocolate.

611
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,009
Right.

612
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:32,309
How...

613
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,310
does it taste?

614
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,580
You know what chocolate cake tastes like.

615
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,219
I don't.

616
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,480
I can't remember.

617
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,749
Did Math take the doggy key chain?

618
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,319
He did.

619
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,888
It looks a bit like you.

620
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,259
He'll become immune.

621
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,960
Hey, how about this?

622
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,960
Make the dog on the key chain a bit bigger each time.

623
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,068
You know those Russian dolls that open and stack up?

624
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,629
The matryoshka.

625
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,138
Yes, like those.

626
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,969
Step 1, step 2, step 3.

627
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,638
Increase the size gradually,

628
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,980
until in the end, it's you crouching like the doll.

629
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,080
When his guard is down,

630
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,210
move in for the kiss.

631
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,649
That's really smart.

632
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,850
- I know. - Not bad.

633
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:14,920
Eat up.

634
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,889
- It's so good, right? - Yes.

635
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,589
Can you stop eating?

636
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:24,199
It's fine. Keep eating.

637
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,069
I want some so bad.

638
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,040
- Bo Gyeom. - Yes?

639
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,040
Can it be bad for someone to eat chocolate at night?

640
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,080
It's totally fine.

641
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,549
Is that a popular accessory these days?

642
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,759
Why do you live in a place like this?

643
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,060
Don't you have a home?

644
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,060
I do have a home.

645
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,529
Why don't you live there, then?

646
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,100
Why live out here?

647
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:02,929
I don't know what I was in my previous lifetime,

648
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,540
but I just love to be around nature.

649
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,239
I'll go home when I'm done.

650
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,738
Done with what?

651
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:12,238
Drink some of that while it's hot.

652
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,409
It's good for you.

653
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:19,880
This tea cup.

654
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,589
It looks really old.

655
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,860
Doesn't it?

656
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:28,589
You'll never imagine just how old it is.

657
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:31,929
Is it a hundred years old?

658
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,009
It's as old as the time it took...

659
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,639
for the light from that star to reach us.

660
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,949
That sounded like a pick-up line.

661
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,980
- What? - I got you, didn't I?

662
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:53,080
You can be so silly.

663
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:05,860
It's nice out here.

664
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,639
- I like you so much. - Hey.

665
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,509
Thank you.

666
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,799
The wedding invitation came out nice.

667
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,369
Seosan?

668
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,239
That's so far out.

669
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,568
Sorry.

670
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,310
Mr. Bong's family is from there.

671
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:29,909
We rented a bus for everyone.

672
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,179
Don't worry.

673
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,310
I don't like buses.

674
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:36,179
Ms. Gong.

675
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:37,650
My wedding invitation's out.

676
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:39,350
My goodness.

677
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:42,190
A wedding invitation?

678
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,350
Yes.

679
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:44,618
Ms. Seo and Mr. Bong's.

680
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:45,690
They're getting married at last.

681
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,559
They thought it was a secret, but everyone knew they were dating.

682
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,460
They dated for a long time too.

683
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:52,699
During the school trip,

684
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,000
out on the balcony.

685
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:57,068
Doesn't this feel like...

686
00:48:57,069 --> 00:48:59,069
we're Romeo and Juliet?

687
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,369
We're not Romeo and Juliet.

688
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:06,980
My Bong-meo.

689
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,409
My Seo-liet.

690
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:12,880
How long must we date in secret?

691
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,318
I bet no one knows what we're up to.

692
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:18,790
I bet. Isn't it a thrill?

693
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,500
- What a... - Be quiet.

694
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,469
Now that I think about it,

695
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,940
us four were on the balcony upstairs.

696
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,679
We're living witnesses of the Bong-Seo saga.

697
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,520
Should we get them a present?

698
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,850
Could you two get something?

699
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:51,759
Yes, I guess?

700
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,429
Are you free this evening?

701
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,199
Yes, I am.

702
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,069
Pick something out and tell me how much I owe.

703
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,600
Okay.

704
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,440
Where shall we go?

705
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,339
Didn't you say you're not yet done grading papers?

706
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:11,839
You have two more days to put the grades in the system.

707
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:14,549
Research will chew you out if you're not done in time.

708
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,650
Darn it, you're right.

709
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,210
Isn't this pretty?

710
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,710
It's too expensive.

711
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,299
I feel much better.

712
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,170
Matching pyjamas might work.

713
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:45,969
Aren't these cute?

714
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
They're nice.

715
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:48,540
How about this?

716
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,710
Can you handle it?

717
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:52,639
Which one...

718
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:54,250
turns you on more?

719
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:56,080
How about this?

720
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,619
That's a bit uncomfortable.

721
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:00,350
Let's get this, then.

722
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:01,619
Why get something I won't wear?

723
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,218
You don't buy this to put on.

724
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:05,290
Then what?

725
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,719
You know what.

726
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,460
Not so loud. We're not alone.

727
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,100
Who cares?

728
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,928
Shall we get out?

729
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:14,969
Yes.

730
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,270
You're such a lovely couple.

731
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,110
This would suit you.

732
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,210
What do you think?

733
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,850
- Thank you. - Thank you. Goodbye.

734
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,560
Lamps.

735
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,540
Shall we go now?

736
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,639
I'd like to drop by a pharmacy.

737
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,379
You don't feel well?

738
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,310
No. I want to get something for car sickness for the trip.

739
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,719
I get really sick when I take an express bus.

740
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:07,920
Are you okay in any other vehicle?

741
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:09,649
Yes.

742
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,989
It's just the express bus.

743
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:15,330
Would you like to go by my car, then?

744
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,659
Really? You don't mind?

745
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,069
If we leave the park at around 9am,

746
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,500
we should arrive on time.

747
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,600
Okay.

748
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,380
I won't let that happen.

749
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,489
- Ms. Han? - Ms. Yoon.

750
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,389
What are you two doing here?

751
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,860
We came to get a wedding gift for Mr. Bong and Ms. Seo.

752
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,860
Oh, just you two?

753
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:55,330
And you?

754
00:53:56,429 --> 00:53:57,869
I needed some cheering up.

755
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,170
You needed a lot of cheering up.

756
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:05,779
Hey. This weekend,

757
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,549
shall we carpool to the wedding?

758
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,209
What?

759
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,719
Mr. Lee doesn't like buses and is looking to make a group.

760
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,389
Oh, is he?

761
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,789
Let's carpool.

762
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,319
We can take turns driving.

763
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:28,770
Count me out.

764
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:31,040
Why?

765
00:54:31,339 --> 00:54:33,440
I'd rather not join you.

766
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:37,069
Can't you still come? It would be nice.

767
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,710
No, thanks.

768
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,549
What about you?

769
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,750
Are you in?

770
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,318
Well, I...

771
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:46,579
Say yes.

772
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,189
Or it'll be just me and Mr. Lee,

773
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,389
and I can't be alone with him.

774
00:54:49,889 --> 00:54:50,960
It'll be awkward.

775
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,219
Will you come with us?

776
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:54,960
Yes, I will, then.

777
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,459
Great.

778
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,659
See you.

779
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:04,199
No, thanks.

780
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,969
Come on, Mr. Lee.

781
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:11,009
You don't want to be in a bus full of strangers.

782
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,110
Still, that's much better than driving for hours.

783
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,049
I can drive. We can take turns.

784
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,020
You want me to put my life in your hands?

785
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:23,190
Then lend me your car at least.

786
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,520
Ms. Han already agreed to join us.

787
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,130
I can tell something's up.

788
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,360
Tell me what's going on.

789
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:32,759
Who knows?

790
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,469
I might take the bait.

791
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:36,429
Well,

792
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:40,469
Mr. Jin offered to drive Ms. Han to the wedding.

793
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:43,770
No wonder. I knew there had to be a reason.

794
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:47,480
So you used me as an excuse to split them up?

795
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,150
I don't want weird rumours to spread.

796
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:53,549
I saw something already, and I got worried.

797
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,750
What did you see?

798
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,960
You must keep it to yourself.

799
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,929
When I was out jogging...

800
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,210
Okay, let's do it.

801
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,448
(Yoon invited Han, Lee, Jin.)

802
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,520
Here's the carpool group chat.

803
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,920
Drop a text when you're nearby.

804
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,130
Yu Na.

805
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:13,659
Take a look.

806
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,369
What do you think?

807
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,299
Does it look like I'm trying too hard?

808
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,540
No, it doesn't look like that.

809
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:25,380
It doesn't?

810
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,310
You want to look like you're trying?

811
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,179
Well...

812
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,489
Kind of.

813
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:41,360
This.

814
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:43,429
Or this.

815
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,900
Or this.

816
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,230
There. Pick one of those.

817
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,199
That's new, so keep it clean.

818
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,549
Are you happy now?

819
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,080
About what?

820
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:07,750
There she is. Hello.

821
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:09,020
Hello.

822
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:12,790
What are you doing here, Ms. Cheon?

823
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,730
I'm taking Ms. Han's spot.

824
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:16,029
What?

825
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,259
I'll sit up front.

826
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:22,069
You're not coming, are you?

827
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,528
You go ahead.

828
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:25,339
I forgot something and can't join you.

829
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:26,869
What did she forget?

830
00:58:27,339 --> 00:58:28,869
She'll be late if she doesn't leave now.

831
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:32,279
Did she forget something important?

832
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,049
Did I make you wait?

833
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,860
Oh, not really.

834
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,770
Today, you look really...

835
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,040
awesome.

836
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:03,210
Shall we go?

837
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,310
If we leave now, we should...

838
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,089
(A Good Day To Be A Dog)

839
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,290
So you'll go with Math?

840
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,489
I have a bad feeling about this.

841
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,190
Something's going on.

842
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,860
How pretty.

843
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,330
I'll help you.

844
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,069
Your fear of dogs.

845
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:38,339
Shall we spend time together out in public?

846
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:40,638
Tell the truth and ask for his help.

847
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:42,369
That's easier said than done.

848
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,338
And she can't tell just anyone about the curse.

849
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:46,580
Have you forgotten already?

850
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:49,710
Is there a side effect to turning into a dog?

851
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,679
Like, would my heart race out of the blue?

852
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:55,219
You'll drift apart quicker than you think.

853
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:57,860
Regardless of what you want.
