00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,855
Hey! Hey! Hey!
The wrong place!

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,725
What? Do you own the place?

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,720
I go wherever I want.
Mind your own business!

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,256
Aren’t you stubborn?
This is not the first time.

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,470
What are you doing?
Stay away from me!

6
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:37,340
Don’t hang around here all the time!

7
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,986
Ouch. That hurts!

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,520
- Shame on you!
- Hands off! Hands off!

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,162
Stay away from me!
You scare people away!

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:39,710
(The Drum Tower)

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,329
Jenny, a cup of ice cappuccino, please.

12
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,624
It’s fucking hot today.

13
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
Ok. Just a moment.

14
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,091
Kid. Is the camera on?

15
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
No!

16
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:37,705
Good. I thought someone
was filming me again.

17
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:41,291
Dear sister,
I am not coming to the shop tomorrow.

18
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,775
My husband and I are moving to Qingdao.

19
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:48,713
I’ve made up my mind.
What’s good about staying in Beijing?

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,091
It’s crowded and expensive here.

21
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:54,076
Do come to visit us in Qingdao
if you are fed up with it here.

22
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,400
Screw you!

23
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,491
I don’t have your luck.

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,347
Your coffee is here!

25
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,277
“BLOCK THE HOLES IN THE WALL!
MAKE BEIJING GREAT AGAIN!”

26
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,480
What are you fucking shooting?

27
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,597
What’s going on?

28
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,301
Just took care of a little brat!

29
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,341
(In French) Everything is possible…

30
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,760
I think it’s absolutely wonderful,
I think the conditions…

31
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,360
We’re going to get that done by next month.

32
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,527
So if things are already under way,

33
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,455
I think we can sign the contract next week.

34
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:41,425
Where’s my dinner?

35
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,241
Excuse me, sorry!

36
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,880
Haven’t you had dinner yet?

37
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,317
Hello? Yes, sorry, I’m really sorry…

38
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,661
I said that I have seen the contact.

39
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,015
And that there is no problem.

40
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:16,264
Really! The stuff we started to do is…

41
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,210
One moment, excuse me one moment…

42
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,400
Hello?

43
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,832
Jenny and her husband are moving to Qingdao.

44
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:48,955
I am left here alone

45
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,040
I don’t want to run the shop any more.

46
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,414
This is perhaps the last time
that I livestream here.

47
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,680
Put it on the door!

48
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,800
“My dear, mum is away for a week.
Here is your pocket money. - Mum”

And you?
