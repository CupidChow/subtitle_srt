1
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,170
I KILL U

2
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:55,230
EPISODE FOUR
BLUE LAGOON

3
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:05,952
What the hell is this...

4
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:09,665
Holy shit!

5
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:14,836
Contact everyone and block the entrance!

6
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:20,217
Hey, come out!

7
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,857
It's so fun.

8
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:39,820
I'm so excited.

9
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:43,381
Hey, Youngjae!

10
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:45,842
Isn't there a passage
that leads to the back door?

11
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:50,136
If you tell me,
I'll teach you Taekwondo, okay?

12
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:52,499
There is... a passage...

13
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:20,376
...500 MILLION DOLLARS,
DEPARTED FOR BORACAY

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,362
Okay.

15
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:26,677
Huh.

16
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,137
<i>It seems like Ms. Kang has disappeared.</i>

17
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:28,661
What?

18
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,079
She's gone?

19
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:31,620
Did she run away?

20
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,908
<i>I think Myeongsu and</i>
<i>Manbae were attacked...</i>

21
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,308
...by the guys from Deputy Manager Han.

22
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,084
Mr. Han?

23
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:36,793
Right.

24
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,644
She seems to have fled
while they were fighting.

25
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:42,232
I'm also trying to figure out
what's going on right now.

26
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:43,717
Hey, you stupid bitch!

27
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:45,568
I told you to keep security tight!

28
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:46,719
I am so sorry!

29
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:48,839
But when I checked the CCTV,

30
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,260
I don't think she went
outside the hotel yet.

31
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,036
Hey! Block all hotel entrances right now!

32
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:55,854
Let your staff catch her
as quickly as possible.

33
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:02,668
Here we are.

34
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,706
What? Where is the passage?

35
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:24,132
It's here.

36
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,211
An elevator that transports food.

37
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,236
If you take this, you can
go straight to the restaurant.

38
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,354
When you come out of the restaurant,

39
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,241
the front door is on the right
and the back door on the left.

40
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,976
In Youngjae's opinion,
the front door is dangerous.

41
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,486
We have to ride this now.

42
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,112
Uh.

43
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:07,759
Are you sure about this?

44
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:10,721
Youngjae doesn't lie.

45
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,014
If we ride this, we can go outside.

46
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,067
- We arrived.
- Shhh!

47
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:37,331
Over there.

48
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,010
Taekwondo!

49
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:45,797
Please teach me taekwondo.

50
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:48,133
I will defeat the villain with Taekwondo.

51
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:50,093
I want to learn taekwondo.

52
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:51,427
Keep your promise.

53
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:53,988
Okay...

54
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:57,092
I will take a quick look
outside and come back...

55
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,018
...and teach you.

56
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,863
By the way, why are you here?

57
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:11,281
Where is your home?

58
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,325
This is Youngjae's home.

59
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,538
Mom and Dad all left me.

60
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,625
When I was young,
sister Miranda... no... no...

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,960
The chief manager brought Youngjae here.

62
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,421
If I work hard here,

63
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,097
she said she would cure
all of Youngjae's illnesses.

64
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,136
The chief manager is a bitch.

65
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:36,335
Gaslighting and even
treating you as a slave.

66
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:37,558
Youngjae is not a slave!

67
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:40,346
I know.

68
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,599
Don't go anywhere, but stay here.

69
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:44,732
I'll be back qiuckly.

70
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:35,701
Hey!

71
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,066
You little bitch!

72
00:06:45,703 --> 00:06:46,620
What are you guys?

73
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:48,003
Uh?

74
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:49,754
Are you looking for Jiyeon Han too?

75
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:52,334
I'm not Jiyeon Han.

76
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:53,419
Out of the way!

77
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,254
Hey, Sunwoo Kang!

78
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:00,175
This little girl is running
trough the whole hotel.

79
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:02,367
What?

80
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,264
Are you the kids sent by Director Yoon?

81
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:06,306
Enough!

82
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,243
You just rest in the room...

83
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,476
...thus let's go quietly.

84
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,477
Huh?

85
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:16,173
Hey! Seize that bitch!

86
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,809
Damn it!

87
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:22,347
What the fuck!

88
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,457
Take her to the VIP room.

89
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:49,589
Yep.

90
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,916
Director Yoon, it's all sorted out now.

91
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:55,182
I apologize for the inconvenience.

92
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:01,564
Everything is ready.

93
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:02,550
Should I run it right away?

94
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:03,972
Sure.

95
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:05,611
By the way,

96
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:09,137
that influencer bastard posted
a video of my accident today.

97
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:10,270
Did you check it out?

98
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:11,730
Oh, I didn't yet...

99
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,309
That fucking idiot...

100
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:16,683
...handed over the video
file to the influencer.

101
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:19,405
He's fucking crazy to blame me.

102
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:20,614
Never mind, please.

103
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,409
Anyway, it will be cleared after today.

104
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:25,743
Okay.

105
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:40,217
What happened?

106
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,511
It seems they got all hit.

107
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:43,679
I can't even contact them.

108
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:44,923
What about Jiyeon Han?

109
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:46,592
I think she's still in the hotel,

110
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:47,926
but I can't find her exact location.

111
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,529
Boss was on the phone with her earlier.

112
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,096
What the hell are you talking about?

113
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:51,823
Hey,

114
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:53,730
Manager Shin!

115
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:55,940
Come to me.

116
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,684
You freaking idiot!

117
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:03,901
What are you doing with these idiots
who can't even seize a girl?

118
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:04,575
What?

119
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:05,576
Expert?

120
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:09,489
If you don't seize that bitch, you'll die.

121
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,243
Risk your life to find her.

122
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:19,924
Hey Miranda!

123
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:23,969
Long time no see.

124
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,966
What brings you here?

125
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,809
This hotel is still open for business...

126
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:33,187
...though it will be demolished soon?

127
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:37,440
Well, Director Yoon said
we can operate until it is demolished.

128
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:41,653
Who the hell is he to
tell you to do or not to do?

129
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,209
You must have conspired with him.

130
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:48,945
You're sharing some secret
club profits with him, right?

131
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,531
Me? Not at all.

132
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:52,331
Don't you?

133
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:55,876
Then...

134
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:01,671
Did you take Jiyeon away?

135
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,320
What do you mean by that?

136
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:08,839
Jiyeon was held in this hotel.

137
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,425
There's no way you wouldn't know.

138
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,803
Ms. Han was here?

139
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:14,513
Fucking liar!

140
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,241
Why... why are you like this?

141
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,276
Stop lying and talk straight!

142
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:23,195
Who ordered it?

143
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:30,702
Do you want me to call the police
to storm the scene right now?

144
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:32,621
The scene?

145
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,742
You guys are selling drugs
in the basement now.

146
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,584
Say it.

147
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:42,623
If you don't speak up,
I'll call the police right away.

148
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,420
Because of the war on drugs these days,

149
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,553
the sentences will probably be very high.

150
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,772
Blue Lagoon...

151
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:03,329
Because it is top quality,

152
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,267
it is a bit of a waste to use for work.

153
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,030
What?

154
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:08,782
Director Yoon?

155
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:11,993
Why that bastard?

156
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,621
That kind of thing...

157
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,537
If you're going to lie,
at least make it up.

158
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:23,623
Director Yoon is sent to save Jiyeon,

159
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,375
why does he make me do that?

160
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,885
The company is currently in
a very dangerous situation due to her risk.

161
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:31,733
I guess the Chairman
gave him a difficult order...

162
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:35,183
...to report her missing and
secretly send her abroad.

163
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,847
Ha, this old man does all sorts of things.

164
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:41,868
Okay.

165
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:42,892
By the way,

166
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,526
where is Jiyeon now?

167
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,085
<i>Reported video I exclusively obtained...</i>

168
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:54,070
<i>...could completely break Ms. Han</i>
<i>from the Bumaan construction.</i>

169
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,549
<i>The full version of the crackhead</i>
<i>girl's murderous drive...</i>

170
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:57,949
<i>...is out now!</i>

171
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:02,315
EXCLUSIVE ACQUISITION

172
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,498
<i>This is fucking 4D, 4D!</i>

173
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:07,041
Wow, they look alike.

174
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:10,021
Let's see how they look alike.

175
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:11,379
<i>Huh?</i>

176
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:47,063
Sister!

177
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,596
Wake up quickly.

178
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:53,546
Wake up quickly.

179
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:55,654
Wake up.

180
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,307
This is a dangerous place.

181
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:02,838
Youngjae!

182
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,845
<i>Owing to the drugs,</i>
<i>she is driving like crazy.</i>

183
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,805
<i>Hey! Booster up!</i>

184
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,106
They look alike so much.

185
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,734
The bitch who should die doesn't die.

186
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:53,190
<i>Isn't that a person.</i>

187
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,401
<i>Hey, that's not a person.</i>

188
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:21,432
Sister!

189
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,725
<i>Hey! Hey, slow down!</i>

190
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,102
<i>No, it's just a beast!</i>

191
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,313
<i>Oh, what a crab! They are human being.</i>

192
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:34,814
<i>Hey, stop!</i>

193
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:38,151
<i>- Hey, brake! Brake!</i>
<i>- Hey, stop!</i>

194
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:39,503
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

195
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,360
<i>I wanna roadkill!</i>

196
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,001
<i>- Are you crazy?</i>
<i>- You hit people, Jiyeon!</i>

197
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,204
<i>Hey, you fucking shit.</i>

198
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:51,581
<i>Shut up!</i>

199
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:54,685
<i>I've been in a good</i>
<i>mood for a long time...</i>

200
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,586
<i>...but you ruined it.</i>

201
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:06,936
Jiyeon Han!

202
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,272
I will definitely pay you back.

203
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:21,784
Club emergency door.

204
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,057
Hey, what is that?

205
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,041
- How did they get out?
- Seize them!

206
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,145
Please follow me.

207
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,881
Youngjae made it, Youngjae made it!

208
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,039
This way.

209
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:54,192
Jiyeon Han!

210
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,634
Stop!

211
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:05,036
Catch that bitch!

212
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:06,912
What are you guys?

213
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,793
Go get that bitch!

214
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:13,753
Youngjae!

215
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:24,864
Ugh!

216
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,335
Go! Go!

217
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,240
Back door! Back door!

218
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:50,832
Ji-yeon Han!

219
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,041
Catch her!

220
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:58,925
Hey, sister!

221
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,688
Stay still!

222
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:12,729
Stop!

223
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:14,763
The front and back doors are blocked.

224
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:15,906
Is there another way?

225
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,925
Is there another secret
passage that only you know?

226
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,330
If I say, I will be hit
by the chief manager.

227
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:20,153
Where is it?

228
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,660
Where is it?

229
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:30,084
Take this up and get off at
the kitchen on the 4th floor.

230
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:33,031
Go straight up the stairs 4, 3...

231
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,393
Open it quickly, you bastard!

232
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:37,235
Second floor?

233
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,172
There is an emergency
door at the end of the hallway.

234
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,532
You'd better tell me earlier.

235
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,683
I am now dead to the chief manager.

236
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,171
Hey! You stop there!

237
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,052
Shit!

238
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:07,591
Youngjae!

239
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,083
If I go out, I will definitely
come back to pick you up.

240
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,710
Until then, take care of yourself.

241
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,212
When are you going to teach Taekwondo?

242
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,865
You promised me earlier.

243
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,969
Okay, then let me give you a quick tip.

244
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:23,507
Good.

245
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:28,179
When bad guys come and
fight with you, you do like this.

246
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,056
One shot one kill!

247
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,117
Ugh.

248
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,066
Hey! Why are you doing this to me?

249
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,652
Wow! One shot one kill! Great!

250
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:44,779
Amazing!

251
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:48,257
Stop!

252
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,101
This is what the chief
manager did to you, right?

253
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:03,177
It's because I...
Youngjae did something wrong.

254
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:09,929
She went too far,
even more than using people for free.

255
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:16,211
Hey! Where does this go?

256
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:17,406
Uh?

257
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:20,937
What are you doing, bastard?

258
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:22,206
Go up quickly and find her!

259
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,952
Yep!

260
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:27,076
Fuck these guys!

261
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,702
Youngjae, you are hiding here.

262
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,965
They'll follow soon.

263
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:42,170
I am okay.

264
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,213
One shot one kill.

265
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,923
What the fuck?

266
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,907
What is this? Damn, it's so fucking slow!

267
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,469
Fucking shitty elevator.

268
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,992
Ouch, hey!

269
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:58,461
Hey, wait a minute!

270
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,412
Fuck! What is this?

271
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:03,946
Hey, what is this? Take this out quickly.

272
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,859
Hey!

273
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:07,074
Ahh!!!

274
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:14,410
Stop there.

275
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,393
Youngjae, hurry up and hide!

276
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,156
Catch her!

277
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,478
Shit!

278
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:01,142
Damn it!

279
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,356
What is this guy?

280
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:11,235
What the fuck is he?

281
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,659
What happened?

282
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,161
What the hell is this?

283
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:25,457
Ha...

284
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:29,680
Oh fuck!

285
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:47,480
This is it.

286
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,906
Hey, get out of the way.

287
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:19,803
Hey! What is this shit?

288
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:21,805
That's the kid next to Jiyeon earlier.

289
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,974
Hey! You bastard!

290
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,382
Why are you following Jiyeon
Han around instead of working?

291
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,298
Where is she? Where is she?

292
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:52,007
Youngjae is not a slave.

293
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,504
What?

294
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:56,965
What did you say? Uh?

295
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,510
Hey! Get out of the way!

296
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:04,973
Where is Jiyeon Han?

297
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,373
Where is she hiding? Spit it out!

298
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,437
Jiyeon Han never came here today.

299
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:12,773
Not here.

300
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,154
You don't understand what I'm saying.

301
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:23,139
Hey! Stand up!

302
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:25,374
It's okay! You stand up!

303
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:30,933
Shit!

304
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:37,381
Fuck! I can't bear you anymore.

305
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:38,938
Bring him out!

306
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,589
I will pay you what you deserve!

307
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:56,438
I don't know
if I'll hit the ball well today.

308
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,613
I haven't played in a while.

309
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,885
Hey! You bastard!

310
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,579
Look straight ahead.

311
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:10,498
Tell me quickly.

312
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:15,312
If you don't, your head
will be blown away by the target.

313
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:07,263
Hey, my lovely sister
is struggling too much.

314
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:16,574
I KILL U
