TAEKWONDO CHAMPIONSHIP
52nd Korean Taekwondo Federation Cup

5
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:22,952
Sun-woo, I'm sorry...

6
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,082
...but, let's just do this once, okay?

7
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,687
I will do it to the best of my ability.

8
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:28,405
What?

9
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,983
I will do it...

10
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:32,938
...to the best of my ability.

11
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,923
If Da-young doesn't win this time...

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,039
...he will not get
grades for college.

13
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,293
You're going to be in the national team anyway.

14
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:42,713
So, please help Da-young...

15
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:44,213
...so he wins, yeah?

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,055
Da-young is the President Director's daughter.

17
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,058
If we make the President Director uncomfortable.

18
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,688
Our team could be disbanded.

19
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,180
If our team is disbanded...

20
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,603
...you're going to blame me?

21
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,559
Sun-woo!

22
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,310
You will understand...

23
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,412
...in this match
compared to ability...

24
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:01,706
...there is something more important.

25
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,833
If you help...

26
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,022
...Predsdir will...

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,152
...give you support.

28
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,071
You will be an athlete
for a long time, right?

29
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,624
Win Olympic Medals too.

30
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,209
Then that...

31
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:23,961
...give it to your mother.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,338
His business is currently difficult.

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,657
<i>Start.</i>

34
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,094
<i>Ever heard of the way</i>
<i>to tame an elephant?</i>

35
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:51,847
<i>Since I was very little...</i>

36
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,311
<i>...his feet were tied to stakes.</i>

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,396
<i>The elephant whose feet were tied for that long...</i>

38
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,517
<i>...even though he weighs 300kg...</i>

39
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,335
<i>...he will remain silent there...</i>

40
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,687

41
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,903

42
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,416

44
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,006

Five.

50
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,744
Six.

51
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,398
You can't stand it, can you?

52
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,595
Come here.

53
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,642
Unlucky.

54
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,094
Stop!

55
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,674
What are you actually doing?

56
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,011
What if he really breaks down?

57
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,368
You told me to lose, right?

58
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:42,305
Therefore I am disqualified!

59
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:42,808
What?

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,663
Are you crazy?

61
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,094
You don't want to be an athlete anymore?

62
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:54,244
Then, I...

63
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,448
...don't need that kind of money.

64
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,616
Just give it to your mother.

65
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,278
Hey, Kang Sun-woo.

66
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,331
Kang Sun Woo.

67
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:24,315
What?

68
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,053
Why are you like that to Da-young?

69
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,313
If you lose, you just give up.

70
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:29,980
But, why did you suddenly
do <i>a Knee Kick</i> ?

71
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,508
Are you Ronda Rosie from UFC?

72
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,109
Don't talk nonsense, move aside.

73
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,344
What a rude person.

74
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,782
Hey! Hey!

75
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:41,735
Damn it.

76
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,719
Damn bastard.

77
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,332
You shamelessly cheat.

78
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:50,821
At least take the money too.

79
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,774
How are you?

80
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:53,295
Your nose is broken?

81
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,321
I'm upset, but...

82
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,024
...I will take the opportunity
to make my nose sharper.

83
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,587
You gave him money?

84
00:05:58,635 --> 00:05:59,361
Don't know!

85
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,220
I think my dad gave it to me
because it bothers him.

86
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:06,058
Usually the beggars will
cooperative if given money.

87
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,711
This one is a bit different, though.

88
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,727
What a funny bitch.

89
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,996
Hey!

90
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:15,633
You've won many times,
Just giving up once is possible.

91
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,360
Even though I was given money,
but instead it creates problems.

92
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,055
You beggar!

93
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:35,078
What?

94
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,578
You do not like?

95
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,006
What do you want?

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,342
No need to talk too much.

97
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,826
Damn it!

98
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,399
You damn bitch!

99
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,689
You hit me?

100
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,774
You hit first, okay?

101
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,680
Damn, yeah. What do you want?

102
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,102
Hey...

103
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,360
Byeong-cheon!

104
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,164
Get out all of you, damn it!

105
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,219
Just wait for you!

106
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,123
Don't run away!

107
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,665
Damn it.

108
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,993
Damn it!

109
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:32,809
Okay.

110
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,414
Crazy woman!

111
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:05,176
Correct.

112
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,750
I'm a crazy woman
who received the money.

113
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,154
But...

114
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:10,922
...the number is too small...

115
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,017
...so, I return it.

116
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,727
Don't talk if you don't know.

- Hey...
- No need to fight.

125
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,939
Be careful.

I feel tired too...

131
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,836
Driver Kang, let's go.

132
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,046
Where did you get that from?

133
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:46,609
He just needs to earn a living.

134
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:48,298
Why are you like that?

135
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,908
- The important thing is to eat?
- Of course!

136
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:10,802
Mother.

137
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,026
I'm a little late.

138
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,069
Forgive me.

139
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:14,514
I had a lot of work earlier.

How are you today?

141
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,814
Is today better than yesterday?

142
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,600
Don't worry,
tomorrow will be better.

143
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:28,792
The doctor already said...

144
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,381
...as long as the operation goes smoothly...

145
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,990
...Mom can go back to the way she was before.

146
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:35,744

00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,599
...I only can
thinking about my sick mother.

189
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:21,933
Sun Woo.

190
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:23,101
What?

191
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:26,831
According to you...

192
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,877
...what is the truth
your mother wanted?

193
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,442
May be...

194
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,570
...he wants you to live
for yourself.

195
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,363
What do you mean?

196
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:37,699
You've done your best.

197
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:39,951
Don't talk like that.

198
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:41,995
I will not give up.

199
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,518
I will collect money...

200
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,167
...to perform the operation.

201
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,467
The doctor said it was difficult...

202
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,377
No.

203
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,255
I will definitely wake him up.

204
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,120
Because this is all my fault.

205
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,039
Hey.

206
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,809
- Should I sell my organs?
- What?

207
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,159
Do you have any information on organ sellers?

208
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,518
Hey, why do you say that?

209
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,646
Oh, did you see that video?

210
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:08,855
What?

211
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,913
Bumaan Construction's grandson...

212
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:13,006
...he once made a fuss
with drugs...

213
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:15,197
...but now he said
disappeared after a hit and run.

214
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,635
Crazy woman.

215
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,737
This time he must be in prison, right?

216
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,507
In this world of money...

217
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,151
...will definitely be covered with money.

218
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,592
So far his face has not been revealed...

219
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:26,248
...finally, the photo was uploaded.

220
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:27,592
Watch the video...

221
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,846
...it looks like he bought it
all collections for one season...

222
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,086
...wear it, then throw it away.

223
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:33,630
Isn't that a waste of money?

224
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:38,051
Even though there are people who do it
part-time work for hospital expenses.

225
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,599
Hey.

226
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,185
You look a bit like him.

227
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,298
What?

228
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,671
<i>- Hello. Are you having fun in class?</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

229
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:58,314
<i>Come on up.</i>

230
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,548
HAN JI-YEON'S KILLER!
BECOME A DRIVER AT THE COURSE

231
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,878
<i>- Hey...</i>
<i>- No need to fight.</i>

232
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:03,725
<i>Be careful.</i>

233
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,537
HAN JI-YEON'S KILLER!
BECOME A DRIVER AT THE COURSE

234
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,340
What are you guys actually doing?

235
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:20,427
You guys can't work well...

236
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:22,137
...until the article spreads?

237
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,389
Do you all want to be fired?

238
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,683
We are having a meeting regarding this matter...

239
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,159
...even according to the Prosecutor...

240
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,020
...it would be hard to ignore it.

241
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,329
Since the YouTuber's video went viral...

242
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,189
...it seems like...

243
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:36,026
...video report too
spread through him.

244
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:38,528
Who's he?

245
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,712
Which bastard tried
kill Ji-yeon...

246
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:44,075
...by spreading that fake video?

247
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:46,703
Hey.

248
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:47,996
Director Seo.

249
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:49,201
Why me...

250
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,879
...spend a lot of money
to take you from the prosecutor's office?

251
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:55,145
Damn it! Didn't I bring you?
to take care of things like this?

252
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:55,837
Correct.

253
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:59,334
We have not confirmed yet
the fake video...

254
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:01,186
...but, this case is very serious...

255
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,719
...didn't two people die?

256
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:04,846
To divert public opinion...

257
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,265
...it looks like Miss Han has to show up.

258
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,475
Hey.

259
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:12,646
Now you...

260
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,066
...suspecting Ji-yeon?

261
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,605
The previous case was also unfair to him.

262
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,514
He was framed by his friend.

263
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:21,600
Yes

264
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,175
We will try to prove it
that he is innocent...

265
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,030
...if you can't...

266
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,143
...we will use mental reasoning...

267
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:26,929
Enough!

268
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,764
Rather than me believing
weak people like you...

269
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,662
...I'd better leave it to you
to Director Yoon.

270
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,101
He will arrive soon.

271
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:34,928
What?

272
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:35,748
Director Yoon?

273
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:36,644
Mr. President Director...

274
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,747
...the company's reputation is bad...

275
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,741
<i>...why did you call Director Yoon?</i>

276
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:42,735
<i>Is there any reason to call?</i>
<i>Director Yoon's thug?</i>

277
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,631
Oh my gosh, you guys!

278
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,100
Do you have a doctorate?

279
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:50,350
You guys are the same.

280
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,516
From now on this case
will be handled by Director Yoon...

281
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,146
...you just support it as best you can.

282
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,022
President Director.

283
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:23,508
Besides, I have no intention of letting you go.
hanging around too long.

284
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,011
This is also an emergency.

285
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,345
President Director.

286
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:29,848
Before it gets any harder...

287
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:32,475
...you have to sell the company.

288
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,194
Sambo Group is a good offer.

289
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,569
Too much bad news...

290
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,069
...will endanger Miss Han.

291
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,032
Of course.

292
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,160
After going through the transition process...

293
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,015
...There is no point
maintain the company.

294
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:55,665
Oh yes.

295
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:57,584
Have you found out?

296
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,629
The person who reported
fake videos to prosecutors and YouTubers.

297
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,616
<i>If Han Ji-yeon is imprisoned...</i>

298
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,686
<i>...who will benefit more?</i>

299
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,570
Hey, Burger.

300
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,057
Why don't you release it?
the recording I sent?

301
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:15,872
After releasing it,
The prosecutor's office will also take action, right?

302
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,147
You don't know <i>Leverage</i> ?

303
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,747
Oh, damn.

304
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,024
Hey.

305
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,155
How much money can be earned
by sucking the coin?

306
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:27,423
I'll take care of it.

307
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,819
Be sure to release everything tomorrow!

308
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,411
Damn hacker.

309
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:47,449
Deputy Han.

310
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:48,659
What?

311
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:50,084
Have you checked?

312
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:50,887
Already.

313
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,348
President Director Han raised
Director Yoon's return.

314
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,265
What?

315
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,936
I quietly turned on the antenna...

316
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,814
...looks like a slush fund investigation
will be done soon.

317
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,707
Miss Han's problem is already complicated...

318
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,442
...and if the problem
embezzlement of funds revealed...

319
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,028
...then it will be more difficult
to be completed.

320
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,694
It's better now 700 billion won...

321
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,199
...washed as a safe asset.

322
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,326
The important thing is, we sell the company first.

323
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:14,702
That bitch, Ji-yeon...

324
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,706
...already at the edge of the abyss,
so they tried to help him.

325
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,772
But...

326
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:23,920
...hearing it makes me upset.

327
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:32,217
Manager Shin.

328
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,608
You think I'm your subordinate?

329
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:34,984
Calling me "Deputy Han"...

330
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,217
...you think I'm your subordinate!

331
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,350
Son of a bitch!

332
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:40,540
I was wrong...

333
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,688
...I apologize...

334
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:42,856
...Director Han.

335
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:48,045
Even though I'm not his biological grandson...

336
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,213
...I've worked hard.

337
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,295
He only cares about Ji-yeon, damn it.

338
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,199
Ji-yeon...

339
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:57,786
...is my only descendant...

340
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,372
...so I can't
let it fall into the dirt.

341
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:04,760
That Miss Han...

342
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,920
...very lucky.

343
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:07,756
Let's wait and see...

344
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,264
...when the recording is released on YouTube...

345
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,889
...he would definitely go straight to jail.

346
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,709
So who won?

347
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:20,343
Of course it's you, Director Han.

348
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,674
The footage I captured will be very powerful.

349
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:24,110
Like a punch.

350
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:25,224
Damn it.

351
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,113
Can be.

352
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:29,211
Possible...

353
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:30,612
...yes...

354
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,488
...a blow is still a blow.

355
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,282
I'm trying to be the heir.

356
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:36,618
Hey.

357
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,786
Find out where Ji-yeon is hiding.

358
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:41,331
It would be difficult if
Director Yoon has already made his move.

359
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:46,036
It looks really delicious.

360
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:49,741
Very similar.

361
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:51,795
Absolutely similar.

362
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:53,802
You think it's a goose?

363
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,600
What are you doing?

364
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:58,459
What are you doing?

365
00:19:58,499 --> 00:19:59,602
Why take my picture?

366
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:00,980
The killer talks a lot.

367
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,100
What did you say?

368
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:04,247
Mom hit and killed someone, right?

369
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,082
What do you mean?

370
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,834
Here is the proof.

371
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:08,851
Hard to believe.

372
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,225
Wow, there's even proof.

373
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,703
Hey, you...

374
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:15,773
...What's this?

375
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:16,790
Wow, seriously.

376
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:17,786
Wow.

377
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,996
- I'll go first!
- Me too.

378
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,598
- Min-jae!
- His phone was taken?

379
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,331
Why take someone else's phone?

380
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:25,643
Why was it taken?

381
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:26,459
What's this?

382
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,100
The day before yesterday I uploaded your photo...

383
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,733
...there are already 20,000 people who have seen it.

384
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:31,788
Extraordinary!

385
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,951
What?

386
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,449
Hey, Min-jae!

387
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:36,838
Hey!

388
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,047
Help!

389
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,741
We are being chased by killers!

390
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:40,968
Blurry!

391
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:42,608
We are being chased by killers!

392
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,405
- Mother!
- Blurry!

393
00:20:56,976 --> 00:20:57,698
Good afternoon.

394
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:01,119
Pleased to meet you.

395
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:03,997
What do you need?

396
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,491
I'm from Bumaan Construction.

397
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:07,834
So?

398
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,752
Do you have time?

399
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,546
Why?

400
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:13,293
You've heard, right?

401
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:15,092
Grandson of the President Director of Bumaan Construction...

402
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:15,967
Han Ji-yeon.

403
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,944
Ah, sorry.

404
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:23,007
Looks like the kids are joking...

405
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,273
...so I will ask for it to be deleted.

406
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:25,331
No need.

407
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,723
We have already taken action on that.

408
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:29,908
I want to talk...

409
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,757
...for a moment in a quiet place.

410
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,401
What?

411
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:34,629
YOON SEK-HYEON

412
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,131
Thank you for taking the time.

413
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:37,389
Please sit.

414
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,530
Let me introduce myself.

415
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,167
My name is Yoon Seok-hyeon.

416
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:45,857
Oh, yes.

417
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:47,499
What do you want to talk about?

418
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:54,547
You guys are so alike.

419
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,255
Can't even be distinguished
in one glance.

420
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:02,430
I was quite surprised.

421
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,891
What do you actually want to talk about?

422
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,684
Han Ji-yeon...

423
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,062
...in three days
will be summoned by the prosecutor.

424
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:10,772
So?

425
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,607
Now he is on Jeju Island.

426
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,600
He was very afraid to come to Seoul.

427
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,622
Especially...

428
00:22:17,774 --> 00:22:20,028
...if there are lots of reporters
and YouTubers who came.

429
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,470
Due to the disease he suffered from...

430
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,285
...he could have a seizure.

431
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,579
What does it have to do with me?

432
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,789
Whether...

433
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,926
...you've heard
the term <i>Kagemusha</i> ?

434
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:33,228
<i>Kagemusha?</i>

435
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,637
<i>If Miss Han appears at Jeju airport...</i>

436
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,850
<i>...there will be many reporters</i>
<i>and YouTubers who came.</i>

437
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,151
Han Ji-yeon, all this time
You escaped the investigation...

438
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:48,326
...How do you feel
when summoned by the prosecutor?

439
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:51,039
Is it true that you are driving?
under the influence of drugs?

440
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,286
Han Ji-yeon, please leave a comment!

441
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,359
<i>After that, the real Han Ji-yeon</i>
<i>will arrive at the airport.</i>

442
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:08,946
<i>Yes, it is true.</i>

443
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,442
<i>I would like to ask...</i>

444
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:11,858
<i>...help to you...</i>

445
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,128
<i>...to divert attention</i>
<i>as Han Ji-yeon.</i>

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,005
So...

447
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:22,286
...You want...

448
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,445
...I pretend
become Han Ji-yeon?

449
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,033
More or less like that.

450
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,199
That's a scam, right?

451
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,101
You ask me to cheat?

452
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:31,519
Not cheating...

453
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:34,247
...but only helps
for the meantime.

454
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:35,683
After seeing the condition...

455
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,775
...your mother's hospital bill is quite a lot.

456
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,609
If you are willing to help us...

457
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,071
...we will pay off...

458
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,615
...and pay for your mother's operation.

459
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:50,054
I'm sure you're confused...

460
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,497
...please think about it and let me know tomorrow.

461
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:57,962
You all are so selfish.

462
00:23:58,388 --> 00:23:59,922
Worse than I heard.

463
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:03,092
You think with money,
Can you buy other people?

464
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,470
Want to pretend to be him?

465
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,597
The person who had an accident
under the influence of drugs?

466
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,174
I'm not interested.

467
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,882
So please solve it yourself.

468
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,520
Ji-yeon didn't do this.

469
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,654
He is not a person who
will use drugs.

470
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:24,906
So?

471
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,449
Kang Sun-woo...

472
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:28,889
...have you ever been misunderstood?

473
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,131
Have you ever felt unfair?

474
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,131
His parents died when he was little...

475
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:35,583
...he was wrong...

476
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:38,544
...but, all the rumors
and news about it...

477
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:40,755
...That is not true.

478
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:43,155
I can't tell you the details.

479
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,070
But, because he became
heir from an early age...

480
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,358
...makes all the hatred and envy...

481
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:48,888
...delegated to him.

482
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,353
Once again I say...

483
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,536
...we are not trying...

484
00:24:58,607 --> 00:24:59,940
...to bribe you.

485
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:01,108
But...

486
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,110
...asking for your help.

487
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,384
In order to straighten it out
misunderstanding...

488
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:06,822
...and reveal the truth...

489
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,245
...we ask you to
help Miss Han.

490
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,677
Are you coming early?

491
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:18,690
Doesn't work?

492
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,065
Yes, I finished early.

493
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,725
So, I want to be with my mother.

494
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:23,252
That, Hee-su...

495
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:26,751
...grandson of Bumaan Construction
what you were talking about yesterday...

496
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,376
That crazy rich woman?

497
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,637
Have you heard?

498
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,555
They say he's a psychopath.

499
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,267
He said he saw
all those people are under him.

500
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,768
What is wrong with her?

501
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:36,561
Oh?

502
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:39,087
I...

503
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:41,065
...very similar to him?

504
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:48,204
CUCU BUMAAN CONSTRUCTION CASE

505
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,676
<i>Because of that...</i>

506
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,881
<i>...I'm talking about</i>
<i>conglomerate heir, Han Ji-yeon.</i>

507
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:56,197
<i>He uses drugs</i>
<i>and hit two people.</i>

508
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,514
<i>But, instead of being arrested...</i>

509
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:01,522
<i>...does it make sense if he</i>
<i>still living comfortably at home?</i>

510
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,808
<i>Because he was born into a rich family...</i>

511
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:05,940
<i>...so life must be funny</i>
<i>and boring.</i>

512
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,949
<i>Finally he became a user...</i>

513
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:10,201
<i>...and crashed his car into people.</i>

514
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,863
<i>Hey, brothers and sisters.</i>

515
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:15,225
<i>Tomorrow night I will reveal</i>
<i>very shocking footage.</i>

516
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:17,677
<i>This is a recording report</i>
<i>exclusive that I got...</i>

517
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:21,272
<i>...and if this releases,</i>
<i>Han Ji-yeon's life will be instantly destroyed.</i>

518
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:27,028
<i>But...</i>

519
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,821
<i>...asking for your help.</i>

520
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,192
<i>In order to straighten it out</i>
<i>misunderstanding...</i>

521
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:32,786
<i>...and reveal the truth...</i>

522
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,622
<i>...we ask you to</i>
<i>help Miss Han.</i>

523
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:41,417
I don't know which one is right.

524
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:45,630
Please answer me.

525
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:56,880
Building rights in Banho yesterday...

526
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:59,352
...I heard we got it.

527
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,372
My senior at school is
CEO at Cheonyang Construction...

528
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,773
...so, I'm relying on it a little bit.

529
00:27:04,478 --> 00:27:05,501
Good work.

530
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:13,702
When your mother
take you the first time...

531
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:16,994
...I do not expect
can rely on you like this.

532
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:18,704
What does it mean?

533
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,165
I owe you one?

534
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:25,002
But...

535
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:26,629
...Grandpa...

536
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,131
...Ji-yeon's case this time...

537
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:31,359
...what will Grandpa do?

538
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:32,510
Your little brother...

539
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:36,263
...it seems like he...

540
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,557
...manipulated by evil demons.

541
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,396
I've asked Director Yoon
to overcome it.

542
00:27:43,717 --> 00:27:45,231
He is reliable.

543
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:47,268
Director Yoon?

544
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:49,670
I know what you want to say.

545
00:27:49,822 --> 00:27:50,528
At that time...

546
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,714
...Director Yoon is not in jail
also because I asked my senior.

547
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,151
If people knew that he was still involved
in corporate matters...

548
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,202
...the company's reputation will get worse.

549
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,079
However, he...

550
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,747
...when I build
this company...

551
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,668
...he who does the dirty work
and brought me to this position.

552
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:06,869
