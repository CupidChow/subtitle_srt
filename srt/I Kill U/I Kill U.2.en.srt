1
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:47,778
I KILL U

2
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:54,721
EPISODE TWO
KAGEMUSHA

3
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,515
Oh, fucking bitch!

4
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:02,791
How can I find her hiding
in such a remote villa?

5
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,418
What about Director Yoon?

6
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:08,087
He seems to go to Jeju
today to take care of Ms. Han.

7
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,922
Fuck, I knew it.

8
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:11,424
By the way...

9
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:16,762
...I need to get her share transferred
before she goes to the prosecution.

10
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,890
Can you get rid of Director Yoon?

11
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:22,101
Right now, we don't even have a choice.

12
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:25,354
Thus, I picked some
men who are well trained.

13
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:26,979
Let's look.

14
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:33,237
Are these guys?

15
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,113
Yes, Boss.

16
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:38,325
Oh, looking good.

17
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:41,697
Hey, take off your shirts.

18
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:42,663
Pardon?

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,540
Take off your shirts in three seconds.

20
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:45,958
Execute.

21
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,049
This guy has a nice body.

22
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,305
Hey! Take it off quickly.

23
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:19,407
From now on, you do push up 100 times.

24
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,577
Roll on the floor and take
as much money as you can.

25
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:26,249
The one who sticks the
most will be a vanguard.

26
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:27,290
Ah!

27
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,752
And if this task is successful...

28
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,089
...I will give him 100
million won separately.

29
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,465
100 million?

30
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,324
I go first.

31
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:03,953
Stop!

32
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,309
This is Ms. Han.

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,434
Would you say hello?

34
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:40,573
Ms. Han, this is Ms. Kang I mentioned.

35
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:41,382
Yes.

36
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:43,650
I am Jiyeon Han.

37
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:49,415
I am Sunwoo Kang.

38
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,710
We really look alike.

39
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,337
Ms. Han!

40
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,797
Do you understand my plan, right?

41
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,217
Now you don't have to
worry about going outside.

42
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:05,472
How about you, Ms. Kang?

43
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,184
If there's nothing to worry about,
let's proceed.

44
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:09,874
No!

45
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:14,231
No matter how much
I think about it, I can't do it.

46
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:14,982
Why?

47
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:17,193
I don't do it.

48
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,907
No, I can't.

49
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,450
I am sorry.

50
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:29,581
Wait a moment.

51
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,586
Ms. Han! You must do it.

52
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,797
I also brought Ms. Kang with difficulty.

53
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:39,422
Director Yoon!

54
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,926
Thank you for your hard work,

55
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:45,242
but I'm having a hard time
with this situation.

56
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:51,143
I am sorry.

57
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:52,478
You've come a long way.

58
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:54,897
Ah...

59
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:58,067
Even though I submitted
explanation materials,

60
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,236
the prosecution issued an order to appear.

61
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,780
There's no way to avoid it anymore.

62
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,037
So, I asked you to find that friend.

63
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,702
I'm looking for her.

64
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,788
I even checked she boarded
a plane to New York last week...

65
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,624
...she was the only friend I trusted...

66
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,583
How could she do this to me...

67
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:17,962
If you don't show up by tomorrow,

68
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,844
the prosecution will force you
to stand in the photo line.

69
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:25,136
Portals and broadcasts will be
plastered with articles about you.

70
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,472
Is that the only way?

71
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,474
Yes.

72
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,476
You must appear and explain yourself.

73
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,521
How many times do I have to say this?

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,482
I told you I lent the car to my friend.

75
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,484
My grandfather bought it for me...

76
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,361
...but she asked me to ride it just once...

77
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:57,793
I know.

78
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,838
But neither the prosecutors
nor the people believe it.

79
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,799
I didn't do it!

80
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,218
Why don't you trust me?

81
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:09,931
It's always been like this.

82
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,749
In the end,

83
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,559
no one believes in me.

84
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,898
Truth and facts are
different things, right?

85
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,114
Because no one can know the truth anyway,

86
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:25,378
people only believe in facts.

87
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:28,782
It doesn't matter whether
the facts are true or fabricated.

88
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:31,577
Anyway, there is no other way.

89
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,330
You should claim your
innocence as much as possible.

90
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,377
Ms. Han?

91
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:38,543
Ms. Han?

92
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:42,087
Ms. Han?

93
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,241
Ms. Han?

94
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,720
Breathe slowly.

95
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,141
Is she okay?

96
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,102
She has asthma.

97
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:58,562
Is there anyone outside?

98
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,692
Take her to the room quickly.

99
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:04,318
Yes, sir!

100
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:06,792
Don't you bring her to the hospital?

101
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,323
If she goes to the hospital now,
reporters will flock to her.

102
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:10,783
Bring her to the bed.

103
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,039
Her symptoms seem severe,
so she needs to go to the hospital.

104
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,467
No, for security reasons.

105
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,804
Then call a doctor instead.

106
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:17,957
It's no use.

107
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,296
People here are usually like this.

108
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:28,676
Because the company
comes before the people.

109
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,180
Ms. Han!

110
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,434
Rest in your room.

111
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,270
No going out and no calling
until you appear in prosecution.

112
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,689
Would you mind?

113
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,568
Why are you asking me?

114
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:48,007
You always did what you wanted.

115
00:07:56,658 --> 00:07:58,247
Aren't you being too hard on her?

116
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,503
I'm sorry for making you miss out.

117
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,213
I never thought she would be so stubborn...

118
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,758
I can't help it because she doesn't want.

119
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,052
Leave on the first flight tomorrow.

120
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,221
I will return your cell phone then.

121
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:16,349
Director Yoon!

122
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:19,785
I'm not sure about the
company or security situation...

123
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,243
...but she is sick.

124
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,021
Ms. Kang!

125
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,231
I don't think this is something
you may interfere with.

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,818
I will pay you generously
for your effort to get here.

127
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:30,154
Sleep today and return quietly tomorrow.

128
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:35,564
Oh, Manager Noh!

129
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,537
Yes, 7 PM our time.

130
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,141
Concerning simultaneously connecting
with President Mao in the Philippines,

131
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,460
make sure the Philippines side is ready.

132
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:45,419
Okay.

133
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:51,257
- Please be safe.
- Ah!

134
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:53,393
Stand guard to prevent
outsiders from accessing.

135
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,178
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:21,806
<i>She killed two people while</i>
<i>driving under the influence of drugs.</i>

137
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,474
Ah! That crazy rich girl?

138
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,684
<i>They say she thinks of</i>
<i>all other people as stupid.</i>

139
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,877
<i>Ms. Kang, have you ever been misunderstood?</i>

140
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:30,547
<i>Truth and facts are different things.</i>

141
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,008
Why don't you trust me?

142
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,426
It's always been like this.

143
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:39,700
In the end, no one believes in me.

144
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,048
Ahh!

145
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,746
Ms. Han!

146
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:05,082
Ms. Han!

147
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,265
Are you okay?

148
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,411
What's going on in Jeju Island?

149
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:47,583
Once you return, you should be in Seoul.

150
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:50,377
But you just take care
of my sister on Jeju Island,

151
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,379
so, I feel bad.

152
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:55,423
Well, this is the most
important thing to me.

153
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,009
Please let me meet my sister.

154
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,762
There are lots of reporters lined up.

155
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:01,596
Impossible for security reasons.

156
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:08,368
I'm her brother.

157
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:10,564
I know it well.

158
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,107
Director Yoon!

159
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,445
What on earth are you plotting with her?

160
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,575
The Chairman is very worried
about Ms. Han's accident.

161
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:25,162
Wouldn't it be good for you as well
if I take care of it?

162
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:26,497
Hey, Director Yoon!

163
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:31,584
How long do you think
I'll be the deputy manager?

164
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:35,479
If she goes to jail this time,

165
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,675
she'll have to spend
there at least ten years.

166
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:41,595
Then I will inherit this company.

167
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:45,891
If you cooperate well with me this time...

168
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,935
...I will go to the end with you.

169
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:55,566
It was you who led Ms. Han into a trap!

170
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,485
Wasn't it?

171
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,254
Thanks to your mother's remarriage,

172
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,157
you've fortunately
become a Han's family member.

173
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:04,451
Please don't cross the line.

174
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:06,370
I won't tell the chairman.

175
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,164
What a fucking bastard!

176
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,135
Deputy manager Han!

177
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,514
No matter how hard you struggle,
you are just a sidekick.

178
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:33,605
Because you came down here...

179
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,441
...get some fresh sea breeze and go up.

180
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,745
Are you feeling better?

181
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:50,581
Ah yes…

182
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,334
I'm sorry, it's because of me.

183
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,520
BROTHER HOJUNG HAN
IS CALLING

184
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,019
Excuse me.

185
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:21,111
- Uh.
- <i>Hey, sister!</i>

186
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,989
<i>Why aren't you answering the phone?</i>

187
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:27,701
Why?

188
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,957
<i>Come to the California Hotel by 6 pm...</i>

189
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,083
<i>...quietly.</i>

190
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:37,628
Okay.

191
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,093
It's my older brother,
but we have different fathers.

192
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:51,934
This is a person
who does everything to kill me.

193
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:58,857
So...

194
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:00,942
I'll go back to my room now.

195
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,569
Call me again if you need me.

196
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:06,614
Hey, Ms. Kang!

197
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,202
Thank you so much.

198
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,583
Without you,
I would have been in big trouble.

199
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,878
You are my savior.

200
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,924
Maybe we must have been sisters
in our past lives.

201
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:25,759
Twins.

202
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,304
Right.

203
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,766
I was also surprised
by how similar we are...

204
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:34,769
...even our voice.

205
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,897
I feel like I'm looking in a mirror.

206
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:45,276
You've heard a lot about me, didn't you?

207
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,073
What kind of?

208
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:53,704
Aren't they calling me
a psychopath and druggie?

209
00:14:57,805 --> 00:14:59,751
They say I did something I didn't do.

210
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:04,798
At some point, they didn't
even believe anything I said.

211
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,846
Sometimes there is smoke without fire.

212
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,389
It's not my fault
that I was born into a rich family.

213
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:34,745
Why do I have to suffer
from such bad rumors?

214
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,789
All kinds of rumors and
malicious comments...

215
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,919
Even though my parents
died in an accident...

216
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,295
...if I think about it...

217
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:47,674
...they were unhappy because
of me and ended up like that.

218
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:50,469
Ms. Han!

219
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,869
It's not your fault, so calm down.

220
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,474
And if you fall again...

221
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:57,017
Ms. Kang!

222
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:03,774
Director Yoon is very dangerous.

223
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:08,111
You should never do what he planned.

224
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:09,664
What?

225
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:11,281
That's not possible.

226
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:15,035
Go up to Seoul right now.

227
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,664
I don't want to commit a sin.

228
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,795
Hey, Ms. Han!

229
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,715
I'll do that for you.

230
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,986
I don't know you well but...

231
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,179
I don't think you're
the type of person to lie.

232
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:38,081
I'll do a good job as a stand-in.

233
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,867
Feel free to go to the prosecution,

234
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:41,186
tell them all about
the unfair circumstances...

235
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,107
...and make sure to clear your reputation.

236
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:47,275
No, it's not!

237
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:50,475
That's not what Director Yoon planned!

238
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,574
That bastard is planning to kill you.

239
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,713
Hello, Director Yoon!

240
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:10,340
Yes, I feel better.

241
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:12,425
In the evening?

242
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,179
No, don't come.

243
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,502
I said it couldn't happen.

244
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,308
I'd rather go to jail.

245
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:23,687
Even though I can be a sinner,
I can't be a devil.

246
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:26,982
So, please just go up to Seoul.

247
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,275
Director Yoon!

248
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,297
Director Yoon!

249
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,367
Ms. Han!

250
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:39,447
What do you mean by killing?

251
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,873
Director Yoon said
that he would come in the evening.

252
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,541
You must get out of here before then.

253
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,126
Take it off quickly.

254
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,587
What are you doing? Why is this happening?

255
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,477
You need to quickly change clothes
and go out before the sun sets.

256
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,757
If you keep staying here,
Director Yoon will kill you.

257
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:54,992
- Hurry up!
- Killing me?

258
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:56,360
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:59,363
It's impossible to prove
that I'm not guilty anyway.

260
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:03,017
That's why Director Yoon found
a double to sacrifice herself for me.

261
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:05,201
What?

262
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:09,332
You are that double who went
around pretending to be me,

263
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:12,026
took drugs, and got into a car accident.

264
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,738
He's going to disguise it,
get rid of you...

265
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:18,324
...and blame you
for everything that happened!

266
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:30,629
I'll go to Busan Port right away.

267
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:34,927
What?

268
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:36,551
At the airport?

269
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,054
Why is he going up?

270
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,725
Well... Anyway, it went well.

271
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,260
There's a 50/50 chance
that she'll get out of the villa.

272
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,930
If she doesn't come out,
go in and catch her.

273
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,065
Hey, Mr. Shin!

274
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,443
It will be harder when
Director Yoon returns.

275
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,571
Finish it before then for sure.

276
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,140
Ms. Han!

277
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:27,686
Where are you going?

278
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,981
I have somewhere to go for a moment.

279
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,026
If Director Yoon knew,
we would get in trouble...

280
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,540
Grandpa is at the hotel now.

281
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,708
I'll come back soon
just to see him quickly.

282
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,674
Yes, please come back quickly.

283
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,099
Ms. Kang!

284
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:33,547
Until you get out of here,
never forget you are Jiyeon Han.

285
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,670
Don't be polite to the security guards.

286
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,048
Ah! Take this.

287
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:42,052
My mom gave it to me,
so make sure to wear it when you go out.

288
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:47,315
It's going to get dark soon.

289
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,225
Get out quickly.

290
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:50,461
You, be careful too.

291
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,063
I am sorry.

292
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:24,845
What's that?

293
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:51,449
Hey, let's go!

294
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:52,517
Let's go! Huh?

295
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:56,168
Oh, look at this bitch.

296
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,922
Oh my, you idiot.

297
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:06,678
What are you doing, dude?

298
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:11,183
Go catch her!

299
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,547
Hey, get up!

300
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:44,174
Get up!

301
00:22:58,978 --> 00:22:59,939
Hey, hold her tight.

302
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:02,813
Stay still.

303
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:14,828
What is this bitch?

304
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:16,205
- Uh?
- Hey, hurry up.

305
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:20,084
One, two, three!

306
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,812
Ah, this damn bitch hurts me so much.

307
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:26,757
What the hell is she?

308
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:32,513
What is this bitch?

309
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,224
We never heard she fights well.

310
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:35,550
You right!

311
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:38,478
I heard that drug addicts
become stronger because of drug.

312
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,563
Let's load her the trunk.

313
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:56,120
Fuck! We almost got screwed.

314
00:23:57,315 --> 00:23:58,706
But who are these bastards?

315
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:00,708
Report to the Director Yoon.

316
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:03,602
There's someone else besides us
who is interfering with us.

317
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:04,336
Huh.

318
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:06,047
Let's move to California hotel first.

319
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:14,597
Boss!

320
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,949
They failed to kidnap Ms. Han.

321
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:18,687
What?

322
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,160
What happened?

323
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:21,478
<i>Because the vanguards are gone either,</i>

324
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,303
<i>I'm not sure what happened.</i>

325
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,192
These fucking idiots!

326
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,961
How can you even fail a simple task?

327
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,088
<i>I am so sorry, Boss.</i>

328
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,408
Could it be that they've been
hit back by Ms. Han?

329
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:35,384
Are you kidding me?

330
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:37,078
What kind of power does she have?

331
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,359
Director Yoon, that cunning bastard!

332
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:43,695
He must have noticed and taken action.

333
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:45,586
Director Yoon went up during the day...

334
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:48,514
<i>Her vehicle is moving</i>
<i>in a different direction from the villa.</i>

335
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,215
What?

336
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:50,769
How do you know that?

337
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,113
We track each other's locations.

338
00:24:53,747 --> 00:24:56,375
I don't think Director Yoon's kids
took her back.

339
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,684
Then who caught her? Damn it!

340
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,413
Find her quickly!

341
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:02,083
Yes, Boss!

342
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:03,410
I will send the expert right away.

343
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:08,567
- Open it.
- Yes, sir...

344
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,420
...500 million dollars.

345
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,492
Check it out.

346
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:39,223
Hello, Director!

347
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,642
<i>500 million dollars confirmed.</i>

348
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,269
<i>Call me when you get the results.</i>

349
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:44,562
Okay.

350
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:54,613
That's right.

351
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:56,157
It's 99.9%.

352
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:57,949
Okay, I see.

353
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,526
What about dollars?

354
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:04,749
500 million dollars confirmed.

355
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,709
I am waiting for the result.

356
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:08,961
They checked the purity and were satisfied.

357
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:10,254
Are they?

358
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,262
Then you would better finish it.

359
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,304
I checked 500 million dollars.

360
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:21,473
If everything is correct, let's proceed.

361
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,266
Okay.

362
00:26:22,432 --> 00:26:23,468
Let's exchange right away.

363
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:24,310
All right?

364
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,878
Huh.

365
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:35,571
What?

366
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:37,907
What kind of bastard are you?

367
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,161
Things almost went wrong.

368
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:42,829
I see.

369
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:46,123
Take care of her until
the drug party is held later.

370
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,337
Mr. Han! You bastard like a rat.

371
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:53,131
You're being a dick.

372
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,371
New drugs are prepared.

373
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,352
Yes.

374
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:03,284
Manager!

375
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,892
Twenty VIPs from Shanghai
will arrive at one o'clock.

376
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:08,260
I also gave a tip
that a good new drug came in.

377
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,022
Okay.

378
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:12,358
You go in and get ready to receive guests.

379
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,786
A lot of nice customers
are coming in today.

380
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:21,846
Even so, there is nothing
left after paying it over.

381
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,786
Ah! What about drugs?

382
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:24,959
Enough?

383
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:25,746
Sure.

384
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:29,458
I've prepared all kinds
of drugs for every taste.

385
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:33,270
The party starts at midnight.

386
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,131
No regular guests after 11 pm.

387
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:38,248
Because this hotel will be closing soon,

388
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:40,511
there are hardly any guests anyway.

389
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,818
Did you get a call from Director Yoon?

390
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:57,737
Go up to 7th floor.

391
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:59,363
Youngjae!

392
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:01,098
Come quickly and guide the guests.

393
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:02,271
Youngjae Oh!

394
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:03,081
I'm coming.

395
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,827
Yes, sister.

396
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,205
Ma-na-ger!

397
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:10,374
Yes, manager.

398
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,170
This way, please.

399
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:45,619
I KILL U

400
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:08,243
<i>You must have a lot of ransom money.</i>

401
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,498
<i>Ransom?</i>

402
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,401
<i>If Ji-yeon doesn't want to sign...</i>

403
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:12,856
<i>...what will you do?</i>

404
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,209
<i>It must end with</i>
<i>suicide or disappearance.</i>

405
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:18,215
<i>If he bothers you...</i>

406
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,714
<i>...handle it yourself.</i>

407
00:29:21,317 --> 00:29:22,158
<i>Let me go!</i>

408
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:24,535
<i>What is it like to be the</i>
<i>child of wealthy parents?</i>

409
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:31,720
<i>Sun-woo!</i>

410
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:33,284
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Kang Sun-woo is here!</i>

411
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,737
<i>Do you know me?</i>

412
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:36,893
<i>Winner of the</i>
<i>27th Youth Taekwondo Championship!</i>

413
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:42,569
<i>Kang Sun-woo is here!</i>

414
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:52,471
<i>Han Ji-yeon, who fled</i>
<i>after the hit-and-run...</i>

415
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:53,581
<i>...is disappeared.</i>

416
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:55,092
<i>It's almost perfect.</i>

417
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:57,251
<i>Miss, you look so much like...</i>

418
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:58,544
<i>...with Kang Sun-woo.</i>

419
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:05,059
I KILL U
