1
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:48,241
I KILL U

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,072
EPISODE THREE
HOTEL, CALIFORNIA

3
00:00:58,893 --> 00:00:59,807
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

4
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,447
Has the money been processed?

5
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,690
Yes, I've just finished
organizing the money in Busan.

6
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,119
Okay, good job.

7
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,152
I only trust you.

8
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,281
Ah! Deputy manager Han
needs to be arranged.

9
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:13,615
What's wrong with him?

10
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,166
<i>He is down here now...</i>

11
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>...and might be an obstacle.</i>

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,739
He's been running around to meet her.

13
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:22,618
He maybe can influence our plans.

14
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,799
What does he want?

15
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:27,079
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

16
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:28,540
To be a successor.

17
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,216
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

18
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,252
He doesn't even know what I think.

19
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,097
Even though he tries hard,
my successor is only Jiyeon.

20
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,867
<i>To someone who doesn't</i>
<i>have a single drop of my blood,</i>

21
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>I can't give all of mine.</i>

22
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,681
If he keeps getting in your way.

23
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:46,766
You may handle him as you please.

24
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:53,364
Yes, I understand.

25
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,859
I'll arrange everything by tonight.

26
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:12,007
What's that?

27
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:15,720
It isn't time to come yet, right?

28
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,633
<i>Hey, Misuk's mom!</i>

29
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,188
<i>Hey! Come out!</i>

30
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,106
<i>Ah, these bastards are...</i>

31
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,358
<i>I came here knowing everything.</i>

32
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,127
<i>Open the door.</i>

33
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:30,985
<i>Open the door!</i>

34
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:34,854
<i>Misuk's mom!</i>

35
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,378
<i>Open it quickly when I say nicely.</i>

36
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:40,465
<i>You are a dead meat!</i>

37
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,389
Who is that?

38
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,551
<i>I came here knowing everything.</i>

39
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,789
<i>Open the door, okay?</i>

40
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,041
<i>Open the door!</i>

41
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,670
Are you President Park?

42
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,714
Is Misuk's mom here? Huh?

43
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,417
Misuk's mom!

44
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,051
Misuk's mom!

45
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,228
I know you are here so come out quickly.

46
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,630
Hey, where are looking for?

47
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,890
I think you're in the wrong place.

48
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,303
Isn't Misuk's mom here?

49
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,137
What do you mean? Who is Misuk's mom?

50
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,639
My wife!

51
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,273
She's here inside.

52
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,118
Hey, can't you come out quickly?

53
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,504
Mister!

54
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,237
Why are you looking for your wife here?

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,446
She is not here, so you go back.

56
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,910
Ah! Here… is not?

57
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,491
Okay… Maybe not.

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,415
- Go back.
- Oh, but let me...

59
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,625
Hey! Go!

60
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:31,663
I am sorry.

61
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,380
Fuck! What an idiot.

62
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,284
Look at him! How funny he is.

63
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,436
He even can't take care
of his wife properly.

64
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,098
By the way, is this place
open for business?

65
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,838
Hey! You don't need to try to speak.

66
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,275
I know who you are, so just be quiet.

67
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,370
<i>Even if I look around,</i>
<i>this is the right place.</i>

68
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,080
Ha, that idiot.

69
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,416
- <i>Hey, you bitch!</i>
- That fucking bastard.

70
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,042
<i>You are dead meat today.</i>

71
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,090
Fuck you! Your wife is not here!

72
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,123
I know.

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,967
Ahh!

74
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,215
Fucking bastard!

75
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,426
Motherfucker!

76
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,105
Fucking bastard!

77
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:48,322
Son of a bitch.

78
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:52,736
You son of a bitch!

79
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,732
Ah, bullshit...

80
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,892
How dare this idiot use an axe?

81
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,483
You've been through a lot.

82
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,205
You asshole!

83
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,616
How dare you...

84
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,327
Who are you?

85
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,036
Me?

86
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,462
You don't need to know that.

87
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,457
You are Jiyeon Han, right?

88
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:40,851
What?

89
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,505
Because these assholes have made a mess,

90
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,214
I'm having a hard time.

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,894
Anyway, I'm sure I can ransom you well.

92
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,347
Ransom?

93
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,559
It has come!

94
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,983
Hello, Boss! This is Gaeko speaking.

95
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,784
The situation is over.

96
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:07,444
Really?

97
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,536
Put her on the phone.

98
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,113
Okay, just a moment.

99
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:13,700
Hello, sister!

100
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,186
Although you trusted me
for the first time and came out,

101
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,378
<i>What happened to you?</i>

102
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,672
Are you Jiyeon's brother?

103
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,424
<i>Right, your brother!</i>

104
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,591
<i>But why are you there?</i>

105
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,011
<i>What kind of bastards captured my sister?</i>

106
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,547
Director Yoon...

107
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,890
Director Yoon?

108
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,642
<i>Um... Jiyeon's brother!</i>

109
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,561
<i>I'm not Jiyeon Han.</i>

110
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,664
When I get out, I'll tell you everything.

111
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:36,813
Please release this.

112
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,069
Oh fuck! This is so fucking funny.

113
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,611
What is she talking about?

114
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:45,865
Phew.

115
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,301
<i>Because this bitch</i>
<i>is living life with drug,</i>

116
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,746
<i>I can't tell what's</i>
<i>nonsense and what's real.</i>

117
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:52,848
<i>Hey dude, you liar!</i>

118
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,875
Because you've always had
behavioral problems like a shit.

119
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,252
There are so many bastards targeting you.

120
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,215
<i>Isn't it like the victim</i>
<i>trying to get revenge?</i>

121
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,319
I'm not Jiyeon Han, but Sunwoo Kang!

122
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,779
Why are you doing this to me?

123
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,947
Release me quickly!

124
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,098
<i>Oh, yes! I will release you.</i>

125
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:12,362
Yes, quickly!

126
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,017
<i>Hey, Jiyeon.</i>

127
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,019
<i>Many people are living within you, right?</i>

128
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,104
They need to be released quickly.

129
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,231
That's a symptom of
multiple personalities.

130
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,609
What are you talking about?

131
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,155
<i>The side effects of drugs</i>
<i>are more severe than I thought.</i>

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,866
<i>I'm going to go to your place soon.</i>

133
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,845
<i>Tomorrow, let's go to Seoul</i>
<i>with me and pay for your sins.</i>

134
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:32,912
<i>And let's get treatment too...</i>

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,665
...if you don't want to die,
fucking bitch!

136
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:39,909
Boss!

137
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,539
If Ms. Han doesn't sign it till the end,

138
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:43,768
what will you do?

139
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,217
Are you asking me
what will I do, you idiot?

140
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,120
<i>Whether suicide or disappearance,</i>
<i>I will put an end to it.</i>

141
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,474
You fucking bastard!
She didn't hang up yet.

142
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,100
<i>Why did you talk to me?</i>

143
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:59,104
- Hey! I'm not Jiyeon Han!
- <i>Drive properly, you idiot!</i>

144
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,148
Hey! I am not!

145
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:02,858
No! I am not!

146
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,068
Disconnected already.

147
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,831
Did you hear that?

148
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,072
You can go with me.

149
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,299
Excuse me, I'm not Jiyeon Han, uh?

150
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,820
Please release this.

151
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,240
Hey, Miss! You are rich, right?

152
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:18,658
What?

153
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,287
If you give me more money
than your brother,

154
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:23,903
I'll free you.

155
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:26,580
How about 200 million won?

156
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,717
This seems like a pretty good offer.

157
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,800
Hey, I'm not Jiyeon Han.

158
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,553
Release me if you don't wanna go to jail.

159
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,120
Hey, you foolish bitch!

160
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:46,995
If I pass you,

161
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,229
do you think your brother
will let you live?

162
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:49,956
Huh?

163
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,362
No way.

164
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,534
Your brother will kill you right away.

165
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:54,463
Why?

166
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,167
If you disappear,

167
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,890
your brother will
automatically take it all.

168
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,332
Jiyeon Han disappears
after a hit-and-run! Missing!

169
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,711
This makes sense.

170
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,584
Think well, huh?

171
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,915
Do you want to be delivered
to your brother and die?

172
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,835
Or do you want to give
me money and be released?

173
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,605
I'm saying this for the last time.

174
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,588
Release me!

175
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,384
Holy shit!

176
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,644
You don't understand what I'm saying.

177
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,471
Okay.

178
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:24,641
Before I hand you over.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,811
I will have some fun.

180
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,068
The daughter of a chaebol family...

181
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,778
Oh, don't move! Don't move!

182
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,822
What's it like to be?

183
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,266
Aah! What a bitch!

184
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,508
Hey, come here.

185
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,564
Come on, you damn it!

186
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,369
Where am I?

187
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,762
Ugh, you pathetic bastards.

188
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,523
Despite having a chance,
you don't take it, uh?

189
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,830
Fuck, why didn't you come faster?

190
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:36,108
Everything's gone to the dog, you idiot.

191
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,362
Oh, are you giving
100 million won to Gaeko?

192
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:47,992
Shit, this bastard
doesn't answer the phone.

193
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:49,660
Shit!

194
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:59,221
BATTERY LOW
BATTERY REMAINING 1%

195
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,026
The party starts at midnight.

196
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:05,955
Yeah.

197
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,721
What the hell?

198
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,237
- You!
- Hey! You weren't caught.

199
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:21,019
Hey! Stop there!

200
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,005
Hey! Jiyeon Han!

201
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,049
Stop there, you bitch!

202
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,353
Where are you going?

203
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:35,808
Hey! Please open the door.

204
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:39,645
Hey! Please open the door.

205
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:42,064
It's of no use doing that.

206
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:42,643
Hey!

207
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,193
But how did you get out of the room?

208
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:47,088
Did you get rid of Gaeko too?

209
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,045
Be careful, bro!

210
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,155
She's not normal.

211
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,492
She looks full of energy from the drug.

212
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:57,365
Hey, there seems to be
some misunderstanding.

213
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,165
I'm not Jiyeon Han, huh?

214
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,583
Let me out!

215
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,001
Right now!

216
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,338
Let's go quietly, lady.

217
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,666
Oh, please be gentle.

218
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,275
I don't want her to get dirty.

219
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,284
Hey, are you okay? Uh?

220
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,065
Where are you going?

221
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:55,863
Hey, catch her!

222
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:33,036
Chief manager!

223
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:36,206
The thugs I've never seen before came in.

224
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:36,804
What?

225
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,015
I think they were sent by Hojung Han.

226
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:42,379
- Hey, Jason!
- Yeah.

227
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:43,815
Before the party starts,

228
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,942
you need to take the kids
and clean them up first.

229
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:46,522
Yes, chief manager!

230
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,732
Let's go, catch the thugs!

231
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:55,408
<i>Yes, Manager Shin.</i>

232
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,853
I think there's a problem with Gaeko.

233
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,896
Crocodile and Haiba went to check first.

234
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,314
- Ha really.
- Yeah.

235
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:03,817
Damn.

236
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,432
Is there anybody here?

237
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:28,464
Is there anyone here?

238
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,150
Director Yoon said that he
would come in the evening.

239
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,845
You must get out of here before then.

240
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,838
It's impossible to prove
that I'm not guilty anyway.

241
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:03,542
That's why Director Yoon found
a double to sacrifice herself for me.

242
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,229
What?

243
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:08,357
You are a fake Jiyeon Han
who went around pretending to me,

244
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,231
took drugs, and got into a car accident.

245
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,859
He's going to disguise
it, get rid of you...

246
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,570
...and blame you
for everything that happened!

247
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:21,937
<i>Um... Jiyeon's brother!</i>

248
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:24,147
<i>I'm not Jiyeon Han.</i>

249
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,125
When I get out, I'll tell you everything.

250
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,234
Please release this.

251
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,833
Tomorrow, let's go to Seoul
with me and pay for your sins.

252
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:31,321
And let's get treatment too.

253
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,218
Aah!

254
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,760
Who... who are you?

255
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:45,975
Oh my god!

256
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:49,214
Get out! This is my room.

257
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:50,955
The chief manager told me to use here.

258
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:53,148
You must have come in the wrong place.

259
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:57,365
I think you must have come
to the wrong place by mistake...

260
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:58,765
I think you come in...

261
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,114
Are you an employee here?

262
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,573
Please help me.

263
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:04,093
Hel... help you?

264
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:05,911
Yes, please.

265
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:09,456
You must have come in the wrong place.

266
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,333
This is my room.

267
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:14,781
Ah... strange people are
chasing me to catch me.

268
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,173
Um... police... please
report it to the police.

269
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:26,917
Um... Hey, can't you hear me?

270
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,004
Then please lend me your cell phone.

271
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:30,894
I think I saw you somewhere...

272
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,356
They're chasing me! Please!

273
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:38,986
Oh my god!

274
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,809
Sunwoo! You are Sunwoo Kang!

275
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:45,033
What?

276
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,123
But why is Sunwoo Kang here?

277
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,212
Do you know me?

278
00:18:57,699 --> 00:18:58,603
Yeah, I know well.

279
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,452
How do you know me?

280
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:04,247
27th Taekwondo Youth
National Team Champion.

281
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,583
In the final of the National
Taekwondo Competition.

282
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,102
After deliberately losing and getting hit,

283
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:09,224
she threw a knee kick
in anger and disappeared.

284
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,944
But here you are.

285
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:23,873
Sunwoo Kang is here!

286
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:25,282
Wait!

287
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:27,222
Sunwoo Kang is here!

288
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:28,647
Shh!

289
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,648
Did you hear that?

290
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,484
Sounds like a scream.

291
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:34,208
Isn't it Gaeko?

292
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,236
Let's go!

293
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,256
Brother!

294
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,512
- Hey, haiba!
- What happened to you?

295
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,789
I got hit by the druggie girl again.

296
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:49,847
Be quiet, please!

297
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,189
Hoyeon Shin in Karade,

298
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:59,191
Seongchun Ma in boxing, and…

299
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,361
Sunwoo Kang in Taekwondo.

300
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,269
Youngjae watched a lot of
match clips on social media.

301
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,369
But only Sunwoo Kang disappeared.

302
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,061
- Block here! You guys get on!
- Okay!

303
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:22,067
I am a true fan of yours.

304
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,426
That last knee kick was the best!

305
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:30,306
Who the hell are you, a bellboy?

306
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:33,378
Nice to meet you.

307
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,311
Welcome to the California Hotel.

308
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:37,563
Shh!

309
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,189
Please…

310
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:45,152
My name is Youngje Oh,

311
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:47,308
who is in charge of hotel service.

312
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,027
I see.

313
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,893
I see, so please lower your voice, okay?

314
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:04,856
Where are you?

315
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:07,355
- Which floor is the sound from?
- I think it's on the 5th.

316
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,594
Brother!

317
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,305
That bitch is too good at fighting.

318
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,490
I don't think she is Jiyeon Han.

319
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,309
What nonsense, you bastard!

320
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,797
To use our hotel,

321
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:25,238
first, you must press W W W Dot.

322
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:27,167

323
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,523
C A I I F O R N

324
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:42,196
Sorry.

325
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:06,222
If you have any inconvenience,

326
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:07,754

We will take care of it quickly.

328
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,956
Shh!

329
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:25,740
It won't open.

330
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:26,838
Get out of the door.

331
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:33,112
Please!

332
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,038
What sound is this?

333
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:01,818
Hello, Ping-ping!

334
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,195
Jason, guys are all down here.

335
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:05,268
What?

336
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,770
What happened to the girl?

337
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:08,313
I fucking missed her.

338
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,965
Asshole… he missed her.

339
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,772
Fuck, I'm screwed!

340
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:16,875
Hey! Unless she is here,
things are going to be a mess!

341
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,066
Where is she?

342
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,688
Ugh?

343
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,425
Where is she hiding?

344
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,333
Ugh!

345
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:41,972
What's that?

346
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,706
You crazy bitch!

347
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:51,981
This bitch is really...

348
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,652
This bitch is really...

349
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:16,114
Damn it.

350
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,215
Did the druggie learn Taekwondo?

351
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:47,021
Give up!

352
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:51,984
Taekwondo is over
once the leg is caught, crackhead!

353
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,748
I told you to give up, damn bitch!

354
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:08,500
Jiyeon Han!

355
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,173
Even if I hand you over,
your brother might not let you live.

356
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,676
Oh, poor bitch.

357
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:33,177
You are the best!

358
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:34,610
Sunwoo Kang is the best!

359
00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,473
Youngjae also wants to learn Taekwondo.

360
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:41,145
Hey, do you have a cell phone?

361
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,160
I don't have a cell phone.

362
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,235
Someone else is coming outside.

363
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:51,602
There are a lot of
scary drug addicts here.

364
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:04,932
You've come early.

365
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,060
- What about Ms. Han?
- She's inside.

366
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:28,205
Ms. Han!

367
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:35,713
What's going on?

368
00:26:36,158 --> 00:26:37,423
Things are going according to plan.

369
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:40,593
I got a call from Hojung earlier.

370
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:43,346
He must have smelled something, doesn't he?

371
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:46,390
Owing to Deputy Manager Han,
things almost got out of hand,

372
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:47,808
but it is fixed.

373
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,561
There won't be any problems with the plan.

374
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,898
Hojung Han, that fucking bastard!

375
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,025
He's impatient to catch me every day.

376
00:26:56,845 --> 00:26:58,990
The person who sent the hidden
camera video to the prosecution...

377
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,112
...must be that bastard.

378
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:01,906
Anyway, I moved Sunwoo to the hotel.

379
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,450
When the VIP party starts at midnight,

380
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:06,243
we will proceed as planned.

381
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:08,537
Okay.

382
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:13,487
Still, that bastard
will not go back down easily.

383
00:27:13,654 --> 00:27:15,503
Be careful until it is done.

384
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:16,587
Yes.

385
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:23,844
However,

386
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:26,410
It's almost perfect.

387
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:28,057
What?

388
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:29,892
You...

389
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:33,757
...look like Sunwoo Kang undeniably.

390
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:35,815
Really?

391
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:40,472
Ugh! Acting like a shitty bitch.

392
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:42,266
My life is so hard as well.

393
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:44,115
Just hold on until tomorrow.

394
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:47,076
The person in charge
of the jurisdiction is under my control.

395
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:50,079
Please, just prepare to leave in peace.

396
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,249
Okay.

397
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:57,292
I will not forget you, Director Yoon.

398
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:03,692
I KILL U

399
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:26,244
<i>It seems that Kang</i>
<i>Sun-woo has disappeared.</i>

400
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,121
<i>What?</i>

401
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:28,106
<i>Did he run away?</i>

402
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:30,577
<i>It seems that he was</i>
<i>kidnapped by Deputy Han's men.</i>

403
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:31,359
<i>Ho-jung?</i>

404
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:32,729
<i>Catch him with your life!</i>

405
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:35,223
<i>You can go down to</i>
<i>the restaurant using this.</i>

406
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,254
<i>Give it your all and</i>
<i>catch him quickly!</i>

407
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:39,333
<i>Come here.</i>

408
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:41,958
<i>Hey, Han Ji-yeon!</i>

409
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:44,885
<i>Quick, catch him!</i>

410
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,382
<i>I am not Han Ji-yeon!</i>

411
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:53,617
<i>Ah, get out of the way!</i>

412
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:55,177
<i>Hey, Kang Sun-woo!</i>

413
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:57,300
<i>Were you sent by Director Yoon?</i>

414
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:58,356
<i>Damn it!</i>

415
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:05,723
<i>What's wrong with driving</i>
<i>while taking medication?</i>

416
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:07,398
<i>Very similar.</i>

417
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,185
<i>Han Ji-yeon...</i>

418
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,204
<i>...I will definitely</i>
<i>get back at you!</i>

419
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:21,926
I KILL U
