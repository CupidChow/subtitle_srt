1
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:47,811
I KILL U

2
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:54,932
EPISODE FIVE
ROADKILL

3
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:08,260
Hey, my lovely sister
is struggling too much.

4
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,473
Instead of many hotel doors,
why do you come here?

5
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,126
Hey, you crazy bastard!

6
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:14,695
I'm not Jiyeon Han!

7
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:19,787
Your multiple personality
symptoms are getting worse.

8
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,919
I will treat you quickly, so come up.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,162
You, son of a bitch!

10
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,432
How pathetic you are!

11
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:44,641
Have you caught her yet?

12
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,559
I am sorry.

13
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,943
Because Mr. Han came in
and stirred things up...

14
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:13,421
This is a power of attorney
for stock transfer.

15
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:14,964
Read it.

16
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:20,470
If you go to jail this time...

17
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,888
...It'll take some time to come out.

18
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:27,143
Until then, I will be running
our company well.

19
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,520
While you diligently pay for your sins,

20
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:30,641
I become a president.

21
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,169
It's good for each other.

22
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:34,532
It's good for you to
fulfill your sentence...

23
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:37,445
...and good for me to save
the company you ruined.

24
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:39,364
How is it?

25
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:48,498
I got it.

26
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,626
I'll give it all up.

27
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:52,975
Really?

28
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:57,479
If you take me directly
to the prosecution instead,

29
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,385
I'll sign it in front of you.

30
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,471
Hey, why do you sign it there?

31
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,778
Just end it now.

32
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,977
If you sign here now,

33
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,994
I will carry you out on my back.

34
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,620
Uh?

35
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:13,356
How is it?

36
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:14,816
It's good?

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,963
Deputy manager Han!

38
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,937
Oh, Director Yoon?

39
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,923
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:32,207
What am I doing here?

41
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,660
Because you don't let me meet my sister,

42
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:36,838
I've come to finish it by myself.

43
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,424
But why are you here?

44
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:40,717
Deputy manager Han!

45
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,511
I told you to get some air
and go up quietly.

46
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,556
This young bastard
really doesn't listen to me.

47
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:49,350
What?

48
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,512
What a fucking bastard...

49
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:52,242
Ouch!

50
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:56,624
You bastard!

51
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,215
Shit.

52
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:07,758
Hold him.

53
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:09,927
Piece of shit!

54
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,639
You bastard!

55
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:27,444
Holy shit!

56
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,525
Do not come!

57
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:41,667
Don't come, motherfucker!

58
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,506
Go away!

59
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,743
You, motherfucker!

60
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,196
Damn it.

61
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:20,775
Oh, damn it!

62
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,527
What the fuck!

63
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,167
Don't come, you bastard!

64
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:39,950
Shit!

65
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,434
Don't come, you fucking shit!

66
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,047
Don't come...

67
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:54,280
Fuck you!

68
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,880
Shit.

69
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:16,303
Son of a bitch!

70
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:19,700
Hey, Mr. Han!

71
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,743
You fucking bastard!

72
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:24,141
You need a reality check first.

73
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,402
You can't change your bloodline
no matter what.

74
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:31,646
There is no way the Chairman
would hand over the company...

75
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,698
...to nobody like you.

76
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,779
No! No!

77
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:40,706
What is this?

78
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:46,310
That is...

79
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:49,563
Stake! It's a stake.

80
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,343
Jiyeon decided to hand it over to me.

81
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:53,886
Jiyeon...

82
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:06,472
Oh my, why did the young lady
make such an empty promise...

83
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,874
...to make your heart flutter?

84
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,153
No!

85
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:13,614
Hey!

86
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,974
You are the one...

87
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,034
...who filmed it with a hidden camera...

88
00:08:18,182 --> 00:08:19,383
...and handed it over
to the prosecution, right?

89
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:21,738
Since the response was lukewarm,

90
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:23,249
you sent it to an influencer, right?

91
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:25,515
Hey! Hey, slow down!

92
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,358
No, it's just a beast!

93
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,922
<i>What a bullshit, they are human!</i>

94
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,716
<i>Hey, stop!</i>

95
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,608
<i>Go go go! Let's do roadkill!</i>

96
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,012
Hey, you idiot!

97
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,173
Do you know how serious
things have become...

98
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:41,017
...because of your pranks?

99
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,260
Because you made many people difficult,

100
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:45,896
you have to pay the price too, right?

101
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,172
Director Yoon, please!

102
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,538
If you listened to me earlier,
you wouldn't die.

103
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,123
Director Yoon! No, no, no! Sir!

104
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:05,555
It's my fault.

105
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:06,876
I think I did something wrong.

106
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,246
I made a big mistake, huh?

107
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,714
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

108
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,983
Motherfucker,
you have no sincerity to the end.

109
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,849
Ugh, these damn bastards.

110
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:51,837
Hey Miranda!

111
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:59,985
Did you drag this bastard in?

112
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:00,680
No!

113
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,475
Did you think he would take over
the company in the future?

114
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,518
So you tested the water?

115
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,352
No.

116
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,604
It's unfair that you think that way.

117
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:12,080
How could I betray you?

118
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:12,774
Hey!

119
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:15,876
Get this bitch and
these bodies out of here.

120
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:16,612
Director Yoon!

121
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:17,878
It's not me! It's so unfair!

122
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,448
Save me! Please!

123
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:22,326
Pull this bitch out and bring it quick.

124
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:23,257
Yes.

125
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,140
Director Yoon, I didn't!

126
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,542
Please save me! I feel so unfair!

127
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:26,738
- Come on!
- Let go!

128
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,623
- Director Yoon, please save me!
- Come on!

129
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,959
No, Director Yoon! Help me!

130
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,315
Hey Ms. Kang!

131
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,446
If you had gotten there on time,

132
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:57,903
we wouldn't have suffered like this.

133
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:03,200
You crazy bastard.

134
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:05,828
However you killed many like this,

135
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,428
do you think your plan will work?

136
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,140
Release this quickly.

137
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:13,711
You still don't understand the situation.

138
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,713
What?

139
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:23,652
Yes.

140
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:24,595
<i>What happened?</i>

141
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:25,821
<i>Are you done?</i>

142
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:26,905
It's in progress now.

143
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:27,808
<i>Still?</i>

144
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:30,644
<i>Why is it taking so long</i>
<i>to deal with that bitch?</i>

145
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,387
It's over soon.

146
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:36,400
<i>The ice must be made</i>
<i>with Blue Lagoon from Laos...</i>

147
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,901
<i>...because that's my favorite.</i>

148
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:38,861
All right.

149
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:40,060
<i>Put her on.</i>

150
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,578
Jiyeon Han!

151
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:52,999
Was this all planned with this guy?

152
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:55,621
Why?

153
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,004
<i>How naive you are.</i>

154
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:58,631
What?

155
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:03,204
Well, that's why you live like a beggar.

156
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,854
You were fooled by what I said...

157
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,365
<i>...and be a volunteer to</i>
<i>be Jiyeon and go to die.</i>

158
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,268
<i>Was my acting realistic?</i>

159
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,063
<i>It was so fucking hard</i>
<i>to pretend to be nice.</i>

160
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:16,558
Jiyeon Han!

161
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,402
What on earth do you want?

162
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,173
Why do I have to become you and die?

163
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,613
Hey Sunwoo!

164
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,703
I've been unlucky since
the first time I saw you.

165
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:29,369
If you have brains, think about it.

166
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,530
<i>I feel dirty even seeing someone</i>
<i>wearing the same clothes.</i>

167
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:35,376
<i>How would you feel seeing</i>
<i>someone looking the same?</i>

168
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:39,505
Have you ever heard of Doppelgangers?

169
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,635
There must be at least one
looking just like me in this world.

170
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,595
But when those two meet,

171
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,514
one of the two is said to die.

172
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:50,975
<i>So how uncomfortable do I feel?</i>

173
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,926
<i>If one of them has to die,</i>

174
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,536
<i>of course, it's you, not me.</i>

175
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,399
<i>You gonna die, so I'll tell you one more.</i>

176
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:00,975
When you came to the villa,

177
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,363
do you know why we did that
instead of killing you right away?

178
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,156
Even I changed my clothes too.

179
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,718
It's a kind of spiritual ritual.

180
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:14,331
Only by doing so, I can avoid the curse
of the person who dies instead.

181
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,792
A certain monk once told me before.

182
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:17,877
Isn't it funny?

183
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,810
<i>Jiyeon Han!</i>

184
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,314
You're such a psychopath.

185
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:28,271
Was that the only reason I need die?

186
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:32,224
<i>You are going die,</i>
<i>so don't try to know more.</i>

187
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,684
<i>Hey, Director Yoon!</i>

188
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:38,521
I'm listening.

189
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,252
<i>It was a short time but</i>
<i>I've become attached to her.</i>

190
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:44,487
<i>Otherwise, we could have been best friends.</i>

191
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:47,281
<i>So send her off in ecstasy.</i>

192
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:48,240
<i>Ah!</i>

193
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,368
<i>When this is over,</i>
<i>bring my bracelet from her.</i>

194
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:52,878
<i>That's expensive.</i>

195
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:53,950
<i>It's a limited edition.</i>

196
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,331
All right.

197
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:58,333
You just leave this to me...

198
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,336
...and prepare for departure, please.

199
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:03,004
<i>OKay! See you later.</i>

200
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,929
Sir!

201
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:17,849
Here is the drug.

202
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,652
Go far away and bury the bodies cleanly.

203
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,864
Yes, I will take care of it.

204
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,247
I should have finished this earlier.

205
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:52,694
Do you understand the situation now?

206
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:55,516
I'm telling you this because
you are going to die soon.

207
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:58,116
Ms. Han is a real crazy bitch.

208
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,021
There's nothing she can't do
when she's on the drug.

209
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:05,067
She even hunts people for fun.

210
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,130
Hey, you're driving
like a maniac after drugs.

211
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,034
Speed up!

212
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,704
It's like fucking 4D!

213
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:19,262
I'm excited and running!

214
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,186
What the fuck is that?

215
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:26,922
Huh?

216
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:29,314
Isn't that a person?

217
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,719
Hey, that's not a person.

218
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:38,767
Hey, slow down!

219
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:41,010
No! It's just a beast!

220
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:43,437
What a bullshit, they are human!

221
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:46,333
- Hey! Stop!
- Brake! Brake!

222
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:47,142
Stop!

223
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,959
Go! Go! Go! Let's go roadkill!

224
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,331
Are you crazy?

225
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:02,239
Fuck you, they're human!

226
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,349
You hit people, Jiyeon!

227
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:07,644
You fucking shit! Shut up!

228
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,162
I've been in a good mood for a long time,
but you ruined it.

229
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:15,054
Damn unlucky.

230
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,447
Grandpa!

231
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,294
I can't go to jail until the end.

232
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,676
I would rather die here than go to jail.

233
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:42,372
Oh my princess, don't worry.

234
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,918
<i>Your grandpa</i>
<i>would never let you go to jail.</i>

235
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,852
I'll take care of everything.

236
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,049
Really? Uh?

237
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,968
Grandpa! You won't abandon me, right?

238
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:59,567
Hey, why would I abandon my pretty puppy?

239
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,267
Two people died.

240
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,437
This time it would be
at least 10 years no matter how.

241
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,439
So I called you.

242
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,317
How can I let her go to jail?

243
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:15,864
I'm 70 and if she goes to jail,
our business is over.

244
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:20,969
Seokhyun...

245
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:22,787
Yes, sir!

246
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:27,042
Why don't you think of a way?

247
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,253
If you just figure it out,

248
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,505
10 million is yours.

249
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,355
Are you going to kill me with that?

250
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:44,949
Was it your plan to kill me with drugs?

251
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:46,969
You were unlucky.

252
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:52,359
While looking for a way,
I happened to see something surprising.

253
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:55,000
<i>Get on and be careful!</i>

254
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,863
<i>Get on board.</i>

255
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:02,008
<i>At first, I doubted my eyes.</i>

256
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,913
<i>Sunwoo Kang, a real doppelganger appeared.</i>

257
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,961
<i>So I came up with an idea.</i>

258
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,877
This is Jiyeon, would you say hello?

259
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:16,423
Killing Sunwoo Kang
on behalf of Jiyeon Han.

260
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:17,926
I am sorry.

261
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,266
<i>How?</i>

262
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,902
Because Jiyeon is a druggie
that the whole world knows about,

263
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:39,396
dying from a drug
overdose seems quite natural...

264
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,948
...even in her hotel's secret club.

265
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:47,538
WHY IS EVERYONE JUDGING ME?
JUST OPENING MY EYES IS EXHAUSTING NOW

266
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:50,750
<i>Just like that,</i>
<i>Jiyeon disappears from the world...</i>

267
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,085
<i>...and...</i>

268
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:58,842
<i>...Jiyeon is reborn</i>
<i>into Sunwoo Kang's life.</i>

269
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,887
It's kind of like a fairy tale.

270
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:05,516
A cruel fairy tale.

271
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,401
You are crazy!

272
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:20,813
What will you do about
her being reborn as me?

273
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:25,300
Would I have done something without a plan?

274
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,384
You never know how much
Chairman Han's slush fund is.

275
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,915
A huge amount of gold
has all been laundered...

276
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:32,807
...and is heading to Boracay beach by now.

277
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:40,259
It is good for the company
that was going bankrupt.

278
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:44,263
In any case, all the assets
will go to Jiyeon as is.

279
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,528
Nonsense!

280
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:46,515
However...

281
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,158
...there's one thing I missed.

282
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,351
I never dreamed...

283
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,237
...you are good at fighting.

284
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:58,442
How much money do you get paid...

285
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,447
...to be a servant of that immature kid?

286
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:04,992
Servant?

287
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:08,036
Money does matter, why not?

288
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:15,850
My cell phone!

289
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:21,481
What kind of contact are you getting?

290
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,085
Hey!

291
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,242
What shall you do?

292
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:30,601
Your mother has just passed away.

293
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:42,320
That's good.

294
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,742
You can see her soon.

295
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:12,493
Sister, I'm sorry.

296
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,122
Sorry.

297
00:22:17,968 --> 00:22:18,677
Let's go out.

298
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:30,673
Sister!

299
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:33,343
Sister!

300
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,011
Sister!

301
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:38,803
Your cell phone is here.

302
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,308
I found it.

303
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:47,774
Thank you.

304
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:52,070
Sister!

305
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:54,322
Sister!

306
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:56,759
Where are you going?
We need to go out.

307
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:58,777
I have work to do first.

308
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:00,954
What to do?

309
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,340
Where are you going, sister?

310
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,052
This isn't the exit, but the club.

311
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:17,595
This is not the way out...

312
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:22,434
You wait here.

313
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,335
Jiyeon Han!

314
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,301
Why are you showing up now?

315
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:01,055
What the fuck?

316
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:04,909
It's so fucking hard to see you.

317
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,291
Long time no see.

318
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:10,646
How was Blue Lagoon?

319
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:11,941
Was it good?

320
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,475
The ice quality is killing me.

321
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,281
Killing you?

322
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:21,983
Ah! I was almost killed, fuck!

323
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,745
You crazy bitch.

324
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,871
Hey, give me your cell phone!

325
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:27,748
Why?

326
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:30,221
Give it to me.

327
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:31,795
It's been a while since we met,

328
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:33,754
I'll give you a video to commemorate.

329
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,274
Hey.

330
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,100
Hey, wake up!

331
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,439
Hello, influencer!

332
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:22,204
Sunwoo! How did you get out?

333
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:23,387
Jiyeon Han!

334
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:27,139
You should get scolded by me.

335
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,577
I KILL U

336
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:54,452
<i>Han Ji-yeon!</i>

337
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,896
<i>You should get scolded by me.</i>

338
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,857
<i>You piece of trash!</i>

339
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,324
<i>Villa?</i>

340
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:06,907
<i>Damn it!</i>

341
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,460
<i>Don't be too surprised.</i>

342
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,993
<i>You brought this on yourself.</i>

343
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:18,278
<i>You said doppelganger, right?</i>

344
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,678
<i>One of them must die.</i>

345
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:22,888
<i>But why...</i>

346
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,670
<i>...does it have to be me?</i>

347
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,379
<i>It is better for me to be a devil...</i>

348
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,656
<i>...than to die as an innocent sinner.</i>

349
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,396
<i>Shit.</i>

350
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:37,078
<i>Die, you bastard!</i>

351
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:39,011
<i>Ms. Han!</i>

352
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,021
<i>Director Yoon!</i>

353
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:42,881
<i>Director Yoon, shoot quickly!</i>

354
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:44,616
<i>- Director Yoon!</i>
<i>- Kill her quickly!</i>

355
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,030
<i>Kill her quickly!</i>
