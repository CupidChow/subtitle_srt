1
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:47,948
I KILL U

2
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:55,062
EPISODE SIX
THE GAME OF HONESTY

3
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,936
Youngjae has never left the hotel.

4
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:28,890
What should Youngjae do now?

5
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:34,788
Youngjae!

6
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:40,294
Do you want to live with me?

7
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,582
If you live with me,

8
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,218
You can learn a lot
about Taekwondo too.

9
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,934
Great!

10
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,147
For Youngjae, you are
the eternal champion.

11
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,092
HEE-SUU

12
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:17,615
Hey Sunwoo!

13
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:18,773
Oh Heesu.

14
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:19,968
What happened to you?

15
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,710
You haven't even received a call!

16
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,829
<i>There was a reason for that.</i>

17
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:28,675
I'll explain everything later.

18
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,971
Let me ask you one favor.

19
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:34,890
What?

20
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,673
Young-jae.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,335
Just wait one day.

22
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:06,212
My friend is coming down from Seoul.

23
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,883
This is my friend’s phone number.

24
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,598
Stay with her until I come.

25
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,943
Oh, your birthday is coming up.

26
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:32,790
I will buy you a bag.

27
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:35,285
Why not just do it with revolving?

28
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,328
Uh? I'll call you later.

29
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:39,871
What's this?

30
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,617
EMAIL

31
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,371
SENDER: HAN JI-YEON

32
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:09,067
Ah! Why doesn't
Mr. Yoon answer the phone?

33
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:47,397
How did you get here?

34
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,818
Get out of the way, you bastards.

35
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,303
Sunwoo Kang?

36
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:14,652
Isn't she dead?

37
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:15,919
Damn...

38
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:32,358
Villa?

39
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:36,405
Damn it!

40
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:47,516
Sunwoo Kang!

41
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:49,582
I can’t even…

42
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:51,346
How did you get out of there?

43
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,557
It's so unfair that I died as Jiyeon Han.

44
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:55,642
I couldn’t die ambiguously,

45
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:57,724
taking responsibility
for all your mistakes.

46
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,813
Crazy...

47
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,156
Jiyeon Han!

48
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:04,660
You should get scolded by me.

49
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,661
You fucking bitch.

50
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:42,167
Shit.

51
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:45,914
You bitch!

52
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:57,127
Shit!

53
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,032
Are you awake?

54
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:10,994
Don't be too surprised.

55
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,115
You brought this on yourself.

56
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:23,388
You talked about
doppelgangers earlier.

57
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,177
One of the two has to die.

58
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:31,465
But why does it have to be me?

59
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,845
I have nothing and even have to die.

60
00:09:37,397 --> 00:09:38,939
It is too unfair.

61
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,484
Ms. Kang, I am sorry.

62
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:43,944
It's my fault.

63
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:45,716
You said that.

64
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,639
Even if you become a sinner.

65
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,488
You can't be a devil.

66
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,454
But in my case,

67
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,998
even if I become a devil.

68
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,786
I don't want to die as a guilty sinner.

69
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,212
Sister...

70
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,302
I'll give you everything I have, uh?

71
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:05,666
Please save me.

72
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:07,759
Your acting was so realistic.

73
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,802
I was fooled too.

74
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:12,846
Can you do that performance
just one more time?

75
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,642
What?

76
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:17,552
Call your grandfather.

77
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:21,940
Grandpa, why?

78
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:27,195
If you read this, you will understand.

79
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:31,199
If you act in line with what is
written here, I will let you go.

80
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,953
What's this?

81
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,915
There's no one but your grandfather
who can stop Director Yoon.

82
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:43,003
So call and make
sure you get a promise.

83
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:52,596
If I get a promise,
are you going to let me go?

84
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:54,806
Sure.

85
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,644
If you say something
wrong or do something else,

86
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:01,521
I'm going to inject it right away.

87
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:06,501
Because I don’t know
much about drugs,

88
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:08,687
the concentration may be a bit high.

89
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,230
I see!

90
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:11,940
I'll do it! I'll do it!

91
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:25,287
Okay, Grandpa.

92
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:26,955
I'll contact you when I arrive.

93
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,047
You are really good at acting.

94
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:36,882
You were born with it.

95
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:41,394
I got the promise, so let me go now.

96
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:42,604
Okay.

97
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,554
Oh, Heesu! It's all over now.

98
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:34,739
I'll be there soon.

99
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:35,899
Hey!

100
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:40,764
Holy bitch!

101
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:24,817
You die!

102
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:27,942
Ms. Han!

103
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:29,666
Director Yoon!

104
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,705
Director Yoon! Shoot her quickly!

105
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,290
Director Yoon! Hurry Shoot her!

106
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,159
Kill this bitch quickly!

107
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:36,960
Kill this bitch quickly!

108
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,295
Kill her quickly!

109
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:40,964
Why don't you shoot quickly?

110
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:44,893
Shoot quickly!

111
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,059
Kill that fucking shit quickly!

112
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:57,113
Shoot quickly!

113
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,609
Kill this bitch quickly!

114
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,184
Miss, are you okay?

115
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:19,404
What the fuck are you doing?

116
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:28,371
<i>Director Yoon!</i>

117
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:30,873
<i>Where are you?</i>

118
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:34,002
I think Manager Noh has arrived.

119
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,131
What happened? The villa is...

120
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,163
Ah! The plan was a little messed up,
but it ended well.

121
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,905
I see.

122
00:15:58,476 --> 00:15:59,444
Let's go.

123
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,279
Yes, Ma'am.

124
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:04,782
Ah, Director Yoon!

125
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,075
Yes.

126
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:08,895
Take my bracelet from her wrist.

127
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:11,432
I'll do it.

128
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:18,314
By the way,

129
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21,733
since when did you start
drinking carbonated water?

130
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,866
And when did you
have the scar over there?

131
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:32,328
Ms. Han doesn't have
anything like that...

132
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,289
What are you saying now?

133
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:39,377
Director Yoon!

134
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:43,005
Do you really doubt me?

135
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:45,341
Well...

136
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:48,386
You do.

137
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:51,681
Okay! Let’s say I’m Sunwoo Kang.

138
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:53,808
Then...

139
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,187
...who is the girl you
killed by injecting drugs?

140
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,732
She must be Jiyeon Han.

141
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:06,487
In fact, at some point
while injecting the drug,

142
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,574
I feel very uncomfortable.

143
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:13,202
I felt like I was in some kind of trap.

144
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,874
So what do you want to say?

145
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,879
Water has already been spilled.

146
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:23,087
I can't admit my mistakes now.

147
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,381
If the chairman finds out anyway,

148
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,049
I won’t be safe either.

149
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:29,093
Director Yoon!

150
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,786
No matter how much you talk about it,

151
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,759
the fact that I am Jiyeon Han
doesn’t change.

152
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,107
This is a world where
fake beats the real.

153
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,610
What meaning does truth have?

154
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:51,281
So shut up and go in quietly.

155
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:56,871
All right.

156
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,836
But you have to give me
one thing I want too.

157
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:05,671
What?

158
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:11,469
Let's split the money
going to you half and half.

159
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,006
What if you don’t like it?

160
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,975
You won't be safe either.

161
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:20,144
Maybe...

162
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,141
Miss!

163
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:28,337
I think you should go in right away.

164
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:35,380
Good job.

165
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:36,577
I'll greet you soon.

166
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,423
Director Yoon!

167
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:43,807
Yes.

168
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:45,853
See you later.

169
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:15,961
What for?

170
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:17,151
Why do you pull over here?

171
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,120
Um... just a moment.

172
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:40,766
Yes, Chairman.

173
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:44,854
Yes, well sent.

174
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:47,898
No, not at all.

175
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,358
She had a hard time.

176
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:54,822
Yes, see you soon in Seoul.

177
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,494
Director Yoon!

178
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:01,857
Director Yoon!

179
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:05,562
Why?

180
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,896
- Let's go.
- Yep.

181
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:36,047
<i>There's no one but</i>
<i>your grandfather...</i>

182
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:37,823
<i>...who can stop Director Yoon.</i>

183
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:42,337
Grandpa, it's all sorted out.

184
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:43,852
<i>Yes, you did good.</i>

185
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:46,582
Then you should prepare
for departure quickly.

186
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:48,461
What about money?

187
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:51,113
<i>Because Director Yoon</i>
<i>arranged the money well...</i>

188
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,631
<i>...you just take it</i>
<i>as soon as you get there.</i>

189
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,294
But what are you going
to do about Director Yoon?

190
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,053
Because he knows too much,

191
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,433
you have to keep him quiet.

192
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:08,354
You don't need to worry about that.

193
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,182
<i>Because this old man</i>
<i>will take care of everything.</i>

194
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:14,819
Director Yoon is greedy for money.

195
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,990
He won't hand over
all the money he laundered to me.

196
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:22,951
If I go abroad, he will definitely
try to steal all the money.

197
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,162
So I'm worried, Grandpa!

198
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,165
If not, I've already taken care of that.

199
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:33,587
Even 1 million is a waste of money for him.

200
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:36,443
<i>All you have to do is leave</i>
<i>the country without any worries.</i>

201
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:38,265
Oh okay, Grandpa!

202
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:40,185
I'll contact you when I arrive.

203
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,523
Mom!

204
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:32,605
Is my daughter here?

205
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,149
You came early.

206
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:39,737
I came early because I missed you.

207
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,023
How are you feeling?

208
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:44,942
I don’t feel any pain today.

209
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,537
The nurses here are good...

210
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,832
...and the doctor is very good too.

211
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,127
It sounds awesome.

212
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,673
Mom, I looked into it.

213
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:04,297
If the surgery goes well this time,

214
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:06,889
let's travel to the sea together,

215
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,951
hand in hand tight.

216
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:13,748
Hey, Sunwoo!

217
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,064
Huh!

218
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:19,235
I'm sorry that I couldn't
do much for you.

219
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,030
What are you talking about, Mom?

220
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:31,781
I hope you get plenty of good air
and bright sunlight...

221
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:34,458
...have fun and live a long long life.

222
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:40,631
There are lots of things
I couldn't do for you as a mother.

223
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:43,717
I was so sorry.

224
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:40,516
<i>Sister!</i>

225
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,569
<i>Hey, Youngjae! Have you set off?</i>

226
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,623
<i>Heesu is busy,</i>
<i>so we'll be leaving next week.</i>

227
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,425
What? Come on...

228
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,543
What makes you so busy...

229
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,486
...when wrapping up
everything and leaving?

230
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,502
<i>Hey! You don't know how hard</i>
<i>is it to organize surroundings?</i>

231
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:56,056
<i>Just wait a moment.</i>

232
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,492
<i>Next week, Youngjae</i>
<i>and I will fly like bullets.</i>

233
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:00,544
Okay! Come fast.

234
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,906
<i>Hey! Did you see that?</i>

235
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:04,471
What?

236
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:06,175
<i>It's crazy here in Seoul right now.</i>

237
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:08,337
<i>Your face appeared on social networks.</i>

238
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:36,505
<i>Right before Jiyeon Han died</i>
<i>rom a drug overdose,</i>

239
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,783
<i>she sent me a video.</i>

240
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:42,054
<i>Because I couldn't decide</i>
<i>how to put it out,</i>

241
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,504
<i>I've been putting it off for a while.</i>

242
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:46,840
<i>But I'm releasing it now</i>
<i>to my subscribers.</i>

243
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,175
Hello, Influencer!

244
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:52,888
I enjoyed watching my accident
video you uploaded today.

245
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:55,391
It wasn't an accident,

246
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,586
but intentional
under the influence of drugs.

247
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:02,287
I feel rather relieved
now that it's been revealed.

248
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:09,404
Honestly, it was so painful
and difficult during that time.

249
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:13,075
Please reveal more of the sins
I have committed.

250
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,288
My grandfather is also guilty...

251
00:27:18,823 --> 00:27:20,499
...because he is the one...

252
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,752
...who puts stakes into
the ground to tame elephants.

253
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,797
Anyway,

254
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,552
it's a bit sad to say goodbye
to the world forever.

255
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:37,598
Everyone, it's been fun so far.

256
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:39,593
Goodbye!

257
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:46,319
I KILL U
