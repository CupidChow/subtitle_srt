1
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,520
-Peace Be Upon You, Mum. -Peace Be Upon You.

2
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,440
I was just about to call you.

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
Coincidentally...

4
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,520
-Mum, are you talking to Karma? -Yes.

5
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
I want to talk to her too.

6
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,560
Karma, make sure all the money is there when you return it.

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
She knows to keep the money. She won't lose it.

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm not worried about the money going missing. I'm worried she will use it!

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,320
Money is like water in her hands.

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
It's been the same since she was a kid.

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
Don't keep bringing up the past.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,520
She's an adult now. She knows right from wrong.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,760
I know she won't spend the money. She has integrity.

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,720
Mum, Fadhila, Suhaila, I want to tell you something.

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,880
-What is it? -What is it?

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,520
I had too...

17
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
-I had to use it. -What?

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,040
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,560
I had no choice! I promise I'll pay it back, okay?

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,360
You really have no integrity.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,640
That money is not mine alone, it's Lan's money too.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
What's wrong with you? So selfish! What am I going to do?

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,200
See, this is your favourite daughter. You keep spoiling her.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,880
Now, your other children suffer.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,240
Mum, I didn't do it on purpose.

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
I really had no choice.

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,960
Please talk to Fadhila, Mum?

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't want to be part of this.

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,840
All this time, I've been protecting you.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,520
Maybe that's my fault.

31
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,520
I thought when you're older, you'd know the right thing to do.

32
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,000
But maybe your sisters are right.

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,560
-Mum. -Apologise to your sister when you return.

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm going to pray now. Peace Be Upon You.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,320
AUNTY ANI: SHAM, PLEASE CALL ME

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,920
What's wrong?

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,480
You look so troubled this early in the morning.

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,200
Are you okay?

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,840
Do you remember my sister's wedding money that I used to pay Master?

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,960
I just told my sister.

41
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,400
Is she angry at you?

42
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Yes.

43
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,240
But she doesn't consider my point of view at all!

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not like I used her money on purpose!

45
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,320
My sisters always think I'm selfish!

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,120
And they like to bring up my past mistakes!

47
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,880
People can change.

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
So,

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,240
you've done this before?

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,320
Use this RM50 to get tea, creamer and detergent only.

51
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,400
Return the rest of the money to me.

52
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,040
You're not allowed to use the balance, that's called stealing.

53
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,440
You understand?

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,080
Little girl.

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
Thank you.

56
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
Karma.

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,280
Come here.

58
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,080
So you do know not to use up the money!

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
You can go.

60
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,600
Don't do it again, okay?

61
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,640
Okay, I promise I won't do it again.

62
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,000
No wonder. Her mistakes are getting covered up.

63
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,800
No wonder she never learns.

64
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,640
Keep on spoiling her, Mum. See what happens when she grows up.

65
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,040
But that was back then! I don't do it anymore.

66
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,360
I had no choice this time.

67
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,240
I said I'll pay it back, right? I already apologised.

68
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,080
You take it for granted, right?

69
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,960
That you'll always be forgiven.

70
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,600
What do you mean?

71
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
If you say you're sorry,

72
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,640
yet you still repeat your mistakes,

73
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,680
does your apology carry any weight?

74
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,280
I had to!

75
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,840
You understand that, right?

76
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,280
-Good morning. -Good morning.

77
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,560
-Good morning, everyone. -Good morning.

78
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,840
I would like to thank all of you for learning the art of kintsugi last night.

79
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,400
Master says thanks for taking the time to learn kintsugi.

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,040
As a small token of appreciation,

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,240
please keep the pieces that you worked on.

82
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
As a sign of appreciation,

83
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,880
he is gifting us the kintsugi pieces we worked on yesterday.

84
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,800
-Thank you! -Thank you, Master.

85
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,920
Oh my God, I love it.

86
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,680
This is what they look like once they're dry.

87
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,560
-Let me see yours. -So nice.

88
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,440
Sham, kintsugi pieces can be sold at a higher price, right?

89
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes, higher than regular pottery.

90
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
What do you plan to do?

91
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,760
Well, I...

92
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
-I want to sell it. -You want to sell it?

93
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,560
I need to pay back my sister.

94
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,866
You don't want to keep it?

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,480
After all the hard work you put into your piece.

96
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,920
Yes, but the money is more important.

97
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,800
I can't be selfish.

98
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,040
Okay.

99
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,040
Selling one might not be enough.

100
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
-For real? -For real.

101
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
Thank you, Sham.

102
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,200
Thank you, Sham. Thank you!

103
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,640
What's going on?

104
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
Well...

105
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Hi guys! I haven't been live streaming in a while.

106
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I guess you already know that I'm in Japan right now.

107
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,760
I've been so amazed by the Japanese culture and philosophy.

108
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,280
I mean, look at this.

109
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,080
Usually, we throw away broken ceramics, right? But not the Japanese.

110
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,879
They'll fix broken ceramics

111
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,840
with a technique called kintsugi,

112
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,280
using gold powder.

113
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,599
This is the bowl I worked on yesterday.

114
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
Nice, right?

115
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
-Nice! -Very nice!

116
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,200
So, guess what? Today, I have not just one,

117
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,680
not two, but...

118
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
four kintsugi pieces up for auction.

119
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,360
And...

120
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
MUM: BIANCA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

121
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
STOP RIGHT NOW! STOP THE LIVE STREAM!

122
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,240
Anyway, if you buy all four pieces together,

123
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,520
you can make a special request for me to do anything, right here right now.

124
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,760
Okay, RM100. RM500!

125
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,440
RM700! Sold to @ondeonde!

126
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,840
Congratulations!

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,320
Sold to @ondeonde for RM1000!

128
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,800
This is the second piece that @ondeonde won.

129
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,560
So will @ondeonde be the one to make the special request from me?

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Okay, we'll see.

131
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,480
And sold for RM1300 to none other than... @ondeonde!

132
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,120
AUNTY KATHY CALLING And now the final piece...

133
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
So, what are you guys waiting for? Keep it coming.

134
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,920
For those of you who'd just joined in, I'm holding an auction for kintsugi...

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,280
RM1500!

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
RM1600!

137
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,240
Sold to @ondeonde for RM2000!

138
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,760
Oh my God, what an auction!

139
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,040
Now, it's time for the special live request, and the request is...

140
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,240
Sing the song.

141
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,240
"Malaysia, A Glorious Nation" loudly.

142
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,280
So, Bob, Sham, Karma! Let's go!

143
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,760
Malaysia, a glorious nation.

144
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,440
Malaysia, free and independent.

145
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,520
All of its people unite, and stand together!

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,240
Against disunity.

147
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,440
We want peace amongst all races.

148
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,200
Hear the joyful cheers,

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,320
across the country.

150
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,760
Malaysia has succeeded a prosperous and peaceful nation.

151
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
Thank you @ondeonde!

152
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Bianca Rozario, what was that?

153
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,480
It was just for fun, Mum.

154
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,120
Just for fun?

155
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,200
You're selling things for fun?

156
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,720
Do you know you could jeopardise future sponsorships?

157
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,560
Come on Mum, they're just ceramics.

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,960
If you can't answer my calls when you're just selling ceramics,

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,880
can I trust you to check with me first next time?

160
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,520
Don't do this again and don't ignore me.

161
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm your mother.

162
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,960
Yes, I know.

163
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,880
Call me later.

164
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
Bye.

165
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,480
Was that Aunty Kathy?

166
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,720
It doesn't matter.

167
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,759
Do you have the photos of me and Bob from the other day?

168
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,640
Yes, I do.

169
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,280
Okay, send them all to my mother.

170
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,320
-Are you sure? -Just do it.

171
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
Okay.

172
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,960
-Sent. -Thank you.

173
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,600
So, we leave the rest of the wrappers here?

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,080
Karma, you've got money now.

175
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
Why don't you treat us a meal?

176
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
That money is not mine.

177
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,840
But, how about I cook for you guys?

178
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,560
Okay!

179
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,600
This is such a bachelor's kitchen.

180
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,360
Why don't you go and buy groceries

181
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,040
while I kick things off.

182
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,000
Here you go.

183
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,760
-What are you cooking? -Does it matter? Just buy the things.

184
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,803
Don't make a mess. I don't like a mess.

185
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,400
Don't worry. After you taste my cooking,

186
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
you'll think, the mess is worth it

187
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,040
if it means such delicious food. Okay? Let's go.

188
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,120
Go, now. Thank you! I'll see you again.

189
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,320
But, do we really need 3 people to go grocery shopping?

190
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,480
I'll stay and help?

191
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,400
-Okay. -Okay.

192
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,720
Okay. Bye. Be safe.

193
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,560
Wow, amazing. I don't even need to tell you to do it.

194
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,720
This is basic. Everything has garlic in it.

195
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Not bad! Did you use to play cooking games when you were younger?

196
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
No. With my family, if you're hungry, cook it yourself.

197
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
Did your parents not love you?

198
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,680
It's not like that.

199
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,080
Everyone needs to learn to cook.

200
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
It's a basic life skill.

201
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,400
You're so husband material.

202
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,880
-Do you like men who cook? -Yes.

203
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,440
What other characteristics do you like?

204
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Ever watched Malay dramas, where the hero is cool and macho?

205
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,280
I know about that.

206
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:13,360
I don't like those kind of guys.

207
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,520
I cringe at them.

208
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,120
Ingredients are ready!

209
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,400
Sham, Bianca!

210
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Okay, who here knows how to blend chili?

211
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
Not me.

212
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
I can.

213
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,280
Really?

214
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,720
Good.

215
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,120
Amen.

216
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,360
Thank you for the meal.

217
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Let's eat!

218
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
Wow.

219
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,880
Like this.

220
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,080
Pinch and pick up the rice and push into your mouth.

221
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,760
-Delicious? -Delicious.

222
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,360
MOUNT NANGAWARA NORITOU POTTERY

223
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,520
I would just like to thank Master Akiro for your kindness and generosity.

224
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,280
Today is their last day.

225
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,360
They would like to thank you for your kindness.

226
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,640
You're welcome.

227
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,640
-And Karma, -Yes?

228
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,080
The delicious...

229
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,640
-Nasi Lemak. -Nasi Lemak!

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,320
-Thank you. -Thank you.

231
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,800
Let's play a game?

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
-Game? -Okay.

233
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,640
Yes! Let's play the game, Two Truths and One Lie.

234
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,440
Master Akiro, would you like to join?

235
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,360
Master, would you like to play a game with us?

236
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,760
Oh, no thank you. Please enjoy yourselves.

237
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,840
-Master isn't playing. -Okay.

238
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,920
Karma, you go first.

239
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,920
Okay, I will start. Listen up.

240
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,560
One, I like to cook.

241
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,040
Two, I can count to 10 in Japanese.

242
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,480
Three, I have two sisters.

243
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,120
Wrong. I can count to 10 in Japanese.

244
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,360
Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, shichi, hachi, kyuu, juu!

245
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
Not bad!

246
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
I do know some Japanese, okay?

247
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,720
Then what's the lie?

248
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,600
Karma!

249
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,680
Okay, listen carefully.

250
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,320
One, I've dated a politician.

251
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,920
Two, I've had a pet snake.

252
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,480
Number three, my name is really Bianca.

253
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,520
You think Bianca isn't my real name?

254
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,840
-It's not your stage name? -It's on my identity card, okay!

255
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,080
So, Bob is right?

256
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,560
-Yes, Bob's the winner. -Yes!

257
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,999
Thank you, please don't stand up!

258
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,960
Enough!

259
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
So you've never dated a politician?

260
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,640
Well, I've dated royalty,

261
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,560
a man from an elite family,

262
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
an actor, a producer, a singer, a CEO... I've dated them all.

263
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,000
But never a politician. Too controversial.

264
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,720
You'll never guess mine.

265
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,560
One, I've dated a model.

266
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,240
Two, I was a singer in a band.

267
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,120
Three, I have an identical twin.

268
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,160
Wrong! The answer is three,

269
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160
I have a twin but we're not identical!

270
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,680
Why don't you believe that

271
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
I once dated a model?

272
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
You don't think I'm deserving?

273
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,440
Please, who is your ex-girlfriend?

274
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,080
Elaine Santiago.

275
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
-Elaine? -Yes.

276
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,600
-When did you date her? -In high school.

277
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,840
Okay, my turn.

278
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,480
One, I was an engineer.

279
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,800
Two, I like anime.

280
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
Three, I'm allergic to mushrooms.

281
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,040
I think.

282
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
Number one?

283
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,160
-Bob is right. -I knew it! It's the brotherhood!

284
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,680
-Don't all Japanese watch anime? -I'm not Japanese, you idiot.

285
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,800
Wow. So you were an engineer?

286
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,560
Yes.

287
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:03,986
What did your parents say about you switching to pottery?

288
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Hey, is no one going to celebrate Bahari Malik's winning 2 points?

289
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,000
Why are you laughing at my name? That's my name!

290
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't call me Bahari Malik. Call me, Bob.

291
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,720
-I'll take it for you. -What?

292
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,880
-He wants to take the photo. -Really?

293
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,720
-Say cheese -Cheese!

294
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:43,528
Hey, Mr. Engineer. What's on your mind?

295
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:47,753
I'm not an engineer anymore. I've left that a long time ago.

296
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,865
Like how you've left Malaysia a long time ago?

297
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:57,625
Do you think you'd miss me after this? Because I think I'd miss you.

298
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:03,745
Maybe when I have the time, I'll come back to Saga and find you?

299
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:12,785
Bianca, I know you always get what you want.

300
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:18,425
But if one second you want me, then the next you want Bob, it's not cool.

301
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:24,545
Good thing I'm not looking for anything. But Bob?

302
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:28,465
It's not fair to him.

303
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:34,385
Okay, time to go!

304
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:37,185
Thank you, Master Akiro and Sham.

305
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:38,785
Thank you, Master Akiro.

306
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:40,905
Thank you, Master Akiro.

307
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,705
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

308
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,665
Don't you miss home?

309
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,665
Sorry, Master?

310
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:06,065
I've never seen you more lively than today

311
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:08,345
when you were in the company of your fellow Malaysians.

312
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:16,505
Perhaps, you should start thinking about going back home.

313
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:22,625
What for? I love being here.

314
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:28,465
Besides, there's so much more I need to learn from you.

315
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,265
Going back would be a waste of time.

316
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:39,265
Spending time with your loved ones is never a waste of time.

317
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:44,145
Sham,

318
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,545
come over here.

319
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:55,025
Listen. Your potter's wheel will always be here.

320
00:22:55,825 --> 00:23:03,545
Your clay will always be here, waiting for you.

321
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:08,745
But what about people?

322
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:13,585
Can they always wait for you?

323
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:17,945
Don't leave it until it's too late.

324
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:29,345
Sham?

325
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,505
Is that you?

326
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:33,305
Hello, Aunty Ani.

327
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,465
This is Sham.

328
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,385
Sham,

329
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:39,505
Your father's in the hospital.

330
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,305
He had a stroke.

331
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,025
Oh no.

332
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:13,905
Bianca! Have you paid Sham for the translator job?

333
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,785
I forgot. Hold on, I'll get the money.

334
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,705
Don't get into frame.

335
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,025
Hi, Mum.

336
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,065
Bianca,

337
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:34,425
is there something you want to tell me about you and Bob?

338
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:37,865
-What? -Are you two a couple?

339
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,545
Even if it's true, so what?

340
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:44,305
You're not serious? You know he's not right for you.

341
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,105
Fine. Then who's the right one for me?

342
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:49,665
Some rich guy? Royalty?

343
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,144
Like all my exes you've approved?

344
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,705
They're all trash.

345
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,025
Well, at least your ex didn't work for you.

346
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:58,145
How can you date your own employee?

347
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,825
He's not on your level.

348
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:01,105
What?

349
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:04,505
Bob.

350
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:10,385
-Mum! How could you say that? -Well, maybe it's for the best.

351
00:25:13,585 --> 00:25:17,385
Bob!

352
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:26,065
Bob?

353
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:31,065
Please, let me explain?

354
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:35,545
Bob.

355
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:43,025
Tell me this is a misunderstanding.

356
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:47,265
Tell me you're not just using me

357
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,560
to get back at your mother.

358
00:25:52,505 --> 00:25:56,745
To make her angry, the only way is to tell her you're dating me.

359
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,625
So tell me that's not what happened, Bianca.

360
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:02,865
Bob, it's not like that.

361
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:06,425
I'm just mad because she asked Karma to spy on us

362
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:10,025
and asked her to report back about us.

363
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:13,425
I just wanted to prank her.

364
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:16,305
Prank?

365
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:21,825
Because it's funny to think that someone like you could fall for someone like me.

366
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:26,825
I didn't mean for you to get hurt.

367
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:30,345
Easy for you to say, Bianca.

368
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:34,465
Then why is it that I still get hurt?

369
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:40,265
You fight with her, I get hurt. You prank her, I get hurt.

370
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:46,465
Do you realise, I'm always here for you, no matter how badly you treat me.

371
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:52,265
But you know what?

372
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:55,625
I'm done.

373
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,705
I'm going to bed.

374
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:05,825
Have a good night. Sweet dreams.

375
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:08,825
Bob, wait. Ouch!

376
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,305
Bianca, why did you put your hand there?

377
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:13,745
How are you going to act if you broke your finger?

378
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:21,465
You really do care about me, don't you?

379
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:28,025
Bob,

380
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:31,465
I shouldn't have used you like that.

381
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,905
I didn't think about your feelings.

382
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,225
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:42,585
You are important to me.

384
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:46,825
You're the only one who doesn't want anything from me.

385
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:53,785
Please forgive me?

386
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,265
I can't be okay if we are not okay.

387
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:02,945
Please?

388
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,305
Yes.

389
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:09,705
Okay.

390
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,905
Peace Be Upon You, Mum.

391
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,425
Peace Be Upon You.

392
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:20,145
Mum, I've managed to get Fadhila's money back.

393
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:22,665
I'll give it to her when I get back.

394
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,105
Where did you get so much money from?

395
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:31,185
-I sold some things. -Sold things?

396
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:34,225
What expensive things do you even have?

397
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:36,385
I have my ways.

398
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,865
The most expensive item you own is your phone.

399
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:44,025
You couldn't have sold that because you're using it to call me.

400
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,545
Tell it to me straight.

401
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:52,625
Mum, it doesn't matter right? What matters is I got the money back.

402
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:57,305
Why are you questioning me like this? Don't you believe me?

403
00:28:58,145 --> 00:29:02,705
Suhaila said you lied to get this job. Is that true?

404
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:08,105
What? Why would she tell you that?

405
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:13,585
I never thought I wasn't good at raising my children.

406
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:18,425
But looking at you now, I don't know.

407
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,945
Mum...

408
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,865
I'm going to bed. Peace Be Upon You.

409
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:36,185
Good morning!

410
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:43,025
-What are you doing here? -Are you not happy to see me?

411
00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:45,345
Depends on what you want.

412
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:50,225
-Can't you see the good in me for once? -No.

413
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:53,985
It's hard. Because I know you.

414
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,665
You're something else.

415
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:59,425
Take this. Your pay.

416
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:04,065
Thanks.

417
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:06,265
I forgot about this.

418
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,185
What time is your flight?

419
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,345
6:30 p.m.

420
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:15,745
Actually, I don't feel like going home.

421
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:19,425
Why?

422
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:34,705
I don't know how to face my mother and sisters.

423
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:37,665
My mum's really disappointed in me

424
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:41,465
after she found out I lied to get this job.

425
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:45,825
Don't you just need to apologise for all your problems to go away?

426
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:50,145
Can you be serious?

427
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:56,425
I've apologised so many times but they're still mad at me.

428
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:02,465
Whatever. I'll have to face them sooner or later, right?

429
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:05,945
I can't run away from this problem forever.

430
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,345
-Why not? -What?

431
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,865
Because I just can't.

432
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,745
Even if you run away,

433
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:18,185
your problems won't go away.

434
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:23,905
It just depends on whether you want to face them now or later.

435
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,225
That's true.

436
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:31,545
Karma,

437
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:35,705
can you accompany me?

438
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:43,385
It's time to say goodbye to Saga?

439
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:45,345
Producing is tough, Bianca.

440
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:46,905
You don't have what it takes.

441
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:48,025
I have what it takes.

442
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:50,705
Lately, my type is more like…

443
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:51,545
Like Karma?

444
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:52,785
How's Dad?

445
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:54,145
Earlier he was doing well.

446
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:56,225
Does your stepmother have a hidden motive?
