1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,280
Karma just texted me. She said to go ahead.

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,680
She said, "Don't worry about me."

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,520
"I'll text you later, Peace Emoji, Sorry Emoji."

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,080
Okay. Where did she go?

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,920
She went to see Sham. To settle his payment.

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Let's just go.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,560
But what if she's late again? Remember what happened the last time?

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,240
She still made it. Let's go.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,720
Bianca! Bob!

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Sham?

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,840
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,280
You guys are going back to Malaysia, right?

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
I'm coming along.

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Karma,

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,640
can you... accompany me?

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Accompany you?

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
I need to go back to Kuala Lumpur.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,840
But I don't want to.

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,560
But I have to.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Do you want to or not, Sham?

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,000
My family and I, we're not really...

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
I don't know how to say it.

23
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,520
We don't really act like a family.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,320
You're not close to each other.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,520
So you want me to accompany you home?

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,240
Not all the way home.

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Just to the airport.

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,080
If I go alone, I might turn back.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,360
I need you to... push me on.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
I see.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Accompany you?

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Okay. How much are you paying me?

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,616
How much does it usually cost? I don't know.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm just joking.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,960
But, if you really want to pay me, I'll accept.

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,520
Have you packed?

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,720
If you want to leave, we have to go now. Now!

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,240
It's so last minute.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,600
There might not even be any flight tickets left.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
I'll just stay here for another 3 years.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Done.

43
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,520
AIRASIA APP

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
Just use the app.

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,120
So that's the story. Thanks, Karma.

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,160
So it's time to say goodbye to Saga?

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,440
And go home.

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Yay.

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,480
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,440
Are you reciting a prayer?

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,920
How about I recite a prayer for a safe travel?

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,520
Okay!

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,679
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Glory to the One who has subjected this for us, and we were not capable of that.

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,280
And to our Lord, we will return.

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Amen, Lord of all worlds.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,560
Amen.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
What is it?

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,600
Nothing. I just didn't expect it.

61
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360
This?

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,880
My grandfather is the head of the mosque.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
He's the one who taught me these prayers.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,560
But you were cute when you recited a prayer the last time.

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,200
Why didn't you pray for me that time?

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I didn't know you well then.

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,320
Now I do, I quite li...

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Quite?

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,280
Know you quite well, so I recited the prayer for you.

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,840
Thanks, Bob.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,480
Your future wife is so lucky.

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,360
Bob, when we arrive later...

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Why are you reading the safety instructions?

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,480
It's nothing. What happens when we arrive?

75
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,800
Let's edit the travelogue soon, so we can pitch it to TV stations soon.

76
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Sure.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,160
We are almost done with the edits anyway.

78
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,120
I know and it's good! The music, the cuts...

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,400
I love it!

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,760
I'll tell my mother to increase your pay, okay?

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,600
-Bob? -Yes! Okay.

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,680
It's just that, Bianca, after I'm done with this,

83
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
I'd like to take a break.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,920
To finish my short film.

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
A break? For how long?

86
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm not sure.

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
But you don't have to worry.

88
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,440
There are many talented videographers who would love to work with you.

89
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Bob, is this about my prank?

90
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
No.

91
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,360
It has nothing to do with that.

92
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,720
This is what I want to do.

93
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,880
You understand, right?

94
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
What are you doing?

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sorry.

96
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
It's been so long since I've seen signage in Malay.

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,920
-Okay, I'll book a taxi back. -Want me to accompany you?

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
How about you?

99
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,480
Need company?

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,680
Don't run away when you see your sisters.

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,040
Okay, guys. Keep in touch.

102
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,360
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,880
Bye.

104
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,600
So, I'm taking the train back.

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
All right. Once it's done, just...

106
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Sure.

107
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,360
Bye, Bob. Take care.

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,920
Yes. Bye.

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,760
So how are you going back?

110
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,920
I've booked a ride using the AirAsia app.

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Okay.

112
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,000
Bianca?

113
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes?

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Thanks for giving me this chance.

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
As a personal assistant, I know I'm not very good,

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,600
but you know that I always try my best.

117
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,760
So if you need a personal assistant for anything, call me, okay?

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Hold on.

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,280
Why not I hire you as my personal assistant and videographer?

120
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,480
Videographer? But what about Bob?

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,520
Bob needs a break because he'll be busy with his short film.

122
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,520
Plus, you're definitely not busy, right? No offense.

123
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,720
-What do you think? -Yes! Of course!

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,680
Okay.

125
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,200
Mum! I'm home!

126
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,600
AIRASIA RIDE

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
Count it, is it enough?

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,560
It's more than enough.

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,760
Suhaila, why did you tell Mum that I lied to get the job?

130
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
It's true right?

131
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,760
-Yes, but you didn't have to tell on me. -You want to get mad at us?

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,240
Because you don't want Mum to know your true colours, right?

133
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,840
It's time to change.

134
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,160
When will you finally stop lying?

135
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,320
It's just a white lie. No one died.

136
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,520
Is there such a thing as a white lie?

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Where did you learn that?

138
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
Mum...

139
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
Welcome home.

140
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Why didn't you answer my call?

141
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,920
Because I was already on the way home.

142
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,080
You've never ignored my call before.

143
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,840
This must be that boy's influence, right?

144
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,400
No, it's not!

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,320
-I don't like you with that boy. -I'm not with Bob!

146
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
He has a name, by the way.

147
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Don't lie.

148
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,000
I've seen pictures of you together.

149
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Yes, I know.

150
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,040
Fake photos that I asked Karma to take and send to you.

151
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,120
What?

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,520
Why would you do that?

153
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,600
Why do you think?

154
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,400
Why would you ask someone to spy on me?

155
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,120
How did you...

156
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
What a useless spy.

157
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
You know what?

158
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm not sorry.

159
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm your mother.

160
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,960
I need to know what's going on in your life.

161
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Why? It's my life.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
When do I get the chance to do what I want?

163
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Fine.

164
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
What do you want?

165
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,280
I don't want to act anymore.

166
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,600
I want to try producing.

167
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,120
Producing is tough, Bianca.

168
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,360
You don't have what it takes, not right now.

169
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,960
-Then when will I have what it takes? -You can learn! Slowly.

170
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,160
In the meantime, just keep acting. That's our bread and butter, Bianca.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,520
I have what it takes. Watch me.

172
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,320
Mum.

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,560
Karma, listen.

174
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,040
The ends don't justify the means. Understand?

175
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,160
Even though you get everything you want,

176
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,800
it doesn't matter because the method is wrong.

177
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Understand?

178
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,600
I understand, Mum.

179
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,400
I won't do it again.

180
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,200
How was your flight?

181
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
It was a bit shaky.

182
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,200
Shaky like her head.

183
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,760
You're here now. Go take a shower and get some rest, okay?

184
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,560
Okay, Mum.

185
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
Excuse me.

186
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm going inside, Mum.

187
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,920
It's nothing. Everything's okay.

188
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,760
It's not a boyfriend or anything.

189
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,880
Peace Be Upon You.

190
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,080
Sham?

191
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,920
Sham! You're home!

192
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,040
Are you well?

193
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm well.

194
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,600
-And yourself? -Praise be to Allah.

195
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,040
I'll go check on your Dad.

196
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Sorry, Sham.

197
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,720
We gave this room to Hawa.

198
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,680
She's grown now.

199
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,760
She can't share a room with Haziq anymore.

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I understand.

201
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,120
It's okay.

202
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,040
I've moved to Japan for a while now.

203
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,400
Where are the kids?

204
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,656
They've gone to see their grandparents.

205
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,240
They'll be back the day after tomorrow.

206
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,440
Why don't you stay in Haziq's room tonight?

207
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
No, it's okay.

208
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,200
I've already planned to stay with a friend.

209
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
You sure?

210
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
How's Dad?

211
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,360
He's sleeping. Let him rest, okay?

212
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Okay.

213
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,720
I don't want to disturb if he's resting.

214
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,360
You don't want to stay for lunch?

215
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
It's okay, Aunty Ani.

216
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
I don't want my friend to wait. He has work to do.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
I see. Hold on!

218
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
Your car keys.

219
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Your dad has been taking care of it.

220
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,400
He always makes sure it gets serviced.

221
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,640
-Thanks, Aunty Ani. -No problem.

222
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Sham!

223
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,880
Can I stay at your place?

224
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,040
Yes, sure. Come in.

225
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm not staying at my father's place.

226
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,480
My room is now my step-sister's room.

227
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,280
I haven't been home for three years.

228
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,680
I can't expect things to stay the same.

229
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,760
You've been away a long time.

230
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,400
Yes, it's been a while.

231
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm back because my father's ill.

232
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Really?

233
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,520
What illness does he have?

234
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,080
He had a stroke.

235
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,400
He was sleeping just now.

236
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,240
So I haven't seen him yet.

237
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,240
I don't want to be the first person he sees when he wakes up.

238
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,760
It will shock him.

239
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,760
I don't want him to be admitted back into the hospital.

240
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Have you eaten?

241
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,240
You must miss Malaysian food, right?

242
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Sure.

243
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,960
My treat.

244
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Is this your car?

245
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,760
Can I drive it?

246
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
No.

247
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,840
Yes!

248
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
In the Name of Allah.

249
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
The prawn looks good!

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Waiter!

251
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Waiter!

252
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,480
Praise be to God.

253
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,760
Let's go home. I have work to do.

254
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
So full.

255
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Is it ready?

256
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,720
It's ready. I've sent the email.

257
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,720
Thanks, Bob.

258
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,720
I hope a TV station buys it, and I can show my mother.

259
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
Don't be that way.

260
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,400
Do it because you want to do it.

261
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,896
Not because you have something to prove...

262
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,560
I really can't stand her, Bob. I have to nail this.

263
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,000
I understand. You can do it, Bianca. I believe in you...

264
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,280
Thanks, Bob.

265
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,480
Bob. Hello?

266
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
So that's the pilot.

267
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
What do you think?

268
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,240
Currently we have one... no, two shows like this now.

269
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,440
It's nothing special.

270
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,560
Does Master Akiro have many followers?

271
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,640
We'll get back to you.

272
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,160
Thanks for your time.

273
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,400
I hope she chokes.

274
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,040
-Bianca! -What?

275
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,600
I'm not wishing for the TV executive to die.

276
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960
-But if… -Bianca!

277
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,160
You need to chill, okay? Don't lose hope.

278
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,080
They said they'll consider, right?

279
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,440
Okay.

280
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,720
-Peace Be Upon You. -Peace Be Upon You.

281
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,760
Hey, Sham.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,360
-How's the car? Okay? -Okay.

283
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,800
How's Dad?

284
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,920
He seemed okay this morning. He had a little bit of energy.

285
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,120
Wait here. I'll go and check.

286
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Harun.

287
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,120
He's here. Do you want to see him?

288
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,960
Sorry, Sham. He wants to sleep.

289
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
He's tired.

290
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,240
Tired? But just now he...

291
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,120
This morning he was okay, but now he's got no energy.

292
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,000
Let him rest, okay?

293
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,720
Want something to drink? I'll make coffee.

294
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Bianca?

295
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Yes?

296
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,200
I received a call just now. From a TV executive.

297
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,000
-Who from? -Nana, my friend.

298
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,320
She said you went to the TV station,

299
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,400
-to pitch a travelogue. -And?

300
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,440
They said no.

301
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,320
You shot this while you were in Japan?

302
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,320
You see, how hard it is?

303
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,680
It's not easy to sell a show.

304
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,280
Your strength is acting.

305
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,920
You are in demand right now.

306
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,640
You can pick whatever role you want.

307
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,160
Once we're financially free, when less offers come in,

308
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,160
then you can do whatever you want.

309
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,640
You know what? I need to go.

310
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,520
Sham.

311
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
This is nice.

312
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,560
They're checking you out.

313
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,680
Please. They're checking you out.

314
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
You want to bet?

315
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
Loser buys.

316
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,720
Bet.

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,240
Here, they're checking you out.

318
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,720
-Give us another order of D24. -Okay.

319
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,080
You're unbelievable.

320
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,720
They're not my type.

321
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,120
Not your type?

322
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,960
Just because you have Bianca, you won't even look at others.

323
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,800
It's not that.

324
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,920
It's just lately, I prefer, like...

325
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Like?

326
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
It's nothing.

327
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,400
Like Karma?

328
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
You like her, right?

329
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,240
She's quite adorable.

330
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
If you like her, what are you waiting for?

331
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,720
Do you need to prepare a speech?

332
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,400
You're just like Karma. Pressuring me.

333
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,800
If you feel the pressure, it means you really like her.

334
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,640
Fine. I like her.

335
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,240
But how do I approach this? I don't know how.

336
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
It's Karma.

337
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Answer it.

338
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,560
-You want me to answer it? -I'll answer it.

339
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,920
-Hello. -Bob, are you free?

340
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,280
-Can we meet? -Meet? Now?

341
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,040
But I'm with Sham, eating durians.

342
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,760
-Sham? -It's a long story.

343
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,360
-Bring him along. -Bring Sham along?

344
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Karma.

345
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Bob, the travelogue didn't sell.

346
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,480
Everyone rejected it.

347
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,920
Seriously?

348
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
Bianca is really sad right now.

349
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,440
I don't know how to make her feel better.

350
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,640
I told her that I went out to make a phone call.

351
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,280
That's how you make her feel better?

352
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,520
No, it's not.

353
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,080
I've already tried everything. Nothing works.

354
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,720
Bob, can you help?

355
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,920
You're the person who knows her best.

356
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Okay.

357
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,320
Bob, what are you doing here?

358
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,880
Karma requested for backup.

359
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,560
I'm fine, how many times do I have to tell her.

360
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,240
Come on. I can see it in your face.

361
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,960
Let's leave them be. Let them have some space.

362
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
-Let's have some Lok Lok? -Lok Lok?

363
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Haven't heard that in a while.

364
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
Let's go. I'll drive.

365
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,840
So you're a rich guy back home.

366
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,880
Wow.

367
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,640
Maybe my mother was right.

368
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Maybe I don't have what it takes.

369
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,360
Do you know what people used to call me?

370
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,920
Student ID Card Collector.

371
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,160
Student ID Card Collector?

372
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,440
Because I kept switching universities.

373
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,720
What I have left are just a bunch of matriculation cards

374
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I felt like such a failure. Everyone thought I had no future.

375
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,400
But now I realise, I wasn't a failure.

376
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,640
I know now why I never finished any course.

377
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
Why?

378
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,200
Because I wasn't really interested.

379
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,560
IT, Business, Communication...

380
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,480
I wasn't interested in any of them.

381
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,000
But when I found what I liked, I studied hard.

382
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,680
No one had to push me.

383
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,520
Now, what I like is now my job.

384
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
Bianca, do you really want to be a producer?

385
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,840
And you can't imagine yourself doing anything else other than producing?

386
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,440
You mean, my ikigai?

387
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,360
Ikigai?

388
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,320
It's nothing. Just something I learned in Saga.

389
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,320
I don't know if I really want to be a producer.

390
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,160
You don't know, but I do.

391
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,200
If you want something, you would give it your all.

392
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,040
Your all.

393
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,960
Remember when you played the role of a mistress?

394
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,640
It took 27 takes for you to cry.

395
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,160
The production wanted to give you eye drops,

396
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,360
but you said, "No, I am going to do it myself."

397
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,600
And in the end, you really did.

398
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,240
But the director doesn't want to work with me after that.

399
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,600
He really regretted it.

400
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,040
The Bianca that I know, will fight for what she wants.

401
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,800
If she really wants it.

402
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,720
It's okay.

403
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,840
I want to see my father.

404
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,200
I've been home twice, and both times I couldn't see him because he was tired.

405
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,840
But then, Sham, your father is sick.

406
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,600
But when I went over there,

407
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,080
I overheard him talking to my stepmother.

408
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,080
If he can speak to her,

409
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,600
why can't he do the same with me?

410
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,200
A bit suspicious. Maybe your stepmother has a hidden motive?

411
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,960
She's the one who told me to come back.

412
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,960
Why would she do that if she doesn't want me to see him.

413
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,040
Maybe she wants to wait until your father gets better?

414
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,800
So you don't see him in this state?

415
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,000
Like a white...

416
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,800
Okay, no such thing as a white lie.

417
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,640
All lies are sinful.

418
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,960
Remember that, Karmila.

419
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,960
Bob is right.

420
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,640
You are adorable.

421
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,280
-What? -What?

422
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,760
AUNTY KATHY: UPDATES ON SHAM?

423
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,440
AUNTY KATHY: MEET ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

424
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,000
It's nothing. Everything's okay.

425
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,840
It's not a boyfriend or anything.

426
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,520
This photo is fake.

427
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
Yes.

428
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
Did you conspire to make a fool out of me?

429
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,520
No!

430
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
So then, how...

431
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,200
So then, how did Bianca know about your secret mission?

432
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,960
I panicked because Bianca was pressuring me,

433
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
and I slipped.

434
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,800
Sorry, Aunty.

435
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,280
Okay, so they're not a couple?

436
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,520
But does Bianca like Bob?

437
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm not sure.

438
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,280
Karma!

439
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,640
I don't know because she's close to Bob and close to another guy, too!

440
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
Another guy? Who?

441
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,560
Is it the guy from the live auction?

442
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,000
Sham. But I don't know much about him.

443
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,600
In Japan, he apprenticed under a pottery master.

444
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,440
Find out more about him. And report to me.

445
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,080
But Aunty...

446
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,480
This is your payment for the Japan job.

447
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,880
If you don't want this new job, I'll hire someone else.

448
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,080
Bianca hired you,

449
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,840
but I can fire you.

450
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,160
So? Do you want to do it?

451
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
What's up?

452
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,280
Your father doesn't want to see you.

453
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,160
Are you doing this on purpose?

454
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
Can I visit your father?

455
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,600
When I was lost in Saga, Bob hugged me so tightly.

456
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,320
Such a meaningful hug.

457
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,040
You know where Karma wants to meet? She's asking you to come along.

458
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,040
No way!

459
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,600
Will you be my boyfriend?
