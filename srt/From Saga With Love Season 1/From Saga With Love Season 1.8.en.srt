1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
What's up?

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,600
All lies are sinful. Remember that, Karmila.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
No, this...

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
It's Aunty Kathy, Bianca's mother.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,160
I was scolded by her recently.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,480
That's why I get tense when she texts.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,440
So, about your father. What are you going to do?

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,640
I'll go home again tomorrow.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
But maybe I have to be firmer this time.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
Because what's the point of going home and not be able to see him?

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,920
It doesn't matter how sick he is.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
I have to see him.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,640
-Right? -Yes!

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,120
It's true!

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,280
Suddenly you can speak Japanese now you're back in Malaysia!

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,120
Yes! 'Unagi mentaiko edamame saranghae'!

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,880
Saranghae is Korean.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Really?

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
It's okay.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,480
I think he's rich.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,800
-He drives a luxury car. -Which brand?

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,960
Next time, take a photo.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,920
Okay, so?

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,240
After he learns to make bowls in Japan, what are his plans?

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
What does his parents do?

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sure what his father does, but he has a stepmother.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
I don't know if his parents are divorced,

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,120
he's never mentioned it.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,840
How many siblings does he have?

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
I'm not sure.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,600
You're not sure about everything! How old is he? What is his full name?

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,040
-I'm not sure... I don't know! -Then what do you know?

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,320
You don't even know how to stalk! You're an embarrassment to women!

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,640
How did you stalk your boyfriend before this?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've never had a boyfriend.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,480
This young girl...

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,280
Let me teach you something.

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
Ma'am, just pick a colour.

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,640
If you don't like it, next week you can change it.

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,640
Okay, this one.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
-This one? -Yes.

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,920
-You like this? -Yes.

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,840
She took so long to choose, then picked such a boring colour.

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,600
Isn't this colour pretty?

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,240
Very pretty.

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,760
I'm glad to see you happy again.

48
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,520
I knew that Bob's the only one who could make you feel better.

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,880
He really knows me, right?

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,160
He's sweet, such a gentleman and kind of cute, too.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,920
Why didn't I see it before? I was so blind.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,520
Not blind, but maybe you were sleeping that time.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,240
That's why you never noticed that he's always looking out for you.

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,840
During the flight, he gave you his pillow for you to hug.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,360
He also pulled up your blanket to cover you up.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,200
It was so sweet!

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,840
Oh my God, he did all that for me?

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,440
Of course, he likes you.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Wait, he told you that he likes me?

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,400
I was just guessing initially but he admitted it eventually.

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,800
He's just slow, and scared to confess to you.

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,279
You know what? If he isn't brave enough to make the first move,

63
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,976
maybe I should be the one to tell him how I feel. What do you think?

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,120
Yes, why not? You always take on these strong girl roles.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,280
You can do it!

66
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
Yes! I can do it!

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
Can I change the colour?

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
Of course, Ma'am.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,640
What's your problem?

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
Sorry, Sham.

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,480
Your dad is still asleep. Next time, okay?

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,560
I've come here three times already.

73
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,920
Not once have I seen Dad.

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,320
-You asked me to come back to Malaysia. -Sham!

75
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
Tell it to me straight.

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,160
Are you not letting me see him on purpose?

77
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
Go. Out!

78
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,760
I just need to be honest with you.

79
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,520
But you cannot get angry. Don't get angry, okay?

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,040
Tell me. What is it?

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,080
He doesn't want to see you. He's mad at you.

82
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,960
Mad at me?

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He said,

84
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
you're only back when he's about to die.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,480
And if you're as stubborn as that,

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,440
might as well not see him at all.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
Then why am I even here?

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,880
Sham, you should talk to him.

89
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,400
He doesn't mean it.

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,480
He's just hurt.

91
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,640
-He's hurt? -Yes.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
What about me?

93
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
No one cares about how I feel, right?

94
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,360
Sham...

95
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,880
WHY DID I ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME BACK?

96
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,440
I SHOULD'VE JUST TURNED BACK.

Selangor-Japan Friendship Garden, Shah Alam.

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,760
Yes! Perfect.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
This one is too black.

137
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,440
It's like a funeral attire.

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,600
This one is too white.

139
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,160
It's like I'm getting married.

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
This one is too pink.

141
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,960
Does Karma like men in pink?

142
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,640
Wait.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
What colour does Karma like?

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,600
But when we were in Saga, it wasn't even Sakura season.

145
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,760
I look like I work in a sushi place.

146
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
This one seems okay.

147
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,920
It can't just be okay. This is an important moment.

148
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
I have nothing to wear!

149
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,800
He's angry at me for not coming back?

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
I should be the one angry at him.

151
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
Sham,

152
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
actually what are you so angry about?

153
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,040
I'm not trying to pry.

154
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
If you don't want to tell me, it's okay.

155
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,280
I just feel like you've been keeping it in for a very long time.

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,200
If you want to tell me what happened, I'm here to listen.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,040
Do you ever notice I've never mentioned my mother?

158
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Back then during the national examinations, I got flying colours.

159
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,440
My school had a ceremony for students who got straight As,

160
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,360
and parents were invited.

161
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,560
My father was supposed to take a half-day off

162
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
and pick up my mother from home to attend the ceremony.

163
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Where are you?

164
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,400
It's so late.

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,120
Poor Sham doesn't have anyone with him.

166
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,160
It's okay, I'll go ahead.

167
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,280
He is supposed to send the car for repairs, but he didn't do it.

168
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,080
Hey! Watch it!

169
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,280
Sorry! The brakes aren't working well.

170
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,680
People tried to console me,

171
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
telling me that it's fate.

172
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,960
But is it fate if it's something that could have been avoided?

173
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,920
My father had always prioritised work over family.

174
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,760
If only, for that one instance, he prioritised us,

175
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,560
then maybe I wouldn't have lost my mother.

176
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,280
I couldn't face my father after that.

177
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,480
I got an offer to enter boarding school.

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,000
I took it straight away.

179
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,920
Over time, I felt even more distant from him.

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,880
Maybe that's why, after my studies, I left.

181
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
To study engineering in Tokyo.

182
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,680
When I wasn't around, my father remarried.

183
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,920
It's not that I don't like my stepmother.

184
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,040
But when I see my father with his new family,

185
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
he was able to work less,

186
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,880
come home early, prioritise them.

187
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,480
Why couldn't he have done that for us in the past?

188
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,920
After my studies,

189
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,880
I came back to Malaysia to work.

190
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,440
But my heart was still in Japan.

191
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Every time I had the chance to go there, I would.

192
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
Explore new places,

193
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,320
experience new things.

194
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,240
From the moment I met Master Akiro

195
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,240
and tried my hand at pottery,

196
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,240
I felt like I finally found where I belong.

197
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,400
I made the decision to quit my job,

198
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,720
move to Japan,

199
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,320
and study the art of pottery.

200
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,800
There's nothing for me in Malaysia.

201
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,000
What did your father say when you moved to Japan?

202
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,800
He didn't say anything.

203
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
He just let me.

204
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,000
Maybe after my mother passed away,

205
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,920
in a way, I'm not just motherless.

206
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,000
But fatherless, as well.

207
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,720
Even then, I still failed to realise.

208
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,520
When I heard that he was sick, I still came back.

209
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,480
But my father doesn't even want to see me.

210
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Did you really want to come back?

211
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Didn't you force yourself to?

212
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,096
To the point where you needed me to accompany you to the airport?

213
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,440
But I'm back, right?

214
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,200
There's a difference between

215
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
someone who wants to come back and someone who is forced to.

216
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,760
You think your father doesn't know?

217
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
He can feel it.

218
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,960
He's your father.

219
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,120
I know you're angry

220
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,680
because he didn't prioritise you and your mother.

221
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,080
But now he's changed, right?

222
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,920
Can't you forgive him?

223
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,680
He didn't change for me, Karma.

224
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,600
How would you know if you keep avoiding him?

225
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,880
You don't even want to speak to him on the phone,

226
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
let alone spend time with him.

227
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,800
Maybe he feels like there's no point in trying to reach you.

228
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,760
Whatever happens, it's not going to bring your mother back.

229
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,560
And you'll always blame him.

230
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,080
I...

231
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,560
I don't know how to forgive him.

232
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
I understand, Sham.

233
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,000
But for someone who has made a mistake,

234
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,200
there's nothing more important than forgiveness from family.

235
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,880
Trust me. This is what I can tell you as the official black sheep of my family.

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,880
It's not the same Karma, what you did and what he did.

237
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,640
You're right, it's not the same.

238
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,680
The difference is, I got lucky because the consequences aren't that bad.

239
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,160
Your father's mistake isn't unforgivable.

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,520
He doesn't deserve the blame that you're giving him credit for.

241
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,760
And you don't know the regret that he feels.

242
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
Anyway, can I visit your father?

243
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
What for?

244
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
I like old people.

245
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,640
So spend time with your own parents.

246
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,560
I don't have a father. Not for a long time.

247
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,240
I was two when he passed away.

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
Sorry, Karma. I didn't know.

249
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,280
How would you have known if I never told you.

250
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
It's okay, take me to visit with your father.

251
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Let's go?

252
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,080
If he doesn't want to see you, don't blame me.

253
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's just go.

254
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,760
I knew it.

255
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,720
He won't come out if I'm around.

256
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,160
Can you relax?

257
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,240
Old people like me. Just look at Master Akiro.

258
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
That's because he already met you.

259
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,920
My father might not want to see you at all.

260
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,880
You don't have any faith in me at all!

261
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,040
He'll come out.

262
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,560
Aunty, you used to be a flight attendant?

263
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,560
You must've travelled to many places!

264
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,440
-Have you been to Japan? -I have.

265
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,640
But just Tokyo and Osaka. I've never been to the place you went to.

266
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,880
-Saga is great, Aunty. -Really?

267
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,800
I'd love to go again.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,520
We should go, with Uncle too!

269
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,240
We're already so old, and can't walk so much!

270
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,800
Come on, you're not old! You're still hot, Aunty!

271
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,680
And Uncle, still so handsome.

272
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,080
You look exactly like Riezman Khuzaimi.

273
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,800
If my mother sees, she'd get heart eyes.

274
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,720
-Please eat. -Okay.

275
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I'll make more tea.

276
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Excuse me, dear.

277
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,440
Oh no!

278
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
Sorry.

279
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh my God.

280
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
It's okay.

281
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,000
-Sorry. -It's okay. It's a small matter.

282
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,960
It's okay, Uncle. When we were in Japan, we...

283
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I...

284
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
I broke many pottery pieces.

285
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,440
My arm is not strong anymore.

286
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
I can't do a lot of things myself.

287
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,600
Slowly, Uncle. God willing, you'll be able to recover.

288
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,080
You can do it!

289
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,360
Watch your feet.

290
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Thank you for coming. Sorry I could only serve banana fritters.

291
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,440
No worries, Aunty! The banana fritters were the best!

292
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,400
I'll get going then.

293
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,280
Aunty, Uncle.

294
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,080
-Please come again. -God willing, Uncle.

295
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,840
Alright, see you again!

296
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,640
-Bye! Peace Be Upon You. -Peace Be Upon You.

297
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,520
Hear that? You need to bring me over again!

298
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Hold on.

299
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,240
I'm still unsatisfied.

300
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,960
How were you so sure that my father would want to see you?

301
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
It's like magic, right?

302
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
It's easy.

303
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
I see you as someone who's quite proper,

304
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,120
who values manners.

305
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,320
Which means,

306
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,760
your parents must be the same.

307
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,760
Your dad wouldn't just ignore a guest at his home.

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Am I right?

309
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,080
-How do I look? -Nice! Cute!

310
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,480
Where are you meeting Bob?

311
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,680
You'll never guess.

312
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,240
Selangor-Japan Friendship Garden.

313
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,520
Okay.

314
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,440
It's a bit cringe, but it's fine.

315
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,560
Carry on.

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,520
-You remember when I was lost in Saga? -Yes.

317
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Then when you guys found me,

318
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,160
Bob hugged me like he didn't want to let go. Remember?

319
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
I do! That was such a meaningful hug.

320
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,840
Right? It was really special.

321
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,320
So I want to try to recreate that moment with him.

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,240
So romantic!

323
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,040
Can you text Bob,

324
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,520
and ask to meet him there?

325
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,920
Why am I the one texting him? You should be the one texting him!

326
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,120
If I text him, he will be suspicious.

327
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,760
You know how he is.

328
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,640
He might feel awkward and not want to come.

329
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
But, if he asks why I want to meet him there?

330
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,280
Tell him that you miss Japan,

331
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,520
and that you want to relive the moments back in Saga.

332
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,080
But when you guys are dating, what do I do there?

333
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
I'm just going to be third wheel.

334
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,920
Just ask Bob to bring Sham.

335
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,720
Then you and Sham can go get some Lok Lok, like the other day.

336
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Okay.

337
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,640
You're handsome.

338
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Thank you.

339
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,920
You're really making an effort. Where are you going?

340
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
Just trying out a new hairstyle.

341
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,160
Sounds fishy.

342
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm going to ask Karma out on a date.

343
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,000
Where to?

344
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,720
Japan.

345
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,400
You had to go so far, all the way to Japan,

346
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,240
when there's a slice of Japan in Shah Alam.

347
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,840
Selangor-Japan Friendship Garden.

348
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
Okay.

349
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,840
Because Japan is where I first met her.

350
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,920
No, actually I met her on the plane, on the way to Japan.

351
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,800
But it was only in Japan that we became close.

352
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,480
So I think,

353
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,040
that's the best spot for me and her

354
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,200
to take it to the next level.

355
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,640
I can see the logic.

356
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,280
Hey, guess where Karma is asking me to meet her?

357
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,000
Selangor-Japan Friendship Garden.

358
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,800
We really are made for each other!

359
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,040
-Like soulmates. -Yes.

360
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,920
She's asking you to come along. Let's go?

361
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,520
No way!

362
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
-That's so awkward. -Don't be like that.

363
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't even ask you to pay rent.

364
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,240
Bob, what am I supposed to do there?

365
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,256
Eat popcorn while watching the two of you?

366
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
You'll figure something out.

367
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I don't want her to cancel on me if she finds out you're not coming.

368
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Please?

369
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay, fine.

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,160
This is what friends are for!

371
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,000
-I'll go get my bag. -Okay.

372
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,600
Where are they?

373
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,800
They'll be here soon.

374
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,240
Show me the photo.

375
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,360
-You see? Isn't it pretty? -Nice!

376
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,400
They're here!

377
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,320
Oh, my God.

378
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,040
Bob has a new hairstyle. So cute!

379
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,680
He must've styled it for me.

380
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
Looks the same.

381
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,840
Hi, sorry we're late.

382
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,720
It's okay, you're not late.

383
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,360
-Hi, Karma. -Hi! Hi Sham!

384
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,520
Sham, why don't you...

385
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,240
take Bianca for a walk

386
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
because you're an expert in all things Japanese, right?

387
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,440
Okay.

388
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,920
Hey, there's no need!

389
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,520
Actually, there's a really nice Lok Lok place nearby.

390
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,440
You guys like Lok Lok, right?

391
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,440
Why don't you go try it with Karma?

392
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,160
But actually, I have something to discuss with Karma.

393
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,320
About my short film, I need her to do a voice over.

394
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,280
Bob, we can discuss that another day, right?

395
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,240
Why don't you two go explore?

396
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,640
Anyway, I'm thirsty so I'll go and look for a drink.

397
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Let's go, Sham?

398
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,400
If you're thirsty, don't go wandering around.

399
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,200
Bianca, you and I go find drinks, while Bob and Karma wait here.

400
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
I agree.

401
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,640
Hey, I'm fine! I don't want to wait.

402
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,920
Plus Bianca doesn't really like walking that much.

403
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,440
You're mistaken, Bianca does like long walks.

404
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,200
Bob, you really do know me.

405
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,960
Let's go take some photos? The lighting is great.

406
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,160
You haven't taken my photos in a while.

407
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
-Of course. -Let's go.

408
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Let's go.

409
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Okay.

410
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,200
Take photos, right?

411
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,520
You want to take photos here?

412
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Sure, hold on.

413
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
This spot okay?

414
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,080
Bob, can I ask you something?

415
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Okay.

416
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,080
I know.

417
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,160
I know how you feel.

418
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,960
You know? How do you know?

419
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,440
That doesn't matter.

420
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,080
I just want to say... Whatever you feel,

421
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,080
I feel it too.

422
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What?

423
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,840
Bob...

424
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Will you be my boyfriend?

425
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,936
-You like Bianca? -You like Karma?

426
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,120
I'm in love.

427
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,640
Don't be mad at me, okay?

428
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,136
I've come back and you don't want to see me.

429
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,600
Why does everyone think that Sham's my boyfriend?

430
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,240
We're just friends!

431
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,760
Hi, boyfriend!

432
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,040
Look at the way Sham looks at Karma.

433
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,800
He definitely likes her.
