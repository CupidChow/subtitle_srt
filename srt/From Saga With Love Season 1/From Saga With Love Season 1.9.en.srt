1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm nervous.

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,200
What if he rejects me?

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,096
Listen here.

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,800
You're Bianca Rozario.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,496
Wherever you go,

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,200
you're the most beautiful woman there.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,936
If not the most beautiful, you're at least in the top three.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,760
Which man would reject you?

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,600
Let alone Bob!

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,496
By the time we're back,

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,200
you and Bob will be a couple.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,920
Bob and I will be a couple!

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,400
Thanks, Karma.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,800
You really are a good friend.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Are you ready?

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Let's go.

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,440
Will you be my boyfriend?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
What did you say?

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,656
All this while,

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,040
I've been really careful with who I let into my life.

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,976
People just want the Bianca who's famous,

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
who's glamorous, who's rich.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,080
But no one really takes the time to get to know me.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
Except for you.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,696
You know me.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,120
You take care of me.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Like during the flight,

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,040
you willingly gave up your pillow for me.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
You pulled the blanket.

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,480
You made sure I slept well.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,016
You know all of that?

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,480
Of course, Bob.

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,320
Maybe I just don't know how to express my appreciation for you.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,360
But I see all that you do for me.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,600
And I know that no one is better for me than you.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,080
I know that now.

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I...

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,920
I've always thought that I wasn't enough.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're more than enough.

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
Need to take a photo!

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
I don't understand.

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,640
What is going on?

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,480
Bianca has confessed to Bob!

44
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Confess what?

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,720
Confess that she likes him, you slow-witted.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,880
I tried so hard to pull you away, to give them privacy,

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,376
but you didn't get it at all!

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,896
Just stood there in the way.

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,080
Luckily, Bianca is proactive.

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,640
Bianca confessed that she likes Bob?

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
But Bob wants to confess...

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Bob also wanted to confess to Bianca?

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh my God, that's so sweet!

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
Don't you have feelings for Bob?

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,520
Of course not. You're imagining things.

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
You think is is some soap opera?

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,176
She likes him.

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,817
He likes me. I like you.

59
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,081
Who do you like? Master Akiro? You think it's like that?

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,080
I guess this is quite a magical evening.

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Why?

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
Maybe we're not the only ones becoming a couple.

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,520
Look at the way Sham looks at Karma.

64
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,480
I can guarantee, he likes her.

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,080
Trust me.

66
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,040
Congratulations, Bianca!

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,640
Thank you, I'm so happy!

68
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,760
-You're with Bianca? -You like Karma?

69
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,880
I think Sham likes you.

70
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
Really?

71
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,680
I don't think so.

72
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Really. Trust me.

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,600
Don't be blind like me.

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,520
Luckily I still have my chance with Bob.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,696
What if he had moved on

76
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,640
because I was too blind?

77
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,920
I would've missed my chance.

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,560
Hi, Mum.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Hi.

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,456
You look happy.

81
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,720
I am happy. Really happy.

82
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Because I'm in love.

83
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,640
Wow.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
Who's the lucky guy?

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
If you want to know,

86
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,640
you have to promise

87
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,840
that you won't freak out.

88
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Why would I...

89
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Hold on...

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
Is it Bob?

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
Yes! A thousand points for you!

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,160
But that day, you said...

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,680
You said it was all fake? It was just a prank.

94
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,520
Well, that was then. Now, it's different.

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,320
Now, I can see what an amazing guy he is.

96
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
What about the other one?

97
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,680
Sham. What about him?

98
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,040
What about Sham?

99
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,560
He seems like a good person.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
He has a life goal.

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,440
Isn't it better for you to be with someone like that?

102
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,760
Okay, first of all,

103
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
what do you know about Sham?

104
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,280
You've only seen him once, right?

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,616
-When I did that kintsugi live auction? -Yes?

106
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,080
You don't even know him.

107
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,200
And, he doesn't know me.

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,160
The one who does know me is Bob.

109
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,360
And who says Bob doesn't have a life goal?

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,056
Why don't you try to get to know him?

111
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,216
Make an effort.

112
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
-No, I just... -And finally,

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,680
Sham likes someone else, okay?

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
He likes…

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,440
Karma.

116
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:27,301
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WISHED FOR WHAT YOU HAVE NOW?

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,936
KARMA: SHAM, TAKE ME TO SEE YOUR DAD TOMORROW? I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR HIM.

118
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,360
SHAM: WHAT SURPRISE?

119
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,640
KARMA: WAIT AND SEE! (HEART EMOJI)

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,040
Can you not send these heart emojis?

121
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,093
SHAM: OK.

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
Luckily, I haven't thrown it away.

123
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,400
What do you want to do with it?

124
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
Okay,

125
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,800
when I broke the pottery in Japan,

126
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,360
Master Akiro taught us

127
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,200
to repair them with the kintsugi technique,

128
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,880
using gold powder.

129
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
The repaired items

130
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,080
looked prettier than the original.

131
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
So Uncle,

132
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,040
let's try kintsugi?

133
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,840
Karma, you go ahead.

134
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,160
My hands are weak. I'll make it worse.

135
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,240
That's exactly why you have to do it!

136
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
To exercise your hands.

137
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,775
It's alright.

138
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,920
Sham can help guide you.

139
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,045
Right, Sham?

140
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,080
Go to him.

141
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Yeah.

142
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,376
Okay!

143
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,920
Let us start!

144
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,360
First, we take the glue

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,456
and the gold powder.

146
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
But because we don't have gold powder,

147
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
we'll just use gold paint.

148
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
Put in the glue.

149
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Yes!

150
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,920
I'll pour,

151
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,320
you mix.

152
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,056
Sham,

153
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
help him.

154
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:47,493
Go.

155
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Aunty,

156
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
-Can you help me? -Sure.

157
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Help me cut this.

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Sure.

159
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
And now,

160
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
we have to arrange the pieces

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,520
then we glue them together.

162
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,496
Uncle, did you know,

163
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,680
in Japan,

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,936
Sham is fantastic at making pottery.

165
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
His creations are perfect!

166
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
No, they're not.

167
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,720
I still have so much more to learn.

168
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,160
That is all

169
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,520
passed down from his late mother.

170
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Sham's late mother

171
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,680
used to do everything.

172
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,920
Sewing, drawing, arts and crafts.

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
I almost forgot about that.

174
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,760
Do you remember

175
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
the teapot costume that she made when you were in kindergarten?

176
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,080
You even won best costume.

177
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,760
Did you know?

178
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
Sham was so happy,

179
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,960
he slept with the costume on.

180
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,016
Really? Do you have a photo?

181
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,000
Maybe. I'll check.

182
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
Hold on.

183
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,440
Didn't know Sham was that kind of kid.

184
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
I found it!

185
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,600
I want to see!

186
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
It's cute!

187
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,280
So cute! Sham!

188
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,400
All kids are cute.

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
Serious!

190
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,040
Sham is

191
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
like his mother.

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,600
Like they're the same person.

193
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,480
I miss her a lot.

194
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,400
Not a day goes by that I don't think of her.

195
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
My wife, please don't be mad.

196
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
Of course not.

197
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
My ex's photo must be somewhere in here too.

198
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,336
What's a relationship without a little joke and tease?

199
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
No hard feelings.

200
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,400
If we make a mistake, we apologise.

201
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,960
And that's just how relationships last.

202
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,680
True. I agree.

203
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,880
-Aunty Ani? -Yes?

204
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Can you make us a drink, please?

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm kind of thirsty.

206
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Sure.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
Can you bring Karma along?

208
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Okay!

209
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Let's go, Karma.

210
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,240
Dad,

211
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
are you mad at me?

212
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,760
Because I'm home, but you don't want to see me.

213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,040
I know,

214
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,320
you're angry at me.

215
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,640
You've been keeping it inside for a while.

216
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
Even you coming back here,

217
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
I know you forced yourself to.

218
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,200
It's not that I don't want to see you.

219
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,280
I know,

220
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,640
you don't want to see me.

221
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,320
I know,

222
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
I failed as a father.

223
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,400
I failed to take care of your mother.

224
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
I made you an orphan.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,120
Sham,

226
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,320
I don't want you to force yourself to see me

227
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,160
because you feel obliged to.

228
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,040
You're right.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
I was angry at you.

230
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,960
I couldn't accept the fact that I lost Mum.

231
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
But,

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,360
I never realised that you also lost

233
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,160
the person you loved the most.

234
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,720
It never crossed my mind.

235
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,200
I only thought about myself.

236
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,800
You were still a child.

237
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,920
You couldn't have understood.

238
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,080
And now that you're older,

239
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,520
you can see it.

240
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,320
And maybe,

241
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,320
someone helped you see it.

242
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
I like Karma.

243
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,720
If your mum was around,

244
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
she would've liked her too.

245
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Dad,

246
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm sorry

247
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,960
for distancing myself from you.

248
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Sham,

249
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,280
I let you go, not because I didn't care.

250
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,880
I just didn't want to stop you

251
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,600
from doing what you thought was best for you.

252
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,200
I love you, Sham.

253
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
I love you.

254
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
I like seeing your father with your stepmother.

255
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,440
They're so relaxed. Such a great couple.

256
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,120
I hope when I have a boyfriend someday, we're like that too.

257
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,680
Always chill.

258
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,400
If you're looking for a boyfriend, find a good one.

259
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't just accept anyone.

260
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,440
Yes, but where do you even find a good one?

261
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,360
If even my almost perfect sister cannot find one,

262
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,200
how would I?

263
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,200
You deserve the best of man, Karma

264
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
We're here.

265
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Okay.

266
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Karma!

267
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,400
Thank you.

268
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,040
Promise me.

269
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,600
If you're into any guy, tell me first.

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

271
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,560
Let me see if he's worthy of you or not.

272
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,600
You're quite caring.

273
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,720
Not with everyone. Just you.

274
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Okay.

275
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
I can't park here for too long.

276
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Okay, sorry!

277
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Okay, bye!

278
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
Bye.

279
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,280
Peace Be Upon You.

280
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
Karma.

281
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,376
Yes?

282
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,176
Why didn't you invite him up?

283
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,256
Introduce him to Mum and me?

284
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
What does he do?

285
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,136
What's his name?

286
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,256
Someone has a boyfriend now!

287
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,016
That's not my boyfriend! We're just friends!

288
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Why are you spying on me?

289
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,856
What's with all the noise?

290
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,816
Mum, Karma has a boyfriend!

291
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,696
But she doesn't want to introduce him.

292
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,840
She wants to keep him as a secret lover.

293
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,680
That's not true! Can you not make up stories?

294
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,296
He's just a friend.

295
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,376
She's in denial, calling him just a friend.

296
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,696
Friends today, married couple tomorrow! He's a catch, Mum!

297
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,440
Drives an expensive car.

298
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,800
Handsome.

299
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,576
Strange that he likes her.

300
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,320
That's not a nice thing to say!

301
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,416
AUNTY KATHY: I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

302
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:48,656
AUNTY KATHY: I NEED TO TALK TO YOU He's texting, right?

303
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,456
Don't reply, just video call him.

304
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,496
Show him to Mum.

305
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,936
-Show Mum. -Enough!

306
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,120
She's right. Enough.

307
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,520
Handsome.

308
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,600
I told you to stalk Sham for Bianca!

309
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
Not for yourself!

310
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,280
This girl...

311
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,640
It's like asking the fox to guard the henhouse.

312
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,336
Why does everyone think that Sham is my boyfriend?

313
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,560
We're just friends!

314
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
Did I say that he's your boyfriend?

315
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,920
No, you didn't.

316
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Right.

317
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,160
So he's not your boyfriend.

318
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
But does he like you?

319
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,360
As in, is he interested in you?

320
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,960
Interested?

321
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
How do I know that?

322
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,880
Don't tell me you don't know that either?

323
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,320
How is he around you?

324
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,960
Normal?

325
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
I guess?

326
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
You have two sisters.

327
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,640
Didn't they teach you all this?

328
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
No.

329
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,160
They don't talk to me about these things.

330
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Okay.

331
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I'll teach you.

332
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,080
If we want to know whether someone likes us,

333
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,000
we need to look out for all these signs.

334
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,280
When he talks to you,

335
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,200
he will lean forward.

336
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,200
His body will face you.

337
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,920
Like this.

338
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,840
He will try to touch you,

339
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
lightly.

340
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Spontaneously.

341
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Like this.

342
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,160
When you're in a group,

343
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,520
he'll pay more attention to you, compared to other people.

344
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,840
He will

345
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,760
steal glances at you.

346
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,920
He will smile at you.

347
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,440
He will laugh a lot.

348
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,440
Even when the things you say aren't that funny.

349
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,080
Doesn't sound like Sham at all.

350
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Not at all.

351
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Maybe you haven't noticed?

352
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,280
It's okay.

353
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,560
The next time you hang out with him, make sure you pay attention.

354
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,280
If he does all of that with you,

355
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,760
it means he likes you.

356
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,920
But If he does all that with Bianca,

357
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
it means that he likes Bianca.

358
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Understand?

359
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
I understand.

360
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,200
This is this month's salary advance.

361
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,456
Don't spend it all.

362
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,720
Make sure you save some.

363
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,440
Don't forget to give some to your mother.

364
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Okay, Aunty.

365
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Thank you.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,120
Most welcome.

367
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Oh my God.

368
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,896
Hi, Bianca!

369
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
Karma!

370
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,056
Wow, you look so fair.

371
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,256
Right? Don't be jealous.

372
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,080
So, what's up?

373
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,560
I have a movie date with my new boyfriend!

374
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,280
Come along, you and Sham!

375
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,920
Won't that disturb you?

376
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
You don't want it to be just the two of you?

377
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,696
It's not like we've never hung out together before.

378
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,816
Besides, if I were to only go out with Bob,

379
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,280
the busybodies will gossip about us.

380
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,600
Please cover for me.

381
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,240
Okay! I'll ask Sham.

382
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Thank you!

383
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Bye!

384
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,560
Bye.

385
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,016
KARMA: MOVIE TONIGHT?

386
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,216
KARMA: MOVIE TONIGHT? SHAM TYPING: IT'S A DATE!

387
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,176
KARMA: MOVIE TONIGHT?

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,120
KARMA: MOVIE TONIGHT? SHAM: SURE.

389
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Hey.

390
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,520
Why are you smiling while repairing the sink?

391
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Or are you thinking about

392
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
-Kar... -Currypuffs!

393
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,360
-Hi boyfriend! -Hello.

394
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,960
You look so good today.

395
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,600
You also look good today.

396
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Hi, Bob!

397
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
I asked Karma to come along.

398
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm setting her up with Sham.

399
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,120
-Hi! -Hi, Bianca.

400
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,280
-Hey, Karma. -Hi, Sham!

401
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Hi.

402
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,200
Double date!

403
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
-Let's go. -Let's go.

404
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,136
-What do you want to eat? -I want rice.

405
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,176
-There's no rice. -There. That's rice.

406
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,976
-You're right. -Okay, what do you want?

407
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,776
I want

408
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,040
the usuals.

409
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,000
When he talks to you,

410
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,040
he will lean forward.

411
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
His body will face you.

412
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay.

413
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
It's pretty cool...

414
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,800
What are you doing?

415
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,480
Nothing. Just exercising my hand.

416
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Just stretch a bit.

417
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,240
Karma, you want anything?

418
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,880
He will try to touch you.

419
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Lightly.

420
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Spontaneously.

421
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,440
Do you want anything?

422
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,080
Hey Bob, it's okay. Let me.

423
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,336
-Sure? -Sure.

424
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Okay.

425
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
When you're in a group,

426
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,920
he'll pay more attention to you, compared to other people.

427
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,080
He'll steal glances at you.

428
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,640
-Right? -Yes.

429
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,800
He'll smile at you.

430
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
You guys!

431
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
How do the Japanese ask for water?

432
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Laughs a lot.

433
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Water!

434
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,520
She's recycling her own joke!

435
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,216
That's so funny!

436
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,000
Even though what you said wasn't that funny.

437
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Karma.

438
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,720
She's like a person who falls in love only for a short while.

439
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,320
You're right. She cannot be with the same person for long.

440
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,840
-She will look for other points. -That's why.

441
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,911
-I get it. -You guys go ahead.

442
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:48,941
Okay.

443
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,353
AUNTY KATHY: REPORT ON THE DATE PLEASE.

444
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
You guys?

445
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm going to the toilet.

446
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
-Okay. -Wait for me?

447
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,320
-You need to go? -No, it's fine.

448
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,560
We were having a conversation about...

449
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
So?

450
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
How was it?

451
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,360
Does Sham like you?

452
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,200
Or does he like Bianca?

453
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Okay Aunty,

454
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,240
I think,

455
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,000
Sham is not interested in anyone.

456
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,880
He doesn't like me or Bianca.

457
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Sure?

458
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,856
Do you remember everything I said?

459
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
I remember, Aunty.

460
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,720
Okay, this is what I see.

461
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,496
When Sham speaks to us,

462
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,880
he doesn't lean forward at all.

463
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,040
He doesn't laugh a lot. He doesn't touch anybody.

464
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,160
Not even with Bob?

465
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
With Bob?

466
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,400
Okay, never mind. Go on.

467
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,760
I understand now what you mean.

468
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
For example,

469
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,400
Bianca obviously likes Bob.

470
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,320
Everything that you mentioned, she did all of them.

471
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,040
Her body turns towards Bob when speaking to him.

472
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,160
She's always touching him,

473
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
and always laughing when talking to him.

474
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,960
Oh God.

475
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,440
How many times do I have to tell that child!

476
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,760
Don't be so obvious!

477
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,080
The boyfriend will get cocky. She needs to play hard to get.

478
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,920
She never learns!

479
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,000
Is that so? We have to play hard to get?

480
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,600
As a woman, we must let the man do the chasing!

481
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,160
Okay, what about Bob?

482
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,360
He's also all over Bianca?

483
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,840
Actually, no.

484
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,960
He didn't seem to be like that with Bianca.

485
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,680
-But... -But what?

486
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
But,

487
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,160
this is what I'm confused about.

488
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,200
Whenever I see Bob,

489
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,040
he keeps looking at me.

490
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,400
There's once he touched my hand.

491
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
When I made a joke, he laughed the loudest.

492
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,640
But we're just friends, Aunty! There's nothing going on.

493
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,400
So maybe the things you mentioned

494
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,440
is not for everyone?

495
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,320
It's different for everyone, right?

496
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
So, you're saying

497
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,480
Bob is like that with you.

498
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
And you?

499
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you like that with Bob?

500
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,413
No. But I seem to be like that

501
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,866
with Sham.

502
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,840
I laugh a lot when I'm talking to him.

503
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,040
I even touched him.

504
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,120
But it wasn't on purpose.

505
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,640
It was like, spontaneous.

506
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,680
You young girl…

507
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,360
Why, Aunty? Did I do something wrong?

508
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,920
No, Karma. You didn't do anything wrong.

509
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,280
It's okay.

510
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
That's all I need to know.

511
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,120
When we meet, we'll talk again, okay?

512
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,240
Now go and enjoy with your friends.

513
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay, Aunty. Bye.

514
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,880
You backstabbing bitch!

515
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,936
-Bianca! -I trusted you!

516
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,080
-Bianca, please? -Go to hell!

517
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,506
Do you like Karma?

518
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:17,574
Yes.

519
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,654
You're going back tonight?

520
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:19,721
What about Karma?

521
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:22,093
I don't know how to give her space.

522
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,336
Just leave me alone.

523
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,880
We were fine in Japan. I hate this!

524
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:30,033
Can you lose what was never yours in the first place?
