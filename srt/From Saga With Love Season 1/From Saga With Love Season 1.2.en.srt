1
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,280
No worries, just take it.

2
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,439
At this rate, we should be paying you.

3
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,039
No, I just don't like seeing a mess.

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,000
But messy could be artistic too, right?

5
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,719
See you later.

6
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,719
Thank you.

7
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,200
FATHER
CALLING

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,159
Oh my God.
That's not consensual!

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay. I can start working now.

10
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,800
Bianca is like you.

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
She's afraid of flying.

12
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,439
So every time we go on a flight,
I have to hold her hand

13
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,599
until she falls asleep.

14
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,080
So how long have you been with Bianca?

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
2 years.

16
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
2 years?

17
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
And Aunty Kathy doesn't know?

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
She knows.

19
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
She's the one who hired me.

20
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,599
You asked me how long I've
worked with Bianca, right?

21
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,800
Yes.

22
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,199
Okay.

23
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,000
What is it like working with Bianca?

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Nod your head.

25
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,080
Nod.

26
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,080
Okay, if you keep doing this with Bianca,

27
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,439
you'll be alright.

28
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,240
Actually, my work with
Bianca is just a side hustle.

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Just to pay the bills.

30
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,000
My real work...

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,639
DIRECTED BY BAHARI MALIK
is this.

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Wow!

33
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,719
Are you a filmmaker?

34
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,919
Yes.

35
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,759
But still underground.

36
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,599
This short film is going to introduce me

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
to the world.

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
Can I watch it?

39
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,159
Not yet. It's not done.

40
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,520
I haven't shot anything.

41
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm going to shoot it in Saga.

42
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
These are just the end credits.

43
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,159
To get me inspired.

44
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,800
Is this the smell of sakura?

45
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,840
If only.

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,240
Sakura season is over.

47
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,439
Karma.

48
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,600
Please translate this for me?

49
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,439
Are you choking on the sakura air?

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Sure.

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,639
Okay, I understand this.

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,439
But if I explain it now,

53
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,000
it will take until tomorrow.

54
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,600
Then you better start now.

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,519
Once upon a time...

56
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,959
Good morning!

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,319
Thank God.

58
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,360
Good morning.

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,639
Are you Bianca?

60
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,360
No.

61
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
Karma.

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Karma?

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,879
This is Bianca-san.

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
This is Bob-san.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,439
I am Karma-chan.

66
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,480
That's easy money.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,279
Just add 'san' and 'chan' to everything.

68
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,439
My name is Rie.

69
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,519
How was your flight?

70
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,240
Wait, you can speak English?

71
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,439
Yes, I work with people
around the world.

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,480
Awesome! We're going
to be best friends.

73
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Welcome to Japan.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,759
Welcome to Japan!

75
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,199
She said, “Welcome to Japan”.

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes, I understood that.

77
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
You can enjoy yourself,

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
but we came here for work.

79
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,399
Is the itinerary ready?

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Okay.

81
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,399
Here you go.

82
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,800
Bianca, I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Where is it?

84
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Here you go.

85
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,000
It's like a kindergartener's timetable.

86
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,959
Just one copy?

87
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,279
Yes, just one.

88
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,800
Keep your work of art.

89
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,040
Since there's only one copy,

90
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,040
you need to update me
on our activities daily.

91
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,759
If things don't go according to plan,

92
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,040
say “Sayonara” to your salary.

93
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
Ouch!

94
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,560
Please hold on. I'm going
to register for you guys.

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Okay. Thanks.

96
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,319
-Bob, let's go?
-Yes.

97
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,279
This is nice, Bianca.

98
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,879
-Here's nice.
-Okay.

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,399
-Take my picture.
-Sure.

100
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,800
This place is beautiful.

101
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,759
One, two, three.

102
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,720
-One wide angle selfie first.
-Just pose.

103
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm just going to take some shots.

104
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,519
-Why are they all so ugly?
-Make sure you get my good angle.

105
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,920
-Try pushing your hair to the front.
-Like this?

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,839
-Let’s show your beautiful hair…
-Okay, that’s enough.

107
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,040
-Let's go.
-We're done?

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Done. Thanks.

109
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,079
Nice.

110
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Wow. Those are nice photos.

111
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,959
Must be nice to be an influencer.

112
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,560
You get to have a personal photographer.

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Why?

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
You want to be an influencer?

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,879
Yes! I want to be like Bianca.

116
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,319
That's why I'm working with her.

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,680
I want to know all her secrets.

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
How her photos turn out so nice.

119
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Must be because of this camera, right?

120
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
Lesson number 1.

121
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
It's not about the camera.

122
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,399
It's about the subject.

123
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,439
Is he saying that Bianca is pretty
or that I'm ugly?

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,199
Come, everybody.

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Here are your room keys.

126
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,839
And they're going to
bring your bags out.

127
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,480
So, I'm going to see
you guys on Saturday.

128
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Saturday?

129
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,279
Yeah.

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Saturday?

131
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,079
But today is Thursday.

132
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,920
You mean, you're not
going to be with us?

133
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,519
No, I'm not.

134
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,000
The driver, Mr. Yamagata,

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,399
is going to be with you guys
throughout the trip.

136
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,879
I'm only working today
and on the day of the shoot.

137
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,160
But, Karma,

138
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
you're the translator, right?

139
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,639
Yes!

140
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
Then that will be all from me.

141
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,120
Please enjoy your stay.

142
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

143
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay, let's get some rest.

144
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,799
Karma.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,639
We have the pottery
workshop today, right?

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
What time is the appointment?

147
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
They said we can come by anytime.

148
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,159
Okay.

149
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Let's go.

150
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,200
Rie!

151
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Rie, I need your help.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
What is it, Karma?

153
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,399
Rie, can you please call this place,

154
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,879
and tell them that we're
coming this afternoon?

155
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
But why aren't you
calling them yourself?

156
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,639
Because...

157
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,559
Because I have phone anxiety.

158
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,759
Phone anxiety?

159
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,200
What is that?

160
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,759
You know, Malaysians...

161
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,039
We are very shy.

162
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,840
We don't like to talk on the phone.

163
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,799
So we have phone anxiety.

164
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,080
Okay, I'll help you.

165
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,759
Hello.

166
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,039
Peace Be Upon You, Mum.

167
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,919
Sorry, I just turned on my phone.

168
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,000
Peace Be Upon You, Karma.

169
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,919
You didn't see me before leaving.

170
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,120
You just left.

171
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,519
Sorry, Mum.

172
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,159
I was late.

173
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm sorry, Mum.

174
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Mum!

175
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
Is that Karma? Let me talk to her.

176
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
How dare you do that to Fadhila.

177
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,919
It's not my fault.

178
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,240
Lan is the one who was late.

179
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,000
Anyway, I improvised, right?

180
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,480
Yeah, right!
The wedding was a disaster.

181
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,039
I'm still counting the money.
If it's short, you're gonna get it!

182
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,960
Suhaila, what is this?

183
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,399
I didn't touch the money.

184
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,799
I'm an honest person.

185
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,679
She knows what she's doing.

186
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,360
Hello, Karma...

187
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Karma?

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Hello?

189
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,639
Karma?

190
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,000
-The line is bad.
-Hello?

191
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,639
I'll call you back later.

192
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,360
-Hello?
-Bye Mum, I love you!

193
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,120
Please, let it not be Suhaila.

194
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,240
BIANCA ROZARIO

195
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Yes, Bianca.

196
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,600
Get me some food?

197
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,679
I'm hungry.

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Now?

199
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,440
No, next week.

200
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,039
Now!

201
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,919
Yes, Bianca.

202
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Welcome to the store.

203
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Hello.

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,559
Which one is...

205
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Which one?

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
This is...

207
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,679
Not this one.

208
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,919
This is...

209
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,559
Beef. No need.

210
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,759
This is...

211
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,039
Okay.

212
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,320
This one...

213
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,480
Okay.

214
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,519
These two.

215
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, thank you.

216
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
380 yen please.

217
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,720
Miss, I only have Malaysian Ringgit.

218
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,159
Japanese yen?

219
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,639
I don't have any other cash.
Please accept this, just take it.

220
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,320
Excuse me.

221
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,080
I'll pay for her.

222
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,879
Thank you!

223
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,200
You saved me.

224
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,360
Thank you.

225
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,000
Next time, change your
money before coming here.

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,639
Thank you.

227
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,759
Thanks!

228
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
My countryman!

229
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
You!

230
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,799
Wait for me.

231
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,080
Hey you!

232
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,919
Hey, you.

233
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,639
Are you Malaysian?

234
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

235
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,519
I just want to say
thank you for helping me.

236
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I wasn't helping you.
I wanted to be quick.

237
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Hey.

238
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,080
You can speak Japanese?

239
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Do you live here?

240
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,919
Or are you travelling?

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,039
First question, can.

242
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Second question, yes.

243
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,240
Third question, no.

244
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,840
Are we done? I'm going home.

245
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,200
Do you want to help me out?

246
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,679
I gave you beef steak, now you want wagyu.

247
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,480
But, I can pay.

248
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,679
And the job is easy.

249
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,960
You can work with a celebrity.

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,519
You get to meet Bianca Rozario.

251
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,399
She's a top actress in Malaysia!

252
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,279
If I wanted to hang out with Malaysians,

253
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,919
I might as well go back to Malaysia.

254
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,759
You don't like Malaysians?

255
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,720
Take you for example.

256
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,600
You come all the way here
without changing money.

257
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,200
Cause a ruckus in another country.

258
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,639
You think?

259
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,960
What a jerk.

260
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,240
You probably only spoke
lyrics from some anime.

261
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,120
Hey! Don't let me see you in Kajang!

262
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
Sorry.

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,399
I've read the script.

264
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
It's good.

265
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,639
The audience loves action these days.

266
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,519
So do I get to do stunts?

267
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Of course!

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,360
You get tied to a chair,

269
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,679
then a hero will come and rescue you.

270
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,840
You can't be doing dangerous stunts.

271
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
It's fine.

272
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,799
We'll discuss it when you get back.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
We've got a few offers.

274
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,879
All of them are good roles.

275
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,240
But, what if I want to
do something else?

276
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,360
Bianca, is this about you wanting to
start your own business again?

277
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Come on.

278
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,960
We've tried opening
a boutique, a cafe...

279
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,799
They've all closed down, right?

280
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,320
But that's just part of business, Mum.

281
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,240
Plus, I'm still figuring it out.

282
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,879
While you're figuring it out,

283
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,960
we still have bills to pay.

284
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,639
Just stick to what you're
best at right now.

285
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Acting.

286
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,240
While there's still demand.

287
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Fine.

288
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,480
I'll call you back later okay, Mum. Bye.

289
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,879
Bye.

290
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,919
I just want to make my own decisions.

291
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,559
Why won't she just let me?

292
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,159
She's your mother.

293
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,000
She just wants the best for you.

294
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:39,440
Everyone speaks as though
they know what's best for me.

295
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,120
Fish onigiri for you!

296
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,399
Thanks.

297
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,960
Why don't you take a rest?

298
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,200
We'll meet at the lobby at 12. Okay?

299
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,200
Bye!

300
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,960
His name is Master Akiro.

301
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,159
One of the best pottery masters in Saga.

302
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
His potteries are famous and sought after.

303
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,080
Especially during the Arita Ceramics Fair.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,679
Wow! Teach me, Master.

305
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,159
What does the "30" mean?

306
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,639
That's his age. He is 30 years old.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Good job.

308
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,639
Thank you.

309
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
What?

310
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,200
She's never been praised by you before.

311
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,080
I'll give praise if you do well.

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't worry.

313
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,159
I've done my research.

314
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,879
Can I have a selfie with you?

315
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,079
Thank you.

316
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,279
Okay.

317
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,640
Can we get closer?

318
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,480
Tilt your head towards mine.

319
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Like this.

320
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,799
Just bump your head with mine.

321
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,160
Like that.

322
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Okay.

323
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,799
Smile!

324
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,079
Smile, Bianca.

325
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,599
Thank you.

326
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
Thank you, Bianca.

327
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,039
Thank you.

328
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,039
Good morning!

329
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,079
Welcome to my pottery shop.

330
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,519
I'm Akiro.

331
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,160
Wait, he's Akiro?

332
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,680
No. He said, welcome to
Akiro's pottery shop.

333
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,839
Thank you.

334
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,319
I'm Karma.

335
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
This is Bianca.

336
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,079
That's Bob.

337
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,079
You're from Malaysia, right?

338
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Yes.

339
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,039
Pottery is an important
Japanese tradition.

340
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,400
In Saga, we try our best to uphold it

341
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,200
and promote it around the world.

342
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,400
Yes.

343
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,839
He welcomes us in.

344
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,839
This is Akiro.

345
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,359
-You!
-You!

346
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,359
There's no money-changer here!

347
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,200
Karma, is this your friend?

348
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
-No!
-No!

349
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,319
These are the visitors from your country.

350
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,039
I'm sorry, Master.

351
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,480
I was at the back cleaning up
and didn't hear them arrive.

352
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,799
Welcome, I'm Sham.

353
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,559
Bianca.

354
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,680
Didn't expect to see
a fellow Malaysian here.

355
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,799
Same here.

356
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Bob.

357
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Karma.

358
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,680
So, since you've already met Master Akiro,

359
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,759
let's go in.

360
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,799
Wait.

361
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,839
This is Mr. Akiro?

362
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,640
Master Akiro.

363
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,240
“Shishou” is a term used to address a person
who is an expert at something.

364
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,680
Master Akiro has been in the
pottery business for a long time.

365
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,160
But the internet says Mr. Akiro...
I mean

366
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,799
Master Akiro is 30 years old.

367
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,279
Karma, show him the article.

368
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Okay.

369
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,640
This sentence does not say
Master Akiro is 30 years old.

370
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,039
It says this photo
was taken 30 years ago.

371
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,559
Sorry.

372
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,319
Japanese writing can be a bit confusing.

373
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,920
There's hiragana, kanji, katakana...

374
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,559
-Here we go!
-Yes.

375
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,839
Let's go inside.

376
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,079
Welcome.

377
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,160
It's beautiful.

378
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
How much is this?

379
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,200
37,000 yen.

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,079
RM1,200!

381
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,519
Come on, everyone.

382
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,359
Let's go to my workshop.

383
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,839
Welcome.

384
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,240
He said, please get out.

385
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,720
This one is especially precious.

386
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
It's the last one my father was
working on before he died.

387
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,079
He passed away without finishing it.

388
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And for a long time,
I couldn't bear to touch it.

389
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
I didn't know what to do with it.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,839
Then one night, I dreamt of my father.

391
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,480
He said,

392
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,960
“Akiro, don't be burdened by thoughts
of what I might, or might not want.”

393
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:43,880
“The greatest gift for me
is for you to be happy.”

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,680
When I woke up, I came here
and continued his unfinished work.

395
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,000
This is...

396
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:08,400
the only piece that my father
and I ever made together.

397
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,359
What did he say?

398
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
His story,

399
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
is about...

400
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,839
It's too much.

401
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,440
It's too touching.

402
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,880
I can't believe, Akiko...

403
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,920
Akiro.

404
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
Akiro Sushi.

405
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,920
Akiro-shishou.

406
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,319
The story is so touching that
I'm getting his name all wrong.

407
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,559
Forgive me, Master Akiro.

408
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,839
I'm sorry.

409
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,119
She is much too moved to speak.

410
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,559
You'd better tell the story.

411
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,799
The story is like this...

413
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
'Your mother is green'!

414
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,759
Sorry!

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,359
It's so rare to see you laugh.

416
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
Okay. A little bit more.

417
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Hey!

418
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,839
You're actually lying, right?

419
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,279
You don't understand Japanese.

420
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,559
I understand Japanese.

421
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,880
I have a translation app, okay.

422
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,519
Good luck.

423
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,000
It's hard to get a connection here.

424
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,119
-I can't get any connection?
-Okay, Bianca.

425
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,319
Get ready for take.

426
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,880
I borrowed this just now.

427
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,400
Okay, action.

428
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,640
When you're in Saga, you have
to come to this pottery shop.

429
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,279
Because Saga is famous for its pottery.

430
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:42,440
I feel so lucky to have a great pottery
master who is kind enough to teach me.

431
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Cut!

432
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,799
Karma, what are you doing?

433
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
How are you going to translate
from over there?

434
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Come here!

435
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,960
I'm sorry.

436
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,039
It's okay.

437
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,279
Okay, Bianca, why don't we skip to the
part where you're making the pottery?

438
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,799
-Okay?
-Sure

439
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,920
Pottery is always in juxtaposition.

440
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,440
You want your clay soft,
but also strong.

441
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,759
You need to wet the clay.

442
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,319
Keep on pressing it hard

443
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,279
but mold it back up before it breaks.

444
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,799
Okay, now you have to press the clay.

445
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,480
Press it hard, like kneading prata bread.

446
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Press.

447
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,319
Press again.

448
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,880
Like that.

449
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,279
Press.

450
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,440
When your master speaks,
it sounds so poetic.

451
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,599
When Karma translates,
it sounds so brutal.

452
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,960
It's about being friends with the clay.

453
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,440
Then you will know where to put pressure.

454
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:29,039
Trusting it to do what you want it to do.

455
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,440
Okay, shape your fingers like a gun.

456
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,680
And poke it in the center.

457
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,559
-Like this?
-That's right.

458
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,880
Don't do that!

459
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Sham.

460
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,400
I don't think she knows pottery terms.

461
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,599
Why don't you help her?

462
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,599
What's wrong?

463
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,200
Master has asked me to help Bianca.

464
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,599
-How did you shape your hand?
-Like this?

465
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,480
Okay, push with your thumb.

466
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,599
Just a sec.

467
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,759
-Like this?
-Yeah. Okay, turn.

468
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,160
Okay, slowly.

469
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,039
Push, and pull upwards.

470
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:16,799
Careful.

471
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Once more, come on.

472
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
This is art, you know.

473
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,799
Okay, slowly.

474
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,119
Okay.

475
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,160
So if the pottery is successful,

476
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,319
It will look like this.

477
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Yes.

478
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,920
If it's not successful...

479
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,720
Were you making dim sum?

480
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
It looks alright.

481
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,599
There's a hole, you can drink from it.

482
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,240
You want to keep it?

483
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,680
If it were me, I...

484
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,880
I know it's ugly but,

485
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,759
I think I still want to keep it.

486
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,720
Okay.

487
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,799
We have to dry it first before baking.

488
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,359
Leave your phone number,
I'll call you when it's done.

489
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,359
Okay.

490
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,599
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

491
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,279
I will leave my phone number,
you can call me about anything.

492
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,279
Sure.

493
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,319
Master?

494
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,359
Tell him that I'm very grateful.

495
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,640
For being kind enough to spare the time,

496
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,920
and teach me with so much patience.

497
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,119
Master.

498
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:37,119
Thank you.

499
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,400
Thank... you...

500
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,400
Thank you. Yes.

501
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,480
I have some tea prepared.

502
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,680
Please wait for a while.

503
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,400
He said, thank you for coming.

504
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,079
He asked us to leave
because he's very busy.

505
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,400
-Let's go?
-Okay, let's go.

506
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
Let's go.

507
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,799
Hey, scammer.

508
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,000
I will expose your secret.

509
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,200
Your boss should know that
she's working with a liar.

510
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Hey, don't.

511
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
Please don't.

512
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,400
I have an offer for you.

513
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,519
You started off with lying.

514
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,400
Now, bribery.

515
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,200
Don't bring these
Malaysian traits to Japan.

516
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,960
This is not bribery.

517
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,359
I want to offer you a job.

518
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
Now you're subcontracting
the translation job to me.

519
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,119
Like a true Malaysian.

520
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,200
Please.

521
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,960
We're both Malaysians, right?

522
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,799
It's because we're Malaysians
that I want to help Bianca.

523
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,079
I'm helping her by exposing your scam!

524
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,599
Please. I'll pay.

525
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
How much?

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,200
My salary is RM2,000.

527
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,839
Minus RM500, I still have RM1,500.

528
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,279
Okay.

529
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,519
RM500.

530
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,759
I would consider RM2,000.

531
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,759
That's all of my salary!

532
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,039
Okay.

533
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,440
RM800!

534
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,640
Sorry, no deal.

535
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,359
Please.

536
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,880
Do you want to see Bianca fail?

537
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,640
What if she says the wrong thing?

538
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,559
It will embarrass Malaysia!

539
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,440
It will embarrass Japan!

540
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,839
It will embarrass Saga!

541
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,119
How could you...

542
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,759
Hey!

543
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,799
Look what you've done!

544
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,119
This is Master's father's heirloom,
it's irreplaceable!

545
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,640
You already know, everything
in here is fragile!

546
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,160
Why would you prance
around like a monkey?

547
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,359
You're unbelievable!

548
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,200
Do you think this is your
grandmother's house?

549
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,359
You're so troublesome,
I don't even know what to say!

550
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,559
I think you should go.

551
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,000
Master is angry at me.
I might as well follow you.

552
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,680
If we want to be bad,
we have to be smart.

553
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,799
Hey, get off!

554
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,839
I can't hear it clearly.

555
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,759
Hello?

556
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,599
You've fallen for Bianca, right?

557
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Bob and I?

558
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,240
No!
