1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Zairin!

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,279
Good luck!

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Okay.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,119
Can you believe it?

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,839
I've only seen this house on social media.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,879
So this is what famous
people's houses look like.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,840
Is it?

8
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:28,159
I'm not familiar.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,279
You don't follow Bianca Rozario?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,230
No.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,869
Actually, I applied for this job
because I can speak Japanese.

12
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,453
Wow. You can speak Japanese?

13
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:36,699
Yes!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,559
But if you don't know Bianca…

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,999
Yes, I know her!
She's an actress, model. She can...

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, I mean, know her personally.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,039
Did you know that her mother is so old

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,239
that she has hearing problems?

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,960
So you have to speak loudly to her.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,440
Really?

21
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:57,279
Yeah, Bianca posts a lot about
her mother's hearing problems.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,200
If you followed her, you'd know.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,754
Wasted my energy waiting.

24
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,595
Now she says she only
wants female candidates?

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,012
What a waste of time.

26
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:08,505
All the best.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Bye.

28
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:11,935
Next!

29
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,167
Karma!

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,440
Nice to meet you!

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,399
I am Karma!

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,880
You speak Japanese?

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Yes, I can.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
"Hait".

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Hai.

36
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:38,614
Hai?

37
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,099
Hai! Yatta!

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,455
"Yatta"? What does that mean?

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,137
It means, "Yes! You did it!"

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,560
So you're fluent in Japanese, then?

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Yes.

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Have a seat.

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
SAFI PERFECT WHITE

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,760
I use this brand too.

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,559
Of course.

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
Everyone follows
whatever Bianca does.

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Are you a fan?

48
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,960
Big fan!

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Thank you!

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Daisy!

51
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,691
-Good luck!
-Thank you.

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Good luck.

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,599
Hello, Aunty!

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Can you hear me?

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,079
I'm sorry about your hearing!

56
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,400
What do you mean?

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,960
Let's go!

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,359
Hi, everyone!

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,119
To those who are tuning in,
it's your lucky day! Why?

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,559
Because today,
we have a lot of special offers!

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Cute, right? It's so cheap.

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,559
You're right! This is a woman's bag,

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,039
but because it's in black,
men can use it too.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,199
Do you guys agree?

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,359
This is Safi Perfect White,
3 Times Brightening Cleanser, guys!

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,720
You'll see results in just one week!

67
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,681
"You're late to the game,
I've already used this."

68
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,559
So in order for our cats
to not be lonely,

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
we can accompany them
with this pet camera.

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,599
By 'one week', I meant two months ago.

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,040
That's why you can see
the results now. Flawless!

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,695
Right?

73
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:57,186
Wait...

74
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,780
THIS ONLINE SELLER IS SO BORING
Wait, don't go yet!

75
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,879
I still have all kinds of offers! Like...

76
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Like this!

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,879
Fermented fish!

78
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Guaranteed to win over your in-laws!

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,400
@JULIINYOURARE LEFT

80
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,600
It's okay.

81
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,960
Next time.

82
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,519
So?

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
How many millions
did you make in sales today?

84
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,520
"How many millions did you make..."

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
That's what you sound like.

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Zero sales, I bet.

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Right?

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Right?

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Some influencer you are.

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,120
You should just quit this nonsense.

91
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,400
You can get rich with this, you know?

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,520
You won't understand.

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
You're outdated.

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,840
Even your products were funded by Mum.

95
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,000
Stop burdening Mum like this.

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,160
Thank God!

97
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,799
I'm so happy you're getting married!!

98
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,929
So that you can move out!

99
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:12,993
My life will be peaceful.

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,120
Have you picked up your emcee outfit?

101
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Yes.

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,319
But, why do I have to emcee?

103
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm not even getting paid.

104
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,599
Because if I had the money
to pay someone,

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,520
I definitely wouldn't ask you.

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,200
MANIFESTING MY DREAMS

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,440
I WILL TRAVEL AND SEE
THE WORLD SOMEDAY

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Time to manifest, Karma and Bianca...

109
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
BIANCA ROZARIO

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:13,080
DEAR KARMA
WE ARE IN JAPAN

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,120
DEAR KARMA

00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,948
I WILL GET TO WORK WITH BIANCA ROZARIO.
WE WILL GO TO JAPAN AND BE BEST FRIENDS.

113
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,293
I WILL BECOME AN INFLUENCER
WITH MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS!

114
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,560
You have to remember,

115
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,480
that I will always love you.

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,360
Thank you, sister.

117
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Cut!

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,679
It was very emotional.
That was so nice.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Thank you so much.

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Next scene!

121
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,240
My fan, please.

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Thanks.

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,039
MAMA
15 MISSED CALLS

124
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,120
Can you give me some privacy, please?

125
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,999
Hi, Bianca.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hi, Mum.

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,480
How's the shoot?

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,039
Difficult.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,839
This kid is difficult, Mum.

130
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,359
Where are all the
child actors who can act?

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,760
Are they extinct?

132
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,440
Not everyone is born
with talent like you.

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,680
Let's have a look at your face?

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,639
What's wrong with your lips?

135
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,600
It looks swollen!

136
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,799
Bianca,

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,480
you know you can't
use just any lipstick!

138
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,120
You see, this is what happens
when I'm not with you!

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,360
You're so forgetful.

140
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,687
That's why you
need a personal assistant.

141
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,232
Especially when you're in Japan.

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Mum, there's no need.
I have Bob right?

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,600
That's another issue.

144
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,599
You can't go with a man alone.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,879
What will people say?

146
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't want any gossip...

147
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Bob!

148
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Hi, Aunty!

149
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:34,426
Bianca,

150
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,496
your performance just now was great!

151
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,001
I couldn't really hear what you said,

152
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:39,386
but I could feel your emotions.

153
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Bob!

154
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,360
If you're taking a photo of me,
make sure I'm ready!

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Sorry, Aunty.

156
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Take another one.

157
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Okay.

158
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,360
So, one, two, three.

159
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
Alright!

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,120
Send that photo to me before posting.

161
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,641
Okay, Mum, I'll call you back.

162
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,729
I have to go.

163
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:59,126
Later, bye.

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Enough.

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,120
My mother is so worried that
people will gossip about us.

166
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
About us?

167
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,760
What's there to talk about?

168
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,480
I don't understand her.

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,519
Whenever people gossip about me

170
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,960
with an athlete or some rich guy,
she seems fine with it.

171
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
But with me,

172
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
she doesn't like it?

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,959
So now,

174
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,760
she wants to hire a personal assistant
to follow us to Japan.

175
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Our plan is finished!

176
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,080
I will make sure our plan goes on.

177
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I'll make sure of it.

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Really?

179
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,640
Anything for you,

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Bianca Rozario.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

182
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,599
Enough, Bob.

183
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,040
No, you look beautiful.

184
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,080
Why would Bianca hire
her as her personal assistant?

185
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
She's the one who needs an assistant.

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
I know, right?

187
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,119
If she's at a drive-thru,

188
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,240
she would get lost going from
the cashier to the pick-up window.

189
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:09,533
Hey!

190
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:10,893
I'm right here!

191
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,066
Why don't you talk about me
when I'm not around?

192
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,079
It's not a sin to talk about
you right in front of you!

193
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Right

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,799
While we're talking about her, right?

195
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,119
For the Japan trip,

196
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,440
Mum had to pay for her
passport and everything.

197
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,560
Seriously, Karma?

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Karma!

199
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
You can't do that!

200
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,919
Speak of the devil!

201
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Look.

202
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
It's Bianca's mother.

203
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,720
Hello.

204
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,839
Hello, Karma. You got the job.

205
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
You're going to Japan.

206
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,840
So, I will have to brief
you about this trip.

207
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,160
Can you come over now?

208
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Yes!

209
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,879
Thank you!

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,200
Thank you, bye!

211
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,120
Yes, thank God.

212
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,200
Sorry, Fadhila...

213
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Suhaila...

214
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
I really want to help,

215
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,560
but I have a job now.

216
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,640
You know, being
Bianca Rozario's assistant and all.

217
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,400
She's going to slack off?

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm getting married,

219
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
and no one cares!

220
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,960
What do you think I'm doing here?

221
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Sorry, Suhaila.

222
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Usually, I'm the one
who goes with her.

223
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,600
But because

224
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,840
I can't really walk now,

225
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,640
I'm forced to send you instead.

226
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Bianca is shooting a commercial
for green tea in Saga.

227
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,600
Your job is not just
as her personal assistant,

228
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,160
but you'll also be her translator.

229
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course!

230
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
No problem!

231
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
But, I also have one other task for you.

232
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
It's a top secret mission.

233
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,880
Her videographer.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bob.

235
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,840
You will meet him.

236
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
He's coming along.

237
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,200
I don't like him.

238
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,640
I think he and Bianca

239
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,000
are dating.

240
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,600
Really?

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
That's your top secret mission.

242
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,453
You need to confirm it for me.

243
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:31,687
Is it true?

244
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
But,

245
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
don't let anyone know,

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,320
that you want to know because
it's an order from me.

247
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
If anyone knows about it,

248
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,199
this mission will fail.

249
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
That means you will fail.

250
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Understand?

251
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,320
Bianca!

252
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,080
This is your new personal assistant.

253
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Karma.

254
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
Hi!

255
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Wow!

256
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Bianca!

257
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I...

258
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Wow!

259
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,960
It's really you!

260
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,640
Am I dreaming?

261
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
Nice to meet you, Karma.

262
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm Karma.

263
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Yes.

264
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,120
I just said your name.

265
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,720
Why don't you two have a chat,

266
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,520
get to know each other.

267
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,920
I have calls to make.

268
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Okay, Mum.

269
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Shall we?

270
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,486
So,

271
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:48,761
are you ready for this trip?

272
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,640
Yes.

273
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:50,640
Ready.

274
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,440
Because this trip is not
just any ordinary trip.

275
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,240
I have a job for you.

276
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,960
A top secret mission.

277
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,360
But you need to promise me, Karma.

278
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
You can't tell anyone.

279
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay.

280
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
What do I have to do?

281
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,279
For now,

282
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,320
I need you to research interesting
places to visit in Saga.

283
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,480
Places that are beautiful
and fun to shoot.

284
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,679
Saga is well known for

285
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
its pottery, green tea, seafood

286
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,080
and many more.

287
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,839
There, I've already helped you out.

288
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,680
The rest, look it up yourself.

289
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,839
Okay but,

290
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,120
why is it such a secret?

291
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,799
My mother thinks

292
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,359
I'm taking two extra
days for holiday.

293
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,719
But actually,

294
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll be shooting.

295
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,302
But aren't you already
going there for a shoot?

296
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,687
You're an actress.

297
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,359
This is not for acting!
I'm so done with acting.

298
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
I've been acting since
I was a little girl.

299
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Do you know that

300
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,280
I was memorising scripts before I'd
learnt "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"?

301
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm tired.

302
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,239
I always play the same
types of characters,

303
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
all I do is cry and cry.

304
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm done!

305
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,440
I want to be a producer.

306
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,595
But my mother thinks I can't do it,

307
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:14,046
so, we have to show her.

308
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
-We?
-Yeah.

309
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,000
We'll shoot a travelogue.

310
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
We'll sell it to a TV station.

311
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,440
Then, I can start my own
production company.

312
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
Bianca Pictures.

313
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:29,294
Maybe.

314
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,319
What do you think?

315
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Sure...

316
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,559
No problem?

317
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,840
Why do you sound so unsure?

318
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Because I'm excited.

319
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
For you.

320
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,320
And Bianca Pictures?

321
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,999
Perfect.

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,079
I'll send you a website link later.

323
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,933
The commercial shoot
is at the end of the week,

324
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,855
so we have about
two or three days to explore.

325
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,759
You have to prepare
the itinerary.

326
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Okay?

327
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,280
Okay!

328
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,400
Why is it all in Japanese?

329
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
What's that?

330
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,980
My boss sent me this website.

331
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,285
How am I supposed to read this?

332
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,159
Why would she ask you?

333
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,440
Why doesn't she ask someone
who actually knows Japanese?

334
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,640
-You lied to her, didn't you?
-No!

335
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Not really...

336
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,559
Oh my God! My sister is a scammer!

337
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,240
I knew it!

338
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,439
Don't fool around.

339
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,679
This is serious. It's a job.

340
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,320
You can't act like
it's all fun and games!

341
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,774
The other candidates couldn't
speak Japanese either!

342
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,039
They still chose me!

343
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
I'm willing to learn,
that's why they chose me.

344
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,680
I need to stay calm.

345
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Hey.

346
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,359
Where will you land in Japan?

347
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,200
Osaka. Then, I'll take
another flight to Saga.

348
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,735
When?

349
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:49,789
In two days.

350
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,853
Fadhila's wedding is in two days!

351
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,480
Are you crazy?

352
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,999
You're the emcee!

353
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,279
I'm out of patience,
I'm telling Mum…

354
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
At night!

355
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,880
My flight is at night!
I can still make it!

356
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
At night?

357
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
You can still make it?

358
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,880
You'll emcee in the morning
and fly to Osaka that night?

359
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,080
Make sure you make it!

360
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Because if you don't...

361
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,119
Don't think I don't know sumo.

362
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,239
Don't mess around,

363
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,480
it's our sister's wedding.

364
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,400
Oh no, what have I done?

365
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
Welcome, come in.

366
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,879
Uncle, what is this?

367
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,920
A gift?

368
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
It's okay.

369
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,200
Thank you.

370
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,159
Hand over the
money packets and gifts to me.

371
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
Or you'll take them for yourself.

372
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,200
Hello, I'm Mr. Wong.

373
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,042
You're Fadhila's boss?

374
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,614
Thank you for coming,
welcome!

375
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,879
This is for your sister.

376
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,081
Wow...

377
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,741
Fadhila is my best staff.

378
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,092
Thank you, Mr. Wong...

379
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:03,086
My sister is so lucky to
have such a good boss.

380
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
Thank you. Welcome.

381
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
You're still alive, bro?

382
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,841
Wow!

383
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:09,626
Oh my God, it's so big!

384
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,840
Thank you. Please come in.

385
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,959
Not here.

386
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,519
You can sit over there.

387
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,840
Sorry.

388
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,040
3:00 PM

389
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,520
Fadhila!

390
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't you know how to knock?

391
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,479
Fadhila, where is Lan?

392
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,015
Why is he not here yet?

393
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,919
It's not like you don't know him.

394
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,080
He's never on time.

395
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,000
But he's so late.
It's almost an hour already!

396
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,479
Hey, who's getting married, now?
You or me?

397
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Calm down.

398
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,720
She's spoiling my mood.

399
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,426
She's gone.

400
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,346
Close the door. Lock it.
She might come back.

401
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,159
Hello?

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,040
Lan?

403
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:10,133
Where are you?

404
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,960
You're still at home?

405
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,040
Lan, Mum said if
you don't come now,

406
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Fadhila will marry Syed instead.

407
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,880
Her ex, Syed.

408
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,576
The one who's handsome, rich,

409
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,200
always punctual...

410
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,119
Excuse me.

411
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,439
That's my future brother-in-law.

412
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
Please make way.

413
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:37,347
Lan, hurry up!

414
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:38,659
Hang on.

415
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,600
So dashing!

416
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,679
Syed is not here yet, right?

417
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
-Not yet.
-Thank God.

418
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Give this to me.

419
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,160
Follow me.
Play faster, like this.

420
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,160
Go!

421
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,599
Coming through!

422
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,119
Move!

423
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,759
Lan, let's go!

424
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,880
Faster!

425
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,479
Not so fast, Karma!

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,920
Come on, faster!

427
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,840
Boss, thank you for coming. Hi!

428
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,471
Hi, sweetheart.

429
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,470
Karma, not so fast.

430
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,216
Take this! Hurry!

431
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:41,201
Sir, can you say a shorter prayer?

432
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,666
Because the bride has
a stomach ache.

433
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,119
-She must be nervous.
-Yes she is.

434
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,520
4:00 PM

435
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,039
Peace Be Upon You, all.

436
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,400
Thank you for coming.

437
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,639
Let's start it off with the

438
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,640
blessing of the newlyweds.

439
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Please come forward.

440
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,919
Don't be shy.

441
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Don't be too slow.

442
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,600
My back...

443
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:14,630
Okay, everyone else...

444
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,173
You can start getting in line too.

445
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:18,237
Miss Wan. Ajam...

446
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:19,781
You can get in line. Come on!

447
00:21:19,806 --> 00:21:21,566
Oh no, I left my glasses.

448
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,340
Glasses! Get his glasses!
Give them to him!

449
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,379
Quickly!

450
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,841
Sorry... everyone.

451
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,720
Okay, come on. Get in line.

452
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,695
Bianca! Can I have a photo?

453
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,968
Yeah, sure. Just one, okay?

454
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:41,753
Okay.

455
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:46,106
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

456
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,920
Patience.

457
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,880
Just a bit longer, then we don't
have to entertain this anymore.

458
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
We'll be in Japan.

459
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,760
Yes, can't wait!

460
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,415
Hold on.

461
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Where's that PA?
Why is she so late?

462
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,600
Call her.

463
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
I don't have her number.

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,439
I only just learnt her name.

465
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,800
What if she's late?

466
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,640
Then, we just leave.

467
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Leave her behind?

468
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:26,509
Thank you, Boss.

469
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:27,606
Thank you for coming.

470
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,700
-Are you okay?
-Okay.

471
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
4:15 PM

472
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,240
LOADING IMAGE
Please...

473
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Yes!

474
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,000
Don't be shy. You can bless
the newlyweds to your hearts' desire.

475
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:32,055
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

476
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,428
No worries, miss.

477
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:35,160
-What time is your flight?
-7.45 PM

478
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,100
7.45 PM.

479
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,342
What?

480
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,447
Hurry, please!

481
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,040
Hurry! You don't want to miss out.

482
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,959
You better drive now.

483
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,759
If I miss my flight.

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,560
I'll rate you only one star.

485
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,119
Ladies and gentlemen,

486
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,120
please help yourselves to
the food and enjoy the music.

487
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,639
Don't be shy.

488
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
Help yourselves.

489
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,960
Look at the road!

490
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,439
Don't just look around.

491
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,479
Please continue dining.

492
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,640
Flirt with your partner,
not with the food.

493
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
Can you go faster?

494
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,959
Go faster.

495
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,080
Faster!

496
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,280
Cut the queue! Cut them!

497
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,279
I mean...

498
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,421
Now it's time for the
cake-cutting ceremony...

499
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:36,568
Whoever wants to take photos
can come to the front.

500
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:37,840
But, don't block the camera...

501
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,720
Together!

502
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,080
Okay, one, two, three.

503
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,999
Run!

504
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,040
They're coming after me!

505
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,887
Where are you going?
You were speeding.

506
00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:15,006
The airport, sir.

507
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Karma!

508
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,160
Excuse me!

509
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,760
Excuse me, sorry!

510
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Oh my God.

511
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
Why is the gate so far?

512
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,119
Final call for Karmila Azad,
flight Air Asia D7 532 to Osaka.

513
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,000
Please head to the
boarding gate immediately.

514
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,239
Wait, please!

515
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,960
Let me catch my breath.

516
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:00,395
Hi, sir.

517
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,646
Can you bring me
and my grandma to Gate C5?

518
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:03,713
Grandma?

519
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,320
Sir, this old lady is lost.
Please take care of her.

520
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:15,940
-Bye, Grandma!
-Bye.

521
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Bye!

522
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,200
No wonder you're late.
You're dressed like this for the flight.

523
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
Sorry.

524
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
Sorry, Bianca.

525
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,200
The driver got pulled over
by the police for speeding.

526
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
This cannot happen again, Karma.

527
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,480
You better get your act together.

528
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Okay.

529
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Hold my contact lenses.

530
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,960
Don't you want to give it
to your personal assistant?

531
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,680
Bianca's a bit moody, today.

532
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm Bob.

533
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,960
Bianca's videographer.

534
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,399
I'm Karma.

535
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,719
So, you're Bob!

536
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Yes.

537
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,120
Fasten your seat belt. We're taking off.

538
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Okay.

539
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
You're okay?

540
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,406
It's here. You're sitting
on your seat belt.

541
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,839
Sorry.

542
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
Okay.

543
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
All right.

544
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,959
Is this safe?

545
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
What if I get thrown off?

546
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,880
You have to fasten it tightly.
Lift your arms.

547
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,120
-Okay?
-Okay.

548
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,039
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
about to taxi to the runway.

549
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,000
Please remain in your seats
when the seat belt light is on.

550
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,880
Sit back and relax.

551
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,989
There is no deity except Allah,
the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of all...

552
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,014
Nervous?

553
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,280
It's my first time flying.

554
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,760
It's okay.
It's like riding a bus.

555
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,280
Cabin crew, prepare for take-off.

556
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,719
-Welcome to Japan.
-Welcome to Japan!

557
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,959
-I don't have any money...
