1
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,399
Sham...

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,359
What happened?

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,800
Sorry, Master.
We shouldn't have been here.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,599
I will clean this up.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm sorry, Master.

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,039
I am deeply sorry.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,758
That one wasn't me, that one was...

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,038
I'm sorry, Master.

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,639
Let me clean this up first.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,560
No need.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,960
Sham, Ms. Karma...

12
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,960
I'd like you two to leave for a bit.

13
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,958
Say something.

14
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,400
Seeing you like this
makes me more anxious.

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,719
Maybe this is my punishment
for always lying.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
You broke just one.

17
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,119
As for me, I might be kicked out.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,599
I might even have to sleep
under a bridge tonight.

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,960
But, the one I broke is
the one that's irreplaceable.

20
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,559
Plus, if I hadn't broken that one plate,

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,599
you wouldn't have broken the rest.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,360
Like they said, out of the frying pan,
and into the fire.

23
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,120
Instead of being dramatic, it's better
to think about how to solve this.

24
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,800
Think about how much everything costs.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,679
- Why don't you talk to Bianca...
- No!

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,199
We'll both lose our jobs!

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
Then, what do you propose we do?

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,240
Wait here.

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,479
Fadhila, sorry.
I promise I'll pay you back.

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,439
I want to speak to Master.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,599
Help me translate.

32
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,478
I'm sorry, Master Akiro.

33
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,120
Master, Karma would like to apologise.

34
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,960
I know that piece is very meaningful.

35
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,840
Even a million ringgit won't
be enough to replace it.

36
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,759
Please accept this money
as a token of my apology.

37
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,719
No amount of money can replace
what that piece means to you,

38
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,000
but please accept this money
as a token of her apology.

39
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,599
And please forgive Sham.

40
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,919
This is not his fault.
This is all my fault.

41
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,318
And I take equal blame too.

42
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,000
It's my responsibility to
take care of this place,

43
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,599
but I failed.

44
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,199
Forgive me, Master.

45
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,239
- Is it Chinese New Year in Malaysia?
- What?

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,000
I mean, you got a really thick
money packet with you.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,279
That's actually...
my sister's wedding money packet.

48
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,199
I accidentally brought it.

49
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,439
I'll pay her back when I get my salary.

50
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,319
Digging a hole to fill up another hole.

51
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,800
So Malaysian.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,838
Anyway, I need to go.
I have another shoot.

53
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,480
When Bianca's pottery is ready,
I'll come to collect it.

54
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,839
Give me some time to think
about how to settle this.

55
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,079
Wait.

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,160
What about your translator job?

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,519
You're lucky that I was here.
If Bianca finds out, you're finished.

58
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,199
I'll figure it out.
I have many other problems.

59
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,160
Who knows, maybe I'll meet another
Malaysian who'd be willing to help me.

60
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,599
See you.

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,599
Wait.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
You can definitely find other Malaysians.

63
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,240
But finding a Malaysian who can keep up
with your antics will be hard.

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll help you this time.

65
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,800
Why?

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,758
Master probably won't even
look at me now.

67
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,839
Might as well help you.

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,839
Okay.

69
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,759
So, what's the plan?

70
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,600
- Hello. We're right here.
- Here?

71
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,040
- Where do we go?
- Right here.

72
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,680
- Hang on.
- Yes!

73
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,398
- Why don't we shoot at the cubicles?
- This one?

74
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,399
- Okay.
- Let's go.

75
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,078
Wait! Let me have a look at
your outfit. Twirl for me.

76
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,239
Wow!

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,679
We can shoot here, but I have
to set up my equipment.

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,239
- Okay, sure.
- It's too dark.

79
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,479
- All right. How do I look?
- Okay.

80
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,399
- Let's go.
- Perfect.

81
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,000
- Over here, Bob?
- There's someone here.

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,079
Okay.

83
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,518
- Karma, you're in the shot.
- Sorry!

85
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,479
Okay, one, two, three...

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,758
This part can come off.

87
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,079
Okay, so you hold on to this boom mic.
But don't enter the frame.

88
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll be wearing headphones,
and I'll be listening.

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Switch these on...

90
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,680
Okay.

91
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,479
- Say something?
- Something.

92
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Okay, good. I'm going to set up
the camera. Don't go far.

93
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,518
Okay. Put this on.

94
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,639
But it only allows you to hear.
You can't speak through it.

95
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Then, how do I communicate with you?

96
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,758
I will call you.

97
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
You will translate
to me on the phone.

98
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,758
And then, I will repeat it to the chef.

99
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,799
When the chef replies,
you'll listen through this device,

100
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,119
translate it back
to me through the phone.

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
And I will repeat it to the chef.

102
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,399
Do you understand?

103
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,240
This is just like “Mission Impossible.”

104
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,240
If we want to be bad,
we have to be smart.

105
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,638
All right, I need you
to chat with the chef

106
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,199
- as I check the framing and audio.
- Alright.

107
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,800
- Karma, can you hold the boom mic?
- Okay.

108
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,519
Sorry, I've got this.

109
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Quiet, please.

110
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,959
Sorry, I forgot to put
my phone on silent mode.

111
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Thank God we didn't get caught!

112
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Okay, ready.

113
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,758
Chef Haruto, thank you for allowing
us to film you and your restaurant.

114
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,759
This is such an honour.

115
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,399
Chef Haruto, thank you for allowing us
to film your restaurant.

116
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,120
You speak good Japanese.

117
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,599
Okay, let's go?
Karma, you're in the shot.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,759
Move back?

119
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
Further back.

120
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,479
Further back!

121
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,559
Out!

122
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,999
- All right, ready?
- Ready.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,360
And Bianca, anytime...

124
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,919
Hey, lift it up!

125
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,719
Okay, smile. Camera rolling,

126
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,639
and action!

127
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,480
So, Chef Haruto, how long have
you been a chef?

128
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,199
I couldn't really hear that.

129
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,638
How long has he been a chef?

130
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,199
Why are you asking in Malay?

131
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,639
Chef Haruto, how long have
you been doing this work?

132
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,360
Chef Haruto, how long have
you been doing this work?

133
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,398
It's been twenty years.

134
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,278
My father... how to...
all types of seafood.

135
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,639
And my mother was
the best at cooking them.

136
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,919
So that's how... interested in
cooking... my speciality.

137
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,558
I can't hear him clearly.

138
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,000
What I heard was,
"More than 20 years."

139
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,120
For about 20 years.

140
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I think he said more than that.

141
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,878
Ask the chef to repeat.

142
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,599
You want me to ask him in Malay?

143
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,359
Are you talking to yourself?

144
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,799
No, I'm not, sorry.

145
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,878
Do you have any more questions?

146
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,798
Are you alright?

147
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,558
What? "Daijubo desuka?"

148
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,558
That wasn't me.

149
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,398
Sorry.

150
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,359
Do you want to order anything, sir?

151
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,439
- Yes, tea please. Thank you.
- Yes, tea please. Thank you.

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,080
Tea? Of course.
Just one moment.

153
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
Waiter.

154
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,360
- Karma!
- Yes.

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,719
What did you say to him?

156
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
What's going on?

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,679
Can you give me 5 minutes?
I need to use the toilet.

158
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,239
I can't hold it in any longer. Sorry.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,479
Seriously?

160
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,038
- Hurry up!
- It's okay. Let's cut first.

161
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,320
Okay, thank you!

162
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,120
Thank you.

163
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,719
Hey, can you focus?

164
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,840
The waiter came.
I couldn't just ignore him.

165
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,678
So this is your plan?

166
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,879
This is your plan, not mine.

167
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,879
What is this?

168
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,080
Hey Sham, what a small world!

169
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,799
What the hell is this?

170
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,559
Tell me everything right now
if you don't want to get fired.

171
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,360
Okay, Bianca. Honestly, this
translation job is very difficult.

172
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,000
I didn't expect the Saga dialect to be
so different from normal Japanese.

173
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,199
The Saga dialect?

174
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,918
Like the Kelantanese dialect,

175
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,799
it's so different than
the Kuala Lumpur dialect.

176
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,679
Read this.

177
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,879
- Now?
- No, next week. Now, of course!

178
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,039
Why? Is the writing
also in 'Kelantanese-Japanese' dialect?

179
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,278
You liar!

180
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm calling my mum and you'll be
going back home tonight!

181
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,918
I'm sorry, Bianca, I'm sorry!

182
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,959
I really thought I could do this
and I really need this job!

183
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,678
Please don't call Aunty Kathy.
Please, Bianca?

184
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,398
Don't call Aunty Kathy.
I'll do anything.

185
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,999
Why would I want a liar
like you working for me?

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,439
How can I trust you anymore?

187
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,840
You can trust me!

188
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,519
See, I didn't even tell Aunty Kathy
about your secret travelogue!

189
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Are you threatening me?

190
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,200
No! I would never do that!

191
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,919
If I were to threaten you,
I would've told Aunty Kathy about...

192
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,399
What did you say?

193
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,399
Tell me what my mum asked you to do!

194
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
Fine. I won't call my mum.

195
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,119
But...

196
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,959
I'm not done yet.

197
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,918
I won't call my mum,

198
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,759
if you tell me exactly what
is going on with my mother.

199
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,399
My mum is calling.

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,279
- Hi, Mum.
- Hi, Bianca.

201
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,240
Is everything okay?

202
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,798
Hello?

203
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,398
Mum, where did you
find a PA like Karma?

204
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,840
Why? You're not happy with her?

205
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,639
No, Mum.
I've never seen someone so efficient.

206
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,799
That's good to hear.

207
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,359
Bianca can really act.

208
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,639
She's played the villainous stepmother
many times. What do you think?

209
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,878
Good. Is Karma with you?

210
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,799
I'd like to speak to her.

211
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,278
Hello, Aunty.

212
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,120
Karma, I heard you were
late to the airport yesterday.

213
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,000
And almost missed your flight!

214
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,599
Don't let it happen again. Understand?

215
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,879
Or I will cut your pay.

216
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes, Aunty.

217
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,639
And about the thing that I asked,
get it done and update me.

218
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,639
Now tell me, what did
my mum ask you to do?

219
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:14,879
Okay! Aunty Kathy
asked me to be her spy.

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,959
She wants to know if
you and Bob are a couple.

221
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,240
What? Bianca and I?

222
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,479
What did you say to her?

223
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,439
Nothing!
I haven't confirmed anything yet.

224
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
Because sometimes you and Bob
seem like a couple but...

225
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,279
Bob and I? Eww, no!

226
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,639
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

227
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,360
Sham, would you be our new translator?

228
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,480
Thanks. Let's go.

229
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,120
You!

230
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,360
Try to be useful if you don't want
be left by the roadside.

231
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,279
Let's go.

232
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,320
DREAMS DO COME TRUE @BIANCA.ROZARIO

233
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
DELETE POST?

234
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,720
Sham.

235
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,360
Thank you. You really saved the day.

236
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,038
Sorry, Bianca. Sorry.

237
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,200
It's a bit narrow. Sorry.

238
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,519
No, really. If you're available, why
not join us for the rest of the trip?

239
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,558
Bianca, you do know that I
work full-time with Master Akiro...

240
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,319
Sorry Bianca, sorry. Passing through.

241
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,640
I understand. You're really responsible.

242
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,839
Some people should really
learn responsibility from you.

243
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Hey.

244
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,319
I should be the only sad person here.

245
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,240
- Karma, do you think I'm “eww”?
- What?

246
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,839
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

247
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,599
Sham.

248
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,319
Master.

249
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't take this the wrong way but...

250
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,519
I think you should go.

251
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,359
Master, please.

252
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,559
I'm really sorry for what happened.

253
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,039
Let me know what
I can do to make it up to you.

254
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,359
I mean, I think you should go,

255
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,319
and be with the Malaysians
for a few days.

256
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,039
Take some days off from work.

257
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,079
But why, Master?

258
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,519
You've been away from home for too long.

259
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,160
And now, home comes to you.

260
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,240
Spend some time with your countrymen.

261
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,680
It will do you good.

262
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,039
I'm sorry, Master.

263
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,038
May I clean up the shop?

264
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,079
No, just leave it. Enough for today.

265
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,798
HELLO, WHY IS THERE NO REPLY TO MY MESSAGE?

266
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,838
ARE YOU SELLING OR NOT?

267
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,400
THIS SELLER SHOULD JUST SHUT DOWN HER ACCOUNT.

268
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,440
MUM - CALLING

269
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,399
Peace Be Upon You, Mum.

270
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,118
Peace Be Upon You, Karma.

271
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,279
How's Japan? Is everything okay?

272
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,319
Mum...

273
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
Why is it that everything I do

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,959
falls apart?

275
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,759
One after another,
I just keep failing.

276
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,038
I broke Master's pottery,

277
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,640
I had to use Fadhila's money and
now Bianca wants to fire me.

278
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,920
Is this my punishment for always lying?

279
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,200
I just want to work because
I don't want to burden you.

280
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,159
Hello, Karma?

281
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,920
Yes, Mum.

282
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,358
Everything is okay.

283
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,038
Bianca is really nice to me.

284
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm happy here.

285
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,518
Thank God. Please take care over there.

286
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,039
Take good care.

287
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,279
Don't miss your prayers.

288
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,519
Another thing, have you seen the
money packet from Fadhila's boss?

289
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,759
About the money...

290
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
The money packet is with me.

291
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,879
- Sorry.
- I see.

292
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
I accidentally took it while
rushing to the airport.

293
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,519
It's okay. As long as it's not lost.

294
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,960
It's a lot of money.

295
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,639
Fadhila said she wants to
use it for her honeymoon.

296
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
- Really?
- Yes.

297
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,879
She and Lan are really excited
to travel to Sabah.

298
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
But it will have to wait
until you return.

299
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,079
Okay, Mum.

300
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,038
Okay Mum, I'm going to have a shower.

301
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,758
I've been out the whole day.

302
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,680
- Peace Be Upon You.
- Peace Be Upon You.

303
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,279
Why is the shot slanted?

304
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,079
It's more cinematic that way.

305
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,160
I told you to keep it simple.

306
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:31,200
Why don't we discuss this
when we're back in Kuala Lumpur?

307
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,400
What's the rush?

308
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,078
The sooner we get this done, the sooner
we can sell it to TV stations,

309
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,640
and the sooner I get to start
my own production company.

310
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,639
Okay. I understand.

311
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,960
But we've been working
the whole day, right?

312
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:50,358
I don't even have time
to do my own stuff.

313
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,440
What stuff?

314
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,159
What stuff? My short film.
I have a deadline.

315
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,318
Bob, it's just a short film.

316
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,200
This is a paying job,
and I'm paying you.

317
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,240
You're right. Yes, this is my job.

318
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:14,000
And Bianca, I really don't mind
working for you 24/7,

319
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,759
but sometimes, I just need a break.

320
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,799
Why don't you pick
the shots that you want,

321
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,279
and I'll work on them later.

322
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,000
Where are you going?

323
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,839
To get some fresh air.

324
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,279
Fine.

325
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,519
What is he saying?

326
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,680
Bob.

327
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,639
What are you doing here?

328
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,039
Nothing much.

329
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,119
You didn't bring your camera?
You can take beautiful pictures here.

330
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm not in the mood.

331
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,559
It's a shame, right? To be in a
bad mood after coming so far.

332
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,400
I get it.

333
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,240
Welcome.

334
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,720
DAD - CALLING

335
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,558
Hello.

336
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,759
I understand what she wants.

337
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,959
I understand...

338
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,400
I understand that the production
company is important to her.

339
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,920
But my short film is important to me.

340
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,960
I want to be somebody, too.
I want people to finally see me.

341
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,240
You want people to see you,
or you want Bianca to see you?

342
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,200
You like her, right?

343
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,239
Who doesn't like Bianca?

344
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,200
Even when she's acting up,
being demanding or temperamental...

345
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
She's Bianca, right?

346
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,079
You must really like her.
Even her fart would smell like roses.

347
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,839
Actually, she's pretty cool.

348
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,880
It's just when she's angry at
her mother, she gets really stressed.

349
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,479
Then, she takes it out on other people.

350
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,640
You're right.
Her mother is pretty scary.

351
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,240
She really wants to know
what's going on between you and Bianca.

352
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
She just wants the best for Bianca.

353
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,279
Someone like me
is not good enough for her.

354
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,480
It's not that.
Maybe just not good enough yet?

355
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,079
It's not easy being Bianca.

356
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,720
Her mother's expectations are so high.

357
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,599
Whatever she does,
she has to tell her mother.

358
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,759
I can relate.

359
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,640
Not wanting to let your family down.

360
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,720
Do you get pressured by your family?

361
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,839
I always get scolded by my sisters.

362
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,920
Everything I do is wrong.

363
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,839
I just don't want my mum
to see me that way, too.

364
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,440
I don't want her to see me as a failure.

365
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,919
I don't know why I just fail
at everything.

366
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,359
Hey, Karma, relax.
At least you're still here, right?

367
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,759
I'm sure you'll know what to do.

368
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,519
You'll figure it out.

369
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,279
Where are you going?

370
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,758
Excuse me.

371
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,118
Can I order a cappuccino?

372
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,039
It's Room 505, thank you.

373
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,880
- Thanks, Sham.
- No worries.

374
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,838
You've been in Japan
for three years, right?

375
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,559
What made you come here
in the first place?

376
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,160
Initially, I just travelled here.

377
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,839
I had no plans to stay.

378
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:56,960
But when I met Master Akiro
at his workshop and learned pottery,

379
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,920
I became interested.

380
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,359
What interested you?

381
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,039
I'm an angry person.

382
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,319
Especially when I was in Malaysia.

383
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,720
But there's something about
pottery that calms me.

384
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,279
When I hold the clay…

385
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,279
Feels like you can start over.

386
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,440
To a time before you know
the bitter parts of life.

387
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,000
That's quite poetic.

388
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,680
So what made you so angry
when you were in Malaysia?

389
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,880
Give me a second.

390
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,880
Thank you.

391
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,079
Oh my God! I'm so sorry!

392
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,920
You can clean up in the toilet.
I'll get you something to wear.

393
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,240
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

394
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,838
- Let me help you with that?
- It's okay.

395
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,839
- Just an accident, right?
- No please, I insist.

396
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,439
Are you guys hungry?
The grilled seafood here is the best.

397
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,160
You are such a gentleman.

398
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,038
Karma, bring me my make-up bag.

399
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,838
Wait for just a moment,
I'll go and get it.

400
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,559
- Ready?
- The battery ran out.

401
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Are you serious?

402
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,359
Enough! Let's wrap up!
Let's just go home!

403
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,279
Where are you going?

404
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,680
- Bianca!
- Where's Bianca?
