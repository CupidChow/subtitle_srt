1
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,541
Move it, bitches.

2
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,333
SHOW TIMETABLE

3
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,708
Where is Richy?

4
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,875
Richy!

5
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,708
Richy, you stupid bitch.
Why aren't you on standby--

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,208
What the fuck are you looking at?

7
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,375
I'm here to collect the debt.

8
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,958
I'm skipping your show.
You deal with the boss later.

9
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,791
No, sis!

10
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,208
You guys too.
What the fuck are you staring at?

11
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,583
So what now?

12
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,041
Are you paying or not?

13
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,166
No.

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,250
I've given everything I have.

15
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,875
I have nothing left but my pussy.
You want that?

16
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,416
You fucker!

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,958
You got a big mouth, huh?

18
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,041
Hey!

19
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,583
I can't be even a little late, can I?

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,083
Why the fuck didn't you wait for me?

21
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,125
Sorry about him.

22
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,291
He's new.

23
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,958
So damn ballsy.

24
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:43,958
Richy,

25
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,583
one or two postponements are fine.

26
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,250
But it's been five now.

27
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,625
My boss won't let it slide.

28
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,125
I'm short on cash.

29
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,541
My cash flow is getting worse and worse.

30
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,083
Despite working my ass off,
I can't make enough to pay you.

31
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,083
You guys are scum.

32
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,041
You leech off us poor people.

33
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,291
I hope you all have miserable lives!

34
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,083
May your parents die young.
May your wives become whores.

35
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,291
May your kids become felons!
You fucking assholes!

36
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,333
You--

37
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,333
Debtors are all the same.

38
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,208
When you asked for my help,
did I make a fuss?

39
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,291
Did I care who you fucking were?

40
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,708
Did I ask about your daily earnings
or what you did?

41
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,708
Did I point a gun to your head
and force you to borrow my money?

42
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,583
Just kill me then.

43
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,500
I can't pay you anyway.

44
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,708
I'm tired.

45
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,041
I don't want to live anymore.

46
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,541
If I can't collect your debt today,

47
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,291
then let's die together.

48
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,333
QUICK LOAN

49
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,041
You sure you're getting money,
not just getting scammed?

50
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,250
CONGRATULATIONS!
LOAN APPROVED!

51
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,666
It's been transferred in.

52
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,916
I asked for a 3,000 baht loan
but it got docked to 1,600.

53
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,708
QR PAYMENT

54
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,750
Damn it.

55
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,041
When will my life be free of you assholes?

56
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,541
Come on now, Richy.

57
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,541
Once a debtor, always a debtor.

58
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,041
See you, bud.

59
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,791
Fucking douchebag. My life will be over
before I can pay off my debt.

60
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,458
Hey!

61
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,916
Stay still.

62
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:06,875
Are you drunk?

63
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,833
TRADITIONAL THAI COFFEE

64
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,333
WAN'S SEAFOOD
GOOD, FRESH, CLEAN

65
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,541
-I don't know, damn it.
-No, but…

66
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:47,000
OPEN EVERY DAY

67
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,333
I just slapped that punk's head,
that bastard.

68
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,875
Saw it. Next time, go there shirtless.

69
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,416
That asshole might pay up more easily…

70
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,375
Who's that, Mama?

71
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,750
New waitress?

72
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,833
Yeah.

73
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,208
Don't toy with her, you dipshit.

74
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,250
Workers aren't easy to find.

75
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,375
Once their hearts break,
they become hookers.

76
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,250
You're funny.

77
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,583
I never toy with anyone.

78
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,041
You guys, go easy
on the stuff in my fridge.

79
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,500
I still need some to sell.

80
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,791
7,640 baht.

81
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,791
All interest.

82
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,125
Serve the dish.

83
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,833
TONY'S BAR, NOW OPEN

84
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,333
Dad, have you eaten?

85
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,583
Thip, is there any food?

86
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,666
No.

87
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,208
Get food yourself tonight.

88
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,833
What is it all about now?

89
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:54,958
Ask your big brother.

90
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,708
A fucking big mouth he's got there.

91
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,500
You're lucky I didn't kick you.

92
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,708
She returned my car
to the auto financing company.

93
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,666
I've paid the installments for a year.
Now it's gone.

94
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,083
Oh, please. What you paid is gone

95
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,750
but do you even think of how you'd have
paid them from now on?

96
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,416
Look at your brother, Bo.

97
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,958
He barely makes
1,000 baht a day cutting hair

98
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,541
but wants a million-baht car.
Dumbass!

99
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,708
And do you even think of
helping me make money?

100
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,916
All you do is talk.

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,541
How much have you spent
on illegal lotteries, huh?

102
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,041
You're in debt
and can't even pay, you bitch.

103
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,083
Shut it.

104
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
Sometimes I win,
sometimes I lose, all right?

105
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,708
Every time I win, you keep giggling.

106
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,125
And how can you say I don't help?

107
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,458
Who cleans the house?

108
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,791
Who washes your clothes?

109
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,541
Who cooks for you? Who?

110
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,750
Other men's wives live worse than you
yet never complain, bitch.

111
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,541
Other women's husbands
are all better than you, jerk.

112
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,375
Fuck! Just shut up!

113
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,083
Stop fighting.

114
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,083
What the fuck are you looking at?

115
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,583
-I'm not done yet.
-Screw it.

116
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,166
You scared my customer.
What the hell is wrong with you, Bo?

117
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,541
You prick. Why did you have to fight then?

118
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,875
Tomorrow, go get your car back.

119
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,083
Here's your installment money.

120
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,375
You too, Thip.

121
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,500
How much do you owe?

122
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,791
8,000.

123
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,708
WAN'S SEAFOOD

124
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,041
The poor man's nest

125
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:43,541
Who'd wish to share it with me as a guest?

126
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,375
With a dirty net

127
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,750
A worn-out mat

128
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,541
No maiden's eye would ever look at me

129
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,541
That's why I sleep all alone in misery…

130
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,916
Wow, Uncle.

131
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,541
The stall isn't yet set up.

132
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,083
The seller himself is already drunk.

133
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,958
My medication.

134
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,625
You should pay today, Uncle.

135
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,375
My boss is getting irritated.

136
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,666
Let me make some sales first.

137
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,583
You told me to wait a bit.

138
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,291
You haven't sold shit.

139
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,583
Why don't you sell somewhere else
more crowded?

140
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,083
When you're a merchant, you'll get it.

141
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,916
You'll know what it's like to sell well

142
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,916
yet have to pay hefty tenant fees
until you have nothing left.

143
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,416
And do I want to play hide-and-seek
with the municipal police?

144
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,958
No freaking way.

145
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,125
I can't.

146
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,666
I'm too old.

147
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,750
Oops.

148
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,875
I keep eating it.

149
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,291
It's almost out.

150
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,833
You should spare some for your dad.

151
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,708
No. You eat.

152
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,291
He won't eat it.

153
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,875
Dad is never satisfied
no matter what I do.

154
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,583
Do you see my brother Aek?

155
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,541
He has a wife and a kid now

156
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,541
but he is still Dad's burden.

157
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,458
He borrows Dad's money and never repays.

158
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,416
He even pawned
Dad's gold necklace the other day.

159
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,125
All I do is give Dad money
but he never takes it.

160
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,833
That's right.

161
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,375
I'm dumb.

162
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,458
I didn't finish high school.

163
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,458
So what?

164
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,541
Higher education doesn't guarantee that
you can take care of your parents.

165
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,666
See this?

166
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,166
Your daughter also finished
her bachelor's degree.

167
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,458
Why does she let you
sell food on the street?

168
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,875
It doesn't prove anything.

169
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,041
What now, Uncle?

170
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,083
Are you paying?

171
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,583
Can I have one more day?

172
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,583
I should sell some tomorrow.

173
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,916
You're damn optimistic.

174
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,875
Hey.

175
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,708
We must live with hope.

176
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:09,583
Those without it are those who are dead.

177
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,291
I should get going.

178
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,875
Drinking with an old man is no fun at all.

179
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:24,916
What are you doing?

180
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,583
I'm buying them all.

181
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,791
My drinking snacks.

182
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,000
Here.

183
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,041
Bye.

184
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,083
See you, Uncle.

185
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,750
Hey.

186
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:43,833
Hey!

187
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:49,208
Why not take this as the interest?

188
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,583
I know you're not so sure

189
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,583
But not all paths lead to obscurity

190
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,083
It might not be pretty where we are

191
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,083
But I'm striving to make it stellar

192
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:34,833
No magic in hand to make it better

193
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:42,083
But with you here, it's all that matters

194
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:04,375
No magic in hand to make it better

195
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:12,625
But with you here, it's all that matters

196
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,583
I'll make our love a legend

197
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,541
A dream fulfilled, never to end

198
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:25,208
In life with nothing, we'll thrive

199
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:29,083
Together we'll build, keep hope alive

200
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,541
As long as it's us, nothing can crush us

201
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,708
Family is the smallest unit in society,

202
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,250
yet it is the most significant
when it comes to shaping individuals.

203
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,625
Therefore, it's not surprising

204
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:25,000
that family serves as
a fundamental foundation in many aspects.

205
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:32,041
Besides family being an
important background…

206
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,875
Hey, Uncle.

207
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,125
Aren't you opening your stall today?

208
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,791
You need to make money for the interest.

209
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,166
Uncle!

210
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,166
Uncle!

211
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,708
Uncle!

212
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,375
Did you really have to go this far?

213
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey.

214
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,208
If you don't have money, we can negotiate.

215
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,083
We're friends, you know?
I brought you whisky.

216
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,250
Who are you?

217
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,250
Uncle Aod's wife?

218
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,916
The patient's relative,
please sign to continue the treatment.

219
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,083
I'm his daughter.

220
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,083
Then who are you?

221
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,416
His creditor.

222
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:44,958
Gosh.

223
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,166
What? He collapsed?

224
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,291
Yeah.

225
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,875
Doc said something
about his lungs getting an infection.

226
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,291
Oh, that poor old man. How unfortunate.

227
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,791
I just met him
at the market the other day.

228
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,791
He's not dead.

229
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,958
You made it sound like he was dead.

230
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,666
Have you talked to his daughter?

231
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,833
About what?

232
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:21,750
Talked about what?

233
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,041
You know all too well what, dumbass.

234
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,208
-Idiot.
-Damn it.

235
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,375
MEN'S WARD

236
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:49,416
Saengarun Han-Uthit.

237
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,583
SAENGARUN HAN-UTHIT

238
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,958
WORAKIT

239
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,250
-I'll handle this client and his loan.
-Yes, sir.

240
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,208
Hey, Mama.

241
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,041
Right now?

242
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,833
Come on, Mama.

243
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,083
I'm collecting the debt from Uncle Aod.

244
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,541
Bring the other guys.

245
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, for God's sake, Mama.

246
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,041
You can't live without Bo, can you?

247
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,750
Shit.

248
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,958
Let's go to Mama.

249
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,625
She's lending a huge sum to a big client.

250
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,541
We gotta be there
and make her look intimidating.

251
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:45,125
Why the fuck are you still there?
Follow me.

252
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,041
Damn it.

253
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,375
EMERGENCY

254
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,500
Hey, there.

255
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,875
Not using the same exit today?

256
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,458
That's good.

257
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,083
They have doors for going in and out.

258
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,166
Windows aren't for that.

259
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:20,041
Police officer? I have a stalker.

260
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,333
He's been stalking me since this morning…

261
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,500
Hello, officer. Yes.

262
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,166
I'm trying to make up with my wife.

263
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,791
Yes, sir.

264
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,958
We're getting back together for sure.
Thank you.

265
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,916
Come on, now.

266
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,083
We are friendly faces. Why don't you…

267
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,250
MOTORBIKE TAXI

268
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,125
Thank you.

269
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:33,208
UNKNOWN NUMBER

270
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,666
It's a waste of money
taking a motorbike taxi.

271
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:39,875
You could have just ridden with me.

272
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:41,958
Where are you?

273
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,625
I'm close by.

274
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,333
Can I move into your heart though?

275
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,125
Do you know now that
you can't run away from me?

276
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,583
It's my dad's debt.

277
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:00,791
Get it from him.

278
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,083
I don't know when Uncle Aod will wake up.

279
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,541
The loan amount is 45,000.

280
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,333
If you want to close it out,
it'll be 60,000.

281
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:11,375
If you don't have that,
pay 250 daily in interest.

282
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,083
Oh, hey.

283
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,833
Uncle Aod hasn't paid the interest
for five days now.

284
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:15,958
Do you have 1,000?

285
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,250
Come down here and pay.

286
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,500
Do you have the contract?

287
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,541
If not, I won't pay.

288
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,375
Here you go. Thank you.

289
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:05,833
Number A05, please proceed to counter 7.

290
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:07,416
How may I help you?

291
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,083
I'm here to collect some debts.

292
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,166
These are the loan details.

293
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,291
You can have a look
before making the decision.

294
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,541
Goodbye.

295
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:24,666
Number A06, please proceed to counter 7.

296
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't want details.

297
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,458
I want money.

298
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,916
Then you must file a loan request.

299
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,541
We're done here.

300
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:49,541
Number A07, please proceed to counter 7.

301
00:30:56,333 --> 00:31:02,750
Number A08, please proceed to counter 7.

302
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:08,125
Number A09, please proceed to counter 7.

303
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,333
Number A10…

304
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:14,416
Number A11, please proceed to counter 7.

305
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,375
Number A12…

306
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm here to collect the debt.

307
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:23,958
Are you paying or not?

308
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,291
We don't have that service here.

309
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,583
Please leave.

310
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:36,375
Number A13, please proceed to counter 7.

311
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:41,708
Number A15…

312
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:46,416
Number…

313
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,750
Number A18…

314
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,291
Number A20…

315
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,375
Hey!

316
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,416
Are you bothering her?

317
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,375
Get out.

318
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,625
I'll visit again.

319
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,625
Thank you, Officer.

320
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,791
Thank you so much.

321
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,541
We need to talk.

322
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:18,500
Hey.

323
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,541
Don't you want to eat?

324
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:25,416
You can order. On me.

325
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,208
Come on.

326
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,625
Orange juice? How about…

327
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,125
Pink milk?

328
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,125
Beer.

329
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,625
Beer?

330
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,000
Hey, bring me one draft beer.

331
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,125
IM'S SALARY 19,120
REMAINING BALANCE 1,470

332
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,125
What are these?

333
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,166
You're a creditor.

334
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:52,125
Don't you care about how much
your debtors are struggling

335
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,291
and how little control they have
over their expenses?

336
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,208
I'm not actually a creditor.

337
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,041
Just a debt collector.

338
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,541
I'm not paying the daily interest.

339
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,875
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

340
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,000
My salary won't cover it.

341
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,833
You finished your bachelor's degree
and have a good job.

342
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,375
Why do you get paid so little?

343
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,541
Street vendors by the beach make
more money. You know that?

344
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,541
I'm taking out 25,000
from my savings to pay first.

345
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,750
As for the rest, I'll pay 2,000
as a monthly installment.

346
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,291
When I get my bonus at the end
of the year, I'll pay off the loan.

347
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,250
No way.

348
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:31,958
If you want to clear the debt,

349
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,958
pay in full.

350
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,750
If you don't,

351
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,208
you'll pay 250 baht daily in interest.

352
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,416
I just told you I wouldn't do that.

353
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,875
Mama.

354
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,416
Just go along with it.

355
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Uncle Aod has been paying the interest
for almost a year.

356
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,750
If I agreed, the other debtors
would ask for the same thing.

357
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:15,083
If every debtor did that, I'd be screwed.

358
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,000
So what do we do?

359
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,583
She doesn't have the money.

360
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:23,541
Bo.

361
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,916
Do your damn job.

362
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,541
No.

363
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,750
If you want to pay it off, pay in full.

364
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,541
You have 25,000 in savings.

365
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,833
Pay the interest first.

366
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,083
It took me two years of saving
to get that money together.

367
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,416
I can't just waste it for nothing.

368
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,083
What do you want then?

369
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:55,750
Do you know what you'll get
if you don't pay today?

370
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,916
If I can't collect money from you,

371
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,000
my boss will kill me anyway.

372
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,500
Let's just die together then.

373
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:46,666
Hey!

374
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,041
If you don't agree with my terms,

375
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,125
I won't pay.

376
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,375
Do whatever you want.

377
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,416
And don't come to the bank again.

378
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:21,791
I need to work.

Hi.

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,125
Aren't you working?

384
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,708
I'm suspended.

385
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:42,000
So you're doing a side gig?

386
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,291
Tell you what.

387
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,833
It isn't a golden spot here.

388
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,291
I'm not a hooker.

389
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51,000
What?

390
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,833
How about you sell your kidney then?

391
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,833
I know a doctor.

392
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:57,541
He is very quick. It doesn't hurt a bit.

393
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,375
I've taken a few people to him.

394
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,958
-Once you're done…
-Fine. Let's do it.

395
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,583
Call him.

396
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,208
I'm willing to trade my kidney
for not seeing you again.

397
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,750
You better save your kidney

398
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,875
and see me every day instead.

399
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:37,083
DATING CONTRACT

400
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,166
Easy.

401
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,666
Go on dates with me.

402
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:44,458
For a normal date, I'll color it yellow

403
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,625
and pay the interest for you that day.

404
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,708
Blue for the dates
I get to hold your hand,

405
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:52,125
and I'll cover your
three days' worth of interest.

406
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,708
For the dates that we kiss,

407
00:40:56,666 --> 00:41:00,083
I'll color it pink
and handle five days of interest for you.

408
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,166
But if

409
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,541
we screw…

410
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:07,916
Hey!

411
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,625
Hey.

-Can I get one more charcoal grill?
-Sure.

417
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,791
Why do we need another one?

418
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,250
It's going to cost more.

419
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,291
So? You can't pay?

420
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,333
Im! I got it.

421
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,041
You want it? Here.

422
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,166

What the hell?

428
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,458
You get paid more than the others

429
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,333
and you dare ask for more?

430
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,791
Of course, Mama.

431
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,916
He's trying hard to impress
Uncle Aod's daughter.

432
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,416
He takes her out for meals
and even pays the interest for her.

433
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
Shut up, Pad.

434
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,833
Geez, Bo.

435
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,958
If you want to blow off steam,
visit a brothel.

436
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,708
Why are you getting involved
with Aod's daughter?

437
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,083
That's my business.

438
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:04,500
I'm worried about you.

439
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,583
You know she's a banker, right?

440
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,250
She won't take a thug as her husband.

441
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,541
She's playing you for sure.

442
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:15,750
Damn it, Mama. Stop nagging.
Will you give me more money or not?

443
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:18,000
I've been working for you for ten years.

444
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,916
Can't you just give me a little more?

445
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,208
If you want more money,

446
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,875
collect more debts.

447
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,375
I'll give you your cut.

448
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,750
You can't work the same amount
and ask for more money.

449
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,291
No way in hell I'll give you that.

450
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,916
Are you sure, Bo?

451
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,583
This place is way out of my league.

452
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,291
Out of your league?

453
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:52,958
Tell you what.

454
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:57,875
If you want to find a big spender,
you come to this kind of place.

455
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,375
Got it?

456
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:04,375
You're doing well as a pimp.

457
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,833
Pimp my ass.

458
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,916
For the drinks.

459
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,625
Don't drink too much. Small sips only.

460
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:15,541
Find someone quick. I'll wait outside.

461
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:27,750
Gosh!

462
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,708
This is something new you want me to do?

463
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:33,791
If you can do your own makeup,
you can do it for the elephants too.

464
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,416
Don't you want money?

465
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:38,291
Go on.

466
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:42,500
Hey.

467
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,291
Ouch!

468
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,458
Come on.

469
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,375
Get closer.

470
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:07,791
Fight him.

471
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,125
Watch out!

472
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:16,750
No more.

473
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:23,833
WHERE SHOULD WE GO TOMORROW?

474
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:27,833
OR TONIGHT?

475
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,541
Im, I'm going home now.

476
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,208
Leaving now.

477
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,083
Goodbye, Max.

478
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,666
Why do you feel like drinking tonight?

479
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,083
Am I not allowed to drink?

480
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:38,958
I guess I'm bored.

481
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:41,125
I wanted to go somewhere
I'd never been to.

482
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,583
You just got your heart broken for sure.

483
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,333
So what if I'm heartbroken?

484
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,083
Well…

485
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:05,500
Nothing.

486
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,250
It's good.

487
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,833
I like that.

488
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,250
Don't you want to go somewhere nicer?

489
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:35,958
No.

490
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,208
Let's stay.

491
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:41,583
I like this decadent vibe.

492
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
"NA NA THONG"

493
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:01,000
People are looking at us

494
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:08,166
With envy because I get to own your heart

495
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,083
Yet I'm not sure if our love will last

496
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:15,791
Because you mean everything to me

497
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:22,750
The only thing
I will never let anyone take away

498
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:29,541
I want to make you solely mine

499
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:59,125
NEW WAY TO COLLECT DEBT!
HELPING DEBTORS MAKE MORE MONEY.

500
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,708
May your love for me last forever

501
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,875
And no one else ever make you waver

502
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:39,875
May my love blind your eyes

503
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:46,041
So you can have only me in your mind

504
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:52,416
May you never fall for anyone
Other than me

505
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,416
Hold on.

506
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,333
All right. I know.

507
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,500
Uncle,

508
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:20,333
you're my debtor,
so can I be your son-in-law in return?

509
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:21,916
Yeah?

510
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Good idea, huh?

511
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:24,291
A win-win deal.

512
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:27,875
LET'S GO ON A DATE TMR. YOU HAVE TIME?

513
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,666
OKAY. I HAVE TIME TMR.

514
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,166
One more charcoal grill.

515
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,875
No. One is enough.

516
00:51:56,916 --> 00:52:04,166
So I cast a spell on your heart
To ignore anyone who makes a pass

517
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:16,000
May our love remain unbreakable

518
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,250
What?

519
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,208
ANYA HOTEL

520
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,166
Ouch!

521
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,875
What?

522
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,958
DATING CONTRACT

523
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:03,875
Have you been in there?

524
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,791
I have.

525
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:14,833
To collect debts from the security guard.

526
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,291
And I got kicked out.

527
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:21,625
Is it nice inside?

528
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:29,875
I don't know.

529
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,750
I guess it's like any other hotel.

530
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,083
Nothing different.

531
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,083
Of course it's different.

532
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:42,791
I don't know if I will ever be able to
afford to step inside in this lifetime.

533
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,291
Do you really want to go?

534
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:08,708
Thanks, bro.

535
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,291
Hi there.

536
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:36,250
We were smooth.

537
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:48,708
Hold on.

538
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,250
Where did you get that from?

539
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,625
Just drink.

540
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,083
We're here after all.

541
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,166
To a romantic night.

542
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:46,708
Pretty, isn't it?

543
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,166
Yeah,

544
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,083
pretty.

545
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:03,375
It's weird.

546
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:07,750
We spend every day there.

547
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:12,500
But from up here,

548
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,041
it transforms into something beautiful.

549
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,291
As if…

550
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,083
we walk up a few steps,

551
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,958
look down from here

552
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,291
and see a whole different world.

553
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:47,958
It would be nice if we got to spend
just one night here.

554
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,083
It's good enough where we are.

555
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,916
It's easier to come up here
than I thought.

556
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,541
I think it's time to leave.

557
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,458
Let's go.

558
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:15,833
Come on.

559
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:26,083
May your love for me last forever

560
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:33,416
And no one else ever make you waver

561
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,291
Get in.

562
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:37,875
May my love blind your eyes

563
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:44,083
So you can have only me in your mind

564
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:48,958
May you never fall for anyone
Other than me

565
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:52,166
So I cast a spell on your heart

566
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,875
Enchant you with
The holy gold leaf on my façade

567
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:59,375
So I cast a spell on your heart

568
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:03,833
To ignore anyone who makes a pass

569
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:07,291
May my love blind your eyes

570
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:13,541
So you can have only me in your mind

571
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:23,250
May you never fall for anyone
Other than me

572
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:41,166
REAL NEWS TALK

573
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,333
Our following news takes place in Pattaya.

574
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,750
A dispute between two loan shark gangs

575
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,208
led to a physical altercation
on the beach in broad daylight.

576
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:53,416
Let's look at the video
captured by an eyewitness.

577
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,041
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

578
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,916
PATTAYA ISN'T SAFE ANYMORE.

579
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,625
As you can see, the confrontation
involved more than ten males.

580
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:05,833
They punched, kicked,
and tumbled over the ground.

581
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:08,208
This is between
two loan shark gangsters.

582
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:10,541
However, they are from
two distinct creditors.

583
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:13,750
Our source stated that they came
into conflict over their clients.

584
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:19,916
We don't know which side initiated
the brawl or what really caused it.

585
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,125
However, we can clearly see that
this is sheer brutality.

586
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:26,791
As you can see, a man is severely
beating up another man.

587
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:30,833
We hope the police will subjugate…

588
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,750
PAYMENT FOR TODAY'S INTEREST

589
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,291
Sorry, the number that you've dialed
cannot be connected…

590
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,458
Im.

591
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:23,708
Im.

592
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,500
Im.

593
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,291
Im.

594
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,708
Im.

595
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,500
I know you're in there.

596
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:41,416
Im.

597
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,375
Im.

598
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,333
What's the matter with your daughter?

599
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,333
She hasn't talked to me
for quite some time now.

600
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,916
She doesn't take my calls.

601
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,083
I don't see her at work.

602
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,166
What is this?

603
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,583
What did I do wrong?

604
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:14,291
Why?

605
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,583
God damn it.

606
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,833
She can't just disappear.
I'm freaking confused.

607
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:28,083
FOR THE INTEREST

608
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,458
Hey, bro.

609
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:33,750
You were brutal the other day.

610
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,750
I thought your head was
the only thing you hit.

611
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,666
Are you mocking me?

612
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,166
Oh, please.

613
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,208
I'm not mocking you.

614
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,125
Seriously, though.

615
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,416
Hear me out. Don't be mad.

616
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:55,666
That banker girl,

617
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:58,791
why did you let her fool you for so long?

618
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:05,500
Motherfucker!

619
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,958
-Hey, stop!
-Don't.

620
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,041
Come on.

621
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,458
What the fuck is wrong with you?

622
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,125
Fine. I'm sorry.

623
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:14,333
I'm sorry.

624
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:15,291
Let go.

625
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,208
This table?

626
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:23,041
Come on. Take a seat.

627
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:27,208
-Let's drink till dawn.
-Yeah, let's do it.

628
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,208
Waitress.

629
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,208
How much is the table service?

630
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:32,541
It's 500, sir.

631
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:33,916
And how much for your time?

632
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,333
It's 500, yeah?

633
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:40,000
We want to order food too.

634
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,375
The kitchen is closed.

635
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,875
What?

636
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:43,833
Why closed?

637
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,416
It's not even that late.

638
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,416
The bar is still running.

639
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,583
Has the cook gone to sleep?

640
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,625
Get her back to work.

641
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:52,916
Hold on.

642
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:56,416
Don't forget to bring
Spicy Chicken Feet Soup.

643
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,375
That's right.

644
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:02,083
I said the kitchen is closed.

645
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:04,250
We want chicken feet.

646
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,500
Chicken feet.

647
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,750
Chicken feet.

648
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:07,958
Chicken feet.

649
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,041
Chicken feet.

650
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,458
Chicken feet.

651
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:11,416
Chicken feet.

652
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,916
Chicken feet.

653
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,958
Chicken feet.

654
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,000
Chicken feet.

655
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,125
How about my feet instead?

656
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,375
Damn it.

657
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,916
Im. Im, open up.

658
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,708
You think you're so pretty?

659
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,416
Yes, you are.

660
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:00,458
But you're a bitch.

661
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:03,625
You tricked me into
paying your debt and ditched me.

662
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,416
I have a heart too, you know?

663
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:10,041
You are damn cold-hearted.

664
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:21,875
Teary eyes.

665
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,916
Are you sad about what I said?

666
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,375
The one that should be sad…

667
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:29,541
My dad is dead.

668
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,000
The hospital just called.

669
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,041
Im.

01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:18,000
"THE POOR MAN'S NEST"

671
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:28,375
Im.

672
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,458
Uncle Aod had been paying
for the Cremation Association.

673
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,166
It can be reimbursed.

674
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,750
You can settle the debt with it.

675
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:57,500
The poor man's nest

676
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:03,083
Who'd wish to share it with me as a guest?

677
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,250
With a dirty net

678
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:08,166
A worn-out mat

679
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:13,458
No maiden's eye would ever look at me

680
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:18,541
That's why I sleep all alone in misery

681
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,208
I was so mad at him.

682
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:27,750
I was mad that his life was
swallowed up by debt.

683
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,291
He requested a loan to open a shop,

684
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,708
got rejected by financial institutions,

685
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,500
and then turned to a loan shark.

686
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,708
The business failed.

687
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,583
He lost both the shop and the house.

688
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,875
He couldn't even afford
his daughter's education.

PAYMENT HISTORY

691
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,791
It's good

692
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:30,041
he could pay off the debt with his death.

693
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:19,791
Anything else I can help you with?

694
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:25,916
No.

695
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:29,833
Well, then…

696
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:32,875
I'm gonna go

697
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:35,750
so you can get some rest.

698
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,958
Does it smell?

699
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,375
I can go downstairs.

700
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,833
No need.

701
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:02,625
You know,

702
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:06,875
there's one thing more harmful to life
than alcohol and cigarettes.

703
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,750
Stress.

704
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:21,916
My life is so damn stressful.

705
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,458
Is it work?

706
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,083
Everything.

707
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,041
Work too.

708
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:42,625
Or maybe

709
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:49,791
lives like ours
are destined to be like this.

710
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,875
We either die because of
alcohol and cigarettes

711
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,541
or we die because of stress.

712
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:59,250
Then quit being stressed.

713
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,500
Whatever problem you have from now on,

714
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,208
I'll help.

715
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:07,958
What about you?

716
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,333
Are you quitting?

717
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:15,708
You mean…

718
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,208
Quitting what?

719
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,958
Everything.

720
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:30,750
Your job, your pals, your bad habits,

721
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,416
your old ways.

722
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,250
Sure.

723
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:56,625
I'll quit everything.

724
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:02,625
Sound good?

725
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:10,583
There's a 200,000 baht financial limit
on your syndicated loan.

726
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:15,791
Withdrawal is available from
Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

727
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,333
Any one of you can withdraw.

728
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:29,750

This area is always full of people.

731
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:41,708
You can reach your break-even point
in a few months.

732
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:45,166
What are you selling, by the way?

733
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:48,708
Fried food

734
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,583
but with a brand.

735
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,875
That's good.

736
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,083
No one sells fried food around here.

737
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:05,750
Do you like it?

738
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:11,375
Ma'am,

739
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,500
can you please give us a discount?

740
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:16,041
It's already cheap.

741
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,958
Lots of people want it.

742
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,916
I want it too.

743
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:25,750
If you want it, take it.

744
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:26,875
Don't think too much.

745
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,416
Are you really not taking it?

746
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:48,375
What if someone grabs it
and we can't find a better place?

747
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,583
What can I do? It's over budget.

748
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,666
We can apply for more loans.

749
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,375
Nope. I don't want to bite off
more than I can chew.

750
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:08,416
The loan we got, we're not gonna spend it?

751
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:14,041
We can just leave it there.

752
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,083
There's no interest
if we don't take it out.

753
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:30,000
I am still pissed that you quit.

754
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,416
And now you've got the nerve
to ask for money?

755
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
What the hell will you do with it?

756
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,625
Open a fried food shop with my girlfriend.

757
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,791
Oh, please.

758
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,083
You, Bo?

759
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:45,958
You're too dumb to run a business.

760
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,333
Collect debts for me.

761
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:58,166
I told you, I'm done with that life.

762
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,458
Bo.

763
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:02,416
Can't you help me just this once?

764
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,041
This guy is something else.

765
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:08,958
Only you can do it.

766
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,083
Prasit.

767
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,416
How much you wanna bet?

768
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:21,458
He runs a high-low table at a casino,

769
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:23,541
scamming people for tons of money.

770
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:25,958
So,

771
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,458
what do you say?

772
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,625
He owes me 400,000.

773
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:52,708
If you can collect it,

774
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:54,625
I'll give you 200,000.

775
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,708
We will come back later.

776
01:15:58,791 --> 01:15:59,958
Yes, ma'am.

777
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,041
Are you going to back out just like that?

778
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,416
I don't want to be like my dad.

779
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,541
IM

780
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,500
If we are to walk together,

781
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,958
we should walk on the right path.

782
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,125
Right?

783
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:24,291
INCOMING CALL FROM IM

784
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:27,166
8 MISSED CALLS FROM IM

785
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,166
IM: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER MY CALLS?

786
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:46,750
BO: I'M FINDING A WAY TO GET THAT BUILDING

787
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:47,750
IM: WHAT WILL YOU DO?

788
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,666
Look at this. Awesome, huh?

789
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,708
-I got it yesterday.
-Holy shit. That's dope.

790
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:08,875
Get me some.

791
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,875
What the heck are you doing here?

792
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:22,000
Mama told us to come.

793
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:25,000
She thought we'd be
the most helpful to you.

794
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,375
Damn it.

795
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:33,916
Listen to me.

796
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,083
Don't make a scene.

797
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,041
Got it?

798
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,708
NO GAMBLING ALLOWED

799
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:48,875
Stop.

800
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:53,750
Arms.

801
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,625
NO GAMBLING ALLOWED

802
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,166
Hey.

803
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,916
Great.

804
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:23,166
Open!

805
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,458
Just open it, man.

806
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,250
What? You won again?

807
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:30,458
Did you cheat?

808
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:32,875
It's 11, high-low.

809
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,208
Damn it.

810
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:36,750
Oh, come on.

811
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,208
Wow, you win a lot.

812
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:42,708
You shouldn't be the type that welshes.

813
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,875
What? Who the fuck are you?

814
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:50,875
Ah. Mama Wan's boy.

815
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:52,666
What?

816
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,791
Did she ask you to collect the money?

817
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,166
Oh, gosh.

818
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:59,875
Throw these scum out.

819
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:00,833
Wait.

820
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:02,458
I'm just kidding.

821
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,375
I'm here to play.

822
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,041
Wow.

823
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,458
So?

824
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,166
You don't want me to? Fine.
I'll go to another table.

825
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:18,500
Please.

826
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:31,166
Good luck, young man.

827
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,458
HIGH

828
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,916
Make a bet.

829
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,041
Come on.

830
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,125
High.

831
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,625
Two, three, four. Low.

832
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,083
Oh, come on.

833
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,208
Oh, come on.

834
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,208
It's not my day today.

835
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,625
All of it?

836
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:10,375
Yes, ma'am.

837
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,416
He withdrew all of it.

838
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,833
Come on, come on.

839
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,000
LOW

840
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,625
I'm winning this one.

841
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:26,708
Please be low.

842
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,333
Six, five, one. High.

843
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,458
-I lose every damn time.
-It's always 11.

844
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,041
HIGH

845
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,000
Low. Let's go for low.

846
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,875
High? Should I go for high?

847
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:43,208
Come on.

848
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,583
Make your bet.

849
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,416
Six, four, one. That's 11, high-low.

850
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,541
Oh, for God's sake.

851
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,333
You want food?

852
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,250
Food?

853
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:10,416
Do you want some food?

854
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,333
Food?

855
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:14,375
-Girl, I want one.
-Food?

856
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,833
Anyone want food?

857
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,833
Time to bet.

858
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:27,250
HIGH

859
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:32,291
I think it's low.

860
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:35,208
Go all in.

861
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,416
Go all in.

862
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:41,041
-Yes, that's it.
-Come on.

863
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,833
-I'm winning this.
-I'm getting rich.

864
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:46,291
I'm getting lucky.

865
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,958
-I'm winning.
-Let's see.

866
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:00,166
Low.

867
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:02,416
Want some food?

868
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:06,708
Do you want some food?

869
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,458
-No.
-I do.

870
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:19,416
Hold on.

871
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:22,916
Can I open it?

872
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:26,333
Of course, sir.

873
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,500
What the hell?

874
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,750
-What's happening?
-Sorry.

875
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,250
I'm okay.

876
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:58,750
I choked on the rice.

877
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:02,416
-Sorry.
-Oh, for goodness's sake.

878
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,333
I'm losing money.

879
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:05,666
Sorry.

880
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:06,791
What the hell?

881
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:08,583
What the hell?

882
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:24,541
I guess someone is losing his money.

883
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,791
Two, two, one. Low.

884
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:37,500
Bet.

885
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,625
11 HIGH-LOW

886
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:45,375
Whoa! Seriously?

887
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:51,208
I guess somebody wants to go to sleep.

888
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:53,708
Follow him.

889
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:55,750
Let's do it.

890
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,625
There's five for sure.

891
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:01,958
Here.

892
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,875
Six, four, one. 11, high-low.

893
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,166
Damn! How is it possible?

894
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,125
So lucky.

895
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:12,125
Awesome!

896
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,458
You're damn lucky.

897
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:15,708
Really?

898
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:17,250
High-low!

899
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:21,916
Is it really 11 high-low?

900
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,583
Let's get lucky again!

901
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:35,541
Wow!

902
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:36,625
Sir.

903
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,500
Follow him.

904
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,833
Four, four, three. 11, high-low.

905
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:54,375
Yeah!

906
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:56,416
11, high-low, people!

907
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,833
Gosh, he wins again!

908
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:01,000
He's damn lucky.

909
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:03,458
How did you do that?

910
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,166
Hey.

911
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:07,208
Are you cheating?

912
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,375
Cheating?

913
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,916
You're the one with the dice.

914
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,791
The dealer's killing the vibe
for me. I'm out.

915
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,291
Whoa.

916
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,291
We're paying by check.

917
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:25,583
Come on, Auntie.

918
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:27,916
Cash is preferred.

919
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,666
Wait half an hour.

920
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:40,541
Did you help him cheat?

921
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:43,583
I didn't. I did as you told me.

922
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,583
Then why did the dice turn out like that?

923
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,250
He swapped the dice.

924
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,291
Do you want some food?

925
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,125
-No.
-I do.

926
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,333
What the hell?

927
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:09,666
11 HIGH-LOW

928
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,333
Four, four, three. 11, high-low.

929
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,833
Fuck!

930
01:26:27,791 --> 01:26:30,083
He looked so fucking confused.

931
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:51,333
You cheated.

932
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:53,541
So?

933
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,458
You cheated too.

934
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:58,458
You can scam people all you want.

935
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:00,791
But if you're in debt, you must pay.

936
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:06,375
You should think twice
before messing with me.

937
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,666
Do you know who's backing me up?

938
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:11,666
Guys.

939
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,291
Give it back.

940
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,333
Dickhead!

941
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,208
Motherfucker!

942
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,583
Where's your friend, huh?

943
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:28,958
Get him here.

944
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:30,500
Where is he? You motherfucker.

945
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:31,791
Son of a bitch!

946
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,291
The money's in my bike.

947
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:39,666
Take my bike.

948
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:42,791
Damn it.

949
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:44,458
Fucking go!

950
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,166
Hey.

951
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:51,416
Hey.

952
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:58,000
Motherfucker.

953
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:30,166
Boss.

954
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,000
Boss, wake up.

955
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,208
Boss.

956
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,541
Why didn't you help me, Mama?

957
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,666
Prasit's brother is a cop.

958
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:58,958
How could I help?

959
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:01,250
You're lucky he's not dead.

960
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,666
Bo,

961
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,083
listen to me.

962
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:10,583
Don't mention me or the casino

963
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,458
so the case will close fast.

964
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:15,083
You'll be in prison for just a few years.

965
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,916
Where is my money?

966
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,208
Your money?

967
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,625
You didn't collect all of my money, Bo.

968
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:25,541
I don't want my cut, all right?

969
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:28,166
But my girlfriend's money is in there too.

970
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:31,208
You can ask Pad.

971
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:34,375
I walked into the casino
with 200,000 baht.

972
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,541
Return it to her.

973
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:41,458
200,000 baht, yeah?

974
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,541
Fine. I'll take care of it.

975
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:56,250
Please leave, ma'am.

976
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:58,416
The offender doesn't wish to see you.

977
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,208
Why not?

978
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:01,666
I don't know, ma'am.

979
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,208
He asked me to tell you so.

980
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:13,375
Why the fuck don't you want to see me?

981
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:17,375
You dared to take my money
but you won't face me?

982
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,291
What did you do with my money?

983
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:21,791
Tell me.

984
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,666
Give it back.

985
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:28,708
What the fuck did I ever do to you?

986
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:30,750
Why are you doing this to me?

987
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,958
I was in debt because of my dad.

988
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:35,375
Now I'm in debt because of you.

989
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:36,833
Huh?

990
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:39,000
How could you do this to me?

991
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,291
Face me.

992
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,250
Bo, you piece of shit. Face me!

993
01:31:52,666 --> 01:32:00,875
YEARS LATER

994
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:18,583
You got out a while ago.

995
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,541
Where have you been?

996
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,000
Cambodia.

997
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,083
Someone got me a job.

998
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,166
10-5097
CHONBURI

999
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,833
I did it for over a year and fell sick.

1000
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,416
Then I got fired.

1001
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:45,000
It tastes worse than food in prison.

1002
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:49,041
Thip's cooking skills have gotten worse
while I was away.

1003
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:51,625
I made it.

1004
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:53,708
If you can't swallow it,
go eat somewhere else.

1005
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,000
Thip moved back to her hometown in Phrae.

1006
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:04,833
This time, she took our daughter with her.

1007
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:09,791
And Dad?

1008
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,708
He stopped driving the pickup truck taxi?

1009
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,500
His sight has been bad
for a while, asshole.

1010
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:18,541
He just crashed his truck the other day.

1011
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,500
It's been so rough.

1012
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,583
Making money is really tough.

1013
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:30,750
What about you, Bo?

1014
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,625
You're a grown man.

1015
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:35,833
Get your life together, man.

1016
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:40,041
How?

1017
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Like you?

1018
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:44,541
Own a barbershop. Have a wife and kid.

1019
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:46,583
But you didn't get it together.

1020
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,833
Dad hates me.

1021
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,000
Whatever shit I do
is never good enough for him.

1022
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,000
Dad doesn't hate you.

1023
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,291
He worries about you.

1024
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:13,875
Though my life is fucked up,
my business is bad,

1025
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:15,208
and my wife and kid left me,

1026
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,458
he doesn't care.

1027
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:20,958
You were all he could talk about.

1028
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:25,916
When were you getting out?

1029
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:29,541
Would you make it out alive?

1030
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,750
Would you hit your head
like you did before?

1031
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,250
You keep saying
he doesn't give a shit about you.

1032
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:45,291
But all he sees is you hurting yourself.

1033
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:49,208
What about you?

1034
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,958
Have you ever cared about
his feelings at all?

1035
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:14,208
The Election Commission Office

1036
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:18,083
invites all eligible voters
to exercise their right

1037
01:35:18,166 --> 01:35:23,250
and vote in the Chief Executive of the PAO
and Member of the PAO Council elections

1038
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,583
at the polling unit
where your name is registered.

1039
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:28,500
For more details on the elections…

1040
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:39,833
PLEASE VOTE FOR WANNA POKUDOM

1041
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:52,083
KHELANG NORTHERN THAI FOOD

1042
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,375
Hi, guys.

1043
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,833
If you're watching, say hello to me.

1044
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:42,291
Today, you'll be paying only 499 baht
for this box full of cosmetics.

1045
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:48,458
But I guarantee everything all together
in one box costs more than 499 baht.

1046
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:54,083
See? One, two, three, four.
These are already over 499.

1047
01:36:54,166 --> 01:36:57,458
I promise you it's worth it.

1048
01:36:57,541 --> 01:37:02,750
Not only that, you might win double.

1049
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:08,041
The first prize is the red envelope.

1050
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:11,208
-RED ENVELOPE AGAIN? I NEVER GET IT.
-The second prize is even bigger.

1051
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:14,416
-Gold. A gold necklace, everyone.
-NO ONE HAS EVER GOT IT.

1052
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Are you thrilled yet?

1053
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:19,375
Who will be the lucky winner?

1054
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:25,666
Im quit a long time ago.

1055
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,208
Almost two years now.

1056
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:33,416
She was deeply entangled in debt troubles.

1057
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:38,375
Someone would call her
or even come to see her here.

1058
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:41,750
It was chaos. She couldn't stay.

1059
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:51,958
The latest batch of products.

1060
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:58,166
What's wrong?

1061
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,125
When you packed
the mystery boxes the last time,

1062
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:05,208
did you put a gold necklace in at all?

1063
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,958
Of course.

1064
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:08,500
Why?

1065
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:14,333
The customers complain that
they never get the gold necklace.

1066
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:19,083
Im. They just ramble.

1067
01:38:29,166 --> 01:38:31,958
Im, hang in there.

1068
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:35,125
You will clear all your debts soon.

1069
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,833
I'm taking off now.

1070
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:55,250
Hello.

1071
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:57,250
I was delivering the products.

1072
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,583
On my way. See you soon.

1073
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:07,708
Ouch!

1074
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:18,791
THE CANDIDATE COORDINATION CENTER

1075
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,458
It's so hot, and I'm exhausted.

1076
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,458
Come on. Keep walking.

1077
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:46,333
Where the heck is my phone?

1078
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,750
It's here, Mama.
You left it at the restaurant.

1079
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,166
Why didn't you give it back sooner?

1080
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,916
Don't get your hands on my phone.
I don't like it.

1081
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:04,875
Hello, Mama.

1082
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:07,833
Long time no see, Bo.

1083
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:13,708
Why didn't you return the money
to my girlfriend?

1084
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:16,875
What money?

1085
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:21,125
Mama.

1086
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,333
That's her money.

1087
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:25,208
I don't remember it.

1088
01:40:30,916 --> 01:40:31,875
Mama.

1089
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:33,500
Don't be like this.

1090
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:35,000
Give it back.

1091
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,041
I said I don't remember.

1092
01:40:37,541 --> 01:40:38,791
How could you not?

1093
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,958
-The day I was arrested…
-Hey!

1094
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:42,750
Get out.

1095
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:44,375
You get out.

1096
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:45,833
I'm talking to her. Don't butt in.

1097
01:40:45,916 --> 01:40:47,125
-Mama…
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

1098
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:48,791
-Get lost.
-Mama!

1099
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,250
-Mama!
-Move!

1100
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:51,166
-Mama!
-Get lost.

1101
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:52,166
-Mama!
-Shut up!

1102
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,541
Give it back.

1103
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:55,458
-Don't do anything stupid.
-Let go!

1104
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:56,916
-Come here!
-Let go of me!

1105
01:41:23,666 --> 01:41:25,958
WAN'S SEAFOOD

1106
01:41:38,333 --> 01:41:39,750
Have dinner without me.

1107
01:41:39,833 --> 01:41:40,791
Don't wait up.

1108
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:55,500
MAX: WHERE ARE YOU, IM?

1109
01:41:55,583 --> 01:41:58,125
MAX: WHY AREN'T YOU DOING
THE LIVE SELLING?

1110
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:01,708
MAX: YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
PAY OFF YOUR DEBT.

1111
01:42:34,041 --> 01:42:36,333
Sir, can't you talk
to someone in your party?

1112
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,166
My competitor is coming in hot now.

1113
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,541
What should I do now?

1114
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:41,416
I've nearly run out of money here.

1115
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:46,125
I can't lose, sir. I've spent all I had.

1116
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,750
What do you say? Are you in or out?

1117
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:51,708
I'm thinking the same.

1118
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,416
Stop talking.

1119
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,958
It's my favorite.

1120
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:57,708
Hold on.

1121
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:02,708
-Who wants it? If you don't, I'll take it.
-I do.

1122
01:43:02,791 --> 01:43:05,416
Don't you dare.

1123
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
Son of a bitch!
Didn't you get what I said?

1124
01:43:17,541 --> 01:43:19,208
I do want it

1125
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:21,958
but I want to protect myself too.

1126
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,125
People keep leeching off me.

1127
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:43,125
When they asked me to run,
they said it wouldn't cost much.

1128
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:45,958
No competition. I would win for sure.

1129
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:46,875
Look now.

1130
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:51,625
Let me call you back, sir.

1131
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:53,458
Damn it.

1132
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,000
What the hell are you guys up to?

1133
01:43:57,083 --> 01:43:58,666
WE DO IT QUICKER AND BETTER

1134
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:03,458
Bo.

1135
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:13,916
You owe me.

1136
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:17,583
You must pay.

1137
01:44:20,625 --> 01:44:21,958
Son of a bitch!

1138
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:31,625
What?

1139
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:34,750
Why staring at me?

1140
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:37,750
What are you gonna do?

1141
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:42,333
Do you have the guts? Huh?

1142
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:50,250
Do it.

1143
01:45:06,416 --> 01:45:07,583
Please, Mama.

1144
01:45:11,541 --> 01:45:12,750
Don't do this.

1145
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:21,666
It's just 200,000 baht.

1146
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,500
You can make it in no time.

1147
01:45:24,375 --> 01:45:25,833
You still have lots of time.

1148
01:45:30,416 --> 01:45:32,250
But my time is running out.

1149
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:37,458
Please return the money.

1150
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:54,458
Look at you kneeling and begging.

1151
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:02,250
You think you'll get what you want?

1152
01:46:06,375 --> 01:46:08,125
You worked for me for so long.

1153
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:12,000
Didn't you learn anything?

1154
01:46:14,083 --> 01:46:16,875
You are a complete idiot.

1155
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:20,083
That's why your life has never
gotten better.

1156
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,666
Don't blame others.

1157
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:27,000
Don't blame me
for taking advantage of you.

1158
01:46:29,041 --> 01:46:31,083
Blame your own stupidity.

1159
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:35,708
What kind of debt collector smashes
his head instead of the debtors' heads?

1160
01:46:35,791 --> 01:46:36,875
Moron!

1161
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:38,583
Ouch!

1162
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:44,125
Damn it.

1163
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I raised you, you son of a bitch!

1164
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:48,958
Ouch.

1165
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:02,666
You taught me yourself.

1166
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,541
When you're in debt, you must pay.

1167
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:10,833
Give me back the money.

1168
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:24,416
Or let's just die together then.

1169
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:27,208
Hi, this is Pattaya City Police.
How may I help you?

1170
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:32,333
Hello, this is Pattaya City Police.

1171
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:35,500
Hello.

1172
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:44,708
THE CANDIDATE COORDINATION CENTER

1173
01:48:58,333 --> 01:48:59,166
Hello.

1174
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:00,916
Im.

1175
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:03,500
It's Bo.

1176
01:49:05,166 --> 01:49:06,666
I'm out of prison now.

1177
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:10,166
I'm giving you back the money tomorrow.

1178
01:49:11,666 --> 01:49:12,583
Im…

1179
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:15,625
What are you doing tomorrow?

1180
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,416
Will you be home?

1181
01:49:18,291 --> 01:49:19,083
I…

1182
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:21,583
I'm returning your money.

1183
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:23,500
Keep it.

1184
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,333
I won't get to spend it.

1185
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:41,875
The number that you've dialed
cannot be connected…

1186
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:17,500
Don't come closer.

1187
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:57,541
Just leave.

1188
01:52:56,625 --> 01:52:57,500
Mister!

1189
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:19,125
Based on his health checkup
and medical history,

1190
01:53:19,208 --> 01:53:26,166
his actions and habits have caused
long-term brain injury.

1191
01:53:27,791 --> 01:53:31,125
Whenever your brain
experiences attack or injury,

1192
01:53:31,625 --> 01:53:35,166
it causes a rise in intracranial pressure.

1193
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:41,000
If left untreated,
it produces brain swelling,

1194
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:44,625
which can be life-threatening.

1195
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:52,500
How do we cure it?

1196
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:56,416
In his case,

1197
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,458
I presume he's been experiencing
the symptoms for some time.

1198
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:02,375
All we can do now
is provide palliative care.

1199
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,750
I know you're not sleeping.

1200
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:31,375
How long have you known?

1201
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:37,416
Since in prison.

1202
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:48,166
What are you doing?

1203
01:54:49,291 --> 01:54:50,958
I gave you the money.

1204
01:54:53,833 --> 01:54:55,625
I don't owe you anything.

1205
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,541
I should go.

1206
01:55:01,791 --> 01:55:03,083
Aren't you going to get treatment?

1207
01:55:06,666 --> 01:55:08,125
I can't afford it.

1208
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,500
I don't have insurance.

1209
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,166
No treatment needed.

1210
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:24,500
The money you just gave me,

1211
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:27,583
I'll lend it to you.

1212
01:55:30,958 --> 01:55:31,875
What about your shop?

1213
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,291
Your debt?

1214
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:37,791
-You can pay me back once you recover.
-What if I don't recover?

1215
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:39,708
You want to be in debt
for the rest of your life?

1216
01:55:39,791 --> 01:55:40,916
Will you stop talking?

1217
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,458
If I'm gonna be in debt, so be it.

1218
01:55:47,958 --> 01:55:49,333
You must get treatment.

1219
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,208
FOR SALE/LEASE

1220
01:57:14,375 --> 01:57:15,208
Uncle Bo.

1221
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:18,458
Hey.

1222
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:19,750
Come here, sassy.

1223
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:21,458
How come you're here?

1224
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:37,416
That's probably reachable.

1225
01:57:39,208 --> 01:57:41,750
Didn't get enough sleep.

1226
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:03,916
Bo.

1227
01:58:19,375 --> 01:58:20,416
Thank you.

1228
01:58:25,208 --> 01:58:26,333
How about this?

1229
01:58:26,416 --> 01:58:27,916
Higher on the right.

1230
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
A little bit higher.

1231
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:30,208
Yeah.

1232
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:31,375
There you go.

1233
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:34,750
Here. Your son cooked it.

1234
01:58:36,958 --> 01:58:38,666
-Tip, have a seat.
-Try this too.

1235
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:40,375
Here you go.

1236
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:42,541
This is Stir-Fried Cabbage
with Fish Sauce.

1237
01:58:44,416 --> 01:58:46,791
Look.

1238
01:58:46,875 --> 01:58:48,708
The fried tofu is so crispy.

1239
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:51,000
So good. It'll be a bestseller for sure.

1240
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:52,875
-Exactly. It's so good.
-Right.

1241
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:53,833
Superb.

1242
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:56,208
The food will be gone in no time.

1243
01:58:58,458 --> 01:59:00,125
Prosperity.

1244
01:59:00,208 --> 01:59:02,666
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1245
01:59:16,125 --> 01:59:19,666
This one is really crispy.

1246
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:21,625
Do you like it?

1247
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:40,708
Should I name the shop "Fries to You"?

1248
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,375
Nope.

1249
01:59:46,291 --> 01:59:47,958
Doesn't sound cool at all.

1250
01:59:51,875 --> 01:59:53,375
Take your time.

1251
01:59:56,291 --> 01:59:57,833
You'll eventually come up with something.

1252
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:06,125
Remember the day
you gave me back the money?

1253
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:10,750
That night,

1254
02:00:12,791 --> 02:00:14,875
I was so ready to die.

1255
02:00:17,666 --> 02:00:20,541
Do you know why I changed my mind?

1256
02:00:35,625 --> 02:00:36,958
It was because of you.

1257
02:00:43,916 --> 02:00:45,041
To be honest,

1258
02:00:46,208 --> 02:00:47,958
I don't even remember
what we talked about.

1259
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:03,916
But you reaching out was enough

1260
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:07,000
to make me not want to die.

1261
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:10,791
Simple as that.

1262
02:01:47,041 --> 02:01:48,250
Let's get some sleep.

1263
02:02:11,875 --> 02:02:13,000
I know

1264
02:02:13,666 --> 02:02:15,375
what I will name the shop.

1265
02:02:20,875 --> 02:02:22,208
Do you want to know?

1266
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:28,416
Take a guess.

1267
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:45,208
Bo.

1268
02:03:08,666 --> 02:03:09,583
Bo.

1269
02:05:35,083 --> 02:05:35,958
Im.

1270
02:05:37,791 --> 02:05:40,083
By the time you read this letter,

1271
02:05:41,916 --> 02:05:44,000
I will already be with Uncle Aod.

1272
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:48,416
You must be exhausted

1273
02:05:49,166 --> 02:05:51,000
from running the shop by yourself.

1274
02:05:53,166 --> 02:05:54,791
But you're smart.

1275
02:05:56,291 --> 02:05:58,041
I'm sure you can manage everything.

1276
02:06:01,208 --> 02:06:03,958
You know, after being discharged
from the hospital,

1277
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:07,291
though I was so worn out
from decorating the shop,

1278
02:06:08,916 --> 02:06:11,875
it was such a damn happy time for me.

1279
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:18,416
I felt like someone
who's paid off his debt.

1280
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:23,416
It felt free and peaceful,

1281
02:06:24,541 --> 02:06:26,791
and I got to take my deepest breaths.

1282
02:06:28,625 --> 02:06:31,333
I never imagined I would ever
experience this kind of feeling.

1283
02:06:35,333 --> 02:06:37,375
It happened because of you.

1284
02:06:43,583 --> 02:06:44,583
Im,

1285
02:06:46,208 --> 02:06:48,000
you still have a long life ahead of you.

1286
02:06:50,791 --> 02:06:53,541
On the day you are at sea,

1287
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:58,125
I want you to love yourself.

1288
02:06:59,958 --> 02:07:01,958
If you don't know which way to go,

1289
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:05,500
stay still.

1290
02:07:06,416 --> 02:07:08,208
Take a deep breath.

1291
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:14,083
If you can't do anything,

1292
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:17,250
just breathe and get through the day.

1293
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,750
Uncle Aod taught me that

1294
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:27,291
we must live with hope.

1295
02:07:28,333 --> 02:07:30,250
Those without it are those who are dead.

1296
02:07:31,416 --> 02:07:33,583
Though I'm dead,

1297
02:07:34,375 --> 02:07:37,458
you must live the longest life you can.

1298
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:45,958
I will always root for you.

1299
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:40,291
Hello. Please, go on in.

1300
02:08:48,375 --> 02:08:55,541
IMBO
