[Episode 18]

3
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,280
Huahua.

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,880
Let's head back to the company.

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,680
I need to talk to Ma Rulong.

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Who are you?

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,880
You'll know soon.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,640
Can you behave yourself?

9
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,240
Hello?

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,400
Ma Rulong.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,720
Liao Dongsheng is with me.

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,400
If you want to save him,

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,600
come alone to the warehouse
in the north of the city.

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
If you call the police,

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
then come collect the body.

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,920
If Ma Rulong shows up, you're free.

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
Stop trying to fool me.

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,120
From the car crash at the start,

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,520
to this kidnapping now,

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,560
you've always had one goal.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,920
My big brother.

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,840
Just the methods keep changing.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,280
From trying to end him,

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
to trying to break him.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Did I say I'd kill you?

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,880
The worst way to break him

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
is making him watch

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,160
the death of his own brother,

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
yet there's nothing he can do.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Right?

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,520
Impressive.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,000
You even saw your own end coming.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,200
I have one request.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,960
Let me make a call.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Ask for help?

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Dongsheng.

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,440
Dongsheng.

38
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
Hello?

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,320
Say something.

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,680
Hello?

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,640
Hung up.

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
Dongsheng.

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,320
He has nothing to do with us.

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
That's true.

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
But he does.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,960
Ma Rulong.

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,840
Play a game with me.

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Guess who I am in fifteen seconds.

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,120
Get it right and you can save him.

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Fifteen.

51
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,080
Fourteen.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,440
Thirteen.

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,760
Twelve.

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Eleven.

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
Too slow.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Eight.

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,920
Seven.

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,200
Six.

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,440
Five.

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,680
Four.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Three.

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,960
Two.

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,440
One.

64
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,320
Why isn't Jun back yet?

65
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,120
Did something really happen?

66
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
No way, that can't be.

67
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,160
San Hu.

68
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,640
He's at the police station now.

69
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
We'll get word back soon.

70
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,120
Sis, my heart's racing right now.

71
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,760
I keep feeling like

72
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
something bad might happen.

73
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,760
You're overthinking it.

74
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
You know what Jun is like.

75
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,840
He'd never hurt his brothers.

76
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
But what if something goes wrong?

77
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,440
If things go south, what do we do?

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
It won't come to that.

79
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
We're back.

80
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,480
Jun.

81
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,200
What did the police say?

82
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,480
The police said,

83
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,920
Long is no longer a suspect.

84
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,200
So don't worry.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Alright.

86
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,320
See? Everything's fine now.

87
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Lan was worried because of you.

88
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,080
Haven't eaten all day.

89
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,000
Huzi skipped meals too, right?

90
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,240
Come on.

91
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
You'd better stay here.

92
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,920
You had us worried all day.

93
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,880
Here's your punishment.

94
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
Clean up the place.

95
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,520
Make sure it's spotless.

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,200
