Guo Chongjiang.

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,880
If you have any conscience,

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
just let me go.

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,320
You're all I have left now.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,600
The only one.

17
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
I can't let you go.

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,600
No way.

It's not that high here.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,440
It's not high.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,240
Guo Chongjiang.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,440
Don't do anything rash.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Jun.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,400
Ma Rulong.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,320
Do you remember this place?

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,880
Let's play one more game.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
I'll show you something.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,240
Watch Qin Lan and I disappear
together.

Guo Chongjiang.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
Are you really doing this?

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,080
Then that's three lives lost.

41
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
Do you love me?

42
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,360
I don't.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,800
Did you ever love me?

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Never.

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120

[Six years later]

56
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,680
Why did it take you so long
to come back?

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,240
So many people here,
still doing it all yourself?

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
Who here even knows how to cook?

59
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,080
I get hungry really fast
with the two of us.

60
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,800
Listen.

61
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,200
What?

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
Come on.

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,960
Take it easy.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Almost done.

65
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,360
Bin.

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,080
Hey.

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
Where are you, Bin?

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,480
Here, brother. Washing veggies.

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,200
Let me prepare a side dish.

70
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll help you.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,280
Sure.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
Gao Lin.

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
Did I call you here to sleep,

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
huh?

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,600
Can't you see everyone else
working out there?

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,640
Are you mad?

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,200
Have you never slept before?

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,400
A bunch of people out there,
do you have to come to me?

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,880
Where's big brother?

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Big brother quit his job.

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
What, here to experience life?

82
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
You don't get it.

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,800
This is
where big brother starts over.

84
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
You talk too much.

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Lazy and chatty.

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,880
So you get it?

87
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah, I get it.

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Alright, that's enough.

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,040
Come to the table.

90
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,280
Alright.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's eat.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,120
Just woke up, and food's ready.

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,640
That's perfect.

94
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,680
Here comes the meat.

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,240
Do some work.

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Say one more word, I'll get you.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,440
Get me?

98
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,040
I haven't even said I'll get you yet.

99
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,400
Come on.

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,160
Let's dig in.

101
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,720
Hold on a sec.

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,160
Someone's missing.

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,200
Who?

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
It's me.

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,880
What?

106
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,920
Did you forget me?

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh no.

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
Come on out.

109
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,840
Everyone knows you already.

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
Whoa.

111
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,080
Huzi!

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,280
Whoa.

113
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,080
What a happy vibe.

114
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Big boy.

115
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,720
Say hello to your uncles.

116
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,280
Uncle.

117
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,600
Come inside.

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Take a seat.

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,560
Weren't you abroad?

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
He didn't go abroad.

121
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,880
He came to Guangzhou with me.

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
This little thing here,

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,840
actually looks pretty cool.

124
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
Alright, everyone's here.

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
Let's raise our glasses.

126
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,600
Come on.

127
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,080
Let's all have a drink.

128
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Count me in too.

129
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Let's do it.

130
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,400
Here's to all of us,

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,480
may things get better.

132
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
May things get better.

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,640
Come on, dig into the meat.

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,840
You're just like a kid.

135
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,040
Fighting for food with a kid?

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
My son.

137
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
Never had meat before?

138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
Go on, just eat already.
