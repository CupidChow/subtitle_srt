[Episode 9]

3
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,680
Hey, sis.

4
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,280
Why are you here alone?

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,320
Come on.

6
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Feels good, right?

7
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,760
Do we know each other?

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Well, we do now.

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,680
What are you talking about?

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,400
You're not from around here?

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,720
Guangzhou Club Madonna.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,680
Feng Yue.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Ma Rulong from Northeast.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,880
Alright, got it.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,160
My bad, I got it wrong.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,160
I just called you "sis".

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
Yeah, I heard you.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,600
You know why?

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,520
Why?

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,360
This one.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,280
Cosmopolitan.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,600
I know the name.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,280
What's with it?

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,120
Did you notice this place,

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,400
how many guys are watching you?

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
Everybody.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,240
Welcome to Sleepless Night.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,240
We're all here for tonight's event.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,200
Let me announce,

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
the fifth

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
Couples Drinking Challenge

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,880
is now

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,360
officially starting.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,640
Get a little more excited.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,280
For this event,

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,320
we keep the same rules as before.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,360
Five-level wine tower,

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,440
ten glasses on each level,

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,600
alcohol gets stronger each round.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080
Clear each level's challenge,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,360
you'll get the matching reward.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,720
But this time,

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,320
there's a slight exception.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,960
No one has

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,880
ever beaten level 5,

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,440
so,

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
our boss decided

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,920
to raise the reward.

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,760
The five grand doubles,

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
if anyone finishes the challenge,

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,840
they'll get

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,840
ten thousand cash.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Ten thousand, wow.

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,280
Ten thousand.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,520
That's ten thousand.

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,480
Couples, sign up fast.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
We want to try.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Sure enough,

59
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,320
a big reward draws brave hearts.

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,880
Me too, me too.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,080
Hurry up.

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Ten thousand.

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
Ten thousand cash.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Come on.

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,440
Go, go, go, move!

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,160
Hurry up.

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
Go up, quick.

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,680
Come on.

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,120
Keep eyes on him.

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,720
Don't let him get away.

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,600
I'll go up. Wait a sec.

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
To finish them all,

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
at least 1 liter each.

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,160
Bro.

75
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,920
You made a mistake.

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I can only handle

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
this much.

78
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
Then why call me up?

79
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Are you messing with me?

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,960
I...

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm giving you a chance here.

82
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Prove you're a real man.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,520
Do I need you to show...

84
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,960
OK.

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,960
Challenge...

86
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,760
starts now.

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,560
Come on.

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,520
You got this.

89
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,960
Come on.

90
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,840
Come on.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,720
Come on.

92
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,560
Come on.

93
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,480
Come on.

94
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,360
Come on.

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,280
Come on.

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,800
Come on.

97
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,520
Now!

98
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,120
We have a champion!

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,760
We did it.

100
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,840
We won.

101
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,720
We won.

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,920
Sobered up now?

103
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,360
What time is it, Hong?

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
Are you tired?

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,120
Are you supposed to take responsibility
for me, aren't you?

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
You're so boring.

107
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,560
Here.

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Ten thousand.

109
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
I keep my word.

110
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,360
You get five thousand.

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,200
I get five thousand.

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
But still,

113
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,160
you must take responsibility.

114
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
My clothes,

115
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,440
you threw up all over them.

116
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,360
Five hundred.

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
Thanks, boss.

118
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,040
Why are you in Guangzhou?

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
Business trip.

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
What kind of business?

121
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
Entertainment project.

122
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
Entertainment project?

123
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm pretty familiar with this.

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,480
My uncle runs the biggest bar
in Guangdong.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,880
Don't mess with me.

126
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,640
Who's messing with you?

127
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,640
Come on, get up.

128
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,920
Put your clothes on.

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
I made coffee for you.

130
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,680
Go ahead, drink it.

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,800
This is

132
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
the one from yesterday.

133
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,520
That's right.

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
My uncle owns this bar.

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Take a good look around first.

136
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm gonna say hi to my uncle.

137
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
Be back soon.

138
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Uncle.

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,160
Move over a bit.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,360
What about you sitting there?

141
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Just move in.

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,120
Your grandpa's searching for you.

143
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
Had enough fun yet?

144
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,200
This is actually pretty fun.

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,840
Don't go telling on me.

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,040
Let me stay a couple more days.

147
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,680
Looking cool, right?

148
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,760
Last time I played as your dad.

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,120
What about this time?

150
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,600
Uncle.

151
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,560
Uncle?

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,760
I just told him.

153
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,720
You're my uncle.

154
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,720
That's not hard at all.

155
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,560
Just act natural.

156
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,720
Ma Rulong.

157
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Let me introduce you.

158
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
This is my uncle.

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
He's the boss here.

160
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,880
Hello.

161
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,360
Have a seat.

162
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,360
I heard you're getting a new batch
of equipment.

163
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,160
Yeah.

164
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
Any specific requirements?

165
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm not really an expert.

166
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
Just want them for

167
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,840
bars and clubs.

168
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,640
Can you share the size?

169
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
Ten thousand square meters.

170
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,280
That's a big order.

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
That's why I need

172
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
a pro like you to help.

173
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Don't worry.

174
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,760
My uncle handles this stuff.

175
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,200
He's definitely an expert.

176
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,440
He can get all the equipment ready,

177
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,000
ship it safely,

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,160
and even send over

179
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,440
a crew of professionals to Northeast.

180
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,920
Taking care of everything.

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,160
And also,

182
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,480
he can give you a discount,

183
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,080
right?

184
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,960
We'll give you a deal...

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,480
30% off.

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
30% off.

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
30% off.

188
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
Is that really okay?

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,840
No worries.

190
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,680
Well,

191
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,080
aren't you Yue's friend?

192
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,200
We're basically family.

193
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,960
Say thank to my uncle.

194
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,760
Thank you so much.

195
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,680
I'll go get things ready.

196
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
You two catch up.

197
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
I have a show.

198
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
A show?

199
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,800
She didn't tell you?

200
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,480
♪The tree still, yet the wind blowing.♪

201
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,580
♪Words on my lips, heart uneasy.♪

202
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,650
♪Words twist and turn in my hands.♪

203
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,410
♪But all I can say is, you look nice.♪

204
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,640
♪Some people only live on in memories.♪

205
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,800
Hey, hey.

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,280
What are you doing?

207
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,360
Let go.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,840
