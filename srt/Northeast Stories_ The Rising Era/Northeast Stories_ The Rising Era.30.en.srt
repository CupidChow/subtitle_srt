[Northeast Stories: The Rising Era S2]

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,320
Did you get the numbers wrong?

4
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,520
Just the sound system costs 20 million.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,480
That's right.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,400
This price has been verified.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,240
There's no way Ma Rulong spent

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,080
that much on Caiman Entertainment.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
He didn't pay a single cent.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,240
So did he just pick up them
off the street?

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,080
Pretty much, yeah.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,120
I had someone look into it.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
All the equipment
Caiman Entertainment uses

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,760
came from Guangzhou.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,760
A company there just gave it all away.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,160
Everything good falls

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,600
right into his lap.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,560
You should leave for now.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,960
I want some time alone.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,200
Don't let anyone bother me.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,280
Got it.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,880
I said don't let anyone bother me.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
Did you ignore what I just said?

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a business meeting.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,280
Still can't get in?

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,960
Who are you?

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,600
The New Yongming Chairman.

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,680
Guo Chongjiang.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,160
Chairman of Yongming Group,

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,440
didn't he jump from a building?

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
That man,

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
was my dad.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Now,

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
you get it, right?

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,160
Both of us,

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,640
want to take down Ma Rulong.

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
That business deal you mentioned,

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
what exactly do you mean?

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
If Jichun and Caiman are in competition,

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
renovating,

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,160
the equipment,

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,640
everything needs money.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm here to give you money.

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,200
But this money,

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
doesn't come for free, right?

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,720
I need you to

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,640
give up shares in Jichun Entertainment.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Plenty want shares
in Jichun Entertainment.

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,560
Why should I take your money?

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,800
Because no one else

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
hates Ma Rulong more than I do.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
How much do you want?

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,240
That depends,

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,120
on how badly
you want to beat Ma Rulong.

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Bro,

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,320
no clue where Jichun Entertainment,

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,840
got so much money,

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,040
now their renovations are all new,

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
and the sound system's brand new too.

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,400
Their ads are everywhere these days.

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,320
Keep a close eye

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
on Entertainment Center these days.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Especially on the Grand Opening.

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,960
See if any strangers show up.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,160
Yeah.

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll look for anyone in fancy cars,

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
or wearing designer brands.

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,320
You always get what I mean.

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
Grand Opening today.

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,560
Caiman leads the way!

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,200
Grand Opening today.

72
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,040
Grand Opening today.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,840
Caiman leads the way!

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Grand Opening today.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Caiman leads the way!

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Hong,

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
I've always liked him.

78
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,600
I've heard all his songs.

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,680

Then you get one draw

Here are the prizes on offer.

86

To keep customers coming back,

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,800
a lucky draw isn't enough.

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,840
We need to step up our service.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,960

It's about time. Open the gate.

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,280
Something's wrong, boss.

95
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,160
It's the first day of the event.

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,920
What are you doing over there?

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
Don't you see the boss's here?

98
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,640
Just say what you need to say.

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,080
People who were lining up outside

100
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,160
have all gone.

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,960
Where'd they go?

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,480
They went
to Caiman Entertainment Center.

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
There's a superstar there tonight.

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
Everyone wanted to see him.

105
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480

I'm really excited tonight.

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me show you something.

113
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,320
Awesome.

114
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
That was awesome.

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Bro.

116
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,960
I'm not exaggerating, really.

117
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,160
Our club,

118
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
with me leading the way,

119
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,160
has been packed every night.

120
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,600
Everyone's at our place.

121
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,080
They can all vouch for my words.

122
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,120
Go ahead, ask her.

123
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,840
Our phone
hasn't stopped ringing, right?

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,160
See?

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,600
The competitor,

126
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
it's not even close.

127
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,720
No competition at all.

128
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
Almost no customer left there.

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,440
So, by your words,

130
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,160
I should find time to meet Shao Meiyin.

131
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,520
Why would you meet her?

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Our business is booming.

133
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm not trying to sink
Jichun Entertainment.

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,840
I just want Jichun
to come together again.

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,960
What do you mean by that?

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,760
It's nothing special.

137
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,560
Look at those circles under your eyes.

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,400
Go home and rest up.

139
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm not tired.

140
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,160
Paid time off.

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,800
Now I'm really tired.

142
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Alright, I'm heading out, bro.

143
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,960
Okay, see you.

144
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,680
Let's go.

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
Paid time off.

146
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,600
Go home and get some sleep.

147
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,240
Alright.

148
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
What's alright about it?

149
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Let me see.

150
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
Nope, not alright.

151
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,880
You still look pretty unhappy.

152
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,200
Come on.

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,440
That's more like it.

154
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,200
I know

155
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,560
you're still thinking about Lan.

156
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,960
I promise.

157
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,280
After I meet Shao Meiyin,

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,280
we'll look for Lan together.

159
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,040
Sound good?

160
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,040
Good.

161
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
Hello, Caiman Group.

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,640
Lan.

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Where are you now?

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
I'll come find you.

165
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,080
Alright.

166
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Youngest.

167
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
Stop being hard on yourself.

168
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,800
You came to watch me mess up, right?

169
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Youngest.

170
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm here to

171
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
take over Jichun Entertainment.

172
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Too late.

173
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
I already sold Jichun Entertainment.

174
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,320
Yeah.

175
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Sold it to me.

176
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,680
Right?

177
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Where's Qin Lan?

178
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
You mean my fiancée?

179
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,760
She's at home.

180
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,720
Guo Chongjiang.

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,920
This is between you and me.

182
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,640
Do not drag others in.

183
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,520
You need proof for your words.

184
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,840
We could be quite the team.

185
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,360
This place is mine now.

186
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,640
Right?

187
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,760
Youngest.

188
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,400
How much did you sell to him?

189
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
Of course everything.

190
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,280
Right?

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,760
I do whatever I want here.

192
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,760
It's none of your business.

193
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,840
Yeah.

194
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,560
It's none of your business.

195
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,120
Oh right, Shao Meiyin.

196
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
Liao Dongsheng called you a lot
that day.

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Why didn't you pick up?

198
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,760
I was in the back...

199
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,680
How did you know

200
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,400
Liao Dongsheng called me
before he died?

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,480
You killed Liao Dongsheng!

202
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
Knife, knife.

203
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,800
Guo Chongjiang, you total jerk!

204
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,920
Think about it.

205
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,520
And think about Qin Lan.

206
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,680
Ma Rulong.

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
Our little game,

208
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
is just getting started.

209
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,320
You better hold on.
