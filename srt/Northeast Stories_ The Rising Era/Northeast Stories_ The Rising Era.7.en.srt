Awesome.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,320
A spicy one,

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,240
and a mild one.

7

Hold on.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,120
Wait.

Bro.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,880
It's a misunderstanding.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm just here to buy some clothes.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,640
We'll see again.

Jun, what's wrong? Wake up.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
There's blood.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,800
Help him inside.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
Useless.

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,960
I have to handle this myself.

What?

27

Cold.

Honestly,
I have no idea what's up today.

45

Step back.

You found big brother
and didn't say a word?
