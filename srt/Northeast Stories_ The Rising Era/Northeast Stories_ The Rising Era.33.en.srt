[Episode 15]

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Everyone, please review the contract.

4
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
If there are no issues,

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,760
let's go ahead and sign.

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,840
Once you sign,

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
the funds will be transferred

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,760
to your account in two days.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,080
From this moment on,

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,280
Caiman is yours alone.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
No matter win or lose,

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,000
you've got to stay with it.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,360
It's not just mine.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
What do you mean?

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,160
They're in it too.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,200
Weren't they against you?

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,480
That's all in the past.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,880
Now, let me announce something.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,720
Starting today,

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,600
Caiman Group will officially be renamed

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
New Jichun.

[Caiman]

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
Hey, brother-in-law,

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
everyone's here.

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
What brings you here?

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
I came to drop off the wedding invite

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
for me and Lan.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Hope you all can make it.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,520
Guo Chongjiang,

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,360
can't we just
put our issues out in the open?

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,720
Ma Rulong,

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,880
my New Yongming

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,040
is a public company.

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
What about you?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
You want to talk out in the open,

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,640
sure.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Go public first.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Make sure all of you come.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,900
Come on.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,560
Take this.

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,800
Everyone's going,

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,960
right?

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,200
I'll head out.

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,520
Relax.

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,720
I've talked to everyone already.

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,440
They'll all show up.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,960
Let's go.

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,240
Guo Chongjiang is always scheming.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,920
He said we'll compete fair and square

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,160
if New Jichun will go public normally.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
Do you really buy that?

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,920
People,

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,160
once they've gone too far,

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
it's hard to turn back.

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,720
New Jichun
going public won't happen overnight.

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,200
We have to stay alert.

57
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,960
Just in case Guo Chongjiang
pulls something.

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
What do you think?

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
I have no clue about going public.

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Forget about going public,

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
just trust your own feeling.

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,160
So...

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Back when I ran that clothing shop.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,800
If I wanted quick cash,

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
I'd sell fast and move stock.

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
If I hoarded inventory,

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,960
my money would get stuck.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,920
If the style flopped the next year,

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
and no one wanted it,

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,080
I'd be in trouble.

71
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,200
So I think,

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,680
maybe going public sooner is better.

73
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,920
And as for Guo Chongjiang,

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,880
he loves stirring things up,

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,920
always scheming something.

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,320
You're right about that.

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Speed is the way to fix this.

78
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,600
But big brother,

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,440
going public takes time.

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
Honestly, we do need more time.

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,480
So we need another approach.

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's find someone to help us.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:07,880
Look at you.

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
You scared me.

86
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,040
You're finally here, man.

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,240
Look.

88
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,040
That guy,

89
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
he's a boss.

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,880
Staying in the presidential suite.

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
I even saw his room card.

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,040
It's definitely him.

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
Appreciate it.

94
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
Where are you off to?

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,520
You're going in that outfit?

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,960
Fix yourself up a bit.

97
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
It's business, not a date.

98
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
It's no big deal.

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,360
You got this!

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,640
Hello.

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,840
I know it's bold

102
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
to sit opposite you.

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,760
But,

104
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
I truly need this chance.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,960
So,

106
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,960
please,

107
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,480
can you spare me a few minutes?

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,640
In business,

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,120
time means money.

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,320
And,

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,320
money also means time.

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Here's what I mean.

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,440
Time means money,

114
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,800
so it's about seizing chances,

115
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,360
right?

116
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,640
Then moving as fast as possible,

117
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,880
to reach the goal of growth.

118
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,200
That's already,

119
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
a kind of opportunistic behavior.

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Opportunistic behavior
often involves mutual choice.

121
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,800
So,

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,600
right now, we're on equal footing.

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
But the moment you sat down,

124
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,800
hoping to get a few minutes of my time,

125
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
from that moment on,

126
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,160
the balance shifted between us.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,280
Isn't that true?

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
See you around.

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,400
New Jichun is a well-known company
in Northeast.

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
You'll regret walking away from this.

131
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
You're Ma Rulong, right?

132
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,360
Yeah.

133
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,600
I've heard about you from someone.

134
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,160
Go ahead.

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,560
You come to me.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
What exactly do you want?

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,640
I hope

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,240
Yidu Huashang

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,640
can help New Jichun go public.

140
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,960
What can you offer me in return?

141
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's sit and talk.

142
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Alright.

143
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Go ahead, I'm listening.

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
If you can make it happen,

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
New Jichun,

146
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
all its business in Northeast,

147
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,040
will partner with

148
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
Yidu Huashang on everything.

149
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
That's what you're offering,

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,760
but only after New Jichun goes public.

151
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,360
What I want in return,

152
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,520
is for helping New Jichun go public.

153
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,720
No matter if

154
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,600
it works out

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,320
or not.

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,240
Looks like

157
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
you're still not ready.

158
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Fine.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
I'll give you a chance.

160
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,520
We've got our eyes on a piece of land.

161
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,320
If you help us get it,

162
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,320
everything else will be easy.

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,000
So, you're planning to

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
test me.

165
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,880
That's right.

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
It's pretty obvious.

167
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
Everyone

168
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
wants to work with smart

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
business partners.

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
Right?

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,520
Alright.

172
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm in.

173
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Great.

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,080
We'll be waiting for good news.

175
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
What's up, brother?

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,200
Here you come.

177
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,680
Thanks for coming out so late.

178
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,720
But there's something important.

179
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,040
Today we're going to a land auction.

180
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,600
Not much time, a lot to do.

181
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Ten hours from now,

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,480
we have to submit our base price.

183
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,960
So,

184
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
let's pull an all-nighter.

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,280
No problem at all.

186
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,840
Let's do it.

187
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,200
Alright.

188
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll work out the building expenses

189
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,840
on land developing.

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
Let me take care of vehicles.

191
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,160
There's a shopping mall in the plan,

192
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,640
I'll estimate its income.

193
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Hold on,

194
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,240
that's a lot to do.

195
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
Then I'll handle
the residential building.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,320
Sounds good.

197

Late-night snacks.

198
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,120
Glad to see you, Hong.

199
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
I know you are staying up late.

200
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,880
Got you guys braised beef bones.

201
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
And some tea for everyone.

202
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,040
Alright.

203
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,200
Since we got everything ready,

204
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,960
guys,

205
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
let's do something before we start.

206
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
Do what? We're not kids anymore.

207
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,960
Why not? Age doesn't matter.

208
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,320
Come on.

209
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,280
Let's go.

210
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
What did you guys shout as kids?

211
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,560
We didn't shout anything.

212
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Actually, we did.

213
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,800
Go for it!

214
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
We're awesome!

215
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Come on.

216
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Three, two, one.

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,280
Go for it! We're awesome!

218
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,320
Let's do this.

219

[Public Land Auction]
are two strong companies.

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
For this auction,

223
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,120
we received seventeen offers.

224
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,760
Among them,

225
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,120
two offers stood out.

226
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,520
They were closest to the mark.

227
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
One is from

228
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,160
New Yongming Group,

229
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,840
the other is from

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
Yidu Huashang.

231
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,520
Their bids

232
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,200
differ by just ten thousand.

233
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
In such a big project,

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,840
ten thousand

235
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
doesn't mean much.

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,720
However,

237
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,800
it's enough to decide the winner.

238
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Now, I'll announce

239
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,120
