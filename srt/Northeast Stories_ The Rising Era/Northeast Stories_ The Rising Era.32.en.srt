[Episode 14]

3
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:33,960
Huh?

4
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
Big brother,
what brings you here today?

5
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,000
Dad left us something.

6
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,840
Left what?

7
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,440
It's about the jade pendant.

8
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,800
The jade pendant?

9
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,640
Meet me in the wine cellar tonight.

10
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Bring the jade pendant.

11
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,400
Big brother.

12
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,880
Want some wild greens?

13
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Good for your health.

14
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
If you don't want it, that's fine.

15
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,440
That's a great drawing.

16
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,360
He's always looked like that to me.

17
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,880
Youngest.

18
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
You still have
Dongsheng's jade pendant, right?

19
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
What's up, brother?

20
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,840
Come to the wine cellar tonight.

21
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
Alright.

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
I'm heading out.

23
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,000
Sir,

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,800
can you help me out?

25
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
Sure, no problem.

26
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
So...the thing...you know,

27
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,080
remember to record it.

28
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,760
If the count's off, I'll come find you.

29
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,680
Alright, got it.

30
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,640
So,

31
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,760
it's just a small business.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,320
I just do things if I could.

33
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
Why are you hanging around here?

34
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
Here to see me mess up?

35
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
Actually, I need your help
with something important.

36
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Hmph.

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm already doing the heavy lifting.

38
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
What else could be so important?

39
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,400
It's about dad.

40
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
We can't miss anyone.

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
But we're already one short.

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,000
Still missing me, right?

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Dongsheng wouldn't want

44
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
to see Jichun split up.

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,880
So, tomorrow at home,

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,160
the three of us will wait for you.

47
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,120
Will everyone really show up?

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,600
Honestly, I doubt it.

49
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,760
It's about dad, though.

50
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
They'll come for that.

51
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,600
Let's just wait and see.

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
Sorry I'm late, brother.

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,040
Had to go pick her up.

54
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,520
What's going on?
Just tell me.

55
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,160
It's about dad.

56
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
Where's Wang Bin?

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,200
He'll show up.

58
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah. Like that'll happen.

59
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,720
Always so sensitive.

60
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,120
Hey, who's that guy trash-talking?

61
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,000
I've been here for a while.

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Just didn't show myself.

63
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
Why's everyone staring at me?

64
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,160
What's up?

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,280
Looks like everyone's here.

66
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,920
Let's head inside to talk.

67
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,360
Next time, show up sooner.

68
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,320
The jade pendants.

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,960
Isn't there a password?

70
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,920
These four jade pendants,

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
the old man gave one to each of us.

72
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
So this password,

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,960
must be about you, the youngest.

74
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,440
These four jade pendants,

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
none can be left out.

76
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,720
Then about the password,

77
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,480
it must be something only I would know.

78
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,600
My mom's birthday and mine together,

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,240
make exactly eight digits.

80
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,320
I feel torn inside.

81
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
I wrote this letter,

82
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,400
but I hope you never read it.

83
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,120
First, I owe my daughter an apology.

84
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,960
I didn't fulfill

85
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,040
my duty as a father.

86
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
Losing your mom so young,

87
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,480
that's the hardest thing in life.

88
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,040
So I made a choice,

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
to adopt a child.

90
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,120
I wanted to find her a friend,

91
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,680
and also someone

92
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,720
who could help her someday,

93
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,320
manage Jichun with her.

94
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,960
Maybe it was fate.

95
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
The moment
I arrived at the Welfare Home,

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,440
I witnessed a rescue.

97
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,080
Get in the car.

98
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,600
Will I never see them again?

99
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,360
People

100
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,440
learn to grow up

101
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
through each goodbye.

102
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,840
You shouldn't just adopt me.

103
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
But I can't adopt everyone

104
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,880
at the Welfare Home.

105
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
You don't have to take them all.

106
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,720
Just three more would be enough.

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,560
Why...

108
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,440
exactly three?

109
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,640
Because I promised to protect them.

110
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,160
I can't break my word.

111
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,040
But you need to know,

112
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,360
if I adopt those three,

113
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,960
you'll have to stay here.

114
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
Will you really look after them well?

115
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Of course.

116
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
Alright.

117
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,040
I'll stay then.

118
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,760
You can take them with you.

119
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,240
Really?

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,600
Since I was young, I was taught

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
to always work hard,

122
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,000
and to stay alert even in peace.

123
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
The future's always uncertain,

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,160
crisis can strike anytime,

125
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
and it's impossible
to be fully prepared.

126
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,760
So I made up my mind,

127
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,680
to set up a secret vault.

128
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,160
If Jichun ever runs into trouble,

129
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,800
we'd still have a way out.

130
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
But I didn't want

131
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,200
to tell you all directly,

132
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,840
because if people know
there's a backup,

133
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
they might stop fighting.

134
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,200
That's why I kept everything hidden.

135
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Jichun Group

136
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,720
can weather storms
in the business world.

137
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,400
It may rise, it may fall,

138
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
but that's never fatal.

139
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,560
But if you five can't stay united,

140
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,760
Jichun,

141
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
doesn't need to exist anymore.

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,680
As long as you stick together,

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,240
every challenge,

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
can be overcome.

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
Big brother,

146
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,840
I was wrong.

147
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,960
Bro,

148
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
I messed up too.

149
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,480
Big brother,

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,160
I was wrong.

151
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
I really hope,

152
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,520
we can use

153
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,000
what dad left us,

154
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
to bring Jichun back on track.

155
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
We'll never fall apart.

156
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,160
This family must stay strong.

157
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,200
Bro,

158
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
when shall we start?

159
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,040
