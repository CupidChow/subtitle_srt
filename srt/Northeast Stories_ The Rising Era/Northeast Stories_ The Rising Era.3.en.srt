00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
[Episode 3]

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,760
Go ahead.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,720
Who went after Ma Rulong?

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,800
Wang Bin, can you even talk straight?

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
Don't think I don't know

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,280
what you all are up to.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,560
Before he disappeared,

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,040
he took back all the shares.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,360
After he vanished,

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,360
who stands to gain the most?

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,640
If you've got nothing to say,
just keep quiet.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,160
Fine.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,880
Then let's keep it all hidden.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
I think,

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,720
right now,
the group's lost its chairman.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,040
Four major divisions
used to run on our own.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,280
The old man put Ma Rulong in charge.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,360
It wasn't really freedom.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,160
Now things are better.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
We mind our own business.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,640
Everyone lives their own life.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
Let's just stop getting involved.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,960
Gao Lin.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Let me make this clear for you.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,080
Jichun Group belongs to the Shao.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,720
You were all adopted.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Even if we split things up,

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,240
how it goes, or if it even happens,

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,040
that's my decision to make.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,880
Meiyin.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,960
What are you trying to say?

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,840
Dongsheng, why are you staring at me?

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
What's with that look?

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Don't think I don't see through you.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:49,960
Alright, that's enough.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,720
The Four Major Divisions of Jichun Group
are now independent.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
From now on,
everyone handles their own part.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,960
Handle gains and losses yourself.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
Happy now, Gao Lin?

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,720
Insightful.

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,600
If you can't take the heat,
don't lend it out.

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,640
We can't set this precedent.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
Shut it down right now.

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,680
Brother.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,440
How about this.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,840
I'll send someone to block him.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
Deal with him first.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,520
You want someone to block him?

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
Right.

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Come here.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Brother.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,240
Use your brain, got it?

54
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,920
Strike at the heart.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,680
Understand?

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,680
Strike...

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,880
Strike...

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
Got it.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,440
Got it?

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,240
Yes.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,960
You don't get it at all.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
Yeah.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,800
Honestly, I don't get it either.

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,360
Quite a show, you know.

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,480
Uncle Qin.

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,960
You'll be fine.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
I...

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm not doing so well.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,640
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,200
I know

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
my body best.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
Just...

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,760
two things...

74
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
that I really can't let go of.

75
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,480
One is

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,240
the Market,

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
the other is

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,400
my daughter.

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,480
Young man.

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,680
I still don't know your name.

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,400
Dajun.

82
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,600
Today,

83
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,680
thanks for your help.

84
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,920
Dad.

85
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,640
Dad.

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Dad.

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,240
What actually happened?

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Why are you in the hospital?

89
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,760
The reapers

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,600
are calling my name.

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,640
Don't say things like that.

92
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
Hong.

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm here, Uncle.

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm listening.

95
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,000
From now on,

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
the Market,

97
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,360
and Lan,

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,560
I'll need you to look after them.

99
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,960
What are you saying, Uncle?

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
The Market needs you here.

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,920
Lan,

102
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
from now on,

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,160
you...

104
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
you...

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,920
Uncle Qin.

106
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Dad.

107
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Dad.

108
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,880
Sister.

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,120
Go get the doctor.

110
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Dad.

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,560
Dad.

112
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Get the doctor!

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Sister.

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,880
Dad.

115
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Dad.

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,200
Dad.

117
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
Dad.

118
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,280
Call the doctor!

119
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Dad.

120
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Dad.

121
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
Dad.

122
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,360
Where are you sending this stuff?

123
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,480
Caiman, bro.

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,440
Here, have a smoke.

125
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,920
Caiman.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,920
Go back.

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,960
What's up, man?

128
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
The truck belongs to Stick Li.

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,920
Without Stick Li's word,

130
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
would I dare mess around here?

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,480
Go.

132
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Got it, sure thing.

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,960
Uncle Qin.

134
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,400
Why'd you leave so soon?

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm here to visit you.

136
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
What are you doing?

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Hey.

138
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't get physical, okay?

139
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
We need to respect the departed.

140
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,120
Don't start anything
in the funeral hall.

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm here today,

142
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
just to pass on a message to everyone.

143
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Caiman Market won't
get any more deliveries.

144
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,920
But of course,

145
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
there's still a way forward.

146
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,080
Hand the Market over to Stick Li.

147
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
Uncle Qin is gone after all.

148
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll handle the Market stuff now.

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
You?

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Uncle Qin put me in charge
before he left.

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll definitely find a way.

152
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
Protect the Market.

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,280
We need the Market to survive.

154
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,200
The Market won't be sold.

155
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,080
It's Uncle Qin's life's work.

156
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,160
We won't sell it.

157
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,200
And we won't let it fall.

158
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,120
Everyone, give me two days.

159
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,880
Alright?

160
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,920
Or else,

161
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
let's give him two days.

162
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,040
Alright.

163
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,560
[Loyalty]

164
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,360
Where did you get this?

165
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
It's a family heirloom.

166
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
Do you want to pawn it,

167
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
or to sell?

168
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,840
Which pays me more?

169
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,120
Selling, of course.

170
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Then I'll sell it.

171
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
How much can I get?

172
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,520
Fifty thousand?

173
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Dream on, man.

174
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,560
It's even a luck
if you get five hundred.

175
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,520
Are you selling or not?

176
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,480
Not selling.

177
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,160
Thanks anyway.

178
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,240
How do you sell the vanishing cream?

179
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,920
It's five.

180
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,960
Whoa.

181
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,920
Sorry about that, man.

182
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,760
No worries.

183
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,200
I really hate playing cards with you
these days.

184
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,040
Why's that?

185
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
You're way too messy when you play.

186
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Messy? Me?

187
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,840
You hide cards.

188
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
You think I'd cheat against you?

189
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,200
It's not the first time you've done it.

190
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,640
Where would I even hide them?

191
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,800
Is that your friend?

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No idea who that is.

193
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,840
Having a drink?

194
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
Who are you looking for?

195
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Hey.

196
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,920
Wait a sec.

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,280
What are you doing?

198
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,200
Just grabbing my thing.

199
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
Your thing?

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
What are you going to grab?

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,080
Who do you think
are you grinning at like that?

202
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:32,920
You.

203
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,400
Step back.

204
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,080
Get out.

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Get out.

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,040
Hello.

207
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,640
See? You gotta be polite.

208
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
That's just rules.

209
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,760
Wait, where are you going?

210
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,760
No, hey—

211
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:45,880
Sorry about that.

212
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,560
Come here, now.

213
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,360
Untie this for me.

214
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Hey.

215
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,680
Stand right there.

216
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,760
Have something, huh?

217
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
What do you do anyway?

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Huh?

219
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Thanks.

220
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,140
Hey.

221
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,780
Hey.

222
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,320
Whoa.

223
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,080
This...

224
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,480
No.

225
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,440
Bro,

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,280
find me a key.

227
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,600
He locked me up right here.

228
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm stuck just like you.

229
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,680
So what about...

230
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,520
I...

231
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,120
Not bad.

232
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm just here to grab something.

233
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,000
