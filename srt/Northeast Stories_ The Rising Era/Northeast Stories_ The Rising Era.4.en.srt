[Episode 4]

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm just here to grab something.

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,560
[Zhong]
How did you get this jade pendant?

5
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,880
Do you know where it came from?

6
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,200
Twenty years ago,

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
someone came across
an incredible piece of jade.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
It was the finest find
in several decades.

9
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,960
Even the best material,

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,440
without a skilled jade carver,

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,120
would still be wasted.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,440
So the owner
found the master, Long Wenxu,

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,440
and asked him to carve the jade
into four pendants.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,180
Loyalty,

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Filial Piety,

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,160
Benevolence,

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,840
and Righteousness.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,440
That means
there are another three pieces

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,200
like this one left.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,040
Who's the owner of that material?

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,960
A carver,

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,560
will just focus on the craft.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
They never ask where it came from.

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,880
So how do you know all this?

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,560
Because,

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,120
I'm Long Wenxu's apprentice.

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,680
And you?

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,640
Why are you selling this jade piece?

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,360
Some people need my help.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,000
How much

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,480
do you want for it?

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
A hundred thousand.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,800
That's too low.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Someone as loyal as you,

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,800
I won't take advantage

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,960
of you.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,960
This jade piece,

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,960
I'll just keep it here for now.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,160
When you pay back the money,

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,080
this piece of jade,

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,000
should be returned

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,080
to its original owner.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Thank you.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,920
I won't forget your kindness.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll pay you back.

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,560
So, what do you think?

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,560
No need to think.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Not for sale.

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Everyone, listen up.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Even though Caiman Market is run
by the Qin family,

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,160
whether business is good or not
is up to you.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
If we run out of stock,
what's the point?

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,240
Am I right?

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
My brother, Stick Li,

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,320
controls most of the city's transport.

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,640
He wants to take over the Market.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,040
Look,

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,560
he even changed your contracts.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,240
Just for you all
to make some real money.

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,360
You get what I mean?

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,680
Girl,

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
just sell it.

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,240
Good for you
to go back to school, right?

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
Why are you so timid?

65
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,040
Just letting people push you around?

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,920
Didn't we agree on two days?

67
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,040
It's been two days now.

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Where is he?

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
Am I wrong?

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Lan, we don't sign it.

71
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,280
These three trucks will be ours
from now on.

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,400
Jun.

73
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,480
I knew you'd show up.

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,760
Trying to act tough, huh?

75
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
Let's go.

76
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,880
[Agreement]

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,880
Heard what happened at Caiman Market?

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Isn't it about Uncle Qin passing away?

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,160
That was before.

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,200
Something big just happened.

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,600
Even someone like Stick Li,

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,600
got put in his place at Caiman Market.

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,360
Got humbled real fast.

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Who could pull that off,

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,040
finally dealt with the local bully?

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,040
I don't know.

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,440
I heard he's pretty skilled.

88
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
Can take on ten guys at once.

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,400
No way.

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Be careful, man.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,880
Yeah, right.

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Go on, keep going.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
Put the food...

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,800
right here.

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,400
Double-check for me.

96
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
If it's all good, sign here.

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,880
Hey.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Why are you taking my stuff?

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,280
Alright, alright, let's drop it.

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
Go on.

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm not fighting you for it.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,760
My name's Dajun.

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,920
What's your name?

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm Xiao.

105
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Xiao.

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
Want to have food every day?

107
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,360
We need someone to clean at our place.

108
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,600
Can you handle it?

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
It's six hundred

110
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,800
per month,

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,200
plus,

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,160
we'll cover your stay?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
No backing out later.

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
And don't do like this anymore, okay?

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,880
Let's promise each other.

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
You're really tough,

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,560
after all that.

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Do you know me?

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,440
What's my name?

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Your name?

121
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,480
Go ask the Reaper.

122
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
What are you doing?

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
Stop.

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,360
Or we'll call the cops.

125
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Fine.

126
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,720
Guess you're lucky this time.

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,480
My wife's been overseas for four years.

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
No sign of her, alive or not.

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,040
What am I supposed to do with my kid?

130
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,200
Ma Rulong really lost his memory?

131
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,600
No doubt about it.

132
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Interesting.

133
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,560
So...

134
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,840
Let's try something new.

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
What about my things?

136
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,240
As for overseas,

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
I've got people handling it.

138
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,040
Just wait for the update.
