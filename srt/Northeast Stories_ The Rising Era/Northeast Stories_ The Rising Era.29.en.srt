[Episode 11]

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,240
Why did you come back?

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm fine.

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,520
Lan.

6
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,240
Are you okay?

7
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm all right.

8
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Really, I'm okay.

9
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,960
Hey,

10
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
did you check on Lan?

11
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Lan already left.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
She got hurt too.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,360
If it wasn't for her,

14
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,920
you wouldn't have seen me again.

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
I rushed in at the door just now,

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,640
so I wasn't nice to her.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,080
I'll apologize to her later.

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,960
Right.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Thank you.

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,440
Lan is back.

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,840
All good?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Director.

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,040
You…

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,560
What happened here?

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,880
I took a fall.

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm alright.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,720
You always solve things.

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,320
All the coats arrived.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
What coats?

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,960
Weren't you the one who asked Mr. Guo?

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,760
Come on.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,080
Don't be shy about it.

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
He seems like a good guy.

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Treat him well.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,040
Anyway,

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll go check on the kids.

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
Thanks for the coats.

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
What happened to your face?

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
I fell down today.

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,760
It's fine.

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,200
So,

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll get going now.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Alright.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,200
Wait a sec.

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,960
Um.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,400
How about...

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,560
we...

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
grab a drink together?

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,920
Sure.

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
So,

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,840
where should we go?

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Go...

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
Is...

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Is your place alright?

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
My place?

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,400
If that's not okay...

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,000
No, it's fine.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Totally fine.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
So...

60
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,720
Let's go.

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,560
I'll get going first.

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,760
Jun...

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,080
Earlier, Ma Rulong

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,640
mentioned your family's stuff to me.

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Was he telling the truth or not?

66
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,680
Never mind.

67
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,560
It's not important.

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,840
You said you like me today, right?

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,920
Yeah.

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
Then let's be together.

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,280
Weren't we gonna have drinks?

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Let's have a drink.

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,360
Here.

74
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,840
Yes.

75
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
Pour me a little.

76
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,960
Sure.

77
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
Sorry about just now.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
It's all good.

79
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,960
Why did I say sorry?

80
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,160
No idea.

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,240
Bro.

82
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,880
All the equipment's set up.

83
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,680
You can have a look.

84
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
We'll open right on schedule?

85
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,360
No problem at all.

86
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
How's the adjustment going?

87
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
Not much to change.

88
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Just need to

89
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
swap out a few managers.

90
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,280
The other projects stay put.

91
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,280
Looks like

92
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,960
it's time to give them a wake-up call.

93
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,080
A wake-up call for what?

94
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Why are you back from the hospital?

95
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm fine now.

96
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
No point staying there.

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
Hong's just careful with money.

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
I call it living smart.

99
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,840
So

100
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,800
you didn't argue with the nurse, right?

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm not that petty.

102
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,880
I don't argue every time.

103
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,040
So, Hong is back now.

104
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,360
Jichun Entertainment Center...

105
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,240
You good with this?

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Of course.

107
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,760
I've rested long enough.

108
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,680
I need to stretch my legs.

109
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
What's going on today?

110
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
Caiman Entertainment Center
just opened too.

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,840
They're pulling away all our customers.

112
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
But it can't be
that not a single person came.

113
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,800
They brought in new audio equipment
from Guangzhou.

114
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,160
I heard the effect is incredible.

115
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,800
Plus, they launched a bunch of events.

116
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Like raffles and contests.

117
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,560
Send someone to blend
into Caiman Entertainment Center.

118
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,440
Find out what the events are going on
and what equipment they're using.

119
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,160
We can't miss

120
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,240
a single thing they have.

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,040
Got it.

122
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,120
Slow down.

123
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
Watch your step.

124
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Be careful.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,680
Hello.

126
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
I'm looking for Qin Lan.

127
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,880
Qin Lan?

128
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,160
She hasn't been here in ages.

129
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,960
Left already.

130
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,400
Where did she go?

131
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,400
Honestly, I'm not sure.

132
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,320
She's dating someone now.

133
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,960
No time for volunteering.

134
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
She's dating someone?

135
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah.

136
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,320
The guy's last name is Guo.

137
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,280
He's a big boss.

138
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,800
He always donates to us.

139
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,680
She never mentioned it to me.

140
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,440
It's fine.

141
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,880
That's not a big deal.

142
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,320
Director.

143
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
We're mainly here today for these.

144
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,960
I appreciate it.

145
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Thank you.

146
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,720
We'll head out now.

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Can I ask if you don't mind?

148
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,360
That Guo guy,

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,520
do you know his full name?

150
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
His full name?

151
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,040
I really don't know.

152
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,880
His company seems to be called

153
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
New Yongming.

154
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,440
Guo Chongjiang.
