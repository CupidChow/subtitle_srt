[Episode 23]

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Hello, Hong.

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,640
Why'd you call my number?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,800
It's Hong.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,880
Hey, Hong.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,520
Which hospital?

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,840
Huzi.

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,400
Hey, bro.

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,000
Which ward?

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,240
Ward 9.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Hong has already called the police.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,080
They've put out an alert citywide.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,320
He won't get away now.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,720
Shh.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
What happened to Lan?

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,920
Guo Chongjiang tied her up.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,240
Locked her in the room.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,760
When I found her,

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,040
Lan was completely worn out.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,200
There's one more thing.

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,760
What else?

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,880
Lan is pregnant.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,560
Bro, look!

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,240
Chongshan.

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
This is for you.

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,160
What do you mean by this?

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,480
Take this money.

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Find a place.

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,680
Start a small business.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
Why can't we go together?

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm already wanted by the police.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
There's no way out for me.

34
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,000
My situation,

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
needs an ending.

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm not leaving.

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,200
Listen to me.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,880
Your hands are still clean.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
That's why you have to go.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm not leaving.

41
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
If we go, we go together.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,640
Chongshan.

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,160
Come on.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Look at me.

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,840
Look at me.

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,880
Listen.

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
I've never begged anyone.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,040
But this time, I'm begging you.

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,040
Please, okay?

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,680
You go.

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,640
Go.

52
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Lan,

53
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,800
I know,

54
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,000
you've had a tough life.

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
You lost your mom at eight.

56
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,640
Uncle Qin raised you alone.

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
You,

58
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
you're stubborn,

59
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,840
and always want to prove yourself.

60
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
But the more
you want to prove yourself,

61
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,080
the more
life throws challenges at you.

62
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
In this life,

63
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
who hasn't taken a few wrong turns?

64
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,560
You're the only college grad
on Caiman Street.

65
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,200
You're always one of the best
at everything.

66
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
Remember back then,

67
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,680
when Jun lost his memory?

68
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,160
All I could think to do was
to find the medium,

69
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,520
but you instantly thought of

70
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,600
getting someone to get medicine.

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,640
Then when we started the company,

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,400
I couldn't help with much anymore,

73
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,200
but you always had ideas to share.

74
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
That's why things kept getting better
for us.

75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
You're way more capable than I am.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
From now on,

77
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,360
you don't have to try so hard
to prove ourselves.

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
I'll keep working hard,

79
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
and you just enjoy the good life.

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
It'll all work out.

81
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,400
The sun's already up.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,600
You've held on this long.

83
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,520
Let me take over for you.

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,400
No need, really.

85
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
Lan's awake.

86
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,640
She has something on her mind.

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
She doesn't want to face it.

88
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
She'll work through it in time.

89
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,520
What I worry about most now,

90
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,800
is the baby she's carrying.

91
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
If we hit a wall, just break through.

92
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
There's always a way out.

93
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,440
Help!

94
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
What's going on?

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
Guo Chongjiang.

96
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,960
Lan.

97
