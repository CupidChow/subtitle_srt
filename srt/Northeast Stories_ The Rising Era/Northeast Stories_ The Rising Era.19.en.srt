[Episode 1]

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,480
Ma Rulong.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,080
Liao Dongsheng is with me.

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,760
If you want to save him,

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
come alone to the warehouse
in the north of the city.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,880
He has nothing to do with us.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,160
That's true.

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,520
But he does.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,920
Ma Rulong.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,800
Play a game with me.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Guess who I am in fifteen seconds.

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,320
Six.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,440
Five.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,960
Four.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,160
Three.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,560
Two.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,800
Guo Chongjiang.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,600
[Six years ago]

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,680
Right.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,200
Watch out.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
It's all over the place.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,440
You were dropping stuff the whole way.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,960
Why are you only here now?

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,040
You're hours late, you know.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,000
I know.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
Traffic was insane on the way.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,720
Besides, it's tons of fake cement.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
There's no fake cement.

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
Listen, Liu Daneng,

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,800
just look at these.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,760
They better pay us more today.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,680
Seriously, it's freezing out here.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,040
We've been hiding for hours.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm numb from the cold already.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,200
Enough complaining.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,840
Get to work.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Finish up
and I'll treat you to barbecue.

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
If that's what you think...

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,040
If that's seriously what you think.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:09,920
Alright.

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Get to work.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,480
Come on, pick up the pace.

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Move.

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,560
Hurry up.

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,400
Who's there?

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,360
Stop it.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Enough.

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
Together with you?

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,360
What do you mean?

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,200
All of us

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,280
are together right here.

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,760
Who?

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Show yourself.

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,480
Your guy?

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
Vice President of Jichun, Ma Rulong.

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,720
Still working overtime at this hour?

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,800
You work so hard.

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
So, what now?

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,880
It's just one guy.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Take him down.

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,880
I can't do anything violent.

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Everyone, come over here.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,520
Ma Ru...

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,120
Mr. Ma.

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,960
Just a joke.

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
We're just joking.

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,560
It's all for fun.

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,880
Liu Daneng, squat down.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,640
Hands on your head.

71
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,720
Hands on your head first.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,240
Hands up.

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,320
Hold it there.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,360
Hold it there.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,320
Bro.

76
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,320
Can you just answer my questions?

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,880
Sure.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,080
It's all that fake cement Gao Lin got?

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,200
Yeah.

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,640
Mr. Gao gave the word.

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
A little fake, no one notices.

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680
Plus, it helps the company earn more.

83
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
Big brother.

84
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Next up...

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Find Gao Lin.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you scared of?

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
How about a kiss for me?

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,520
Come on, just one kiss.

89
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:17,960
No need to be afraid.

90
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,400
A real kiss.

91
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Mr. Gao, we're out of drinks.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
Out of drinks? Just ask.

93
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
We're out of liquor.

94
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,280
Manager.

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,760
Hello, what can I get you?

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,880
A bottle of Rémy Martin.

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,320
Sorry about that.

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,320
The last bottle

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
was ordered by another table.

100
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,520
My brother wants that.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
You don't know me?

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,760
I know you.

103
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,880
You're Gao Lin, VP of Jichun Group.

104
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
Who doesn't know that name?

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
At your service.

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,360
So you know who I am.

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Got any drinks here?

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Boss.

109
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
That's not...

110
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,200
I can work this out.

111
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,360
Yeah, I can handle it.

112
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
I'll work this out.

113
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
Let me have a check.

114
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,520
What's wrong, girl?

115
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
No need to be scared.

116
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,840
Why are you hiding?

117
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,680
My brother wouldn't trouble you.

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
Look how scared she is.

119
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Boss.

120
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,720
Your Rémy Martin.

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Tonight, you have to make me happy.

122
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,960
You can't leave until we have fun.

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
Don't sneak out halfway, all right?

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Okay.

125
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Don't you even think about it.

126
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,720
Happy.

127
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,560
Happy.

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,120
Have fun.

129
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Have fun.

130
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,440
Please.

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,480
Come on.

132
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,080
Come on.

133
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,680
Bottoms up.

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,200
No problem.

135
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,000
What's up with this drink?

136
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,280
No head, no tail.

137
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
And no source.

138
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Guo Chongjiang.

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
Are you making me drink piss?

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,800
Bottoms up.

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,760
Keeping some fish in your glass?

142
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,640
Come on.

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,960
Come on.

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,400
Come here.

145
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
What are you doing?

146
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Gao Lin.

147
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,560
Ma Rulong.

148
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Heard Jichun,

149
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
wants to compete with Yongming
for land?

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,920
The auction in the next round,

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
is what really matters.

152
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
We'll see.

153
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
I'll take you down.

154
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,680
Lin.

155
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,240
Don't get too cocky.

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,240
About the cement deal,

157
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,840
it's been exposed.

158
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Big brother.

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Does dad know?

160
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,080
Big brother.

161
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
Brother.

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Leave here.

163
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,200
Pack your stuff.

164
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,400
Leave Jichun.

165
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,440
Dad.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,080
I was really wrong.

167
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Dad.

168
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,320
The project hasn't started yet.

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Give Lin one more chance.

170
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,640
If we don't get news,

171
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,000
I won't send you to the warehouse.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Those cement bags,

173
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,440
wouldn't they be used soon?

174
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,760
Jichun Group.

175
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,000
Since it was founded,

176
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
we've always been careful.

177
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,960
Never did anything unfair.

178
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,240
But,

179
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,520
you crossed the line.

180
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,880
Jichun's been in real estate
less than 2 years.

181
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,880
On the outside,

182
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
Yongming is still a tough rival.

183
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,200
At the land auction next month,

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,080
if Jichun loses,

185
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,280
Yongming will always have us beat.

186
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,720
Gao Lin,

187
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,880
you chase small gains
and forget the big picture,

188
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,200
ignoring our company's future.

189
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
How can I keep you here?

190
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Dad,

191
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,560
what if I represent Jichun,

192
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
and win the land auction?

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
But what if you lose?

194
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Then I will leave with Lin.

195
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,760
Big brother.

196
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Alright.

197
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,680
Let's make a gentlemen's agreement,

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,280
here in front of everyone.

199
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,760
If you lose then,

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
don't blame me for this.

201
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,880
Family ties won't save you either.

202
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Thanks, dad.

203
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,280
Thanks, dad.

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,480
Brother...
