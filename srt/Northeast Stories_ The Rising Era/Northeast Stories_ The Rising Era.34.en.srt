00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
[Episode 16]

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
I honestly didn't expect this.

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
Turns out you're an amazing actuary.

5
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,480
You're too kind.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,760
Alright then.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,160
Since

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
you've already passed the test,

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,440
next up,

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,680
the plan

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,000
for New Jichun to go public,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
and the details of our cooperation,

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,960
we can discuss all that now.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,720
Here's my initial plan.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,160
I...

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,840
No need to explain to me.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Actually, I'm not

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,640
the Chief Executive Officer
of Yidu Huashang.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Was it because

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,640
of that room card you saw?

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,680
Then you thought I was someone else.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,760
To be honest with you,

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,200
I came to Northeast this time

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,760
for an old friend,

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
to visit his granddaughter.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Ma Rulong.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,720
Feng Yue.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,160
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
Why can't I be here?

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,080
CEO of Yidu Huashang?

31
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Yeah.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,880
What else did you expect?

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,960
You know, you're really

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
hard to figure out.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
But don't all you guys

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,680
like mysterious women?

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Come on, tell me,

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,520
what's your real plan

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,360
with all of this?

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,480
Honestly, the whole thing,

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm just an underling here.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,360
What happened in Guangzhou,

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
my grandpa told my uncle about it.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,040
My uncle came to Northeast
for business.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,200
He had to visit me for a couple days.

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
That's when you volunteered.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
So he wanted to give you a shot.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,680
If you get the land,

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
it'll be good for the company.

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,080
If you don't,

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,960
it's no big deal.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,560
So,

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
about the promise,

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
to help New Jichun go public,

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,480
does that still stand?

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Of course it does.

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,440
But I don't want the land.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,080
I

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,600
want

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,160
you.

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
What do you mean?

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,640
I want you to be my boyfriend.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,360
Huh?

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
I can't do that.

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm already in a relationship.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Since when?

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
You never mentioned it.

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
I'm telling you now, aren't I?

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,000
Her name is Chen Hong.

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
Alright.

71
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,880
Let me meet her then.

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,360
No, wait.

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
We're talking business here.

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
It's just a partnership, right?

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,080
It has nothing to do with her.

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,000
Why do you want to see her?

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,600
Fine.

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,200
So we're negotiating, right?

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,200
If you want me
to help your company go public,

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,320
I have to meet Chen Hong myself.

81
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,280
Is it that serious now?

82
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,680
See, I told you.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
You just can't figure it out.

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
You're teasing me again.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
Don't joke around like that.

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Three tomorrow afternoon.

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,240
Right here.

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Chen Hong.

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
See you.

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,360
Bro, you really agreed to her?

91
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,320
What else could I do?

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Oh no.

93
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Are you out of your mind?

94
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Neither the tycoons

95
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,520
nor street thugs can stop Long,

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
but a girl in her twenties got you.

97
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,880
Are you mocking me now?

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:27,960
Bro.

99
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,400
Have you heard that old saying?

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
What?

101
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,840
Only women and something I forgot
are hard to handle.

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,320
What does that mean?

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
Means even one woman is tough
to deal with.

104
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Look at you, handling two at once.

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Look at your smile.

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Is that what it means?

107
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
Hey, I didn't make that up.

108
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,160
That's what the old people said.

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,080
Alright, stop messing with me.

110
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Help me figure this out.

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
How do I invite Hong?

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,880
I'm serious.

113
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't look at me for this.

114
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,200
It's about feelings.

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,240
Asking me is like asking your knee.

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Let me take a look at "my knee".

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,240
Anyway,

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,040
it's settled.

119
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
I'll just ask her straight up.

120
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,280
Are you sure?

121
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,680
Yeah, I am.

122
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Are you out of your mind?

123
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
That's basically "Game Over".

124
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,960
Hong.

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
When are you marrying
my big brother?

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,440
We're not there yet.

127
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,560
Wait, don't tell me

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,960
nothing happened between you two
until now.

129
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
Not exactly.

130
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,840
So if you've already slept together,

131
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,520
why not just get married?

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,720
We didn't sleep.

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
We just

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
had a kiss.

135
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
A kiss.

136
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,960
Yeah.

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,880
It's modern times now,

138
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,840
and you two only kissed?

139
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,560
If...

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
If things move too fast,

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
even we won't be able to handle it.

142
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
I can totally tell.

143
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
You and my brother are both
so passive.

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,000
Honestly, that won't work out.

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,240
Your relationship is moving
way too slow.

146
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,400
There's no spark at all.

147
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,760
Seriously?

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
What do you mean?

149
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,600
So what should I do?

150
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,680
If he won't make a move, you should.

151
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,760
You have to create the moments.

152
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,960
Just the two of you, alone.

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
I know, I know.

154
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
I've taken him
out for braised pork bones.

155
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,600
We've shared some Baijiu.

156
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
We've gone grocery shopping
together.

157
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,080
That's all?

158
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Yeah.

159
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
So you two never watch movies
together?

160
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,400
Right?

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,760
Go out for some western cuisine
or something.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
You have to be romantic.

163
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Oh my gosh.

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,600
Aren't you my Love Guru?

165
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,040
Right?

166
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,280
Trust me on this, you can't go wrong.

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
Wish I'd met you sooner.

168
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,440
Exactly.

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Let me tell you...

170
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,120
The chance,

171
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,760
is right here.

172
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,920
I want to take you somewhere
tomorrow.

173
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,840
What?

174
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,560
Tomorrow I

175
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,880
want to take you

176
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,080
out for a bit.

177
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,400
You,

178
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,120
me,

179
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,320
just the two of us, strolling around?

180
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,640
Yeah.

181
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,920
Sound good?

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
So, I...

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

184
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,360
Okay?

185
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm heading out.

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Got it.

187
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,160
Got it.

188
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,360
Thanks.

189
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,480
Cheers.

190
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,360
Cheers.

191
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
There's someone there.

192
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,120
Yeah, right here.

193
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,200
Let me introduce you.

194
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
This is Yidu Huashang's

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,440
Chief Executive Officer,

196
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,160
Feng Yue.

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,600
And this is...

198
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Chen Hong.

199
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Hey.

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
Go sit over there.

201
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,200
Step outside.

202
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,760
Enjoy.

203
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
You're quite different

204
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
from what I thought, you know.

205
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,560
How am I different?

206
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,280
I always thought he'd

207
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,080
go for someone sweet,

208
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,680
gentle, with a soft vibe.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,600
So what?

210
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,080
You saying I'm basic?

211
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,840
What I mean is,
[*Spoken in Cantonese]

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,680
you're not a match for him.

213
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
Didn't get the first part,

214
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,120
but for the rest,

215
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
let me tell you,

216
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,040
I am good enough.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
But are you?
