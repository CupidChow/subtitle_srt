[Episode 18]

3
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,040
Bro.

4
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,280
What happened?

5
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,480
Oh my gosh,

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,520
San Hu, call the police.

7
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,160
Trying to catch me?

8
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,560
Don't even think about messing with me.

9
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,480
That depends if you have the ability.

10
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,120
Sis.

11
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,920
Sis.

12
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,920
Don't worry.

13
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
The police have
started their investigation.

14
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,000
There'll be news soon.

15
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Jun.

16
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,480
Are you sure
she's safe on the way?

17
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,040
Don't worry.

18
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,840
Everything's been taken care of.

19
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,520
Sister.

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
You guys be careful too.

21
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160
Don't worry.

22
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,080
With San Hu here,

23
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
I'll get it done for sure.

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
Alright, I'm heading out.

25
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
Come visit me in Guangdong.

26
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
Deal.
[*Spoken in Cantonese]

27
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,560
Am I right?

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,600
Of course.

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,720
You,

30
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,880
don't pick on my sister.

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,600
Did you hear me?

32
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,640
Me, pick on her?

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Did I ever do that to you?

34
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,560
See what I mean?

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,840
Alright.

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,080
San Hu.

37
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,600
Hey.

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
Be careful on the road, okay?

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,080
Don't worry about me.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,640
So...

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
Let's find some time to visit Qin Lan.

42
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,600
You're worried about her too, right?

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,840
It's nothing.

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
If she wants to marry, let her.

45
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,040
It's just because of Guo Chongjiang.

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,640
That's reason.

47
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,400
Alright.

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
I get it.

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,200
I'll think of something.

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,240
Maybe I can talk her out of it.

51
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,760
Let's go.

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Congrats, you're pregnant.

53
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm going to be a mom.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,320
Yeah.

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,360
You need to watch your diet now.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,560
And keep the house temperature steady.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,440
You know how it is in the Northeast.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,000
The wind outside cuts like a knife.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,280
And the heated bed's like an oven.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,800
Where's your husband?

61
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Why did you come here alone?

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
We're getting married next month.

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,600
He doesn't know yet.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,440
You two are really open-minded.

65
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,280
Alright.

66
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
You can head home now.

67
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,280
Share the news with your fiancé.

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
Let him have some good news.

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,320
Right.

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,560
Um...

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,880
Doctor.

72
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
May I borrow your phone?

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,720
Go ahead.

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Thanks.

75
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,640
How should I tell him?

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Oh.

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Lately, I don't know why,

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,840
sometimes I crave spicy food,

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,240
sometimes I want something sour.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,160
Are you alright?

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,520
Feeling sick?

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
No, I'm fine.

83
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,480
Maybe it's because of...

84
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
this.

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,320
Here, take a look.

86
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,960
Guess who's gonna be a dad?

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,760
Lan.

88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm home.

89
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,280
Why are the lights off?

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,520
Hello, Mr. Guo.

91
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Do you know what you're doing?

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah, I know.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Go on, say it.

94
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,760
What do you want?

95
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,160
I've done so much dirty work for you.

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,800
What do you think I want?

97
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,600
Your wife's address.

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,000
Friends overseas are still looking.

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
I want the address now.

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,320
Write it down.

101
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Okay.

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,800
I'll write it for you.

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,040
I'll do it for you right now.

104
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Come on.

105
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Right here.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,120
Yeah, right here.

107
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
Let me help you, right?

108
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,200
Let me help you.

109
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
Come on, get up.

110
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,960
I won't touch you.

111
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,800
Alright?

112
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,000
I won't touch you.

113
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
It's okay now.

114
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,640
It's alright.

115
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,320
Look.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Alright?

117
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Okay, I won't touch you.

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,960
I won't touch you.

119
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,040
