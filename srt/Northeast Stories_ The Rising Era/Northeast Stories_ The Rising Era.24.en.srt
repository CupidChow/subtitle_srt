[Episode 6]

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,520
Is this enough for 1.2 million?

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,960
There's only a half.

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Let me see the person first.

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,920
Alive.

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,400
The other half

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,080
you'll get every penny, no short.

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,720
See them?

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,200
They're all alive.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,160
Go on.

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,480
Where's the money?

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,480
If I tell you, will you let them go?

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,120
You tell me, and I'll let them go.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
Hong, you can't say a word.

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,200
Shut up.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,000
Say it.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Come over here.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,240
Speak up, don't be shy.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,920
It's alright.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,600
Where you caught me.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Be more specific.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,600
That little room,

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,680
an old guard booth.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
Watch closely.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
Got it, bro.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Behave yourself.

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,040
You dare trick me.

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
Is my watch broken?

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
Why isn't Boss back yet?

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,200
No idea.

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,240
Hey.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,680
What?

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
I need the bathroom.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,240
Just go here if you need to.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,120
No one's watching you.

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,200
Isn't this a bit much?

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you so slow?

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,080
How about this.

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
How about you help me up?

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,280
I've been kneeling so long,
my legs are numb.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,800
Caught you grabbing sand.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
You really think I can't see it?

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,080
Hurry! Run!

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,000
Get back here!

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Untie their hands.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Right.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm doing now.

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm doing.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,920
Hurry up.

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,640
Quickly.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,360
Quickly.

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,560
Jun!

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Police!

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,880
Don't move!

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Get down!

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,960
Hands on your head.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,670
[Long Bo was arrested for intentionally
causing serious injury,]

59
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,930
[and committing crimes
such as kidnapping and extortion.]

60
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,320
[He will be held criminally responsible
according to the law.]

61
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,960
Mr. Ma.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
Already made up your mind?

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,160
If I take this deal,

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,840
four hundred thousand turns to two.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,840
You once saved my life.

66
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,760
Even let me cover the extra two hundred.

67
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,440
I would love to.

68
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
I believe

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,240
with the raw materials factory
in your hands,

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
you can run it even better.

71
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,240
Mr. Ma,

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,240
I have one more favor to ask.

73
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,800
It's about the workers.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,440
They've been with me for years.

75
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,360
Since I got hooked on gambling,

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,560
I've been out of it every day.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
Their wages,

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,600
I've only managed to pay them
on and off.

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,800
After you take over the factory,

80
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,440
can you not fire them?

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,400
I can't promise that.

82
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't know production.

83
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,360
I need pros to handle it.

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,240
So,

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
I've actually got an idea.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
It could solve your problem.

87
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,040
Mr. Ma, stop keeping me guessing.

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
As long as they can stay,

89
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll do whatever you ask, Mr. Ma.

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,760
Aren't you close with them?

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,880
You manage them then.

92
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
I'll hire you as Factory Director.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,880
Forget what I said

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,800
if you let the tears fall.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Mr. Ma,

96
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
you're honestly a good person.

97
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,120
I'll take it.

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,160
Come on.

99
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,160
Do your best.

100
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,360
Mr. Wang,

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
I don't know

102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
why the parts factory,

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
won't take our orders anymore.

104
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
Maybe they're working with others?

105
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,800
No, it can't be.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
The guard said,

107
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,560
the factory,

108
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,120
hasn't even started the machines.

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Right now, our only option,

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,360
is to look at the staff.

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,240
Let's hold off on staff bonuses,

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,000
and not pay them for now.

113
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,200
Once the sales of the new car pick up,

114
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,960
we'll make it up to them.

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
So,

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,560
you handle this for me.

117
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
I'll give your bonus separately.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,640
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,280
Go ahead.

120
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
Mr. Hong,

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
the manager wants to see you.

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,120
About our new model truck,

123
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,840
it's about to go into production.

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,320
But because of the parts,

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
the cost just won't go down.

126
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
News about it

127
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160
has already been released.

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,640
The company cares about its reputation,

129
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,760
so the price

130
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
can't be changed now.

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,440
At a time like this,

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm thinking us longtime staff,

133
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
maybe we should step up,

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,320
show some self-sacrifice.

135
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Manager,

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
are you saying we won't be paid?

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,480
No, that's not it.

138
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,400
But the bonus we talked about before,

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
it's not happening now.

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,160
What?

141
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Why can't you get it all of a sudden?

142
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,440
How many years have you worked
for the company?

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,080
Would they even have that engine
without you?

144
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Dad, I won't study abroad then.

145
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Don't worry, girl.

146
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll do whatever it takes for your fee.

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,160
Even I have to borrow money,

148
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
I'll make sure you have enough.

149
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,520
Go open the door.

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,280
Hello.

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,000
You must be Mr. Hong?

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,560
Yes, that's right.

153
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,200
And you are?

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,680
Ma Rulong from Caiman Group.

155
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,480
Nice to meet you.

156
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,280
Please, come in.

157
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:02,920
Thanks.

158
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
I'll get straight to the point.

159
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,440
I want you at Caiman Group.

160
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Are you serious right now?

161
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
I'm not kidding.

162
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,080
Honestly,

163
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,640
I really want to build engines.

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,040
We're making engines now,

165
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
but cars are next on my list.

166
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,080
And other vehicles.

167
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,280
You're the engine expert here.

168
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,920
The core of the team.

169
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,000
So,

170
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,520
I want to offer you five times your pay,

171
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,520
plus some shares.

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,560
How does that sound?

173
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
Let me think it over.

174
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,120
Thanks.

175
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,360
Here's some water.

176
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,720
Thank you.

177
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,760
Besides,

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,680
Mr. Hong,

179
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,920
I heard...

180
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,640
that your daughter's leaving
to study soon, right?

181
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,680
Here's some money.

182
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,720
Hope it comes in handy.

183
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,680
It's two hundred thousand.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
That should be enough, right?

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,040
I really can't accept this.

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,560
I just can't take it.

187
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
Please, don't say no just yet.

188
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,280
How about this.

189
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
If you don't want to work at Caiman,

190
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,400
consider this a loan from me.

191
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,040
Pay me back when you can.

192
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,280
If you do want to join us,

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
think of it as an advance on your pay.

194
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,720
When can I start to work?

195
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,120
Mr. Hong,

196
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
making engines,

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
you really are the expert.

198
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Here, in this factory,

199
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
you'll have the final say.

200
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
What about the parts?

201
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,040
Don't worry.

202
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,880
I've already bought

203
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,160
all the related parts factories.

204
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,920
Once the blueprints arrive,

205
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
we can start work right away.

206
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
The engine is the heart of a car,

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,320
but the overall design

208
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,440
can't be overlooked.

209
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,840
I've hired the right experts.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
They'll be here tomorrow.

211
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
What about the workers?

212
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
Mr. Hong.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Hello.

214
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
Everyone.

215
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,520
Mr. Wang.

216
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,960
Mr. Hong...

217
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
was poached...

218
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,920
by Caiman Group.

219
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,520
You mean...

220
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,840
Mr. Hong from engine development?

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,640
So, is there a way

222
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
to stop Caiman

223
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,440
from building their own engine?

224
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,880
I've got an idea.

225
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,560
Really, I do.

226
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,480
Mr. Wang, I have a plan.

227
