00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,280
Ms. Shao.

But he's not here.

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,920
He's the Acting Chair now.

Let me think about it.

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,680
Is something wrong with the Chairman?

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280

The old man is in critical condition.

Ma Rulong.

25

No one at the Welfare Home
taught you manners, huh?

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
My dad,

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080

Who do you think you are?

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,680
What gives you the right to sit here?

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Do you really think,

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
being an adopted son
makes you real family?

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,560
You,

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,680
