[Episode 2]

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,440
Dad.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,760
Why are you yelling?

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm not gone yet.

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,360
I can hear you.

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,080
I brought you something.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,640
Your favorite Xinyang tea.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Please enjoy.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,480
Stand up.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
Heard you caused trouble again.

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,560
No, I didn't.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,480
Look at yourself now.

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,280
Drinking,

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,320
getting into fights,

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,720
and throwing money away.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
Have you done anything right?

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
You're my only son.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,200
One day,

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,680
you're supposed to take over from me.

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
But look at yourself now,

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,080
how can I trust you with the company?

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,080
If I'd known you'd turn out like this,

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
maybe I should've done
like Shao Wuyang,

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
adopted some kids instead.

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,040
At least one would've made me proud.

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,480
Tomorrow, head to the site.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,080
Go learn something.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,560
What are you still staring at?

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,320
Get moving.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
I can tell why
big brother is a nice person.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
Every time that chubby messes up,

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,800
he just throws himself into it too.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,240
Guess that's what makes him big brother.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,840
Hey, you,

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,600
do you think
I could ever be big brother?

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
You?

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,280
Why not run a few laps with him?

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,960
Me?

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,400
You know what, just forget it.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,760
Anyway,

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,080
Yongming is a real big shot.

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,200
I've thought about it for ages,

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
but still have no idea how
to deal with them.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Don't stress.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,400
Look,

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
our brother just keeps running around,

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,280
what does that tell you?

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
He's planning something sneaky.

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,560
What do you mean?

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,840
What do I mean?

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,400
That's why you're the third.

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah? I thought you were the fourth.

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
Send this to my dad right now.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,760
Let's go.

56
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,960
Karaoke.

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,440
Mr. Ma.

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,560
About that cement,

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,160
it's already destroyed.

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Not a bit left.

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,680
We can't sell it.

62
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,840
Selling that wouldn't be right.

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
It's about to be destroyed.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
As soon as possible.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,920
Sell it.

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,360
Sell all of it.

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,680
If you'd said sell earlier, Mr. Ma,

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
we would've sold it ages ago.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,240
It would've sold fast.

70
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Gone the second it hit the market.

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Mr. Ma,

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
who would we sell it to?

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Hurry up, hurry!

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,920
Keep going.

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,400
Come on.

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Hey, you're so big,

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,120
how can't you blow it over?

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,480
Come on!

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
Yours.

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Go on.

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Sir,

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
someone's here to see you.

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Alright.

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Hurry up.

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Come on in.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,200
Keep playing.

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah, keep playing.

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,640
Mr. Guo.

89
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,360
Do I know you?

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,840
Here's the thing.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
I used to supply materials

92
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
to Yongming before.

93
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,000
Of course you don't know me.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
But I know who you are.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,280
So, what brings you here?

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,440
Actually, I do need your help.

97
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,520
Well,

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,040
Mr. Guo.

99
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,040
Here's the thing.

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,960
I actually,

101
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,440
opened a small cement factory.

102
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
It's not a big brand,

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
but the production ramped up,

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
I just couldn't sell it all.

105
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,640
So I figured,

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
maybe I should sell cheap.

107
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,880
That's why I came to you.

108
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Cheap price,

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,800
how cheap are we talking?

110
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,680
Half price.

111
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,400
But, but...,

112
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,200
even at half price,

113
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,480
the quantity is pretty big.

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
I did think about...

115
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
Jichun,

116
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,240
but then I realized,

117
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,960
in our city,

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,520
Jichun can't match Yongming's strength.

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, here I am, found you.

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,960
You're not wrong about that.

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,760
Just a small brand for now.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
But once you work with Yongming,

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,960
you'll be a big name soon.

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah, that's true.

125
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Exactly.

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,040
So, so...

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,200
You're giving me this chance?

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Alright.

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,400
I'll take them all.

130
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,960
Oh,

131
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,160
Mr. Guo.

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,480
Thank you so much.

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Let me drink a few more with you.

134
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
I don't drink alcohol.

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Then, then...

136
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,320
How about blowing up balloons?

137
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,360
Can you do that?

138
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,760
Of course I can.

139
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,560
Of course.

140
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:16,800
Come on.

141
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,440
Together.

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,160
I, I...

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,560
I'll do two.

144
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,920
Alright.

145
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,280
Come on.

146
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Come on.

147
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,640
You have money too.

148
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,360
You have money too.

149
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,840
Hurry up.

150
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,320
Hurry up.

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,160
Come on.

152
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,400
Quick.

153
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:26,980
Faster.

154
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,640
You three, come on.

155
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:27,960
Hurry.

156
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
This one's from abroad.

157
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,680
The work's really detailed.

158
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,520
Super straight.

159
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Big brother,

160
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,360
what are you thinking about?

161
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,680
About getting that land parcel
from Yongming?

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,320
Leak the news about the fake cement.

163
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,880
Brother,

164
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,000
about what happened last time,

165
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,560
I haven't done it again.

166
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Big brother.

167
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
According to an anonymous tip,

168
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,920
Yongming Group is suspected

169
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,240
of using substandard products
during construction.

170
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,760
The case is still under investigation.

171
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,040
Yongming Group hasn't responded yet.

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,280
You all made your decision.

173
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,320
We've all talked it through.

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,200
We want out of Yongming Group.

175
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,440
We're withdrawing our shares.

176
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,920
Yongming isn't just mine.

177
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Everyone,

178
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
you're all original members
of the company.

179
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
Have you ever thought about this,

180
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,200
if everyone pulls out the shares,

181
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,880
the company will be gone.

182
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,960
This is where things stand now.

183
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,560
Yongming Group has no way back.

184
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,440
By then,

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
it'll be too late to run.

186
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
All these years,

187
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,200
the company

188
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
has survived a lot already.

189
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
Don't you want to

190
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,960
take one more shot?

191
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Guo Yongming,

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,720
let's face the facts.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,120
About the substandard cement,
