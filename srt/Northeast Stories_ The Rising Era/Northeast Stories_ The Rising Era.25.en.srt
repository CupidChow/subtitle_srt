[Episode 7]

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,760
Here you are.

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,440
Make sure this is done right.

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,160
This doesn't look right.

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Is Hong Liang here?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Yeah, it's me.

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,360
Hello.

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,160
Hello.

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,440
You've violated some rules

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,520
of Jichun Construction.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,680
So they're suing you.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,000
Before the arbitral award comes out,

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
you're not allowed to work

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,840
in any job related
to the automotive industry.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,920
Here's the report.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,720
Take a look.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,880
So Wang Bin did this on purpose.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Once Mr. Hong left,

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,960
the whole factory shut down.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,120
So what do we do now?

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
Should we just report him too?

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
Mr. Hong didn't sign a non-compete.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
That wouldn't make sense.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,000
Jichun Manufacturing's goal

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,960
isn't to win this lawsuit,

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,000
but to stall for time.

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,960
Our focus is the VAM.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm heading to the factory first,

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
to calm down the workers.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
I'll go with you.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,320
Yeah.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,560
Jun,

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,280
Hong, I...,

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,120
Wait a second,

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,600
there's something important.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
We'll be back soon.

[Letter of Resignation]

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
Any updates from Ma Rulong?

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,160
These past three months,

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
I had people watch his factory.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,680
Not a single person was working there.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
You couldn't even hear the machines
running.

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,000
If we pull this off this time,

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,480
I'll make sure you get a bonus.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,320
please welcome our Chairman,

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,360
Mr. Wang Bin,

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,480
to the stage.

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
This is Jichun Manufacturing's

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
first press conference since the split.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,720
My business goal is
to build the market's

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,240
best value-for-money trucks.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,400
This will be a highlight as well,

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,560
showcasing both price and performance,

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,320
which surely will meet,

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,440
what buyers and drivers expect.

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
What Mr. Wang said proves even more,

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,280
our confidence in these products.

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,000
So, Mr. Wang,

61
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,120
can you estimate the sales for us?

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Don't ask me about sales numbers.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,720
There's only one thing I can promise.

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,880
We'll definitely lead the market.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
That's not a sure thing, is it?

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Ma Rulong.

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,400
I was about to look for you.

68
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Keeping your word,

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,120
is the top rule in business.

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,160
Alright.

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Then today's the day to settle the VAM.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480
This agreement,

73
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,560
was signed by Jichun Manufacturing,

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,880
and Caiman Group.

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
Here's what it says.

76
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,840
If Ma Rulong builds an engine
in three months,

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
I'll hand over Jichun Manufacturing
to him.

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,080
But if you can't make it,

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,680
then you give up Jichun Trading,

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
and Jichun Construction.

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,800
Now Caiman Group's in trouble.

82
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,440
Build an engine in three months,

83
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
isn't that just crazy?

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah, it's nearly impossible.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
If you can beat me,

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,560
I'll quit on my own.

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,280
Everyone here can witness it.

88
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
So, where's your engine?

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,720
Well then,

90
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,200
let's all head over, please.

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Where is it?

92
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,040
Listen.

93
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
Didn't you say the factory never ran?

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,760
It really hasn't run.

95
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,920
You broke the agreement.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,040
That's against the rules.

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,200
How did I break the rules?

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,360
I never even set foot in the factory.

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,200
Then what's up with that engine?

100
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
Can't workers teach each other?

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
A bet's a bet, Wang Bin.

102
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,040
I don't need you to remind me.

103
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,840
I accept it.

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
But dad said I can only be a fighter.

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Why can't I be the big brother?

106
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,760
Because you want to win too badly.

107
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
You always try to prove yourself.

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,200
Which of us doesn't want to beat you?

109
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,080
Why are the rest of us just sidekicks?

110
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,040
It was my fault before.

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,360
I was too full of myself.

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,480
I always thought protecting family

113
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,480
meant taking on everything myself.

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Now I get what dad meant.

115
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,920
We're a family.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,960
Everyone has their own part to play.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Not to mention, we're the Group.

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
Don't flatter yourself too much.

119
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Take responsibility.

120
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,200
Protect the family.

121
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,280
Then let me ask you.

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,760
How did Dongsheng die?

123
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,280
I admit I lost this time.

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,960
But remember this.

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
I'll never forgive you.

126
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,400
Should we visit Lan?

127
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,240
Yes.

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
I was thinking the same.

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,520
It's been a while now.

130
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
I wonder how Lan is doing.

131
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,160
I always feel like as her sister,

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,400
I haven't taken good care of her.

133
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,960
Some of this is on me.

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,120
I've always treated her like a kid.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
Ever since I was young,

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
I've been clueless about this stuff.

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
I just can't handle it.

138
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Let me do it.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
I know Lan well.

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
She's always aced her studies.

141
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
She's a top performer in everything.

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,120
No way she'd just give up.

143
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll go talk to her.

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,160
Once we clear the air, it'll be fine.

145
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

146
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't worry.

147
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,240
Mr. Guo, have a drink.

148
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,680
Just one with us.

149
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,640
Come on.

150
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,680
Drinking alone is boring.

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,200
Here.

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,440
Let's play a game.

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,400
Mr. Guo, what do you want to play?

154
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
What do I want to play?

155
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Let's try this one.

156
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Wanna play?

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
Yeah, let's do it.

158
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Alright.

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,760
You said that.

160
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Then let's play.

161
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
No matter how many you stab,

162
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,520
that's how many you keep.

163
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
I know how this works.

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,400
You know that?

165
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,120
I know it very well.

166
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Hey.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,320
That's not the way to do it.

168
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
You have to do it like this.

169
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,880
Put it right here.

170
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,120
Come on.

171
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,520
Hit it here.

172
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,000
Right here.

173
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,360
Wait, how to play like this?

174
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
How to play?

175
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Let me help you.

176
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,200
One.

177
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,760
Two.

178
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,320
Three.

179
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,440
Wait, wait.

180
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,880
If...

181
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,320
If I prick my hand,

182
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
wouldn't you feel bad too?

183
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,160
Right?

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,040
I'd feel terrible.

185
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,400
Get out.

186
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Sorry, really sorry.

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,560
I...

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,000
Sorry about that.
