3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,440
It's definitely Stick Li.

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,120
He loves playing dirty tricks.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,680
But this time, it's really not him.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,600
Then who else could it be?

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,760
This person knows me.

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
But I have no idea who he is.

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,640
Hong,

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,360
just tell me the truth.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
What truth are you talking about?

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200
What kind of riddle
are you two playing?

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,600
I can't understand a word.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,720
Me neither.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,360
I'll tell you.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,800
That night
when I came back with the goods,

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,320
I drove through a small forest.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,480
It was pitch black in there.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,160
He was dressed all in black too.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,720
I barely grazed him.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,880
I thought it was some little animal.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,440
Sis.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Did you hit Jun?

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,400
I didn't hit him.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,840
I just brushed past him.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,720
And you looked a mess back then.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,680
Who knows
how many people had grazed you.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,160
Then...

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,320
why didn't you take him
to the hospital right away?

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,360
He said it himself.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
He didn't want to go.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,040
Yeah.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,280
Of course I said that.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I don't remember a thing.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Whatever Hong says is correct.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,720
Are you trying to pin this on me?

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,520
Alright.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
So...

39
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,320
About this whole thing,

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,800
I honestly remember nothing.

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
But I feel like something's up here.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,120
Jun, you're scaring me now.

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,440
A stranger shows up
and wants to hurt you,

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,840
and you don't even know who he is.

next time?

Sis.

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Something just came to mind.

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,200
My dad once told me,

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,760
Aunt Liu, the seasoning vendor,

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,240
has her family remedy,

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
supposedly for head injuries.

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm thinking,

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,280
maybe Jun should try it.

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
Who knows, it might jog his memory.

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,120
Aunt Liu sells the seasoning.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,360
Does she make medicine too?

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,320
Probably messing with you.

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm planning

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
Maybe something bad

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,720
We could try a soul-calling ritual.

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,440
Sis, that's nonsense.

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
That's just feudal superstition.

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,920
But what if it actually works?

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,680

Now he's lost his memory.

So, is it still possible to light it?

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,160
You'll have to ask the master.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
The master said,

83
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
it can be lit,

84
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,880
but you know...

85
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680

No, it's not that.

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
The main issue is,

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,280
it takes too much spiritual energy.

92
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,000
You should really head home.

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,240
I have enough for school, for sure.

192
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,160
Just take it.

193
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,960
What's wrong?

194
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
You don't want the money?

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,680
Then I'll take it.

196
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,800
Alright.

197
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
I'll pay you back soon.

198
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm going to see my classmates now.

199
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
Jun, Hong.

200
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,440
Okay, sure.

201
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
Bye.

202
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,480
Um...

203
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
If so,

204
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,920
Hong,

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
can I borrow another ten grand
from you?

206
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
Wait, do they want interest?

207
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,880
No,

208
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
it's something about my stuff.

209
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Then I'll need some interest.

210
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Alright.

211
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
Borrow ten, pay back twenty.

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,360
No problem.

213
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,520
What do you mean?

214
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,120
You think I'm greedy, huh?

215
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,640
Huh?

216
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm just joking.

217
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,360
A man of his word.

218
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,680
Thanks, Brother Chao.

219
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,400
Dajun.

220
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Why'd you add an extra ten grand?

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,080
To be honest,

222
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm here because I need your help.

223
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,440
That extra ten grand,

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
is just a thank you for your effort.

225
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
Hope it's enough.

226
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,560
I'm still confused though.

227
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,480
Not gonna lie, this might sound funny,

228
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
but I had an accident a month ago.

229
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,280
I hurt my head pretty badly.

230
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,040
I don't even remember my name.

231
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,160
Why am I wearing
such an expensive jade pendant,

232
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I have no idea either.

233
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,400
So you want us to help figure out
who you are?

234
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,360
Yeah.

235
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,360
And,

236
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,040
I also,

237
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,840
need help finding someone.

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,640
I think he's connected to all this,

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
maybe even to the whole accident.

240
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
So this person,

241
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,080
any special features or something?

242
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,880
Yeah.

243
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,400
He's got a long scar on his face,

244
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,200
on the left side.

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,160
That makes it easy.

246
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
Give me three days.

247
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,080
This person,

248
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll find him for you.

249
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,360
Sound good, Brother Chao?

250
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
Why ask him?

251
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,320
Dajun,

252
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,960
I've got this handled.

253
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Alright.

254
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,280
Well,

255
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,840
I hope to hear good news from you.

256
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm off now.

257
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,480
Wait up.

258
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,880
Why leave so soon?

259
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,680
Look.

260
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
Since we're here,

261
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,000
let's have a drink.

262
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Shall we?

263
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,560
Yeah, why not?

264
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,480
Let's go.

265
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Brother Hong.

266
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Got some work to do.

267
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,120
A pair of twos.

268
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,000
Pass.

269
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,400
Pass.

270
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Seven.

271
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,560
I'll go.

272
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,880
Joker.

273
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,520
Brother Hong's here.

274
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,840
Bro,

275
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,960
the person you wanted me to find,

276
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,800
I found him.

277
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,160
The one with the scar, right?

278
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,960
Where is he?

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,880
Just inside.

280
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Show me around.

281
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,840
No problem.

282
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,080
Brother.

283
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,000
That's the guy.

284
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Hey, Zhuzi.

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,600
What's up...

286
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,080
