[Episode 9]

3
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,200
Did you eat yet?

4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,680
Will you leave again?

5
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,000
Do they look alike?

6
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah.

7
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,560
What do we even look like?

8
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,640
Like a couple.

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,640
So...

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,920
I'm not great at thank you speeches.

11
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,440
I'll just toast with water.

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,320
Thank you all.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,040
If we're talking gratitude,

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,880
all of us here,

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
should be thanking you.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,040
Without you,

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,720
the Market,

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,480
would've closed by now.

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,040
Let's toast.

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,760
Actually, I brought everyone here today,

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
because I have a few things to discuss.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,320
I want to hear your thoughts.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Go ahead.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Our Caiman Market,

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
this location we're in,

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,040
it's not bad, right?

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
There are lots of apartments nearby,

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,280
but why can't we attract more people?

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
A few years ago,

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,880
at this market,

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,680
we used to have a lot of customers.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,160
But in recent years,

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,360
new shopping malls and supermarkets
opened,

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,440
and more wealthy folks moved in,

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,360
so,

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
people just stopped coming
to our old market.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
I paid attention recently.

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,240
It was winter not long ago.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
The roads were all iced over.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,880
The older people,

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,760
carried bags of groceries home.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Going a long way isn't the problem,

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,520
what if they slip?

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
That's when it becomes serious.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,440
Exactly.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,360
So back then, I started thinking,

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
what if our market offered

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,600
a home delivery service?

49
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
How does it sound?

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,880
Yeah, that's a good idea.

51
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,040
Good idea.

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
It could definitely work.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,560
I like this idea.

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
We'll follow your lead.

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,760
Since you all trust me,

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,400
then,

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,360
allow me to raise a glass of water,

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,160
cheers!

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,760
Of course.

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,920
Cheers.

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
That's great.

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,040
What were you thinking

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
about this logistics business?

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
It's just getting started now.

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
We need to keep it moving.

66
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
Oh right.

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,680
I need to head out tomorrow.

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,960
Where are you going?

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
Got something big to handle.

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,520
What big thing?

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
Taking over Jichun, that's what.

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,040
What's Jichun anyway?

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
Nevermind.

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,640
Mainly just want to see Lan.

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
Alright then.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh, I forgot.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Lan told me before she left.

78
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,040
She said let her know
if I hear anything from you.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,160
I totally forgot.

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,440
You know, this market belongs to Lan.

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,880
We can't move forward
without her approval.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,600
Yeah, that's true.

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
No problem with that.

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Alright then.

85
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,960
Go to sleep now.

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah.

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,600
Wait, I just remembered.

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,440
What?

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Isn't Jichun a corporation?

90
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Yeah, that's right.

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Are you planning
to take over the corporation?

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
That's the idea.

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,120
How to take it over?

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,920
Hey, beauty.

95
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,160
Interested in buying some DVDs?

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,280
They're Chinese Hong Kong edition.

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,880
No, thanks.

98
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,960
No rush, don't go yet.

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,920
Chinese Taiwan edition.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Top quality stuff.

101
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not interested.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Thanks.

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
What do you mean?

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
I didn't even touch you.

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,360
It couldn't be me who dropped it.

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
If you didn't touch it, how did it fall?

107
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,240
Don't grab me.

108
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,920
Keep your voice down.

109
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,880
Just shut your mouth.

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,520
You...

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,240
Let go of me.

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
Am I being too nice to you?

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,120
Who do you think you are?

114
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Jun.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,440
Let me go, now.

116
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,240
Hurry up.

117
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,240
Just you wait.

118
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm calling the boss, just wait.

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
Did you get hurt?

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,760
Jun, why are you here?

121
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
To see you, of course.

122
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,440
Let's go, my treat.

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,840
Know any good spots nearby?

124
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
I do, I'll take you there.

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,560
Let's go.

126
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go.

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
The Market now...

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
is pretty much back to normal.

129
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
The delivery service
is running well too.

130
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,440
Hong is taking care of some of it.

131
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
That's pretty much the situation.

132
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,440
Jun,

133
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,880
I don't really get the market stuff.

134
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,240
I just follow your lead.

135
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
You trust me that much?

136
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,240
Yeah.

137
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,520
Alright then.

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Let's eat.

139
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,960
Why are you just sitting there?
Help yourself.

140
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,640
You're still growing.

141
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,360
You're still at the age

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,560
of fueling up and bulking up,
aren't you?

143
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Roasted corn and roasted sweet potato.

144
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,200
After eating these,

145
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,240
everyone's all smiles.

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Roasted sweet potato and roasted corn.

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
After eating these...

148
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,440
Bro.

149
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,160
Bro.

150
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,520
Bro, I give up.

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,680
Seriously, I'm convinced.

152
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,720
Really.

153
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm done with this life.

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,360
Bro.

155
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,960
What are you up to?

156
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,760
Take it easy.

157
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320
No need to fight you.

158
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Then you want some corn?

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Give me one.

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm here for business.

161
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
What kind of business?

162
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
Doing some trading.

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,920
What?

164
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
You want me to get that many clothes,

165
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
but where to find so many people?

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
They'll be here soon.

167
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,600
Boss.

168
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,240
Boss lady.

169
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,200
We're here to talk business.

170
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,160
Not here for shady stuff.

171
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,240
So keep it professional.

172
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,240
Got it, boss.

173
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,200
Those smokers, go outside.

174
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,360
I sell clothes here.

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Don't burn holes in them.

176
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,440
Go.

177
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,000
Alright, everyone's here.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,880
I have something to tell everyone.

179
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,840
Caiman Market is about
to start a company.

180
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,120
We're looking
to kick off a new business.

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
What kind of business?

182
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Delivery service.
Starts from Caiman Market,

183
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,560
and serves the people living nearby.

184
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,480
We'll deliver products to them.

185
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,080
So what would we do exactly?

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,200
Delivery guys.

187
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
If you want in, just sign up now.

188
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,840
There's a base salary.

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
The more you work, the more you earn.

190
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,120
You get a bonus for every order.

191
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
So, what do you think?

192
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,400
Are you in or not?

193

I'm in.

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,840
Count us in.

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
I told you already...

196
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,920
So...

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,960
Let's put on the same clothes.

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,240
One for everyone.

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,000
Come and get yours.

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
Take it yourself.

202
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,240
