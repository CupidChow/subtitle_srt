[Episode 16]

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Something's off.

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,240
Head back.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,240
Ma Rulong.

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,600
You two have guts.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,760
You really are bold.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,440
My neck lately,

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,600
feels uncomfortable.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
Can't really look up.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,520
Mind kneeling to talk to me?

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,840
I've told you before.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,320
This place is small,

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
what I say goes.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,960
And you still won't listen.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,880
I'm listening.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,040
Listening.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,960
Long.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,360
Business is easy to discuss.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,160
Easy to discuss?

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,640
Right.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,800
Don't you want to sign?

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,960
Come on, just sign it.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,040
I'll sell you steel from now on.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,600
Price goes up 50%.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,360
Go ahead.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,040
Long.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
Slowpoke.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,240
Bro.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,360
Long, Long.

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,120
Brother, it's just business.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
Long, nothing personal here.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,480
Really, doesn't have to be like this.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,360
Big brother.

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,920
Long.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,720
It's really not that serious.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,200
Long.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
Long, it's not that serious.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:49,960
Long.

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,720
Sign it.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,400
Come on, Long.

42
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,120
What do I want here?

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Turning on each other.

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,360
But look at now,

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,280
not a single one got hurt.

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
They won't make a move.

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,080
So give them a little push.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,320
You get what I mean?

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,040
Don't worry.

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
If this goes well,

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,320
I'll let the overseas team know,

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and add more people.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,480
Don't you want to find your wife sooner?

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,840
Got it.

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
What are you thinking?

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Just looking at the map.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,960
See, that's Shunlin Park,

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,200
and over here is Caiman Market.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
So why is this spot marked in red?

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,600
Sis,

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
this should be

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,640
industrial land.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,080
Here's the situation.

64
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,600
These two spots,

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
are what Dongsheng wanted most.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,480
This one's in the city center,

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,680
and this one's in the suburb.

68
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,920
Neither of them is cheap, right?

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,560
Yeah.

70
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
So, we want to buy?

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,800
I'd love to.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,480
But we only have enough money
for the suburb.

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,320
Now, my worry is,

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,600
even if
Dongsheng doesn't have much cash,

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,760
he could still go all in.

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,200
He might take out a bank loan,

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
then grab both parcels.

78
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
If that happens...

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,120
Let him drop one, problem solved.

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Thirsty?

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll get you some water.

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Mr. Liao.

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Hope you don't mind.

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
This loan is really huge.

85
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
You don't need that much
for one land parcel.

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
Who says I'm only buying one?

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
So, what brings you here today?

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,600
I need your help spreading a rumor.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
Just say some antiques were found.

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,600
Where exactly?

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,360
At the Daobei land parcel
about to be developed.

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,560
I remember that spot.

93
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,280
Aren't you and Jichun Construction
both after it?

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,000
I want them to back off.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Got it.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
If Jichun Construction sees risk
in developing,

97
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,720
they'll rethink it.

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,480
They might pull out of the competition.

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,000
Alright.

100
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,400
I'll do what I can for this.

101
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,520
But whether they believe me or not,

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,080
is really up to fate.

103
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Right. Tea instead, cheers.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
What are you doing, Huzi?

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,200
I can't find my car keys.

106
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
They're right here with me.

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Not too bad.

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,840
Is the job not simple enough for you?

109
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,880
I'll just drive it back myself.

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
Don't be like that,
then what am I supposed to do?

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
You're really no fun, you know.

112
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,520
I've got something for you to do.

113
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,800
Alright, this is my thing, Bro.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,440
Drive a bit slower.

115
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Seatbelt.

116
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Seatbelt.

117
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
Put it in first gear, Bro.

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,520
Yeah.

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,280
Shift left into first gear.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
You gotta drive sometimes, really.

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,080
Mr. Liao.

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,680
We just got some news.

123
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,400
Of the two land parcels
we planned to bid on,

124
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
one was found to have antiques.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,520
If antiques are really there,

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,560
that might cause major delays

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
to our development.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,920
Could even stop the whole project.

129
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,960
The bidding conference is tomorrow.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,400
Should we give up on that land parcel?

131
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
Let me think it over.

132
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Go handle your tasks for now.

133
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,680
Alright, Mr. Liao.

134
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,960
Hello, Mr. Ma.

135
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,280
May I ask you two questions?

136
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,880
As a newcomer to real estate,

137
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,040
does Caiman Group have any goals
for this bidding?

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
We're mainly here to learn.

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
But if we win good land, that's a bonus.

140
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
So, facing Jichun Construction,

141
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
you must have some confidence, right?

142
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,600
Let's see how things play out.

143
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,040
What about the funding issues?

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
With talk about antiques found,

145
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,720
do you feel any pressure this time?

146
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
And Ma Rulong, Jichun's former boss.

147
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
What's your opinion on him?

148
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Mr. Liao, could you answer, please?

149
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,000
Mr. Liao.

150
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,960
Could you give us a response?

151
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Say a few words for us.

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,200
Just a quick comment.

153
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,440
Mr. Ma.

154
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,800
Mr. Ma, could you say something?

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
Thank you to all our guests,

156
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,520
[Public Land Use Rights Auction]
for joining the auction event.

157
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Let's keep it brief,

158
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,720
and get straight to the point.

159
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,880
We have two land parcels today,

160
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,280
the east section and west section.

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,520
First, we'll auction the land parcel
in the east section.

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,600
Starting bid is one million.

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,600
One million.

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,880
One and a half.

165
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
Two million.

166
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,200
Two million.

167
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,120
This gentleman bids two million.

168
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Five million.

169
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,840
Five million.

170
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,600
Anyone want to raise the bid?

171
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,320
Five million, going once.

172
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
Five million, going twice.

173
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,160
Any more bids before we close?

174
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
Six million.

175
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,560

Seven million.

180
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,240
Jichun Group bids seven million.

181
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,880
Any higher offers?

182
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Seven million.

183
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,520
First call.

184
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,000

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,160
Sold.

189
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,080
Next up is the land parcel
in the west section.

190
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,960
Starting bid.

00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,400
