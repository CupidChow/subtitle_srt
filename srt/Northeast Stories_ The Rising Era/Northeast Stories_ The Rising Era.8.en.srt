[Episode 8]

3
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Bring me some good luck.

4
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Really, I need some luck.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,640
Dreams mean the opposite.

6
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,520
Seriously,
dreams are just the opposite.

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,120
That's how dreams work, right?

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Sorry about that.

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,520
Sir,

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,360
I totally forgot about you.

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,040
Have a seat.

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,360
So,

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,520
here's your favorite dish.

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't let it go cold.

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,000
About the car accident...

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,320
what really happened there?

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,080
It all happened so fast.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,880
I don't remember much.

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,360
Anything else seems abnormal?

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,880
No, nothing at all.

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,760
Everyone's here now.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,480
Let's talk about the company.

23
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,680
Our big brother just got back.

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Why are you in such a rush?

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
Now everyone's playing nice.

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
What are you getting at?

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,760
Am I wrong though?

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,240
It's for the company's benefit.

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,640
Sure, that's true.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,400
But shouldn't we set priorities here?

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,320
You guys really love pretending.

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
So what do you want, huh?

33
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,880
Gao Lin.

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Are you out of your mind?

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,680
You talk to me like that?

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
Are you just here to start trouble?

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,640
You two,

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
just cool it a bit.

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,360
Bin, stop picking on Lin.

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
Did I pick on him?

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Gao Lin.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,960
Did I?

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm asking you a question.

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,280
Are you looking for trouble?

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
Who are you yelling at?

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Can't you shut up for a second?

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,480
Why are you pretending with me?

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,360
Am I being too nice to you?

49
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Stop staring at me.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,720
What, am I your stepdad now?

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
Your so-called dad can't even talk.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,080
His photo's still right here.

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,640
If you don't eat, just get out.

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
Bro.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
Did you forget everything?

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
No, I didn't.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Then who am I?

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,400
You're...

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,360
Still pretending, huh?

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm your sister.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,960
The youngest one.

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
Didn't lose your memory?

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,440
Why did you hide that?

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Well, here's the thing.

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,160
I suddenly got into an accident.

66
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,120
Then somehow, I just came here.

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
I have no idea where this place is,

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,880
and who any of you are.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,840
I can't remember anything.

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,440
Shouldn't I hide that?

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Of course.

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,400
But you can't handle this alone.

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,680
Brother.

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,600
You have no idea
what the company is facing.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,920
You've been missing for three months.

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,480
That gave them time
to win more support.

77
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,600
The shareholders' meeting is
in two days.

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
They're going to come after you.

79
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,240
If their proposal gets approved,

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Jichun will fall apart.

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
Dad is watching.

82
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
He wouldn't want this to happen.

83
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,880
Bro,

84
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,760
this is the Notice to All Shareholders.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,200
Everything here says,

86
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,840
serious problems that will follow

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
once the company splits.

88
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,760
You're the Acting Chairman.

89
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,720
You have the veto power.

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Only if you sign,

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,920
can the proposal be stopped.

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,480
Bro,

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
I respect your choice.

94
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,400
Sign or not,

95
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,600
it's up to you.

96
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
Bro,

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
don't let Dad down.

98
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,400
Alright.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
Bro, do you still remember that place?

100
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
When we were kids,
you all trained there.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,840
I used to sneak peeks at you.

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,200
You practicing your moves.

103
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Was I any good?

104
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,240
You were, you were the best.

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,120
Come on.

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
Let's welcome the Chairman.

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,320
Let me get down to business first.

108
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
Three months ago,

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,480
Jichun Construction,

110
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,320
Manufacturing,

111
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,160
and Entertainment,

112
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
submitted a proposal for division.

113
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm sure you've all seen it.

114
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Before, the Chairman wasn't here,

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,480
but now he's back.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,520
Alright,

117
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,200
let's take a vote.

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,320
Okay.

119
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Ninety percent said yes.

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,600
Chairman.

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
You don't have any objections, right?

122
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,280
I,

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
I disagree.

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,760
I've got a document here.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
It needs to go to all shareholders.

126
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,000
Please take a look.

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,400
That's right.

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Everyone, check this document.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,080
In my opinion,

130
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,400
splitting up Jichun now

131
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
is not the best timing.

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,800
So I plan to use

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,800
the Chairman's veto power.

134
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
I veto it.

135
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Big brother,

136
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,040
you've already resigned.

137
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Why use your veto power now?

138
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
[Letter of Resignation - Ma Rulong]

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,440
You tampered with it.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,080
I have something
to announce to everyone.

141
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,400
Our former Acting Chairman,
Ma Rulong,

142
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,560
has lost his memory.

143
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,040
To keep the company running
smoothly,

144
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,960
he's made a decision,

145
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,840
and has chosen to step down.

146
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Since you're no longer
Acting Chairman,

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,680
and can't manage current business,

148
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,640
I suggest,

149
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,360
that let's split Ma Rulong's shares
and projects

150
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,920
among the Four Major Divisions,

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
and have their heads handle them.

152
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,640
If you agree, raise your hand.

153
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,160
Alright then,

154
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
you can start now.

155
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,560
Go ahead.

156
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
You're busy.

157
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm leaving now.

158
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,280
Ma Rulong,

159
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm actually Shao Wuyang's
real daughter.

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,600
Why is it that
ever since he adopted you,

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,680
he's put all his attention,

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,120
and spent all his time caring for you?

163
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,160
You took my everything.

164
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Well, look at you now,

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
you've lost everything too.

166
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,600
Your stuff's all packed up for you.

167
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,080
Now get out.

168
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,840
Thanks.

169
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,440
I still don't know your name.

170
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,800
Aren't you Dajun?

171
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
Did you forget?

172
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,960
Ma Rulong.

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,840
Ma Rulong.

174
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,640
You shouldn't have adopted only me.

175
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,560
But I can't adopt everyone

176
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
at the Welfare Home.

177
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,280
Just three more would be enough.

178
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Why...

179
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,520
exactly three?

180
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,800
Because I promised to protect them.

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,240
I can't break my word.

182
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,920
Can you protect them forever?

183
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,680
I can.

184
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
You have to keep moving forward,

185
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
that's the only way to win.

186
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,720
Dad,

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,640
don't worry.

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm here for you.
