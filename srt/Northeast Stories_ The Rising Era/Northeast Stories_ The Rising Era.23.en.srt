[Episode 5]

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
Fan Zibo's nickname is Fan Datou.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,600
This guy loves to gamble.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
He always racks up debts.

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,960
Always been hit by others.

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,840
I've seen it with my own eyes.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,360
He got cornered in the bathroom.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,080
Came out with a bruised face.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,920
Sounds like fate is giving us a shot.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,640
We should grab this chance, right?

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,000
Today,

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,520
let's go ahead and

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,120
take over Fan Datou's
raw materials factory.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,440
Get the contract ready.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,400
OK.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Who?

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Go in.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,440
Head.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
Well.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,120
There are two people outside.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
They said they want to buy nuts
from you.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,440
Which company are they from?

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,520
I didn't ask yet.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,360
Next time, get clear details.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,240
Don't let scammers into our company.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,040
Alright.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,440
Anything else?

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,520
Well...

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,520
Um...

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,720
It's not about me.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,440
The workers on the line asked this.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,000
It's been three months with no pay.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,080
When can they get their wages?

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,000
How did I

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
lead a bunch of ungrateful snakes?

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,120
Come on, tell me.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,600
Back when the factory was doing well,

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,000
did I ever owe anyone a cent?

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,480
So if the factory isn't doing well,

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,160
shouldn't you try to understand?

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,120
Yeah.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,080
But the thing is,

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,880
you need to see things their way too.

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
They're living off that paycheck,

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,760
barely making ends meet each month.

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,320
Isn't that right?

48
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,960
Now, do you really think I can...

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,520
Take it.

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,400
What for?

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
Even tea, you know.

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,080
Well.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
Head, to be honest.

54
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,560
This group of workers,

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,280
really don't get it at all.

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,040
How about this,

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,640
just leave it to me,

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
I'll talk to them for you.

59
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,840
You just focus on the big stuff.

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,240
I'll call that two.

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,560
Come on in.

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,320
Please, step inside.

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,480
Boss.

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,480
They're here to see you.

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,560
This is our boss of the factory.

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,800
You all have a good talk.

67
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,080
Looking forward to working together.

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,800
Which company

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,480
are you from?

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,560
What parts are you looking for?

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Caiman Group.

72
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
This is our Chairman.

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
Ma Rulong.

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,760
Caiman Group.

75
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,000
You and

76
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,160
Jichun Group have some issues, right?

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,160
Just normal business competition.

78
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
We are

79
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Parts Supplier

80
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,440
of Jichun.

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
Working with you guys...

82
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
I think there's a misunderstanding.

83
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm not here to make a purchase.

84
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm talking acquisition.

85
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040
At double the price.

86
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Look over the contract, please.

87
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,360
I want cash.

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
Alright.

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
I want it by tomorrow.

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,920
Pleasure doing business.

91
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Pleasure doing business.

92
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Off work yet?

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
Bo, I said I'd pay you back,

94
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,360
so why all this drama?

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,320
Did you meet someone today?

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,880
Ma Rulong.

97
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,200
How'd you know?

98
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400
I told you.

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,720
I run this place.

100
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,760
You know,

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,160
that factory of yours.

102
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,320
You built it all from scratch.

103
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
Selling it now feels like a waste.

104
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,480
But if you don't sell,

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,680
you still owe me the gambling debt.

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,800
Bo, give me a little more time,

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
I promise I'll pay you back.

108
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Let me give you an idea.

109
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,080
Alright.

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,280
Bo, Bo, Bo.

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
I can't do anything illegal.

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,080
Can't?

113
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

114
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm with you, Bo.

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm with you.

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,880
Next time,

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,760
try talking less.

118
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,960
You're too chatty.

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
Now you know what I can do?

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,840
For sure. For sure.

121
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Mr. Ma.

122
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
I brought the contract.

123
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,400
If everything looks good,

124
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
just sign it here.

125
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
Why are you shaking?

126
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,160
It's...

127
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a bit chilly today.

128
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
Aren't you going to check the money?

129
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,600
No, no problem.

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,160
No problem at all.

131
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,320
You've got the cash now.

132
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,480
That means we're done here.

133
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,280
Alright.

134
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,640
I'm heading out.

135
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
Take care.

136
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Ma Rulong.

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,480
Would you say this is

138
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
a reunion of two Long?

139
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,440
Long Bo.

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
You've been laying low for years.

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
What brings you here now?

142
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Nothing serious.

143
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,920
Just here for a simple job.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,320
If you cooperate,

145
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll make this easier for you.

146
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,720
You get what I'm saying?

147
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,680
Tie him up.

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Throw him in the pit.

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Bo,

150
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,560
all the cash is right here.

151
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,800
Can I go now?

152
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
Toss him in the back.

153
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,920
Jun.

154
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,640
Hey.

155
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
I need the one in charge.

156
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
You don't need to know who I am.

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
I said, I need the one in charge.

158
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,960
Hong.

159
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,120
Hello.

160
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,840
Who is this?

161
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
No need to know.

162
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,360
Your boss is with me.

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
His fate's in your hands.

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,240
It all depends on you.

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
What do you want us to do?

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,520
Bring me 1.2 million.

167
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Okay.

168
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,880
In cash.

169
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,160
I want it right now.

170
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Can you manage that?

171
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,960
Yes, I can.

172
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,360
Hong.

173
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,040
Don't come here.

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,160
2 p.m. this afternoon.

175
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
Daobei abandoned factory.

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
Come alone.

177
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,760
Got it?

178
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,200
Got it.

179
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,400
Got it.

180
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
Sis.

181
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Hong.

182
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,080
Hong.

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,920
Lan.

184
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
Find me a pen.

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,760
Right here.

186
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,520
It's right here.

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,520
Sis, is it Jun?

188
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,320
Yeah.

189
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,880
Jun's in trouble.

190
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Someone took him.

191
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,880
What do you mean took him?

192
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
Do we have 1.2 million?

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
1.2 million...

194
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,200
In cash.

195
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,760
We do.

196
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,120
We...

197
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,720
We have it.

198
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,000
Alright.

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
We've got 1.2 million.

200
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,240
We've got two people here.

201
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,520
Hong, we...

202
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Lan.

203
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,600
Let's stay calm.

204
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,720
We need to calm down.

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,680
Okay.

206
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Only calm minds find solutions.

207
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
With a plan, we can

208
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
go save Jun.

209
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,960
I've got an idea.

210
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,280
We work together on this.

211
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,320
Yeah.

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840
We can definitely make it.
