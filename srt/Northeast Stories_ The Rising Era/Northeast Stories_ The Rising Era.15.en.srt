Hey, youngest.

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,240
Why come in without knocking?

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
Have you heard about Gao Lin?

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,320
Yeah.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,520
He just lost to Ma Rulong, right?

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
Jichun Trading now belongs to Ma Rulong.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
Looks like he's taking everything back.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,880
So he was faking his memory loss?

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
He did it to let our guard down.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,480
Are you scared?

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
I'm not scared of him.

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,600
It's Gao Lin who's not up to it.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Should we team up?

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,160
We agreed when we split up,

17

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
Are you sure about that?

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,400
Of course.

The deal depends on you, Long.

The price is a bit steep,

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120

This batch,

is totally enough for Jichun Group

101
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
Long, you're absolutely right.

102
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
Your steel is top-notch
and comes in bulk.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,200
It saves us from running back and forth.

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,840
But Long,

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880

Long, you're always so generous.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
But here's the thing, Long,

118
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,800
the company has its own rules.

119
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,200
I'll need to report this first.

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,640

121
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800

139
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,640
We need another channel.

140
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,480
Which channel do you mean?

141
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,200
No way.

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Even with new suppliers, it won't match.

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
You want to change suppliers?

144
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,040
That's even worse.

145
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600

We'll never make it.

147
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
How about we try from the inside?

148
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
Who inside?

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
Won't know till we try.

154
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Alright.

155
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I'll go with your plan.

156
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,440
Let's find out more about him.

157
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,680
Yeah.

Bro,

159
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,880
I still think this is too rushed.

160
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,360
It's our first time meeting this guy.

161
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,960
We don't even know if he's reliable.

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,600
Maybe we should head back
and rethink it.

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Weren't you the one who said that?

164
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,120
Dad didn't give us much time anyway.

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah, that's true.

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,720
Alright, forget it.

167
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,360
It's really not a big deal.

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,480
Relax, it's fine.

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
Well.

188
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
The info on the steel supply,

189
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
it's not useful for you anyway.

190
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
Why not just go with the flow?

191
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,440
You'll help yourself and us too.
