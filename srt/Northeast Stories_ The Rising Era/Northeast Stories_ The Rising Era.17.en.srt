Congrats to Jichun Group

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Mr. Liao, we have a few questions.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,040
Mr. Liao, could you say a few words?

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
Jichun Construction,

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,800
as a top player
in the real estate industry,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,280
we're not like those new companies,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,440
who dream big but lack the strength.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,880
But rest assured,

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,960
we'll push ahead
with this new land plot,

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,200
aiming to build a new landmark
in Northeast.

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,800
Mr. Ma.

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,680
Caiman Group lost
to Jichun Construction.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,080
Any thoughts on that?

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
I mentioned it before.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm mainly here to learn.

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
Alright.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,880
You two used to be so close.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,600
What happened between you now?

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Sorry about that.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,280
Mr. Liao, would you say a few words?

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
Mr. Liao.

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
Look at Dongsheng's interview.

52
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,920
It's just two plots of land.

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Why is he showing off so much?

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,840
He really scared me just now.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,800
Do you even have that kind of money?

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
Just raised your hand over there.

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,600
What if we had actually won?

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Wouldn't that be cheating?

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
I just wanted a good start.

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
Do you really have to go that far?

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,880
Ten million, thirty million,

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,840
sixty million.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,080
Are you satisfied now?

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
I raise my hand, I feel good too.

65
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
But they didn't call my bid.

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,760
Don't say a word.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
But hey, bro,

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
these two land parcels,

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
just like you said,
went to Liao Dongsheng.

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,160
So what now?

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,480
Don't rush.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
Make a call first.

73
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,840
Hey.

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,680
Everyone, hold up a second.

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,200
Pause what you're doing.

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,760
Come here, come on.

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,400
I have something to say.

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Over at Jichun Construction,

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,040
they just secured two land parcels.

80
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,400
Then that's a good thing, right?

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,640
Either way, we're doing all the work.

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,800
At least we're making money too.

83
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
What's so good about it though?

84
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
Just for the two parcels,

85
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,280
they put everything in.

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
Includes our salaries and bonuses.

87
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,520
Our money.

88
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
How do we explain this at home?

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Think about it, everyone.

90
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,920
How long has it been since we got paid?

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,960
It's been half a year already.

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
What if
they hold off another half a year?

93
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,320
We can't let that happen.

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,280
We're all counting on this money.

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,080
So here's the thing.

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,040
The company doesn't care about us.

97
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
Then we have to rely on ourselves.

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
Let's go to the company together.

99
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,000
Get our money back, okay?

100
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,560
Alright, alright.

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's go.

102
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,400
Come on.

103
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,280
Mr. Liao.

[Wage Arrears at Jichun Construction]
All the major outlets have reported it.

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,760
Looks like,

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,360
this won't blow over so easily.

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Hello,

108
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,680
Mr. Liao isn't here.

109

you can talk to me.

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,320
Sure.

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
No problem.

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,080
I'll make sure
Mr. Liao gets the message.

113
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,440
Mr. Liao,

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,480
it's from the bank.

115
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
They want to discuss the loan with you.

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Go out.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,000
Dongsheng,

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,520
I'm putting all
Jichun Entertainment shares up as collateral,

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,960
to help you fill your funding gap.

120
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,840
Alright?

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
No need.

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,960
You don't need money,

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,320
or you don't need me?

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,840
I don't need either.

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,560
Dongsheng.

126
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,920
Is it really that hard to move on?

127
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Move on...

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,280
You need legs to do that, right?

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
I don't care, really.

130
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,920
But I do.

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,160
I care.

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
I really care.

133
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,440
My leg...

134
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Dongsheng.

135
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,120
Sorry.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,680
Get out.

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Go away.

138
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
You must be exhausted lately.

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,480
It's alright.

140
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
Come sit, you've been out in the sun.

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Take a break, you've worked hard.

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,600
All this for the company.

143
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Honestly, it's not hard at all.

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,160
What are you two talking about?

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,360
I don't get it here.

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Jun,

147
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
did you and San Hu

148
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,920
already plan things behind the scenes?

149
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,560
Just kept Hong and me in the dark?

150
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,720
Acting needs to be convincing, right?

151
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,600
So why didn't you let me act?

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,920
I can act just as well, you know.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,520
Stop joking, just tell us already.

154
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,280
So, the other day,

155
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,200
I checked Jichun Construction's

156
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,960
available funds on the books.

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,000
Between thirty and fifty million.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,880
So where did Liao Dongsheng
get all that money for the bid?

159
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,280
When he brought me the plaque,

160
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
I realized something important.

161
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
He will never give me

162
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,200
any chance to enter real estate.

163
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
So he'll find a way,

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,600
to win those two plots of land.

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,560
But he doesn't have enough funds.

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,000
He'll have to get a bank loan.

167
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,760
Huzi,

168
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,120
gave the key suggestion.

169
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,720
From that moment on,

170
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,360
my goal changed.

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,240
It wasn't about getting land anymore,

172
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,360
but making sure his funds

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
were completely drained.

174
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,000
So,

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,240
you spread news about finding antiques,

176
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,960
to make Liao Dongsheng think

177
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,200
Caiman Group will do anything for land.

178
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
That pushed him to go all in.

179
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,040
Am I right?

180
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,840
That's right.

181
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
During the land auction,

182
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,680
I need him to put in all his funds.

183
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
That's where Huzi comes in.

184
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,360
He can do a lot on site.

185
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,680
The bank has a rule.

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,280
If any company faces major risks,

187
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,920
they can ask for all loans back early.

188
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Arrears of wages is a matter of concern
for the government,

189
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,880
and the media follows that closely.

190
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,040
Right?

191
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
If they force that money through,

192
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,200
to buy those two pieces of land,

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,880
it'll backfire on them.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,520
Mr. Liao,

195
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
I get what you're facing,

196
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,880
but the bank has its own rules.

197
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
Your company owes wages,

198
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,040
and that's drawn public attention.

199
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,920
For the bank,

200
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
this is a huge risk.

201
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,720
We have to follow the contract.

202
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,240
Collect the loan early.

203
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,360
The tough times won't last.

204
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
We're working on some new ideas.

205
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,360
About the unpaid wages,

206
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I swear I'll pay within two months.

207
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,600
The bank isn't just about me.

208
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
The incident from your company,

209
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
has already caused lasting effects.

210
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
It's now being treated

211
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
as a typical case up top.

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,800
Mr. Liao,

213
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,160
that's all I can say for now.

214
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,600
Hope you can pay the loan soon.

215
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,080
If not,

216
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,360
we'll have to see you in court.

217
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,440
Huahua.

218
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes.

219
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,080
I want to go outside.

220
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
Get my car ready.

221
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
Sure, Mr. Liao.

222
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
No, thanks.

223
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
I'd like to be alone for a bit.

224
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,680
You can play with me if you want.

225
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
Why pick on the new guy?

226
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,080
Yeah.

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
We're just bored anyway.

228
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,520
Come play with us.

229
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,760
You guys have fun. We're heading out.

230
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
What's your name?

231
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,640
Liao Dongsheng.

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm Ma Rulong.

233
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,200
He's Wang Bin.

234
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
He's Gao Lin.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,280
We can play together.

236
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
No one will bother you.

237
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,080
Huahua.

238
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,720
Let's head back to the company.

239
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,480
I want to talk to Ma Rulong.

240
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,680
