[Episode 21]

3
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,520
Open.

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,320
Come on, just open yours.
No need to be shy.

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,360
I'd like to discuss business
with Mr. Gao.

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,840
What business could we possibly have?

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,080
For example,

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,960
Mr. Gao's skills in bed.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,000
Mr. Gao's skin is quite fair.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,760
Hey.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,880
What do you want?

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,920
I heard you're thinking of selling

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,240
the New Jichun shares.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,600
I hope you turn that idea,

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,760
into reality.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm not interested in making money
from stocks.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,560
Don't worry.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,200
If I manage to acquire New Jichun,

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,080
you'll be the boss for sure.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,800
Are you sure
there's only one tape?

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
Take a guess.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,080
Don't you think Gao Lin's stupid?

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,120
Gao Lin really is a fool.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,320
Starting tomorrow,

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,560
from stock brokers,

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
and those retail investors,

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,400
buy up New Jichun shares.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,560
Get as many as you can.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,200
I don't care if you rent or borrow,

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,560
just get it done, alright?

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,280
Within a week,

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,400
I want to start short selling
New Jichun.

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,600
Okay.

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
What a fool.

36
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,640
Big brother,

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
I just got some news.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
New Yongming
is secretly borrowing shares.

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
They're trying to short selling
New Jichun.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah, I know.

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,040
Right now, over half the stocks

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,600
have been borrowed
by New Yongming.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,320
Each share goes for 20,

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
1 higher than the current price.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
And there's no sign of stopping.

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,360
If this keeps up,

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,720
only shares in circulation

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,440
are those held by management.

49
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,840
Where's Lin?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
We can't find that fool now.

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,600
Last meeting got pretty heated.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
You don't think he'll actually

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
sell off his shares, do you?

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,680
If he really does that,

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,960
he's basically telling the media
we're divided.

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,320
The stock would tank.

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,280
New Yongming's short selling
would work.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,960
Contact the media.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
We'll hold a press conference.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,560
Let everyone know

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
that we, New Jichun,

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,560
can handle any kind of pressure.

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,360
What if Lin doesn't show?

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
You're here.

65
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,720
Hong.

66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Hi.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,560
Big brother,

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,600
we'll head out first.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:27,880
Yeah.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Let's go, youngest.

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on.

72
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Please have a seat.

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,320
What's wrong?

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
Why's the mood so heavy?

75
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,920
What happened?

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,520
It's nothing.

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
Really.

78
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,040
I found Lan.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Where is she?

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,720
She's at Guo Chongjiang's place.

81
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
But she still won't see me.

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
That's pretty normal.

83
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Lan just started out in the society.

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
If Guo Chongjiang wants to fool her,

85
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,800
it's not that hard, is it?

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,720
No way.

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
I still need to find her.

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,920
I have to see her myself.

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
You've been exhausted lately.

90
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,200
Running around everywhere.

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, I have.

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Give me a hug.

93
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Does that feel better?

94
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,600
Much better.

95
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,160
But I still feel off.

96
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Come here.

97
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,160
For now, the stocks of New Jichun
in our hands

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,960
account for 55%.

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
Some people still can't see the truth.

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
They're not sure
if they should stay.

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,200
Not sure if they should stay...

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Then let's give them a little push.

103
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,920
Find a way to leak Jichun's infighting,

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
and tip off the media about it.

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,040
Also,

106
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,640
don't forget that fool Gao Lin,

107
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,960
and how he sold off his shares.

108
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,240
Add some drama to the story,

109
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,600
make sure everyone hears about it.

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
Let them know the brothers

111
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,360
are beyond fixing things.

112
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't worry, bro.

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm good at this kind of thing.

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,840
I'll make sure Ma Rulong feels

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,560
what it's like to be under fire.

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,560
Get to it.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Isn't this all just nonsense?

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:26,920
Big brother.

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,560
Take a look at this.

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,600
There's infighting at New Jichun.

121
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,880
Shareholders want to cash out fast.

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
How did things get this messy?

123
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,520
Now they're saying,

124
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
he's lost without the company.

125
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,680
Guo Chongjiang's using the media,

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,320
putting pressure
on hesitant shareholders.

127
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
The company's stock has
already halved.

128
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,960
If there's a big sell-off,

129
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,200
New Jichun will go bankrupt.

130
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
Let's hold a media conference.

131
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,880
Big brother,

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
if that fool doesn't show up,

133
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
won't that confirm everything?

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,640
Got any better ideas?

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Let's go with what big brother says.

136
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
Ma Rulong never expected

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,320
you'd hide right under his nose.

138
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,760
New Jichun's press conference

139
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,200
is about to start.

140
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,800
When the time comes,

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,560
I want you to say it loud and clear,

142
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
let everyone there know,

143
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
that you're selling
all your New Jichun shares.

144
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,720
I did everything you asked.

145
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
Now give me the tape.

146
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,760
Of course.

147
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,000
I get it.

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Betraying your brother,

149
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,520
makes you feel guilty,

150
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,760
and you blame yourself.

151
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
But think about it,

152
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
if Ma Rulong goes down,

153
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,760
it won't hurt you at all,

154
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,520
it might actually help you.

155
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,360
Once it's done,

156
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,640
all of New Jichun,

157
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
will be under your control.

[Press Conference
on New Jichun Development Plan]

159
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,320
The reason why
New Jichun called the press conference,

160
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm sure everyone knows already.

161
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,880
So I won't repeat myself.

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,320
I have two things to say.

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
First thing,

164
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,200
New Jichun,

165
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,480
will definitely get through this.

166
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,880
Second,

167
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,800
New Jichun,

168
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,480
has not had the rumored

169
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,160
infighting.

170
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,560
So why isn't Gao Lin
from Jichun Trading here?

171
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,160
After New Jichun went public,

172
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,920
we've been making internal adjustments.

173
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,800
Each division head,

174
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,520
has taken on a lot more work.

175
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
Especially at Jichun Trading.

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,800
That's why Gao Lin

177
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,880
couldn't make it
to the press conference.

178
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,240
The rumor says you had infighting,

179
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,160
and that's why he didn't show up, right?

180
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,320
Who said I wouldn't show up?

181
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
I'm here now.
