[Northeast Stories: The Rising Era]

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,160
Gonna play or skip?

4
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,360
Why are you so free today?

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,760
Isn't anyone working?

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,720
We want but there's nothing to do.

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,640
What's going on here?

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,720
Just passing the time here.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,880
Knitting sweaters?

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Gossiping?

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,960
You won't even wear your uniform.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,400
What do you mean?

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
Hong.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600
It's not that we don't want to work.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,960
We haven't had a single call
since morning.

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,520
Is the phone broken or what?

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
It's not broken, just no one's calling.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,480
So why is that?

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,280
Because Jichun Trading started
something called JiSpeed.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,440
Their business is just like ours.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,480
But,

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,440
they give new partners bonuses.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,760
So what?

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,160
They're just throwing money at it.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,880
That's pretty normal.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,480
Companies with cash do this
to win market share.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,560
That's how it always starts.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,040
So,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
enjoy your paid time off,

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,240
everyone.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,840
Come on.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Go relax.

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,640
See for yourself.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
Just saying it like it's nothing.

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,400
And it's paid.

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,320
Dajun.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
Oh my gosh.

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
What's going on?

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,640
Gao Lin.

41
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,520
He started fighting with Ma Rulong.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
Just a fight isn't enough.

43
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,320
I want them to turn on each other.

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,160
Alright.

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
Then I'll stir things up some more.

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,440
What about overseas?

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
Any updates from them?

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
It's a huge place out there.

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
Finding a woman isn't that easy.

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
But don't worry.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Just focus on your work.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
If things go well here,

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,320
maybe the people over there,

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,800
will show up soon enough.

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,560
Huzi.

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
What are you doing up so late?

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Why aren't you sleeping?

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,880
Your brother's been inside for days.

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,960
He hasn't eaten or drunk anything.

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
It was noisy here
just a couple days ago.

61
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,400
But today it's totally quiet.

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
What's going on, should we check?

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
Can you get the door open?

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm worried something happened to him.

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
Isn't it locked right now?

66
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,320
Yeah.

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,440
Why'd he lock himself in here?

68
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,400
Relax, he's just snoring in there.

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
Why are you sleeping here?

70
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't you know to go home?

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
What brings you guys here?

72
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
Hong was worried about you.

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,640
You really know how to worry people.

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
Hey, this thing actually works.

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
Look at this guy.

76
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
He mixed a motorbike with a cart.

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,880
You sure this will work?

78
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
It really does work.

79
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,280
This is your secret weapon, huh?

80
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,720
Think about JiSpeed.

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,360
They use big trucks for deliveries.

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,240
It's always large packages for them.

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,040
But for us,

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
we use this for small parcels.

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
We win with quantity.

86
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,440
With it delivering, it gets so easy.

87
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Yeah.

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Alright, back to sleep then.

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
Say that again?

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,800
Get up.

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,120
Come home with me.

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
Just get in the car.

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
Consider it a test run.

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,080
It's just a short walk.

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Take a walk?

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,240
Let's go.

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,960
You're just ditching me.

98
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,760
Huzi, close the door.

99
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,200
It was so close,

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,560
how could he have made it again?

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
They've widened their delivery range.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,000
They even dropped order size limits.

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,880
Now all those smaller clients

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,840
we never served are with them now.

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,600
They deliver to them,

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
and so do we.

107
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,440
But,

108
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,480
our prices will be even lower.

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,680
Mr. Gao,

110
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
our delivery costs

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
are way higher than theirs.

112
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
We're short on staff too.

113
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,160
Short on staff?

114
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,280
Just hire more.

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,400
Not enough money,

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
then raise more funds.

117
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Raise the pay,

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,440
and bring people from Caiman Express.

119
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I don't buy it.

120
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
Ma Rulong can handle the delivery
on his own?

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,120
Alright, I'll get on it right away.

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,680
JiSpeed offers a 100 more base salary.

123
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,320
Plus, if you have experience,
that's another 100.

124
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,280
And they have vans,
so you won't freeze.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,920
We should talk to Long about this.

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
If they don't raise our pay,

127
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
we'll just quit together,

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,520
and join JiSpeed.

129
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,400
For sure.

130
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,440
What are you even talking about?

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,320
You're so ungrateful.

132
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,120
Can't you just be content?

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,560
You should appreciate
what you have.

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,640
Hu, why do you sound
so harsh?

135
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
Did you forget how Ma Rulong
hit you before?

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,280
And now you're siding with him?

137
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,680
We're just trying to negotiate fairly.

138
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,600
- Right?
- It's reasonable.

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
Right for what?

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
Whether I was hit or not,
that's in the past.

141
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
Now, we're working together
as a team.

142
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Just focus and give it our all.

143
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
I trust Ma Rulong.

144
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
Don't overthink things.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,600
Get back to work.

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
Looks like everyone's here.

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,560
Well,

148
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
I have some big news for everyone.

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,880
Just now, three markets

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
signed a delivery agreement with us.

151
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
That's really good news,

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
which means, our delivery area

153
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
has expanded now.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,840
That's why I want to give everyone

155
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,360
some systematic training.

156
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Then, based on where you live,

157
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
we'll assign delivery team leaders.

158
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
What's wrong?

159
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,480
You don't look happy.

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
Maybe they're just a bit tired.

161
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,320
Just go ahead.

162
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,760
I...

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,080
I have something to say.

164
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,200
Please.

165
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,400
We need a raise on our base salary.

166
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Wasn't I just about to bring that up?

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,320
I think everyone should
get fifty more.

168
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,120
Delivery team leader,

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,840
a hundred more.

170
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,560
JiSpeed,

171
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,840
offers 200 more.

172
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Yeah, two hundred.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,440
Guys,

174
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,640
our company just started, right?

175
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,960
It's tough at the beginning.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,600
I promise you,

177
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,560
I'll make it up to everyone later.

178
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,720
When is "later" exactly?

179
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,600
I have something else.

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Can you stop already?

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,480
Huzi.

182
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,840
How about this.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,800
We're all here,

184
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,640
just trying to make a living.

185
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,440
I get that.

186
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,120
If you want to leave, I won't stop you.

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,640
If you want to stay,

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,920
you're more than welcome.

189
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,680
Bro,

190
