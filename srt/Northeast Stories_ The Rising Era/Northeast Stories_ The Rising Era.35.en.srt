3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,560
What I mean is,
[*Spoken in Cantonese]

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:45,960
you're

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,360
not

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:46,640
a

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:46,960
match

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,440
for him.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,520
Didn't get the first part,

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,040
but for the rest,

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,240
let me tell you,

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
I am good enough.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
But are you?

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,800
I can give him a lot.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
People from the north,

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,920
don't you care
about matching backgrounds?

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
Don't try to play tricks on me.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,720
I know what you're getting at.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,240
I have nothing at all.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
But I've already chosen him.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,040
I'd risk everything for him,
even my life.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Could you do the same?

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,200
Even your life?

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,760
You love him that much.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,960
But what if he leaves you?

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,560
Then what can I do?

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
I just love him boldly.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,480
If that day comes,

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,760
I'll accept it.

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,560
This is my own choice.

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,920
Ahh...

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,760
Alright then.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,760
No wonder Ma Rulong

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,880
picked you.

35
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,840
If it were me,

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,400
I couldn't do it.

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Fine, you win.

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,960
You're giving up just like that?

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,760
Guess you're not that tough.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
I haven't even started yet.

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,480
What else could I do?

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,240
If it ends, just move on.

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,160
I always thought

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,360
me and him had something special.

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,760
Stop.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,200
Please don't start your story.

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,920
No matter how special you two are,

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,760
you can't top what we have.

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,720
What do you mean, "what we have"?

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
Our story...

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
is miraculous.

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,120
Fate didn't
let us dodge each other's paths.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,520
Tell me about it.

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
I actually have no idea.

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I'll explain everything today.

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,280
So, here's what happened.

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,760
It all started on this road.

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,760
And this is

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,520
Ma Rulong.

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,560
This is my little car.

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
I was just driving as usual.

62
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:35,960
Hey,

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
then I bumped into him.

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
What a coincidence!

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,200
What are you doing?

What are you doing?
[*Spoken in Northeast accent]

68
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Go ahead, ask him.

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,800
What...

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
What are you doing?
[*Spoken in Northeast accent]

71
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,320
What's wrong?

72
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
Done talking?

73
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,240
Thanks for introducing me
to my sister.

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Thank you

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,920
for letting me meet such a great girl.

About the Go Public,

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,880
I've agreed to it.

78
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
But,

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,920
you need to stay with me tonight.
[*Spoken in Cantonese]

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,680
You're staying with me tonight.

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
Alright.

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Sound good?

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Yeah.

85
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,560
Come on, let me pick one for you.

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,600
How about this one?

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,960
This one?

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Let me see.

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
That's way too small.

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
This one's too big.

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,040
Too big?

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,560
Yes.

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,000
Then let's go even bigger.

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
I need to take a call.

95
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,920
Can you watch my wife for a sec?

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
Check out the small ones.

97
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
The small ones?

98
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,200
Hello.

99
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Have you found out everything?

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Yidu Huashang

101
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,920
is going to help New Jichun go public.

102
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
In that case, I hope

103
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
Ma Rulong never gets a chance
to challenge me.

104
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
Understand?

105
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Got it.

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,720
This can be adjusted, no worries.

107
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,120
It all depends on your preference.

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
How about these?

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
They're all too big.

110
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,440
All too big?

111
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,200
Then just bring out

112
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
your largest one.

113
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,440
Alright?

114
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,320
He's just joking.

115
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,880
Just joking.

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm not joking.

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,680
Let me take a look.

118
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
Hey.

119
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
Hello, sir.

120
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,360
Are you here to check in?

121
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,160
Hello.

122
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,080
What rooms do you have?

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,720
We have basic and queen rooms.

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
Which one would you like?

125
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,960
I'll take a

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,800
queen room.

127
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,520
Alright, let me register you.

128
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,480
You answer the call first.

129
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Sorry.

130
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,920
Hello.

131
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,240
Hello?

132
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,080
Where did the man go?

133
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Hello.

134
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,640
Sis.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
I can't eat Iron Pot Stew.

136
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,160
Something came up in Guangzhou.
I need to go back tomorrow.

137
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,720
It's fine, really.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,440
You don't need to see me off.

139
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,280
Alright then.

140
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,560
Then come over here.

141
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,440
Alright, alright.

142
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,880
A woman's heart,

143
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,040
is like a needle at the bottom
of the ocean.

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,560
Didn't expect those two
to get along so well.

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
Let me say something.

146
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Today, I need you both all day.

147
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,280
For what?

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,920
My sister's going back to Guangzhou.

149
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,040
I need to get her
some Northeast specialties to take home.

150
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Come on, really?

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,040
She's got a big company,
need your local goods?

152
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
Same things,

153
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
but it's different if they're from me.

154
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,240
Besides,

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,160
people say
folks from Northeast are welcoming.

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,480
I can't lose face.

157
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,040
Right?

158
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
What?

159
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm officially recruiting you both.

160
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,400
Hurry up.

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,680
Move it.

162
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,400
Come on.

163
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,880
Hurry up.

164
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,960
We're running late.

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
You bought way too much.

166
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,600
I'm not done shopping yet.

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,400
Hey, bro.

168
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,080
I haven't eaten all day.

169
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,080
That cow needs to be fed too.

170
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
At lunch, I really fed you grass.

171
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,120
Feels like something's missing.

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,840
Auricularia heimuer.

173
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
Hasma.

174
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,480
What local product do we have?

175
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,840
Do I look like a local product?

176
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,080
Let me think again.

177
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,000
It's a matter of pride.

178
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,160
Be careful.
