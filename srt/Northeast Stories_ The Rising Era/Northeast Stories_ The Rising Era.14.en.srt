Let's go.

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,000
Have lunch together.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,200
I'm not hungry.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,840
You guys go ahead.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,960
I've got accounts to sort out.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,560
Alright, we're off then.

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,660
Okay.

Long.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,160
Why you come here?

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
To see you.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
You're just getting better,

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,400
but still skipping meals.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,400
Have a look?

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,760
What's all this?

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,680
Wow, rice noodles.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,240
I've been craving this for ages.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
You made this?

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,160
Who else would it be?

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,400
I didn't know you could cook.

Back at the Welfare Home,

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,000
we only had it on New Year's Day
or birthdays.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,560
Just those two days, that's it.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,880
So I got pretty good at making it.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,600
Honestly,

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,200
this tastes amazing.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,400
Aren't you having any?

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,120
It's all mine, then.

31

34

She actually looks familiar.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Look at you, what a mess.

36

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,480
You didn't even tell us you were coming.

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,400
We could have picked you up.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,440
I wanted to surprise you two.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
Well, you definitely surprised us.

45

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,560
She's way overqualified for that.

58

So those people in vests at the gate...

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,320

Mr. Wang also had conflicts
with Ma Rulong.

Even if the company goes bankrupt,

109
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,640
I still won't ask them.

110
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,760
So what do we do now?

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,200
Sell the shopping mall.

112
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,480
Use that to pay off the debt.

113
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
That still won't cover
what we owe the suppliers.

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Did I ever say we'd pay it all at once?

115
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Get the supplier reps in here tomorrow.

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,440

[Jichun Group]

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,960
I can give you the money,

121
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,040
but it has to be on my terms.

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,280
First,

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,840
the debt gets settled yearly.

124
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll pay four percent each month.

125
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Second,

126
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
the debt gets a twenty percent cut.

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,080
And it's paid in cash.

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,640
Any objections?

The market changes fast.

130

If you want the cash,

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
you've got to take the risk.

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,240
He guessed it.

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
Guessed it?

134
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,600
He figured out your settlement plan.

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
So last night,

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,600
we sold off all the debt
at a ten percent cut.

137
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,680
Now, between us,

Please don't kick me out
of Caiman Group.

I can't do anything but
be a chairman.

179

And the winery.

193
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,160
I was wrong.

194
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
I just can't grow grapes.

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,240
Gao Lin, listen to me.

196
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,040
If you want to stay with the company,

197
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,000
start from the ground up.

198
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,920
When you truly get grape growing,

199
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,320
you can come back to lead a team.

200
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,160
I can't grow grapes.

201
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,800
Brother, please, I'm begging you.

202
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,080
The choice is yours now.

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
Stay or go, it's up to you.

204
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,920
Keep going.

205
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,520
Hand them all out.

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll grow grapes.

207
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,840
Brother, I'm leaving.

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,520
Brother.

209
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm leaving now.

210
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,120
Stand right there.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Grow with this.

212
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,400
Looks really good.

213
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,600
Yours.

214
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,680
Does it look good?

215
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,440
You're amazing.

216
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,560
