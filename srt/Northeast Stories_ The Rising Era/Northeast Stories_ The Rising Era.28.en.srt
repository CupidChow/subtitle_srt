[Episode 10]

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:42,960
What are you doing?

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,080
Let go.

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,640
Hey, hey.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,160
This isn't about you.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Pretty bold of you.

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,040
Go on.

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,760
That's enough messing around.

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,400
Feng Yue.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,280
This whole mess is on you.

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,520
Aren't you going to explain?

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Grandpa.

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,960
This whole fight,

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,080
was it your idea?

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,320
No, it wasn't.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,120
It wasn't me.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,760
Really, it wasn't.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
You've had your fun now,

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,120
and made enough noise.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,720
Go home.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,800
Grandpa.

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,880
It's so boring back there.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,320
Just let me

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,160
stay a few more days.

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,520
Ma Rulong.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,360
I'll come find you in Northeast.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,200
Wait for me.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,840
Seriously.

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,240
Grandpa.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,720
I haven't been strict
with my granddaughter.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Sorry to

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
trouble you like this.

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,480
The audio equipment you ordered,

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,040
I've already shipped it to Northeast.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,160
That's too much.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,080
Please don't refuse.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,200
It's my way to apologize.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
How about this,

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,120
let's take this batch of equipment

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,440
as your investment.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
When the weather gets cold,

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,960
these poor kids

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
are more likely to catch colds.

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah.

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,600
They really need warmer clothes.

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,400
The donated jackets,

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,880
who knows when they'll arrive.

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
So frustrating.

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
We can't just watch the kids freeze.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Let me see what I can do, Director.

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Thanks for taking care of this.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,080
No worries.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,600
Are you feeling okay?

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,560
Hong,

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,280
here's this week's transport report.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,040
Take a look when you can.

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
Okay, just leave it there.

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,120
Alright.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,320
Hello.

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Caiman Group speaking.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Hey, Lan.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Lan.

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,360
How have you been?

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Come home, will you?

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,720
I'll make you something nice.

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah, I do.

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
I do have winter coats.

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,200
There's plenty left.

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,720
Where are you now?

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,960
I can bring them to you.

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,280
Alright, sounds good.

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,840
Then you come find me.

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Just drop by the shop.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,960
Let's meet there.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,680
Does that work for you?

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Ever since we moved the company,

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,320
I haven't been back in ages.

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,160
If you don't take these clothes,

80
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,240
they're all sitting here.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
What a shame.

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,120
People want to move up.

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,400
We can't always

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,920
stay in this small market forever.

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,680
Lan,

86
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,400
no matter how nice it is out there,

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
this place is still our root.

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,200
I always feel

89
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,920
one day we'll come back here.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,320
Just the three of us, together.

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,200
That feeling of home,

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,960
it's the best.

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,560
It's only home when everyone's here.

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Come back, Lan.

95
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Sometimes,

96
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
we might come back physically,

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,440
but our hearts

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
might not make it back.

99
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
The heart just can't return.

100
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,040
Isn't it the same anywhere?

101
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Sis,

102
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,960
such a huge...

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,680
carton,

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
and all these clothes...

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,760
How are we moving all this?

106
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,440
I wanted to ask San Hu for help,

107
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
but he said he's busy.

108
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's just take my little Alto.

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
Doesn't that car always act up?

110
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,400
It's fine,

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,720
one trip won't hurt it.

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,000
Alright.

113
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,400
Just set it down.

114
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,120
Grab this one.

115
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,600
Here, give it to me.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,560
I've got the muscle.

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
It's pretty heavy.

118
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,200
It's okay.

119
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Let's go.

120
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,520
Is that little one okay?

121
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,880
Yeah, it's good.

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
See? I told you.

123
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
This car's tough as nails.

124
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,600
Do you remember?

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
The farthest we traveled together,

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
was that trip to Tianjin.

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
You came with me to pick up the car.

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
We took the train there.

129
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,440
Talked the whole way.

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,400
How did we have so much to say?

131
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,400
On the way back,
you said you wanted to drive a bit.

132
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,480
Back then, I couldn't bear to let you.

133
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Lan,

134
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,520
just talk to me.

135
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Like we used to.

136
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
Let's open up for once.

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,320
Okay?

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Lately, I keep thinking,

139
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,400
what if Jun had only met me?

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,600
Maybe the one he likes would be me.

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,240
Hong.

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,600
Watch out!

143
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,200
Bro.

144
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,360
No one keeps secrets like I do.

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
Nobody knows you're back.

146
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,760
If Hong knows,

147
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
she'll be really touched.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
You sure know how to flatter.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Just focus on driving.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,600
Hong, are you okay?

151
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm fine.

152
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,280
Really.

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,120
Lan.

154
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,160
Are you hurt at all?

155
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,880
No, I'm good.

156
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
There's a gap here.

157
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,040
Think you can get out?

158
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,000
Take it slow.

159
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,360
Lan.

160
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,000
Can you give me a hand?

161
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
My seatbelt's stuck.

162
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,600
Hong, push the door.

163
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
Push the door.

164
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,680
Hurry up.

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
It's leaking oil.

166
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,720
Jun,

167
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
today I

168
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
went to Hong for winter coats.

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
But then I forgot...

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
I don't even know

171
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,000
why I kept saying those with her
in the car.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,880
It's my fault the car flipped.

173
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,040
I'm asking you, where's Hong?

174
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
Ward 6.
