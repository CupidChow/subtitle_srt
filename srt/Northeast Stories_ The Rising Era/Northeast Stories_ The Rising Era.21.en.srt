[Episode 3]

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,600
Mr. Ma.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,920
Guo Yongming jumped off a building.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Is that news true?

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,600
It's true.

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,680
Everyone,

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
today means a lot to Jichun.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,880
It's a truly special day.

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,880
Over the past two years,

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,440
with careful planning,

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,400
we've not only broken into real estate,

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but also found solid ground.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,360
And beyond that,

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,000
we've become the industry leader.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
But when I think about it,

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,840
the real key was someone here.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
I believe,

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
no one has any doubts, right?

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,840
Long,

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,800
come here.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,840
Dad.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,840
In life,

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,600
there are really just two things
to remember.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,560
Honor,

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
and shame.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
Long,

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,760
I hope from now on,

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,160
you'll fight to protect that honor.

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
I will, Dad.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,080
Alright, everyone, enjoy yourselves.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Enjoy.

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,840
Take a sniff.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,720
The wine smells good.

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,880
Still drinking, huh?

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
Can you act normal for once?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
What did I do?

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,840
Without me,

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,440
isn't big brother still here?

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
Why are you even worried?

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
He's talented,

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,680
and handsome too.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
He's also really capable.

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,280
Yongming Group might be impressive,

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,800
but compared to my big brother,
it's nothing.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
One call from him and it all crumbles.

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,360
Come on, let's have a drink.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
To my big brother.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
But at the same time,

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,880
I, Gao Lin, am talented too.

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,400
Right?

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
If I didn't stir things up,

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,800
would Yongming have fallen so fast?

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,480
Of course impossible.

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
Drink for me too.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,280
To Mr. Gao.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,040
To Mr. Gao.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,760
Big brother's here.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
Brother, do you think

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,280
that I'm really the key player here?

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,160
I never thought I'd push you this far.

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,920
That was never what I wanted.

63
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,400
Ma Rulong,

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,720
only to protect your brother
and to win in the business world,

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,640
look what you have done.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,520
Despicable. Pathetic.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,440
You're a sinner.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,760
Dad,

69
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,840
I don't deserve this badge.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,960
[Jichun Group]

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
The story between me
and Guo Chongjiang,

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,160
that's pretty much all there is.

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,240
So I get it now.

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,680
But right now, there's no evidence,

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,880
to prove Dongsheng's death

76
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,200
has anything to do
with Guo Chongjiang.

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,680
For now, we can only focus on

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,600
the man
that pushed Liao Dongsheng down.

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,360
That's our only piece of evidence.

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
It's the only clue we've got.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Wang Bin.

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
Youngest...

83
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,680
locked herself in again, huh?

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,320
You're pretty sharp.

85
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,080
Do you really need to ask me?

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,760
It's the last chance to see him.

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,440
Let her come say goodbye.

88
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
You're really loyal, you know.

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
Busy with Dongsheng's funeral here,

90
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,880
and running to Ma Rulong there.

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,680
The police already checked into it.

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,920
It has nothing to do with big brother.

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,320
Which word can't you understand?

94
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
Wasn't Dongsheng's death about him?

95
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,640
Didn't he take over Jichun Construction?

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,440
All this is right in front of you,

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,680
yet you keep calling him big brother.

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,760
Really?

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,520
Aren't you the least bit ashamed?

100
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,720
Kids, get off now.

101
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,880
Come here, come on.

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,000
From now on,

103
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,920
this will be your home.

104
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,040
My child.

105
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,080
Come here.

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,960
Hurry up.

107
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
Let me introduce you.

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
These people here,

109
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
will be your brothers now.

110
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,800
You all need to get along.

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,640
Alright?

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,160
Let's go.

113
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,840
Let's take a family photo.

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,360
Put on your nice clothes.

Everyone, look over there.
