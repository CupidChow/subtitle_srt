Ma Rulong.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,840
Our little game,

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,760
is just getting started.

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
You better hold on.

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Hold on.

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,240
Why are you stopping me?

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,120
Taking his life isn't the best move.

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,160
Trust me on this.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
Are you sure about this?

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,120
Lan.

13
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,800
Marriage is for life.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,280
You can't just rush this decision.

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,880
Besides,

16
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,160
let me be straight with you.

17
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,720
Guo Chongjiang isn't exactly...

18
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,680
What do you mean?

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,680
What are you trying to say?

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,000
Guo Chongjiang is no good?

21
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,680
And why's that?

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,640
Just because the man you like
is a saint,

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
but the man I like is a bad guy?

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
Hong.

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,840
I asked you out today,

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
because I just wanted your blessing.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,960
Is that really so hard?

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Is it?

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm done, I'm out.

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,160
This is just not my day.

31
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Fifty.

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,280
Time to knock you down.

33
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
What kind of hand are you betting with?

34
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I've got three aces.

35
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,920
What have you got?

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,840
Think you can beat me with a pair?

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
He's cheating.

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,560
Really disgusting.

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,080
No wonder we lose.

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,240
Dare cheat?

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,840
Pull his hair.

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,320
We all come out for some fun.

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
Can I really do that stuff?

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,600
The card slipped in by itself.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
I didn't mean to.

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,240
Hello.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
Alright.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,720
See you at the usual spot.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,400
Is it time to deal with Ma Rulong?

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
Not the right time yet.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Give it to him harder.

52
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
So, what's your plan?

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,720
I want him to suffer

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,160
the same pain I did.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
I want him to realize

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,680
what it means

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
when everyone turns on you.

58
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Caiman Express sent spoiled food
to clients.

59
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,200
Caiman Properties had a safety accident.

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,480
Caiman Entertainment keeps
getting involved in drugging women.

61
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,080
For this series of scandals,

62
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,160
what's your answer?

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Let me clarify for everyone,

64
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,560
our shareholders are in a meeting,

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
we'll definitely give everyone,

66
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,800
a proper explanation soon.

67
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,480
That's all for now.

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
Sir, could you say a few more words?

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,480
Sir.

70
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
Sir, please say something else?

71
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,280
Sir.

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,240
You all,

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,480
have you made your decision?

74
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
That's right.

75
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,080
We're selling all our shares.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,040
Then let me make a request.

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,520
We get how you feel right now.

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
But to be frank,

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,560
right now,

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
don't try to change our minds.

81
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,960
That's not what I'm doing.

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
The request is that,

83
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
I just hope everyone

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,760
can hold off for now,

85
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,760
and not rush things

86

88
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
Give me ten days.

89
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,280
I'll raise the money fast.

90
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,280
Then,

91
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll buy back your shares first.

92
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,640
Ten days is too long.

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,520
Our shares could lose value.

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll give you five days.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Deal.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,920
How did the talk go?

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,520
Not so great.

98
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Don't stress.

99
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,560
We'll figure something out.

100
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
They only gave me five days.

101
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,280
They clearly don't know you.

102
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,320

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm fine, really.

105
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
I just need a moment.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Let me think by myself.

107
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,640
No one's going to stay here.

what would you do in my place?

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
I taught you martial arts,

113
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,480
not so you could push people around.

114
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,040
But they started it first.

115
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,680
Yet in the end,

116
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,600

broaden your horizons.
