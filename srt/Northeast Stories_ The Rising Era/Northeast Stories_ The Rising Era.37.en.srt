I totally disagree with that view.

77

No matter how New Jichun develops,

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
none of this happens
without Old Master.

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,720
If Old Master wasn't here,

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,400
facing all that hardship,

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
and building everything from nothing,

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,520
then Jichun wouldn't even exist.

83

That's what Old Master always believed.

93
