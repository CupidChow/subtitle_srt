Someone's looking for you.

5
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Take a seat.

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,800
What's up?

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
Brother.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm here to discuss something
with you.

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,720
I want to hire your guys.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
For business.

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,720
Business?

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,760
My crew here,

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
they've all done some things.

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,760
No worries, I trust them.

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,440
How many people do you need?

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
How many do you have?

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,040
That's a big ask.

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
You're not just talking, right?

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,360
The contract.

Let's talk about something.

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,360
Give me some air.

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,600
It's way too strong.

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
Open the window a little bit.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
What's the matter, bro?

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,000
Everyone's here.

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160

Living.

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,720
Back then, we just messed around.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,160
But now,

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,000

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
So now,

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,480
here's the thing,

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,720
that can settle everyone down.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,760
I just want to know if you're on board.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,320
Sure.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Of course.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,480
You don't sound like an "of course".

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Unwilling?

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,480
Dajun,

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,960

Bing trusts me,

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,800
so I won't waste your time.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,160
I've started a company,

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520

You get a month's pay in advance.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
So, we're delivering packages?

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
Isn't that like pulling a rickshaw?

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,920
Bro,

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,920
I might lose my face.

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
You still care about saving face?

62
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,600
You don't even have food at home.

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:35,960

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,440

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,240
Come on.

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,320
It's all voluntary, really.

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,280
Even Bing said so,

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
I'll sign.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,200

70
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,760
Right.

71
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm signing too.

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,480
Alright.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,520
It's all voluntary.

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
When can I get discharged?

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
I told you a couple times already.

76
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,520
We're just being responsible for you.

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
You need a couple more days
of observation.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
Still need to observe?

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm already fine now.

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
How much is your hospital stay per day?

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Around a hundred or so.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,920
What?

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Around a hundred?

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
Can you keep your voice down?

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,680
Is this your place?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
There are still patients here.

87
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
Don't disturb others' rest.

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Hurry up and take this out for me.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,200
I'll leave. Give my money back.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,000
You paid for a week.

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,800
You can't get a refund if you leave now.

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,200
What's with your attitude?

93
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,520
I'm sure it's not as good as yours.

94
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
You sell clothes pretty well too.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
Look at this quality.

96
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,360
The seams are all coming apart.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
You know,

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
I recognized you
the moment you came in.

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,920
Who are you blaming for your weight?

100
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,240
When I bought clothes from you,
did I weigh only sixty?

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
I was just as chubby back then.

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
You totally talked me into this.

103
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
You said the quality was great.

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,400
That it was custom-made for me.

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
And super stretchy, too.

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
Now I wear it daily, looks like a Qipao.

107
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
Who are you blaming for this?

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,760
It's not the clothes, it's on you.

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah.

110
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,560
I'm bigger, but I'm healthy.

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm strong, you know.

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,960
So what?

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
You took the tag off already.

114
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
That means I can't refund it.

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
I won't return it back.

116
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,680
So what?

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,760
Anything else you need?

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Nope, I'm good.

119
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Take a break.

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Remember to get some rest.

121
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
This is bullying.

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,960
Why am I still so weak?

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Don't mess with me.

124
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
What happened?

125
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
Did you finish up at the company?

126
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,760
We already had some new staff.

127
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Don't worry about it.

128
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,760
Did you pay the hospitalization fee?

129
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
Couldn't you just keep the money?

130
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm better now,
I'm leaving the hospital.

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Go get back the rest of those money.

132
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Oh.

133
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,880
Well.

134
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,440
Let me do the accounts for you.

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,880
About your illness,

136
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
if you're not fully healed,

137
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
won't it cost even more later?

138
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Yeah.

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,240
So the hospitalization fee
is no big deal?

140
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,080
Yeah.

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,840
Exactly.

142
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,120
That's what I thought before.

143
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
But,

144
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,560
after hearing you, it makes sense now.

145
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
It's really not necessary.

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,040
Don't go.

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,520
You've paid anyway.

148
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,440
I can stay more days.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,640
Stay more days?

150
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,440
Yeah.

Mr. Gao.

162
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Our number of staff expanded sevenfold,

163
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,600
so vehicle costs went up too.

164
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,920
Plus, we added franchise bonuses.

165
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,800
Now the company's cash flow

166
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,800
is starting to have some problems.

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,320
We can't pay our suppliers anymore.

168
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
How's Caiman Express doing?

169
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,400
It's okay.

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Okay.

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
If it's good, just say it's good.

172
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,040
If it's bad, just say it's bad.

173
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
What do you mean by okay?

174
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
You usually talk a lot,

175
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,000
why so quiet now?

176
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
Caiman Express uses low-cost transport,

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,120
and same-day delivery,

178
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,640
so it's got 80% of the market now.

179
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,040
The returns are way higher than before.

180
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,600
They've grown over ten times.

181
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,240
So you're saying I spent all that money,

182
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
set up that Feng Shui thing,

183
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
and Ma Rulong wasn't hurt,

184
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,480
but actually got stronger, right?

185
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,920
Get out.
