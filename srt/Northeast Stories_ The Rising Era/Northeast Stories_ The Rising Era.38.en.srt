[Episode 20]

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,080
Try a bite, I made it just for you.

4
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,040
Okay?

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,880
Go away.

6
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Go away.

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,520
Guo Chongjiang.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,320
Let me go.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,080
Guo Chongjiang.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,960
Lan, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Sorry, Lan.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,400
Lan.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,040
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
New Jichun went public smoothly,

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
but we can't let our guard down.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,360
The capital market has its risks.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,760
But there are chances too.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,520
Everyone here today,

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,400
is a key member of New Jichun.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
I called this meeting today,

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,600
to hear your thoughts.

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,360
They're important for the company,

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,520
to plan our next steps.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,880
Who wants to start?

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
No one?

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
Let me say something then.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,800
Chairman,

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
honestly, we don't need meetings.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,120
However you decide,

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,440
we'll follow your lead.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,760
From Jichun,

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
to New Jichun,

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,160
and now going public,

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,560
those were all your calls.

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,720
So,

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
we trust your judgment.

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,760
Brother.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Tone it down a little.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,600
What?

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,080
Did I say something wrong?

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Anyone see things differently?

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah, I do.

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,880
I see differently.

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,560
Then hold your words back.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
Wang Bin.

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Feel free to speak your mind.

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,720
Go on, Gao Lin.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,880
You heard that?

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Feel free to speak.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,840
Since Mr. Ma said so,

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
I'll just be straightforward.

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
These past few years,

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,200
the Group's been stagnant.

57
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,440
We're stuck in our comfort zone.

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,080
We need to broaden our view.

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
It's time to enter new fields.

60
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,160
Internet,

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,200
New Energy,

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,880
Biotechnology and so on.

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
These are all emerging fields,

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
and they're worth a lot.

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,360
Jichun has already gone public.

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
We're flush with cash now.

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,160
If we get in early,

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,720
it'll be good for us.

69
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
If we're too late,

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,200
there won't be a next step.

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,920
That's all?

72
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,400
That's it for now.

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
When I say "steady",

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
I don't mean
standing in our comfort zone.

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
As for the things you mentioned,

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
the company will get there
eventually,

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,320
just not right now.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Right now, two things matter most.

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,600
First,

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,160
make sure the current projects
of Jichun Trading,

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
Jichun Construction,

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,600
and Jichun Manufacturing

83
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
run steady.

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,760
Meanwhile,
upgrade both staff and equipment.

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
Second,

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,040
as soon as possible,

87
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,480
take Jichun Entertainment back

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,040
from New Yongming.

89
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,720
Oh my goodness.

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
Mr. Ma,

91
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
all you talk about
is Jichun Entertainment.

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,280
You brought it up
not only at the press conference,

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,080
but also in the internal meeting.

94
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,120
How much can it make in a year?

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm talking about new opportunities.

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,280
These new fields,

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,000
could be worth billions or more.

98
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,840
You've crossed the line.

99
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,920
Big brother is letting you
finish your point.

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,320
Why do you have no respect?

101
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Shut your mouth.

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,880
Do you even get to speak here?

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
Who put Jichun Entertainment
at risk?

104
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,640
Don't you know deep down?

105
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,960
Gao Lin.

106
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,920
What are you trying to do?

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
You're even scolding youngest?

108
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
So what?

109
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,640
Gao Lin.

110
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,480
At the press conference,

111
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
I did give you some respect, right?

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,360
But now,

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
you're talking to the youngest
like this?

114
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,880
Can't keep pretending, Mr. Ma?

115
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Back to that Ma Rulong again.

116
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,600
I can just leave Jichun if I want.

117
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,880
But don't forget,

118
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,240
I own 15% of Jichun's shares.

119
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
What if I decide to sell them?

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,520
What will investors think now?

121
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,360
From now on,

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
who would still
buy New Jichun's stock?

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,440
Oh.

124
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,320
Mr. Ma,

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,120
you might set a new record.

126
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,600
Been listed less than a month,

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
be delisted right away?

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
Since it's all out in the open,

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,360
just say it.

130
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,320
What do you really want?

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
Change the company charter.

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,320
Chairman,

133
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,280
every two years per term,

134
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,560
let's take turns running it.

135
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Gao Lin, are you out of your mind?

136
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
I'm clearer than you are.

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll tell you right now,

138
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,920
that's not happening.

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,520
Alright.

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Then there's no point in me staying.

141
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
You guys carry on.

142
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,120
It's fine.

143
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,360
Let's keep going.

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Are you sure about this news?

145
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm sure.

146
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
It's really reliable.

147
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
I've spent quite a bit

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
to get this info.

149
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,040
If that's really the case,

150
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,840
this could our best timing

151
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,480
to take down New Jichun.

152
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Exactly, bro.

153
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,760
We can't miss this chance.

154
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Wait,

155
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,760
I still need to check.

156
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,720
How do you want to check?

157
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,640
Got it, I'll handle it.

158
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,280
Wait for my update.

159
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,840
Tonight, everything's on me.

160
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,840
Mr. Gao is picking up the bill.

161
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

162
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
I can't go on anymore.

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,440
Seriously, I have no energy left.

164
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Let's have a rest.

165
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Hurry up.

166
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,680
Come on, chase me.

167
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,840
Come on.
Looks like you're not man enough.

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm not man enough?

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,800
Me?

170
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,960
Not man enough?

171
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,880
Where are you?

172
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
Hey, sweetheart?

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
Darling?

174
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,080
You're here.

175
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,520
Playing hide and seek?

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
Trying to hide?

177
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
In such a hurry, huh?

178
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Who wouldn't be?

179
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
Go get cleaned up.

180
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Ask too much.

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,720
Bro,

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
that woman said

183
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
she recorded everything.

184
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
If the media finds out,

185
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,360
Gao Lin is definitely done.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Bro,

187
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,880
what do we do now?

188
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
Come on,

189
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,520
let's go meet the male lead.
