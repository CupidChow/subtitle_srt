[Episode 8]

3
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,560
Madam, someone wants to see you.

4
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,760
Leave me alone.

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,000
It's...

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,280
Ma Rulong from Caiman Group.

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,760
He said you'd see him for sure.

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
Let him in.

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Murderer.

10
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Why are you here?

11
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
To show off?

12
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,760
Or see how low I've sunk?

13
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,360
Don't bother lying to me.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Dongsheng was killed by you.

15
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,040
The police just didn't find proof.

16
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,280
That's fine.

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,800
You can treat me as a murderer.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,960
But don't drag dad's

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
Jichun Entertainment into this.

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,960
In the end,
it's all for Jichun's business.

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Dad worked hard to build this group.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,600
We can't let it fall apart in our hands.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
What makes you think

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
we'd ruin the business?

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Jichun Trading, Jichun Manufacturing,
and Jichun Construction,

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,560
weren't you
the one who took them all over?

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
I just want to keep my promise,

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,880
the one I made to Dad.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,320
If Jichun wants to move forward,

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,080
every leader has to grow.

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,400
We can't just go with the flow.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
If you can't handle

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,320
the challenges I set,

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,560
how will you survive in business?

35
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,560
And about dad...

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Stop calling him "Dad" every time.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,840
He's my father,

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
not yours,

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
and definitely not our dad.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,680
Ma Rulong, just you wait.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
What Dongsheng couldn't do,

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll do it for him.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,440
Alright.

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,800
Hope you beat me this time.

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Call all Jichun Entertainment managers.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,760
I'm updating our plans.

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,920
Call me when you get to Guangzhou.

48
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,400
It's just
an entertainment center inspection.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
What could possibly happen?

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,800
Don't worry.

51
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
Still, be careful.

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Alright.

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,440
Hey, bro.

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
Let me go to Guangzhou with you.

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,400
You don't have to.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,520
Just drop me at the station.

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I'll wait in the car for you.

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,640
Yeah.

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
You did it to push Meiyin harder,

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
is it really worth it?

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
Jichun Entertainment is the slowest now.

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
She needs to realize

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,640
where society is now,

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and what people want
from entertainment.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,480
Alright.

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm setting out.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,920
Remember to call Qin Lan.

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040

Hong.

91
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,360
Hong, you don't need to persuade me.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
I'm not going back to Caiman.

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,000

95
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,920
I'll talk to you later.

97

98
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,120

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,400
Sorry about that.

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,760
No need to be sorry.

102
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,320
No, no, it's fine.

106

I followed you here.

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,720
I just followed you.

108
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,720
I see, to return my shoes.

109
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,960
