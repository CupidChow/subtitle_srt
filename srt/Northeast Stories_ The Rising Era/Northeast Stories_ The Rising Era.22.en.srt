00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,080
Ma Rulong.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,560
You still have the nerve to show up.

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,680
Wang Bin.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,120
Can you not make a scene here?

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm just here to see Dongsheng.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,120
Now that you've seen Dongsheng,

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,240
shouldn't you see me next?

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,000
You're a bit slow
taking over the Four Major Divisions.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,720
So here's the deal,

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,280
I'll help you pick up the pace.

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,280
Ou.

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,520
I've already drafted the contract
for you.

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
Three months from now,

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,840
at the Truck Trade Expo,

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,440
if Caiman Group

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,960
can build an engine as good as

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,400
the ones from Jichun Manufacturing,

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
all my shares,

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,920
will be given to you.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
But if you can't make it,

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
then Jichun Trading,

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,160
and Jichun Construction,

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
you hand them back.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,360
You've got this all planned out.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,880
Who even are you?

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,480
I'm his...

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,360
None of your business.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
Come on.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Are you signing or not?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,280
You have neither production line,

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
nor technology.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,200
How in three months,

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
will you build an engine?

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Three months later,

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,880
we'll listen to your engine.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,000
Is that even necessary?

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,600
It's none of your business.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Go plant your grapes.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,960
Jun.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Why are you so impulsive?

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
They're clearly trying to provoke you.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Besides,

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,680
Jichun Manufacturing is the hardest
of the Four Major Divisions.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
High risk means high reward.

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
That's why
this betting opportunity matters.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,760
But honestly,

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
our relationship with them...

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,760
Well,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,560
enough.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
We finally get to eat out.

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
I've been craving this forever.

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,960
Let's not talk about stressful stuff.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,400
Uncle.

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Coming.

57
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,440
Oh dear.

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,360
You're here.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,000
The usual three dishes?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Alright.

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Let's get some Baijiu.

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
Sure.

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,920
Okay.

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,360
Sis.

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,080
I want some too.

66
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,840
Sure.

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Just don't get too much.

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Yeah.

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
Lan, stop drinking.

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
What's wrong?

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,920
Hong.

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes.

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
Do you like Jun?

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
But you can't like him more than I do.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Right, Jun?

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,480
Hong.

77
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,960
You're not gonna compete with me,
right?

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,600
Jichun Manufacturing is really
goading us on.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,200
They just got us
to sign a VAM agreement.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Then they're launching the new car
today.

81
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,840
Tell Hong to come up here.

82
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
If there's something tough,

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
why do you have to find Hong?

84
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,920
Is this something I can't handle?

85
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
No, it's not.

86
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,720
I asked Hong and Huzi to help

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
check into the background

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,400
of the parts supplier
for Jichun Manufacturing.

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,800
You finish your work?

90
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm not afraid of handling more.

91
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,080
I want to do more for the Group,

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,520
and also,

93
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
to help ease your load a little.

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Alright.

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
When you're done,
I'll get you something else.

96
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,920
Right?

97
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,800
Alright, got it.

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,760
Then have Huzi,

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
and Hong come up.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Hu. Hong.

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
Jun wants to see you both.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Bro.

103
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,560
How's it going?

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
These are all suppliers,

105
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,280
mainly for large parts.

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,680
This is for small ones.

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Smaller scale,

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
easier to acquire.

109
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,080
Especially one of them,

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,120
the raw materials factory,

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,040
always supplies Jichun Manufacturing.

112
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,840
You can have a check.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've put these files together.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,120
Should be what you need.

115
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,960
Huzi,

116
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
about Fan Zibo,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,160
I need his details.

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Check on him today if you can,

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
then send me the info, alright?

120
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,920
Alright.

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
You've worked hard.

122
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm heading out now, bro.

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
Why are you staring at me?

124
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,680
Is something on my face?

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,880
It's nothing.

126
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
I just think
your work's so detailed now.

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,840
Are you out of things to talk about?

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
Am I really out of things?

129
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Yeah.

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Seven Character.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,760
Win.

132
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,880
Told you, it's always spot on.

133
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
One, two, three, four.

134
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Four Dan.

135
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,520
Fully concealed hand.

136
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Two hundred from each of you.

137
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,800
You, four hundred.

138
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,840
Pay up, pay up.

139
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,800
A strong wind,

140
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,120
blew wealth my way.

141
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
That's it.

142
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,960
It's not enough.

143
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,200
Didn't you win it all anyway?

144
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
Just spot me one round.

145
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
What do you mean spot you?

146
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,920
I might mess up my luck.

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,520
Lend me a little.

148
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
Are you kidding me?

149
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,000
Who borrows money at the table?

150
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,200
Then I'll go outside to borrow money.

151
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,320
That's not my problem.

152
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Who's asking for cash?

153
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,360
Bo.

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
You need some money?

155
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Let me have a few hundred.

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
I'll give it to him first.

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,520
Hang on a sec.

158
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Let me do the math first.

159
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,840
Back to zero.

160
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,920
Last time playing mahjong,
you took 1,500 from me.

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,480
That's one-five-zero-zero.

162
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Then you borrowed
another 2,000 in Pai Gow.

163
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Plus two-zero-zero-zero.

164
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Later, you borrowed 3,000 more.

165
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Plus three-zero-zero-zero.

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,880
So that's a total of 6,500.

167
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,560
Look.

168
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,320
I'll give you a discount.

169
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Multiply by one-point-eight-five.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
That's 12,025.

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
Forget the small change.

172
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
Just give me twelve grand.

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,880
That's a bit unfair.

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,800
I only borrowed about six grand.

175
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,520
Why are you still talking?

176
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,740
Bo.

177
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,800
Bo.

178
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,440
Bo, I'm sorry.

179
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,880
Bo.

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,800
Bo.

181
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,000
Bo.

182
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
Bo, I really don't have cash.

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,160
Bo.

184
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,840
I'll give you seven grand.

185
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,560
You talk too much.

186
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,520
Kneel down.

187
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
I'll give you seven grand, Bo.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,520
Bo.

189
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
Bo, just give me some time.

190
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,080
I really have no money.

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,880
Bo.
