00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,560
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,560
Who said I wouldn't show up?

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,160
I'm here now.

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,080
Hello, Mr. Gao.

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,040
Is it true?

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,200
Is the rumor real?

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,240
Of course that's not true.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Would I sell my own stuff?

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,640
Mr. Gao.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,240
Say a few words, Mr. Gao.

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
Is the rumor true, Mr. Gao?

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,560
Could you respond, please?

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,160
Really?

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,920
Is it true?

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,240
Mr. Gao, say something.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,840
Now, I'll make an announcement.

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,600
While the original business segments

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
of New Jichun

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
remain unchanged,

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
we'll add more investments on

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Internet,

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,800
New Energy,

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,920
and Biotechnology projects.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,120
The future belongs to technology.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,920
That's why I truly believe

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,000
New Jichun will

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,560
create something great,

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,760
and reach new heights.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Are those two hiding something?

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,280
Isn't it obvious by now?

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,200
It's pretty clear they are.

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,560
[One month ago]

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,080
New Jichun just went public.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
The crisis isn't over yet.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Guo Chongjiang will definitely

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
try to beat us fast.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
Short selling is the best bet.

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
Then let's get funds ready.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,520
To stop the stock price from crashing.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,400
That defense just works
on open threats.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,120
We'd better make use of the point

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
that he really wants to beat us fast.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,240
Let's lure him right into our trap.

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,400
I need you to act with me.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,360
Acting?

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Come on.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,400
We'll blow it.

49
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,520
That's true.

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,080
Might as well ask Wang Bin instead.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
What's that supposed to mean?

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
Why am I worse than Wang Bin?

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
I'll do it.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,280
I can act.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
Why couldn't I act?

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
Alright, you're in.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,920
Bro.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Gao Lin said at the press conference,

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
he's not selling
those stocks anymore.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Plus, his stocks have gone up.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Not selling anymore?

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Where's the tape?

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,360
The tape is right here.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
What do you want me to do with it?

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,560
Play it.

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Play it!

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Lan.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
Don't be mad at me.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
Talk to me, please.

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,000
Getting married is a big deal.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,080
You can't be so impulsive.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,600
Guo Chongjiang isn't what you think...

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,280
Don't say that about him.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Last time you said that,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
you really upset her.

76
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,760
Lan.

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't be upset with me.

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
Come on, talk to me.

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,800
Uncle Qin trusted you to me
when he left.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,520
You're like a real sister to me.

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,560
Family would never hurt you.

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
You have to listen.

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,760
Lan, is that you?

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,120
Lan.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,760
If it's you, knock twice.

86
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,840
Lan.

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't be scared.

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm here now.

89
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Lan.

90
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,520
Lan.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Lan.

92
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,080
Lan.

93
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,680
Lan.

94
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,120
There's a rope.

95
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,560
Lin.

96
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,480
Not gonna lie, you were cool just now.

97
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,760
You had me totally convinced.

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,040
Keep it low-key.

99
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,720
Let's stay low-key.

100
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Big brother,

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,160
if I played that role,

102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,440
I'd do way better than him.

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,880
Impossible.

104
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Am I being too easy on you?

105
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,160
Are you trying to get hurt?

106
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,880
You know what,

107
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,640
this time you did well,

108
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,480
I won't argue with you.

109
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
Like I'd ever argue with you.

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,640
Alright, stop joking.

111
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,520
This time, Guo Chongjiang,

112
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,120
put all of New Yongming on the line.

113
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,480
He had it coming, big brother.

114
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,600
Anyway,

115
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
we're the ones who won.

116
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,640
New Jichun has gone public.

117
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,640
So, in a way,

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
we got justice for Dongsheng.

119
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,560
Alright.

120
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,400
Cheers.

121
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,880
Come on.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
A toast to dad,

123
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,320
and Dongsheng.

124
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,280
To dad.

125
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,560
To Dongsheng.

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,640
Hello, Hong.

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
Why'd you call my number?

128
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
It's Hong.

129
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,360
Hey, Hong.

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
Which hospital?
