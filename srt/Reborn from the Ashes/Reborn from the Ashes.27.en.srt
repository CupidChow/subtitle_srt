You won't blame me, will you?

Come here.

Give it to me.

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,670
These jades were from your mother.

8
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,880
She and I each had one.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,150
Back then, I failed to cherish her

10

I should have been irreconcilable
with you,

with a deep and bitter hatred.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,110
The tragedy isn't recognizing a thief
as father,

29
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
but rather,

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,000
that the thief is truly the father.

31
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,320
How interesting.

Su Feiyi, how did you escape?

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,770
Of course, it's because the crown prince
felt sorry for me

42

Impossible.

187
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,720
They have no proof.

188
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,740
How could they possibly arrest me?

189
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,510
It's the crown prince.

190
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,950
He handed over the account book
proving your embezzlement

191
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
to the Emperor.

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,720
Traitorous son!

193
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,040
Traitorous son, traitorous son!

194
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,390
Your Highness,

195
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,390
we need to leave right now.

196
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,680
Leave?

197
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,800
Of course we must leave.

198
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
But not now.

199
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,840
Come here.

200
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,040
Yes.

201
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,560
By the decree of the Emperor,

202
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,430
during his tenure
as an adopted royal heir,

203
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,830
Wanyan Lie embezzled military pay,

204
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,410
and conspired with the criminal Su Guang

205
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,040
to poison over a thousand soldiers
in the Qilin Army,

206
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,190
cruelly and falsely executed
Yunzhou Governor Wen Muchen,

207
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,880
showing disregard for imperial law.

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,470
Someone!

209
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,510
Bring him to me at once.

210
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,720
Where is he?

211
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,070
The Prince's study caught fire.

212
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,270
The fire was too fierce.
I couldn't rescue him in time.

213
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,110
He perished in the blaze.

214
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,560
No, that can't be true.

215
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,880
