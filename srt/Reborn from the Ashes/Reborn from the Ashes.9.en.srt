[Episode 9]

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,710
My Lord,

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,030
so many lotus roots.

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,710
Can you finish all of them?

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,190
Lotus roots stay connected
even when broken.

Qi.

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,670
Are you alright?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,030
Mother...

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,030
I feel like I am going
to see Great Grandmother.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,230
That bad seed!

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,480
Don't worry.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,630
I won't spare a single one.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,440
Speaking of which,

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,070
why does she look so much
like Wen Yueqian?

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,760
Didn't you personally throw her
off the cliff?

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,400
Yes, Mother.

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,190
Not only did I throw her off the cliff,

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,710
I also ruined her face

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,510
and gouged out her eyes.

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,760
She probably won't survive.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,920
Could Wen Yueqian have turned
into a vengeful ghost

24
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,800
to demand my life?

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,760
What is there to fear?

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,980
There are no such things
as ghosts in this world.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,480
It's more likely someone
is pretending to be one.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,230
I remember

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,800
Wen Yueqian can't eat cherries.

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,760
If she eats them,
she will break out in a rash

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,150
and even struggle to breathe.

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,230
Then let's find a chance

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
to test her properly.

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,360
If she really is that vile woman,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,550
I'll make sure she goes back to hell
once more.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,230
Qingran,

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,850
I'm sorry to offend you
when you offered tea that day.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,590
Today, I come to apologize.

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,710
Please forgive me.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,440
These are freshly picked fruits
and some small gifts.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,710
Qi, you're truly too polite.

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,030
You don't have to do that.

43
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,400
I've already

44
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,070
forgotten the past.

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,630
What?

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,150
Is it that my things can't
catch your eyes?

47
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,510
Or is it that you won't forgive me?

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,190
If I don't forgive you,

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,880
will you insult me again

50
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,880
like you did that day?

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,920
Qingran,

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,190
I spoke without thinking that day.

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,230
I know I was wrong.

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,030
Qingran,

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,320
what must I do to earn your forgiveness?

56
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,320
You speak hurtful words,
and you naturally deserve a slap.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,630
Slap yourself five times.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,840
Then I'll forgive you.

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,590
You...

60
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,400
Looks like you still lack sincerity.

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Please leave.

62
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,630
I...

63
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,920
Is that enough?

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,760
Your sincerity isn't enough.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,300
This woman is so aggressive.

66
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,100
She's completely different
from Wen Yueqian.

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,250
Could it be that they just happen
to look the same?

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,190
No,

69
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,760
to be absolutely sure,

70
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,030
I must make her eat the cherries.

71
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,320
Qingran, are you satisfied?

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,190
So-so.

73
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,030
It's really sweet.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
Qi, have one too.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,440
Alright.

76
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,510
No rash appeared on her body.

77
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,760
Could it be that she's really not
Wen Yueqian?

78
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,150
Honey.

79
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,110
Qi, I was mistaken.

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,710
I thought it was Jin who returned.

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,110
Are you alright?

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,550
You didn't choke, did you?

83
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Let me help you.

84
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,800
I know how to do this.

85
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,440
Come on.

86
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,150
Just like this.

87
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,760
No need.

88
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,070
Has it come out yet?

89
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,110
Let me do it again.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Maybe I didn't hit hard enough.

91
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,550
Let me try one more punch.

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,880
This last one.

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,910
It will come out for sure.

94
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,280
Qi,

95
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,960
I told you

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,170
this trick really works.

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
Before,

98
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,000
my neighbor choked on a loquat.

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,990
The physician used this method
to get it out.

100
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,280
Hey, Qi,

101
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,630
I just saved you.

102
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,630
You didn't even say thank you.

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,800
Is this really how they teach manners
in the Mansion?

104
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,800
Thank you for saving my life.

105
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,070
You're welcome.

106
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070
But just now,

107
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,110
I slapped you a few times.

108
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,800
You won't hold a grudge
against me, right?

109
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,190
You was just saving me.

110
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,670
How could I possibly hold a grudge?

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,480
Qingran,

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,670
since when did you and Qi get so close?

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,190
Qi

114
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,440
just sent over a bunch of cherries.

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
So...

116
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,190
So...

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,550
I feel so dizzy.

118
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,640
[Hot Spring, Prince Zhenbei's Mansion]

119
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,480
You're awake.

120
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,550
Wanyan Jin.

121
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,800
Wanyan Jin, are you alright?

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,710
Defend the homeland!

123
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,710
Face death fearlessly!

124
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,510
Brothers,

125
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,880
cheers!

126
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,360
Cheers!

127
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,000
March!

128
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,880
If we hadn't been poisoned, we wouldn't
have suffered so many losses.

129
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
I'm afraid I won't last much longer.

130
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,150
This jade pendant belonged
to an old friend of mine.

131
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,920
You must take good care of it.

132
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,590
Father.

133
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,320
Take it.

134
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,070
Father, reinforcements have arrived.

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,230
Wanyan Lie,

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,030
what does this mean?

137
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,000
The Qilin Army is really amazing.

138
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,510
Despite being poisoned,
you still can push back the enemy.

139
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,190
You poisoned us?

140
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,400
Unfortunately, you realized it too late.

141
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,000
You shouldn't have stood in my way.

142
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,550
You abused your power
to embezzle military funds.

143
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,320
That is a grave crime.

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,880
Do you dare to kill me to cover it up?

145
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,550
So you really knew.

146
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,400
Then you

147
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,670
deserve an even worse fate.

148
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,840
I'll fight you to the end.

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,680
Father!

150
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,880
I will kill you.

151
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,760
No.

152
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,230
Don't.

153
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,070
Wanyan Jin,

154
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,110
you're awake.

155
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,840
How do you feel?

156
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,640
Last night, you touched it.

157
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,310
But now,

158
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,680
I can't touch it.

159
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,350
Your face...

160
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,350
It's healed.

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,350
Yi,

162
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,520
you've finally arrived.

163
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,880
You have no idea how much
I've missed you all this time.

164
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,520
Qi,

165
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,030
why did the one marrying Su Qingran
become the crown prince?

166
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,000
I was supposed to marry you.

167
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,560
I even convinced my father

168
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,390
to marry the eldest daughter
of the Su Family.

169
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,640
But why did an elder sister
suddenly appear?

170
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,110
I had to run from the wedding
at the last moment.

171
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,560
That's how Wanyan Jin ended up
marrying your sister instead.

172
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,800
But don't worry.

173
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,960
Once my father calms down,

174
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,880
I'll bring up marrying you again.

175
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,600
So it was all because of you

176
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,800
that Su Qingran
became the crown princess.

177
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,720
Qi, you're so thoughtful.

178
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,070
My sister was trapped
in the countryside since childhood.

179
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,270
This time she came back,

180
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,840
she made trouble everywhere.

181
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,720
But...

182
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't you think she looks strikingly
like Wen Yueqian?

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,680
Impossible.

184
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,190
She can't possibly be Wen Yueqian.

185
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,800
At first, I was shocked too.

186
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,350
But I've already checked.

187
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,560
She's not her.

188
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,000

how could she have survived unscathed?

192

It's just that when I look at her face,

193

I can't help but feel unsettled.

Yunzhou City is way more interesting
than the Capital City.

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,190
It's really fun.

203
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,600
I think what you like is food.
