193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,480
she should at least wash up first.

194
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,670
I'll help her clean up.

As you predicted,

203
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,390
this place

204
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,790
is only an intelligence relay point.

205
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
