[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 21]

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,480
Why are you so restless tonight?

4
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,920
Because I can't forget
what he did to you.

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,590
He deserves to die.

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,750
How did you know I would find him?

7
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,270
Great minds think alike.

8
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,440
If not for your kiss,

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,270
he wouldn't survive the night.

10
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,110
Why haven't you found the assassin yet?

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,400
Your Highness, his martial arts
are unpredictable.

12
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,110
There's no trace left behind.

13
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,190
You are really useless.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,800
Mother.

15
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,190
I want to rest a while.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,670
Then I will check on you later.

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,550
How could I fall for a woman
who looks exactly

18
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,440
like Wen Yueqian?

19
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,360
Jin, Qingran.

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,070
Are you here to meet our father's
new concubine?

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

22
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,270
Su Feiyi?!

23
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,630
Why is it you?

24
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,000
Why are you shouting like that?

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,880
From now on,
you must call her Auntie.

26
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,590
Your Highness, I realize I was wrong

27
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,160
about misunderstanding the crown prince.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,960
I specially made this lotus seed soup
for you.

29
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,360
Why are you all staring at me?

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,920
Where is your father?

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,750
This...

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,230
Su Feiyi

33
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,550
is my newly taken concubine.

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,100
From now on, we are all one family.

35
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,590
My Consort, take good care of her.

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
What?

37
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,590
Since when did she
become your father's concubine?

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
If she is not my concubine,

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,710
then whose concubine could she be?

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,920
Of course, she is yours.

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
I

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,750
pay my respects to you, Auntie.

43
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,750
I will take good care

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,920
of her.

45
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,630
Then thank you.

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,840
This account book

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
is really with you?

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
You have already seen what I copied.

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,550
You still don't believe it?

50
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,270
If you can protect me,

51
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,360
then in this world,

52
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,190
there will be no more account book.

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,550
Everyone, go back.

54
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,110
Go ahead.

55
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,520
Behave yourself inside the mansion.

56
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,710
I can guarantee your life is safe.

57
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,840
I understand.

58
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,070
Don't repeat your father's mistakes.

59
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,800
Get lost.

60
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,360
What are you doing?

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,670
Young Master Qi,

62
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,000
please show some respect.

63
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,840
I am your auntie now.

64
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,480
You keep tugging and pulling at me.
What kind of propriety is that?

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
It won't be bad if His Highness sees us.

66
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,400
Su Feiyi, you're insane.

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,400
You actually climbed
into my father's bed.

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,150
Wanyan Qi,

69
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,550
your judgment has always been poor.

70
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,880
You've never been able
to tell new from old.

71
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,190
All I feel

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
is that you're pitiful.

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Su Feiyi.

74
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,000
You...

75
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,320
You vile woman!

76
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,710
I'm going to slap you.

77
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
How dare you block me?

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,190
I am thinking for your sake.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,110
After all, if the wife is jealous
of the concubine,

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,670
and word gets out,

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,070
it will lower her status.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,360
If you were truly kind-hearted,

83
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,320
you wouldn't have climbed into his bed.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,520
Your Highness,

85
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,400
you can be careless with food,

86
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,590
but you can't be careless
with your words.

87
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,880
His Highness and I decided our fate
at first sight,

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,400
deeply in love with each other.

89
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,440
Decide your fate at first sight?

90
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,670
Saying something like that,

91
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,070
aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,190
Your Highness,

93
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,150
His Highness dotes on me dearly now.

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,270
After all, I am still young.

95
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,230
Maybe I can even bring new heirs.

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,750
You should wish him well instead.

97
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,480
You...

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,440
Let's go.

99
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,590
Wanyan Qi,

100
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,550
the ones you favored before
were nothing but monsters.

101
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,950
This Wanyan Lie has never been a fool

102
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,960
who forsakes profit for lust.

103
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,270
However,

104
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,400
after decades
without taking a concubine,

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,270
he openly favored Su Feiyi.

106
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,400
It is not his style.

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,710
I always feel

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
that their relationship is unusual,

109
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,520
as if they have exchanged something.

110
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,480
The Princess Consort will deal with her.

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,000
Sister,

112
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,070
long time no see.

113
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,550
Now that you are the Prince's concubine,

114
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
stop calling me sister.

115
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,400
Qingran,

116
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,880
since the Su Mansion was raided,

117
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,000
we haven't seen each other
for a long time.

118
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,840
I want to catch up with you today.

119
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,070
I wonder if you have some time.

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,440
Wen Yueqian.

121
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,500
Just say what you have to say.

122
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
Wen Yueqian,

123
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,670
returning to your original home,

124
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,070
does it bring a different feeling?

125
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,670
But honestly, I just can't understand.

126
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,710
You were clearly disfigured by me,

127
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,630
your eyes were gouged out,

128
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,000
and you were pushed off the cliff.

129
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
How did you survive all that?

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,920
Su Feiyi,

131
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,230
your eyes are beautiful,

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,750
so you must protect them well.

133
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,070
From now on,

134
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,960
wait for me to claim them in person.

135
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,110
I know you are Wen Yueqian.

136
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,630
But don't worry.

137
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,150
I won't reveal your identity.

138
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,880
Because I intend slowly

139
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,920
to make you suffer.

140
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,430
First, you climbed into the son's bed,

141
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,510
and now you serve his father.

142
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,800
A woman serves both father and son.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,350
Truly shameless.

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,040
Wen Yueqian,

145
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,960
I should be thanking you.

146
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,470
If it weren't for you,

147
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,880
I wouldn't have been able
to marry Wanyan Lie.

148
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,230
Since I can be Wanyan Jin's auntie,
I'll gladly accept it.

149
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,150
You shameless woman.

150
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,470
