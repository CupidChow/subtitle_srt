00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,440
Husband and wife bow to each other.

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,920

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,520
Madam,

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,590
you truly have miraculous healing hands.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,550
These little daisies were clearly wilted
a few days ago.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,000
After you tended them,

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,990
in just a few days, they started
to bloom again.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,920
It's getting late.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,140
I'm going back to rest now.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,070
Madam,

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,880
since His Highness passed away,

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,630
you've spent your days either sleeping
or tending to flowers.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,660
It's been like this every day
for a year.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,270
What a dull life you've led.

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,100
Tomorrow is
the Colorful Clouds Festival.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,100
You should go out
and get some fresh air.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,520
We'll go.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,520
Yes.

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,270
Is there anyone kind enough

24
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,840
to spare a copper coin?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,320
I haven't eaten for days.

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,320
Give me some money, please.

Let's say you luckily won again.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,990
What do you mean by "luckily"?

44
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,630
You're the one who cheated first.

45
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,110
I just made the game

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,360
more interesting.

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,960
Cheating is cheating.

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
You make it sound so noble.

49
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,550
Shame on you.

50
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,150
No cheating next time, understood?

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,110
That depends on my mood.

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,750
I'm neither human, god, nor demon.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,030
I've walked this world
for thousands of years.

54
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,550
I've met countless humans along the way.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,400
I realized humans are like trees,

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,070
yearning for the light up above,

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,150
while rooted in the darkness below.

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,520
It must be more light than darkness,

59
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,840
more good than evil.

60
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,360
Because human nature at birth

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,190
is inherently good.

62
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,160
What if I said human nature
is inherently bad?

63
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,480
You little thing.

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,320
Old thing,

65
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,190
then let's make a bet.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,800
18 beads in total,

67
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,480
gold beads represent good,
red beads represent evil.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,590
It's a deal.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,710
I've won.

70
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,320
How about that?

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,750
I'm telling you, in this world,

72
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,800
good outweighs evil.

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,880
You just happened to win
time after time.

74
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,710
What's there to be proud of?

75
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,670
Humans are selfish by nature.

76
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,320
Evil always outnumbers good.

77
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,190
I've lived longer than you,

78
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,740
and seen more than you have.

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,590
But facts speak louder than words.

80
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,110
Now, out of 18 beads, nine are golden.

81
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,630
Sooner or later,

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,110
I'll turn every single one
of your pearls

83
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,320
deep red.

84
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,850
Still talking tough after losing?

85
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,710
Look.

86
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,870
The two people at the bottom of the lake

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
actually harbor such great resentment
and will to survive.

88
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,320
How about

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,920
we bet one more time?

90
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,960
Come on.

91
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,270
Let's see how I make you admit defeat.

92
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,880
The game begins.

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
See that?

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,630
How deep is Wen Yueqian
and Xiao Jin's resentment,

95
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,890
and how strong is their belief
in revenge.

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,230
This time,

97
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,670
I'm sure to win.

98
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,880
Don't celebrate too soon.

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,690
I believe their true nature
is pure and kind,

100
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,380
and they will never
lose their conscience.

101
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,240
You don't understand.

102
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,230
When a person encounters unfairness,

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,360
pain,

104
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,320
hardship,

105
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,800
and darkness,

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
resentment and grievance

107
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,480
will arise.

108
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,000
Can't they repay evil with kindness?

109
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,040
Besides,

110
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,980
a gentleman is judged by actions,
not intentions.

111
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,210
What one thinks doesn't matter.

112
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,440
What one does matters.

113
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,630
Just wait and see.

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
This round...

115
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,070
You actually cheated.

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
How could you let Su Feiyi go?

117
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
How can this be considered cheating?

118
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,190
I only made the game more interesting.

119
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,800
As long as someone with pure Yang blood

120
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,000
pulls out the spear from his chest

121
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
and stabs it into my body.

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
He will vanish into dust.

123
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,190
You're heartless and unreasonable.

124
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,000
You old fool!

125
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,710
You're cheating again.

126
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,630
Show some humanity.

127
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,670
I was never human to begin with.

128
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,360
You're not human either, little one.

129
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,520
Foolish!

130
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,630
It is

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,360
like drawing water with a sieve.

132
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,060
You've been acting for so long,

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,330
yet you're still spouting nonsense
about refining

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,480
and supreme power.

135
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,670
In the end, it's kindness that wins.

136
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,230
Silence!

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,480
What a waste of effort.

138
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,710
Look at you, after all that fuss,

139
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,980
it still ended up being nothing.

140
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,750
You're celebrating too soon.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
The game isn't over yet.

142
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:45,920

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,630
