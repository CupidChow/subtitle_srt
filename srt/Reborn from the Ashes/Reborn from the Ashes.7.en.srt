00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,280
Where is the bride?

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,480
Master, something bad has happened.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,070
Lady Qingran ran off
through the back gate with a man.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,000
What?

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,190
Your Highness, please stay calm.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,320
Lord Su,

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,670
you really have a good daughter.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,670
There must be some misunderstanding,
Your Highness.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,590
I don't like the word
"misunderstanding".

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,130
No, it's not a misunderstanding.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,590
Your Highness, I was wrong.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,230
I will do everything
to find my daughter

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,420
and offer her with both hands.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,880
You really know how to surprise me.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,320
Someone!

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Qingran, we made it.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
You helped me get out like this.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,670
Prince Zhenbei's Mansion won't
let this go easily.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,800
Ran, don't be afraid. I'm here with you.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,590
I have only you in my heart.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,110
If I marry someone, it will only be you.

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,360
With your words,

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,110
I will never let you down.

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,760
Focus on staying alive first.

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,190
She's the bride of the Wanyan Family.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,670
How dare you take her away?

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,710
- Why him?
- Why is the groom Wanyan Jin now?

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,150
Why you? Where's the sickly one?

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,840
Come here.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,480
Wanyan Jin,

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,320
since you came alone,

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,190
I'll give you a special gift.

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,510
These were originally for Wanyan Qi.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Since you're so clueless,

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,030
I'll make sure you can't return.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,320
Just you?

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Kill him!

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,880
Wanyan Jin,

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,710
keep pretending.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,030
Listen carefully.

43
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,400
Those poisoned by this poison

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,630
will lose their inner strength
and suffer unbearable pain.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Killing you now

46
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,150
is easier than killing an ant.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Today,

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll personally send you on your way.

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,150
Farewell.

50
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,670
Why?

51
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,760
Because you killed Zhijin.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,630
I'm avenging her.

53
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,440
You vile woman!

54
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,760
I will kill you.

55
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,360
Using others to kill for you.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
You did a good job.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
What do you mean by that?

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,840
I don't understand a word.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,690
You deliberately lured Gong Shixian
to help you escape the marriage,

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,360
just to use me

61
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,190
to eliminate Gong Shixian.

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,840
You already knew this long ago.

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,230
Let's go.

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,150
I'll take you back for the wedding.

65
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,590
I killed that scoundrel
with my own hands.

66
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,190
Do you have no questions?

67
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,960
What do you want me to ask?

68
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,330
If you keep stepping back,

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,840
you'll fall.

70
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,030
Let me tell you,

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,880
never use those cheap tricks

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,440
in front of me again.

73
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,630
I hope what happened today

74
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,110
will not happen again.

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,760
You probably won't see it happen again.

76
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,280
The crown prince
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

77
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,440
was abducted by Gong Shixian

78
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,400
on his wedding day.

79
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,880
The two fought fiercely.

80
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,320
In the end,

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,880
they perished together.

82
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
[Su Mansion]

83
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,280
Mother,

84
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,510
how did Wanyan Jin
become the crown prince?

85
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,280
Master, Concubine Gong,

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,670
Lady Qingran has returned.

87
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,590
Does she even have the face
to come back?

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
She ran off with a man
on her wedding day.

89
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,190
She's truly brought shame to our family.

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,250
You ungrateful daughter!

91
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,920
How dare you come back again?

92
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,550
Now the entire city of Yunzhou has heard

93
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,160
that on the very day of her wedding,
the lady of the Su Family

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,960
actually eloped with a random man.

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Qingran,

96
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,000
tell us who that man is.

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,230
I can even plead with our father
for you.

98
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,960
At worst, we can just accept it.

99
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,840
The so-called man you speak of,

100
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm afraid you won't be able to laugh

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,510
once you find out who he is.

102
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,510
No matter who it is,

103
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,800
the dirty things you did

104
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,070
are now known to everyone.

105
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,960
Exactly.

106
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,190
You were never a virgin.

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,800
In the brothel, you had been
with all sorts of men.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,590
Why would you care about shame?

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,550
You are truly the disgrace
of our family.

110
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,710
Today, I will give you a lesson

111
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,840
for your late mother's sake.

112
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,960
Su Qingran,

113
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,510
how dare you!

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,190
How dare you hit a senior like that?

115
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,150
Senior?

116
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,440
If I show her respect,

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,030
I'll call her Concubine Gong.

118
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,440
If I don't show respect to her,

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,190
she's just a lowly concubine
unfit for public view.

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,880
When has a concubine
ever been this arrogant?

121
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,800
According to the law and rites,

122
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,870
favoring a concubine over the wife
is forbidden.

123
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,880
Father,

124
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,550
have you forgotten
all the law and rites?

125
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,150
By disregarding the law and rites
like this,

126
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,780
are you not afraid

127
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,000
of losing the people's trust

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
and jeopardizing your official position?

129
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,190
You!

130
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,440
Today, I will use the family rules
to teach you a lesson.

131
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,880
Mother...

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,710
Enough!

133
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,670
Su Qingran,

134
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,190
how dare you strike my mother?

135
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,430
Because I am the legitimate daughter
of the Su Family.

136
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,630
Because I am your sister.

137
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,670
Today,

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,150
I will represent the Su Family

139
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,290
and properly discipline these pests
in the backyard.

140
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,280
Stop!

141
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,190
It seems

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,440
that letting you roam freely
all these years

143
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,110
has made you lose your manners.

144
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,110
You are truly undereducated.

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,070
When my mother passed away,

146
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,030
you not only took her dowry,

147
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,190
but also abandoned me
in the countryside all these years.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,710
And now,

149
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,070
what right do you have to
judge me?

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,510
All of you

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,480
live off my mother's dowry

152
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
for food, clothing, and shelter.

153
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
Your mother married into the Su Family,

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,630
in life,

155
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,190
she was one of us;

156
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,070
in death,

157
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,000
she remains a part of the Su Family.

158
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,630
Her dowry has always belonged
to the Su Family.

159
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,150
On your wedding day,
you ran off with a man,

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,390
bringing shame to the Su Family.

161
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,110
You end yourself now.

162
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,680
Then we can explain it
to the Wanyan Family.

163
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,840
Grandmother, Su Qingran
has caused such disgrace,

164
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,230
the Wanyan Family will surely
reject her for good.

165
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,030
It might even bring trouble to us.

166
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,350
How about I marry into the Wanyan Family
in her place

167
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,390
and take her body with me to apologize,

168
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,470
to show the Su Family's sincerity?

169
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,070
You really are scheming.

170
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,680
At first, the groom is that sickly one,

171
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,800
so you made me marry him
in place of you.

172
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,390
Now the groom's the crown prince,

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,270
and you're eager to marry him.

174
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,560
You're truly shameless.

175
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,430
What are you waiting for?

176
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,800
Listen to the Madam.

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,520
Send her on her way.

178
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,390
Who dares?

179
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,390
Am I really going to die here?

180
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,990
I thought that being reborn
would allow me to punish the wicked

181
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,530
and seek justice for my father,

182
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,430
I didn't expect it to end
in failure after all.

183
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,030
Zhijin, I can no longer avenge you.

184
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:29,840
♪But in the twilight,
the autumn wind is sorrowful♪

185
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,110
The way you operate

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,680
truly surprises me.

187
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
Why are you still alive?

188
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,390
I haven't even got married with you.

189
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,270
How could I die before you?

190
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,110
Your Highness, my daughter dared

191
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,600
to escape the marriage.

192
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,150
So we are dealing with her

193
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,600
today,

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,000
to give you and Prince Zhenbei
an explanation.

195
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,310
An explanation?

196
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,520
Deal with her?

197
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,640
Since she is to marry
into Prince Zhenbei's Mansion,

198
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,760
she is my wife.

199
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,960
Her life and death should be decided
by me.

200
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,270
How could I allow you
to bully her like this?

201
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
Governor Su, you clearly don't
take me seriously.

202
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
That's not true.

203
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,310
How could I be disrespectful to you?

204
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,960
Remember, she will be
the only crown princess in the mansion.

205
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,760
Her fate isn't for you to decide.

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,960
That man who threatened me
to elope with him

207
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
is actually your nephew,

208
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,520
Gong Shixian.

209
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,430
What now?

210
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,940
Perform the wedding ceremony.

211
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,470
There are no guests left.

212
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,520
Why bother?

213
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,800
Just going through the formalities.

214
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,920
Do you really think I fall for you

215
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,430
and want to marry you?

216
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,270
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

217
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,490
Red candles reflect double happiness,

218
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,110
Heaven and Earth witness our love.

219
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,110
Second bow to the deities.

220
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,560
Spiritual blessings descend upon us.

221
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,600
Mutual love without doubt.

222
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,290
Husband and wife bow to each other.

223
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,310
May we walk hand in hand
through this life,

224
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,520
promising to grow old together.

225
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,640
Well...

226
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,310
Hey.

227
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
What are you doing?

228
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,800
Enter the bridal chamber.

229
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,520
