See?

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,240
This is the consequence
of not serving the guests properly.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,670
It's even burnt.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,640
How can you serve men like this?

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,350
If a honored guest notices you,

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,430
make sure to serve him properly.

I have to find a way to escape from here
with Zhijin.

Young Master Gong has specifically
requested you to serve him.

Zhijin is injured like this.
How could she possibly go?

What?

Qianyue did it on purpose.

She usually refuses to serve guests.

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,560
And she actually hit our guest so badly.

I just saw Young Master Gong act
without thinking.

69
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,840
If Zhijin got seriously hurt,
