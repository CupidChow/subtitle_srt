[Episode 26]

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,800
I've already told Wanyan Lie

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,920
that we will be away for a few days.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,750
I'll deliver the account book
to the Emperor.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,110
You must stay hidden until I return.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,710
Yeah.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,400
You have to come back safely.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,480
I will.

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,230
Prince Han? Why are you here?

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,480
Qingran, why not

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,110
stay at my place for a few days?

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,800
Thank you for your kindness.

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,440
I've been away too long.
It's time to return.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,040
You probably can't go back
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion yet.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,880
Because of the account book.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,840
You...

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,440
How do you know?

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,750
The Emperor of this reign

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,880
is actually my own brother.

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,070
The Emperor has long been suspicious
of Prince Zhenbei.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,110
Prince Zhenbei is opposing the court,

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,660
which means he is opposing me as well.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
If it weren't for that,

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,960
I wouldn't have made a second trip
to Yunzhou City.

26
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,270
You can rest assured.

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,480
I am here

28
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,070
to protect you.

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,840
Please.

30
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,440
Who is it?

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,320
Why do you confine me here?

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,270
You don't need to know.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,040
Just stay here.

34
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,190
Maybe one day, if I'm in a good mood,

35
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,960
I'll let you out.

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,520
Don't leave.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,750
Let me out.

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,960
Who exactly are you?

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,590
It's been half a month,
and he still hasn't returned.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,920
He wouldn't...

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,360
Thank you.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,620
It's been so long already.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,590
There's still no news from Wanyan Jin.

44
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,270
Could it be that he...

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,590
Impossible.

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,550
I'm just worried your trust
might be in vain.

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,630
After all, Wanyan Lie

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,750
is Wanyan Jin's father.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
Would he really hand the account book
to the Emperor?

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
This account book

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,550
was obtained only after much effort
by Wanyan Jin and me.

52
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,960
He would never betray me.

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,750
Don't be so sure.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,840
After all, a wife

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,920
and a father by blood,
which weighs more?

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,100
Think carefully about that.

57
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,480
But he's not Wanyan Jin.

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,230
What?

59
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,040
Then who is he?

60
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,230
You don't need to know all this.

61
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,230
Go back early.

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,880

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,110

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,480
Yes.

His place is very safe.
No need to worry.

Do you really trust Prince Han
that much?

77
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,670
He has helped me a lot these days.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,800
He was sent by the Emperor
to investigate Prince Zhenbei.

79
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,110
He also knows about the account book.

80
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,110
He should be trustworthy.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
About the account book,

82
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
it might be the work of Wanyan Lie.

83
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,170
I need to go back to the Mansion
and investigate.

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,070
Then I'll go with you.

85
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,150
No.

86

I will make sure you both disappear
without a trace.

Didn't I tell you
not to come here again?

112

Why are you here again?

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,150
I've come back with news for you
this time.

114

Wanyan Jin is not your biological son.

115

You're talking nonsense.

116
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,670
If I want to return to the Mansion,

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,520
I must have an equal bargaining chip.

118

How could this be false news?

119

If you don't believe me,
you can verify it yourself.
