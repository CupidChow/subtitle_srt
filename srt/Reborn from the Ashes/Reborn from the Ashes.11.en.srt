[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,880
Wen Yueqian.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,150
What did you say?

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,200
You've been staring
at Wen Yueqian's memorial tablet.

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,960
I thought you knew her.

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,750
Your Highness, we should go back.

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,270
You still haven't answered me.

9
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,320
Your Highness,

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,440
we are the host today.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
We've been out too long.

12
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,960
We might be neglecting Prince Han.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,270
Your Highness, Prince Han sent me
to find you and Her Highness.

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,040
See? Even Prince Han is urging us.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Mother.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,630
Su Qingran somehow learned archery.

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,800
She shone brilliantly at the banquet.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,480
What's more, she must've used
some bewitching tricks

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,690
to get the crown prince
to look for medicine for her.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,270
That cured the scars on her face.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Her face has healed?

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,270
Mother,

23
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,070
the crown prince won't spare me
a glance.

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,480
What should I do?

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Instead of daydreaming
about useless things,

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,800
you'd better learn more from Qingran.

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,360
You really embarrassed me.

28
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,150
Go back and reflect on yourself.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,520
Why didn't you say such things before?

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,270
It's just because

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,840
Su Qingran became the crown princess

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,960
and you want to curry favor with her,

33
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,270
while neglecting the two of us.

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,110
Gong Xi, enough.

35
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,000
Let me tell you,

36
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,630
Su Qingran hates you.

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,550
You abandoned her all these years.

38
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,320
What feelings could you possibly have?

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,840
She will never be your ally.

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
She's nothing but trouble.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,150
Poor Shixian,

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,800
he died so mysteriously.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,320
He was the only son of the Gong Family.

44
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,750
How am I supposed
to explain this to them?

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,320
Crying like this is hardly dignified.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Madam,

47
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,190
my family came
to demand answers yesterday.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,880
They say the family lineage has ended.

49
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,040
The Gong Family's lineage,

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
let it end then.

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,670
With a nephew like yours,

52
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:58,880
the lineage

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,150
will eventually die out.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,040
You should worry more
about the Su Family's lineage.

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,150
Look at your belly,

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,520
so disappointing.

57
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,670
All these years,

58
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,270
you still haven't given birth to a son.

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,230
Madam,

60
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,480
you shouldn't say things like that.

61
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,360
If you want fertile fields
to yield crops,

62
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,070
someone has to till the soil
and sow the seeds.

63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,710
Your son has taken tonic for years,

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,750
but there's been no sign of improvement.

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,270
Xi,

66
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,550
didn't we agree not to bring this up?

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,630
We were discussing the Gong Family,

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,960
so why drag this matter into it?

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,670
I'm concerned about the Su Family.

70
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,440
After all, Shixian had this accident
in our mansion.

71
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,070
I fear they might act recklessly

72
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,230
and do something harmful
to the Su Family.

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,750
So, what do you suggest we do?

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,440
How about

75
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,270
we pay a visit
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,320
and speak with Su Qingran?

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,250
She's the one
who stirred up this matter,

78
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,400
so let her resolve it.

79
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,110
If she manages to calm things down,

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,150
the Gong Family will remember
our kindness.

81
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,920
If she ignores it,

82
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,400
after all, we did try
to seek justice for her.

83
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,960
But Prince Zhenbei's Mansion
holds too much power.

84
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,040
We are truly helpless.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,670
This way,

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,880
all the blame could be placed
on Su Qingran.

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,750
Then our family could walk away clean.

88
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,840
Who should go?

89
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,480
Why not have the Madam go?

90
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm not going.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,360
I still want to live a few more years.

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,630
You ungrateful wretch,

93
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,840
just wait for me to die early.

94
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,550
Ungrateful? Me?

95
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,230
Su Qingran is the real ungrateful one.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,840
She even insulted our family
at the banquet.

97
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,840
Who knows what worse things
she might do next?

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,710
If the one marrying the crown prince
were Feiyi,

99
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,110
who knows how many benefits
it could bring to us?

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,960
Wasn't it your lousy idea back then

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,790
to insist on bringing Su Qingran back
to be a substitute bride?

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,750
Otherwise, Yi would
be the crown princess by now.

103
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,110
I was just offering a suggestion.

104
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,190
In the end, isn't it still you
who makes the final decision?

105
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,520
If you didn't approve,

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,230
how could we dare act on our own?

107
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,040
Qingran

108
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,710
really forgets where she came from.

109
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,590
This time when she returns,

110
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,150
we must properly teach her the rules.

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,400
Let her remember where her roots lie.

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,800
[Su Mansion]

113
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,400
When Qingran returns this time,

114
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,520
we must teach her a lesson.

115
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,590
With the crown prince here,
it's probably tricky to do that.

116
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,000
Since she has entered the door,

117
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,590
we certainly have ways to deal with her.

118
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,150
Yi, you must behave well

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,440
and win the crown prince's favor.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,320
I see, Mother.

121
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
No matter how late she arrives,

122
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,190
we'll wait until she shows up.

123
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,360
This time,

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
we have to teach her a lesson.

125
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,550
Why does my head hurt so much?

126
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,040
You drank way too much
with Prince Han last night.

127
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,320
Honestly, I almost thought
you were his wife.

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
Your Highness, you...

129
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,710
Jealous, huh?

130
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,590
Impossible.

131
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,190
You don't even like me.

132
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,750
You're my woman.

133
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,960
Yesterday you drank so much
with Prince Han

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,190
that I had to carry you back.

135
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,000
You've really embarrassed our family.

136
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,920
Did I embarrass myself?

137
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,070
Now that you're sober,

138
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,150
then go back.

139
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,440
Look at me. I almost forgot.

140
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,400
What time is it now?

141
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,710
A quarter past three.

142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,750
If I go back at this hour,
won't that just cause trouble?

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm not going back today.

144
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,650
I'll return tomorrow.

145
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,880
Wait, why are you so eager?

146
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,070
I am just upholding
the family's reputation.

147
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,040
Otherwise, outsiders might think
we lack proper manners.

148
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,230
Alright then.

149
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,840
I'll accompany you back tomorrow.

150
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,840
Why does he leave just like that?

151
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
Jin, Qingran,

152
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,880
how did you know I was coming to see you
and wander around Yunzhou City?

153
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,270
It seems that you are all ready.

154
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,960
I...

155
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,230
We are going...

156
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,840
I came to Yunzhou City this time

157
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,640
because I heard
this city is rich in resources

158
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,290
and blessed with enchanting scenery.

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,680
Today, you two must give me a good show.

160
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,600
Or else,

161
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,880
I have to report it to Prince Zhenbei.

162
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,110
Looks like we can't go back today.

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
[Su Mansion]

164
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,960
That annoying Su Qingran

165
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,190
made us wait in vain all day yesterday.

166
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,510
When she comes back today,
we won't let her off easy.

167
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,880
It's not even the right time
for Buddhist worship now.

168
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,370
Why hasn't Grandmother shown up yet?

169
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,610
You really think
she's doing Buddhist worship?

170
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,230
She's just making excuses

171
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,760
because it's cold.

172
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,270
Xuan,

173
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,600
why didn't you bring me out
with you today?

174
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,490
Luckily, I was smart enough
to follow along.

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,270
Greetings, Your Highness.

176
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,640
Where are you off to today?

177
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Just wandering around.

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,720
Why don't you take me with you?

179
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,510
Here.

180
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,430
These candied hawthorns
are absolutely delicious.

181
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,190
Ran, why don't you give it a try?

182
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,230
You really know how to stir things up.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,800
[Su Mansion]

184
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,190
This weather is perfect for hot pot.

185
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,880
Today we enjoy hot pot with wine,

186
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,900
carefree and happy.

187
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Here.

188
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,960
How about

189
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,390
you give it to me?

190
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,430
That way, everyone will have some
in their bowl.

191
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
[Su Mansion]

192
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,350
Prince Han asked the crown princess
to join the outing today.

193
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,390
So, she will not return.

194
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,370
She will definitely come back tomorrow.

195
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,070
Wanyan Jin changes his mind faster
than the weather.

196
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,800
He said he wouldn't come back,
and he really didn't.

197
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,680
That annoying Su Qingran.

198
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,310
Today, I won't be fooled again.

199
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,430
Concubine Gong,

200
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,820
the crown princess has returned.

201
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,350
Where is she?

202
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,310
I saw her getting into a carriage
at the palace gate and heading this way,

203
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,600
so I hurried back to report it.

204
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,000
And more,

205
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,000
I also saw that she was returning alone.

206
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,660
The crown prince did not accompany her.

207
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,720
Someone!

208
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,040
Bring all things out.

209
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,510
Let's go.

210
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,190
I want to use this chance
to find the account book

211
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,960
to clear my father's name.

212
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,310
The crown prince really
doesn't care about her.

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,920
Only she comes back.

214
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,310
What does this mean?

215
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,190
It's just to ward off bad luck for you.

216
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,480
You have a bad fate chart.

217
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
You caused your mother's death
when you were young.

218
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,160
Later, you almost brought harm
to Grandmother.

219
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,300
Luckily, Grandmother is blessed
with great fortune.

220
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,430
And now, you've caused
Shixian's death as well.

221
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,350
We're doing this
for the crown prince's own good.

222
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,470
Qingran, be careful not

223
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,840
to bring misfortune to the crown prince.

224
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,430
Fine then.

225
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,640
I return to my parental home.

226
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,110
You not only humiliate me,

227
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,670
but also curse the crown prince to die.

228
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,190
Do you really think
Prince Zhenbei's Mansion means nothing?

229
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,690
The crown prince was unwilling
to accompany you for the return,

230
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,230
and did not even prepare the gift
that signifies status,

231
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,560
letting you come back empty-handed.

232
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,390
Do you think he'll back you up?

233
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,270
Even if the crown prince comes,

234
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,230
you still have to dispel the bad luck.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,190
