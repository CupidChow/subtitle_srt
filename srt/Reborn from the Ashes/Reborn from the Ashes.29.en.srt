00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 29]

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,360
Your Highness,

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,850
you also know medical skills.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,150
Then you must understand

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,690
the Prince's poison
is attacking the heart meridian.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,110
I'm afraid...

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,960
How could this happen?

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,810
Just a few days ago,
he was perfectly fine.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,400
And this poison is strange.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,070
Neither of us can identify it.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
Right now, unless we find the poisoner,

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,840
otherwise....

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,520
Your Highness,

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
this was just found at the door.

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,040
If you want to save him, come to me.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,230
Xuan.

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,040
I am the crown princess.
I am the crown princess.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,590
I was born noble; no one can defeat me.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,800
Miss, why haven't you gone home yet?

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,040
I am the crown princess.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,230
Don't touch me.

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,070
I am the crown prince.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,550
Let's go home.

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,230
I am the crown princess.

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,750
I'm going home.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,800
Welcome to our wedding.

28
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,230
Prince Han, what do you mean?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,590
Well,

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,090
this is the wedding robe
I prepared for you.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,580
What do you mean by this?

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,040
I wrote the letter.

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,070
I also poisoned him.

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,520
Why did you do this?

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,360
Why?

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,520
Because

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,070
I want to have you.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll kill

39
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,320
whoever you love.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,590
You have lost your mind.

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
How did you end up like this?

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
This is my true self.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
Want the antidote?

44
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,920
Then marry me.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,960
[If you want to save him,
come to me. Xuan]

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Qian.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,150
Jin.

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,000
Let go of my woman.

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,670
Your woman?

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,040
Sorry,

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,150
but now,

52
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,840
she belongs to me.

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,000
Yan Shaoxuan,

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,710
you openly took my wife.

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,750
Aren't you afraid
the world will mock you

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,090
or that you'll face retribution?

57
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,960
Retribution?

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,150
Not only did I take your wife,

59
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,070
I also stole your account book

60
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,270
and exposed your true identity.

61
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,480
Do I have any retribution?

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,840
In the end, I had both power

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,270
and beauty.

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,670
Why did you do this?

65
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,920
So it was all your doing.

66
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,520
I did everything

67
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,110
for you.

68
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,040
Who exactly are you?

69
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,040
No, you're not even human.

70
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,360
Ah.

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,590
You've found me out.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
But,

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,630
anyone who knows my secret

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,110
must die.

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,630
No!

76
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,590
Jin. Jin.

77
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,670
Jin, are you alright?

78
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,110
Jin!

79
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't!

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,150
Don't!

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,670
Jin!

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,710
Want to save him?

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,400
Say you love me,

84
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,440
and I'll let him go.

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
No.

86
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,360
Love...

87
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,440
I love you.

88
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,440
Not sincere enough.

89
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,670
No.

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
Kiss me.

91
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,230
No.

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,850
You're crossing the line.

93
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,860
Let's go.

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,590
Hurry, let's leave.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,920
You've ruined my plan.

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,800
Hey!

97
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,070
You were the one who sealed me first.

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,880
Now you're accusing me.

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,710
If you hadn't suddenly appeared,

100
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,540
I would have definitely won this game.

101
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,630
It's because you kept interfering
all along.

102
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,110
Even if you win,

103
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,920
it wouldn't be a fair victory.

104
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,590
It's time to end this.

105
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,170
Hurry and go after them.

106
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,440
Oh.

107
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,040
Jin.

108
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,360
Jin,

109
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,190
are you alright?

110
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,920
Qian, don't worry.

111
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,270
I'm fine.

112
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,480
You've been coughing blood.
How could you be fine?

113
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,400
I won't die.

114
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,110
I finally caught you.

115
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,110
Yan Shaoxuan,

116
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,750
what exactly do you want?

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,710
I want your

118
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,360
pure Yang blood.

119
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,480
Once I have your pure Yang blood,

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,070
I will gain supreme power.

121
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,270
At the right moment,

122
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,880
I will become Lord of the Three Realms.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,800
A few lives mean nothing to me.

124
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,750
Want to see Yunzhou City
run red with blood?

125
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,840
I will never let you succeed.

126
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,670
You are no match for me.

127
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,000
Yet you still dare to block my path.

128
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,000
Jin...

129
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,670
Even if I lose my life,

130
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,150
I will fight you to the death.

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Don't act so righteous.

132
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,590
Kindness

133
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,710
is just an excuse of the weak.

134
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
Only power

135
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,800
is the law of the strong.

136
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,000
Xiao Jin!

137
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,520
Don't you understand yet?

138
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,880
Now this world

139
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,070
is under my command.

140
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,750
Yan Shaoxuan,

141
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,040
no matter what kind of person you are,

142
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,630
we will never fear you,

143
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,520
nor will we stand by
and watch you do harm.

144
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Is that so?

145
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,150
Want to kill me?

146
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
It's not impossible.

147
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,270
As long as someone with pure yang blood

148
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,710
pulls out the spear from his chest

149
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,400
and stabs it into my body.

150
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,880
Why tell us this?

151
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,720
You won't do such a thing.

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,390

Haven't we already married?

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,880
Yes, but the wedding ceremony
is not held yet.

195
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,560
What if my life

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,840
only has its last moment left?

197
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,440
I'd hold the wedding ceremony with you.

198
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,270
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

199
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,350
Red candles reflect double happiness,

200
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,000
Heaven and Earth witness our love.

201
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,800
Second bow to the deities.

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,070
Spiritual blessings descend upon us.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,270
Mutual love without doubt.

204
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
Husband and wife bow to each other.

205
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,720
May we walk hand in hand
through this life,

206
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,190
