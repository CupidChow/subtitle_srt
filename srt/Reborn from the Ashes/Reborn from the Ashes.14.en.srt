[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 14]

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,550
Let's see where you can hide.

4
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,640
Master.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,840
Master.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,790
Master.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,640
You two adulterers...

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,000
Master.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,510
Master, please hear me out.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,000
Get back home with me.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,600
Just wait and see how I deal with you.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,790
It's time to settle
Su Feiyi's family matters.

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,640
Master...

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,630
Master, I was momentarily confused.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
For the sake of all the years

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,090
I've devoted myself wholeheartedly
to the family,

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,720
please forgive me this once.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,960
Go away.

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,800
Someone!

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,720
Take this shameless woman

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,520
away

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,750
and drown her in the cage.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,320
No!

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,550
Mother.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,440
Father, Mother has been with you
all these years.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,990
Your relationship has always been good.

27
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,750
She must have been deceived by him.

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,200
Master, you care about Feiyi most.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,990
If I were punished by being drowned
in a cage because of this matter,

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,600
it would ruin Feiyi's reputation.

31
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,680
How will she ever marry in the future?

32
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,440
When you were out with others,
did you ever think of Feiyi's name?

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,470
Father, I beg you.

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,440
She is right.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,270
If this matter gets out,

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,350
it would bring shame upon me

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,240
and disgrace the reputation
of our family.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,550
Father, please spare her.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,910
Father, why not send her
to Lianhua Nunnery for tonsure?

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,720
And announce to the public

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,770
that it is to pray
for Grandmother's blessing.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,560
Su Qingran,

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,230
you wretched woman.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,350
You actually want to drive me away.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,950
Concubine Gong,

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,040
you falsely accused me
of pushing Grandmother into the river,

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,950
forced me out of Su Mansion,

48
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,470
and personally killed my mother.

49
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,120
You were so ruthless
to my mother and me back then.

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
Now that it's your turn,
you can't bear it.

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,840
Nonsense.

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,230
I never did any of those things.

53
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,750
Bring her up.

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Miss, she's here.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,510
Aren't you He Tao,
Gong Xi's maidservant?

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,440
You fell into a well and died back then.

57
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,070
How are you still alive?

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
Master, Madam Dowager, Lady Qingran.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,230
Lady Qingran.

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,600
Lady Qingran,

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,750
you're back.

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,280
Is it true Concubine Gong
caused my mother's death?

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,350
Yeah.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,510
Back then, I saw with my own eyes
how she poisoned Madam,

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,510
and pushed Madam Dowager into the water
to blame it on Lady Qingran.

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,400
I wanted to tell Madam Dowager
the truth.

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,560
But Concubine Gong found it out.

68
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,670
She pushed me into the well.

69
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,470
Fortunately, I survived.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,670
All these years, in order to keep her
from finding me,

71
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,720
I've been living under a false identity.

72
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Concubine Gong,

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,560
my mother treated you well back then.

74
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,720
Yet you showed no gratitude.

75
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,400
Instead, you poisoned and killed her.

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,880
She brought it upon herself.

77
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,510
She knew I admired Master
but always blocked me.

78
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,630
She claimed it was for my own good.

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,790
In truth, she couldn't bear
to see me well.

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,040
She just wanted
to protect her superiority.

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Since she was unkind first,

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,400
don't blame me for poisoning her

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,230
and then throwing her beloved daughter
back to the countryside,

84
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,310
making her restless even in death.

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,520
You're just a maidservant,
yet you betrayed your master,

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,670
and even climbed onto my son's bed.

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,330
You have the nerve to justify yourself?

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,470
You shameless wretch.

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Qingran,

90
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,600
I've heard so many rumors about you,

91
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,040
which have caused you
quite a bit of grievance.

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,990
Please forgive me.

93
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,310
Zhijin, will you forgive her?

94
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,040
Grandmother,

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,990
whether I forgive you or not,

96
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,790
it's not for me to decide.

97
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,400
Father,

98
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
let me perform the tonsure ceremony
for Concubine Gong.

99
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,720
In this life,

100
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,990
I never want to see
this disgusting woman again.

101
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,430
Stay far away from me.

102
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,410
What are you trying to do?

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
Mother! Mother!

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,160
Concubine Gong,

105
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,960
you have no mercy.

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,230
You killed my mother.

107
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,430
You showed no regard for life.

108
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,430
That is your first crime.

109
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,840
You hid ill intentions,
framed the legitimate daughter,

110
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,960
and even hurt Grandmother.

111
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,990
That is your second crime.

112
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,510
You didn't follow wifely virtues,
committing adultery with others.

113
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,550
That is your third crime.

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,350
I spared you from drowning in a cage.
You should be grateful.

115
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,840
Your worldly ties are severed.

116
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,790
You will stay at Lianhua Nunnery

117
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,080
for the rest of your life.

118
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,870
Zhijin,

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,400
I finally avenged you.

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Qingran,

121
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,350
you really put on a good show for me.

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,550
Concubine Gong's romantic history
is really rich.

123
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,910
You know everything.

124
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,840
You can not only imitate handwriting,

125
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,760
but also help with tonsure.

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,600
You even know about the tonsure.

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,760
You sent people to watch me.

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,550
We don't even have the most basic trust
between us.

129
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,550
It's not that I don't trust you,

130
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,430
I'm just curious.

131
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,840
After all,

132
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,640
my wife

133
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
is far too mysterious.

134
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,160
Others say I'm complicated,

135
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,840
mysterious,

136
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,640
but I don't mind that at all.

137
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,910
That way, no one remembers my past
in the brothel.

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,550
I hate being deceived
more than anything.

139
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,110
Qingran, you'd better not

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,760
deceive me.

141
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,080
Gong Xi and Ye Changyuan
caused quite a mess this time.

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,350
I wonder how Su Guang
will handle Ye Changyuan.

143
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,110
Master.

144
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,870
I know I was wrong.

145
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,400
I entrusted you to watch
over Begonia House.

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,110
What did you do?

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,870
Master,

148
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,280
I was blinded for a moment.

149
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,550
That's why I developed evil intentions
towards Gong.

150
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,670
It won't happen again.

151
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,230
Master, please spare me.

152
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,670
Please spare me.

153
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,990
You're nothing but a dog to me.

154
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,670
Since I can entrust you
with Begonia House,

155
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,840
I can also end you anytime.

156
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,280
Master, please spare me.

157
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,350
Please spare me.

158
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,670
As for Begonia House,

159
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,760
I won't let a single word slip out.

160
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,650
Master, please spare my life.

161
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,160
Please spare me.

162
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,870
Remember this.

163
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,070
I'm letting you live
only because you are a loyal dog.

164
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,310
It's not the first time for you

165
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,040
to cause trouble out of desire.

166
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
Before, I turned a blind eye.

167
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,040
But now that it's come to me,

168
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,790
I might as well help you get rid
of that desire.

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,240
Thank you...

170
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,550
For sparing my life.

171
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,880
Mind your steps

172
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
and be a good, obedient dog.

173
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,310
I guarantee you a worry-free life
in your later years.

174
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,640
But if you cross me again,

175
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,410
I have plenty of ways to deal with you.

176
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,640
I won't dare again, Master.

177
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,910
I swear my loyalty to you till death.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,760
Chu Yunfei should be back
from the border soon.

179
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,880
Get ready to ship the next batch.

180
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,480
Yes.

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,160
My Lord.

182
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,830
Before my bed a pool of light,

183
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,400
is it hoarfrost upon the ground?

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,280
