[Episode 6]

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,480
And yet, you and I remain
so ambiguous.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,330
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,510
Appropriate or not,

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,630
it's up to me.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,480
There is really a spear on his chest.
I wasn't mistaken.

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,230
Isn't Wanyan Qi the only son

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,510
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion?

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,150
Wanyan Jin is the eldest son
whom Prince Zhenbei has just found.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,840
Prince Zhenbei valued him greatly

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,990
and had just appointed him
as the heir apparent.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,630
Before, I was wondering

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,880
why he didn't confer the title
upon Wanyan Qi.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,920
Who would know he has another son?

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,110
But Wanyan Qi has been frail and sickly
since his childhood,

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,200
and his days are numbered.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,000
If it were me,

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,770
I wouldn't appoint him
as the heir either.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,190
Bah, bah, bah!

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,960
Look at my big mouth.

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,830
If you marry him,

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,130
Young Master Qi will surely
be blessed with great fortune

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,290
and live a few years longer.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,840
It is not necessary.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,480
Cuihua,

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,540
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,330
Go fetch something to eat
from the kitchen.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,770
Right away.

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,960
It's truly an honor
to have you to be here.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,320
This isn't the place for conversation.

32
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,840
Please follow me to the study room.

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,670
[Execution ground]
Governor Wen's daughter

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,630
got married yesterday.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,330
Why does she beat the drum here today?

36
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,190
So this is that ugly bride
from the Wanyan Family.

37
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,920
I, Wen Yueqian, have been wronged.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,070
My father, Governor Wen Muchen of
Yunzhou City,

39
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,320
has always been loyal to the Emperor.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,840
I beg you to see the truth.

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,400
The Prince has arrived.

42
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,190
Father, Father!

43
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,700
My father has been wrongfully accused.

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,840
He is not such a cruel man.

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,000
Please, spare him.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,770
Don't cause a scene.

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
This is the execution ground.

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,630
My father has been wrongfully accused.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,670
Let me go!

50
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,590
Father.

51
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,840
Qian.

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,150
My father has spent his life

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,550
serving the country and its people,

54
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,630
dutiful and loyal.

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,670
He would never harm the soldiers
of the Qilin Army.

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,590
I beg you to investigate thoroughly.

57
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,710
Give my father back his honor.

58
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,480
Even if you are a daughter-in-law
of the Wanyan Family,

59
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,360
I

60
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,710
will never bend the law
for personal gain.

61
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,810
It is a fact that the criminal
Wen Muchen

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
poisoned the soldiers of the Qilin Army,

63
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,800
and his crime is beyond pardon.

64
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,650
Carry out the execution.

65
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,510
Live well.

66
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,510
No!

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
I might as well tell you

68
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,670
the crime your father committed
against the Qilin Army

69
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,510
was orchestrated by my father.

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,190
Lord Su,

71
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,840
now that you have been the Governor,

72
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,400
you must surely know

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
what you should

74
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,320
and should not do, right?

75
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,710
Just don't end up like Wen Muchen,
that clueless fool.

76
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,400
He discovered my military payroll fraud,

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,760
secretly copied the account book,

78
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,360
and even planned to deliver it
to the Emperor.

79
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,110
The account book has been dealt with,
right?

80
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,840
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

81
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,150
You ordered me to poison the wine
Wen Muchen gave the Qilin Army.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,630
Everyone thought Wen Muchen
had poisoned the Qilin Army.

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,550
It turns out

84
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,670
you killed my father
over the account book.

85
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,230
I will make you suffer eternal ruin.

86
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,920
I naturally trust you.

87
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,630
Once our two families unite by marriage,

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,360
we will be family.

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,190
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

90
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,760
Bah!

91
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,760
Such an old fox.

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,230
Luckily, I held back after
intercepting the account book last time.

93
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,230
If I can find that account book,

94
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,630
my father's name can finally be cleared.

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,710
Only then will those evildoers

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
get the punishment they deserve.

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,400
[Half a month later]

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,920
Gong Shixian.

99
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,840
The beast who killed Zhijin

100
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,400
is now at the Su Family.

101
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,960
I will play along with this.

102
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,440
Sorry,

103
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,360
Shixian.

104
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,820
No trouble at all.

105
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,110
It's so late.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,660
Where are you heading, Qingran?

107
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,980
Grandmother has asked for me

108
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,960
to have a talk.

109
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,670
Once you're done with it,

110
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,480
why not join me in my room for a drink?

111
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,030
None of you

112
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,550
are getting away.

113
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,230
What a beauty.

114
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,150
I need to find a way

115
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,630
to get her.

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,630
What exactly has happened

117
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,230
to make you

118
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,630
so sad?

119
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,320
Greetings, Shixian.

120
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,400
Shixian,

121
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
in a few days,

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,160
I'll marry the second young master
of Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,760
But his health is fragile,

124
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,110
and his days are numbered.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
If I marry him,

126
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,280
I'm afraid

127
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,880
it won't be long
before I become a widow.

128
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,030
Besides,

129
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,670
he's not the one I truly care for.

130
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,030
Then,

131
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,590
who is the one

132
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,030
you fancy?

133
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,480
If you don't want to marry,

134
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,190
why not

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,710
let me take you away?

136
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,630
From now on,

137
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
you can live a life as you wish.

138
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,960
How does that sound?

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,000
No,

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,630
I can't bring trouble to you.

141
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,400
Just take what I said today

142
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,110
as nonsense.

143
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,840
This girl is so beautiful.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,710
Marrying Wanyan Qi, that sickly one,

145
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,000
really is a shame.

146
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,670
It's rare she has feelings for me.

147
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,000
Why not take her away from Yunzhou City?

148
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,000
When I'm tired of her someday,

149
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
I'll sell her to a brothel.

150
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,480
No one will know it was me.

151
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,000
Yi,

152
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,880
you'll belong to me forever tomorrow.

153
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,440
Young Master.

154
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,880
Have you prepared everything
I asked for?

155
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,370
Rest assured, Young Master.

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,180
[Zimo, Guard]

157
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,830
All is arranged.

158
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,800
Good.

159
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,430
Tomorrow, I will give Yi
a proper wedding celebration.

160
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,960
What Yi? Aren't you marrying Su Qingran?

161
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,270
Since when did Su Qingran
become the eldest daughter?

162
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,110
I've heard that Miss Qingran

163
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,160
was raised in the countryside
for over ten years.

164
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,430
Not long ago, she was brought back
to the Su Mansion.

165
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,310
That's wrong, all wrong.

166
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,640
The one I married is Yi, not Su Qingran.

167
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,270
Where's my father? I must find him.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,310
I want to call off this marriage.

169
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,270
Young Master, it's too late now.

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,800
You'll officially marry Miss Qingran
tomorrow.

171
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,520
The Prince definitely won't agree
to cancel it now.

172
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,270
Young Master, you'd better

173
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,760
wait quietly to marry the bride.

174
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,390
I would never betray you
by marrying another woman.

175
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to run away.

176
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,350
Ah!

177
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,190
Jin,

178
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,520
the few tasks I assigned to you recently
were handled quite well,

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,070
especially the case of the firearms
in the Begonia House.

180
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,030
I really didn't misjudge you.

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
It is worth it to name you
the crown prince.

182
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,430
Father, you flatter me.

183
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,600
It's all thanks to your wise guidance.

184
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,110
Your Highness,

185
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,310
this medicinal cuisine
was specially prepared for you.

186
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,680
You're too thoughtful.

187
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,950
Your Highness, something's wrong.

188
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,560
Young Master Qi has run away.

189
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,470
What?

190
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,430
How could Qi run away?

191
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,110
Hmph!

192
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,370
This is all because you spoiled him.

193
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,680
Now,

194
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,720
we should focus on what to do next.

195
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,350
Can we

196
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,350
delay the wedding date?

197
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,070
Delay?

198
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,350
If no one from our family
goes to pick up the bride today,

199
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,470
then tomorrow,

200
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,430
the whole Yunzhou City will be buzzing
with gossip.

201
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:03,840
Father,

202
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,680
we absolutely can't let others
mock the Wanyan family.

203
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,070
I am willing to marry Miss Su
as my wife.

204
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,640
That's actually a pretty good idea.

205
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,600
As long as it's a marriage
with the Su Family,

206
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,210
who marries her doesn't really matter.

207
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,800
Jin,

208
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,560
are you really willing to marry Miss Su?

209
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,070
To help you ease your worries

210
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,470
is my greatest honor.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,160
[Su Mansion]

212
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
Such grandeur.

213
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,720
The groom is truly handsome.

214
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Your Highness,

215
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,760
why have you come
to pick up the bride instead?

216
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,760
I'm not here to pick her up.
I'm here to marry her.

217
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,560
Marry her?

218
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,310
You're going to marry Su Qingran
as your wife?

219
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,390
Is there a problem

220
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,000
with that?

221
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,640
Of course not.

222
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,390
Your Highness, you must be joking.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,680
It is a blessing for us
that my daughter can marry you.

224
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,640
How did the groom end up
becoming the crown prince?

225
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,350
If she marries the crown prince,

226
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,190
how could Feiyi and I

227
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,470
ever have good days again?

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,350
