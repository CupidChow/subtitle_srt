[Reborn from the Ashes]

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 3]

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,790
The Su Family refused
to marry their daughter

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,670
to the sickly son
of the Prince's Mansion,

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,920
so,

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,590
they planned to have Zhijin marry

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,030
in her place.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,320
But now,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
she is dead at my place.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,590
How can I explain this?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,440
If I marry into the Wanyan Family

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,990
as the eldest daughter of the Su Family,

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,940
I can search in the mansion
for proof that my father was wronged.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,590
Madam Yun, don't worry so much.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,360
Zhijin has not seen the Su Family

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,030
for over ten years.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,070
How do you know all this?

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,230
Zhijin told me herself.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,590
No one from the Su Family
has seen Zhijin in ten years.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,150
So, who is Zhijin

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,320
is up to you.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
You're about the same age as Zhijin.

23
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,070
As for looks,

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,150
you do carry the grace
of a refined young lady.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
Why don't you

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,030
take Zhijin's place

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,630
and return to the Su Family?

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,030
This is extremely risky.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,490
If caught, it could cost me my life.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,070
I haven't lived long enough yet.

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,920
I dare not.

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,590
What?

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,840
Don't you want to marry
into Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

34
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,590
to enjoy wealth and honor?

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,880
Listen to you,

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,760
who wouldn't want wealth and honor

37
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,030
and have a life of luxury?

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,760
Then go ahead.

39
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,440
As long as I keep silent,

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,030
the Su Family won't find out.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,710
From then on,

42
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,280
you will become a person above others.

43
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,280
You know far too much.

44
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,150
If you don't go today,

45
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,030
then death is your only option.

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,280
Then,

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,630
I'll give it a try.

48
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,360
Don't forget who helped you
along the way.

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,280
Madam Yun, please rest assured.

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,510
If I truly marry
into the Prince's Mansion,

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,320
I will share wealth and honor with you.

52
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,360
You do have a conscience.

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,710
Zhijin,

54
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,800
I will

55
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,360
reclaim everything for you.

56
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,070
Wanyan family,

57
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,840
it's time for you to repay
what you owe me.

58
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,070
My Lord,

59
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,990
the bait has taken the hook.

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm being watched here.

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,230
What did the Master say?

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
When will the items be moved?

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,190
The Master has given orders:

64
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,590
do not act rashly.

65
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,670
I'm just a simple woman.

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,550
I can't bear such a shock.

67
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,630
Hmph.

68
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,070
Go back and tell the Master.

69
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,280
That will cost extra.

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,500
Additional payment is required.

71
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,760
Take them down.

72
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,590
Speak.

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,290
Where are they hidden?

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
I...

75
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,880
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

76
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,590
Who was behind that deadly agent?

77
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,070
Deadly agent?

78
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,070
In our line of work,

79
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,670
we never ask guests' names.

80
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,510
Very well.

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,230
I'd like to see
whether it's your stubborn mouth

82
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,110
or my tough methods that prevail.

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
Don't be so rough.

84
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,320
What if you accidentally kill her?

85
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,440
How about

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,590
we play a game?

87
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,550
Everyone makes a cut on her.

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,150
Let's see how long she can endure.

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,590
Sir...

90
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,360
No, please.

91
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,920
This man is truly ruthless.

92
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,760
Begin.

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,070
Take this.

94
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,630
Sir...

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,840
No.

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,380
You go ahead.

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,150
No.

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,590
Sir,

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,450
aren't you afraid of divine retribution

100
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,110
for forcing a confession
through coercion?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Divine retribution?

102
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,480
Keep going.

103
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,440
Your turn.

104
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,320
You.

105
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,230
This man is so unpredictable.

106
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,070
He wouldn't remember me, would he?

107
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,590
Qianyue.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
Qianyue, please save me.

109
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,920
Qianyue, help me.

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,550
Do you still want to return
to the Su Mansion?

111
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,880
You

112
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,550
should go accompany Zhijin.

113
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,280
Madam Yun.

114
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,510
Madam Yun.

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,550
How could you kill her?

116
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,790
We haven't finished
the interrogation yet.

117
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,670
It wasn't me.

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,760
It wasn't me.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,840
How could I dare kill Madam Yun?

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,230
You killed her.

121
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,480
Sir, you're mistaken.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,760
How could I ever dare kill Madam Yun?

123
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,150
Didn't you say

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,550
that we should each

125
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,710
cut her once?

126
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,550
So many have already cut her before.

127
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,630
I only gave her one cut.

128
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,000
I am innocent.

129
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,110
If you don't believe me,

130
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,190
then take my worthless life.

131
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,110
Hmph, such a chance to avenge Zhijin.

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,000
How could I let it slip away?

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,670
He wanted to kill me.

134
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,360
You still don't believe me.

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,670
I believe you.

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,510
But since she's dead,

137
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,960
you can finish

138
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,390
what she hadn't finished saying.

139
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,520
What does he want me to say?
Could it be...

140
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,720
[One day ago]

141
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,920
Sir, I think I know

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,560
where the place you are looking for is.

143
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,110
Lead the way.

144
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,070
I'm not sure if what I saw earlier

145
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
is actually what they want.

146
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,800
Whatever.

147
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,110
Just give it a try.

148
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,720
If you're lying to me,

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,030
you know what will happen.

150
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,430
No.

151
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,270
This path is uncertain.

152
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,720
And his mood swings wildly.

153
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,640
I can't risk my life here.

154
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,490
I need to find a way to escape.

155
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,430
Yes, sir.

156
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,960
Since you've already found
what you sought,

157
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,190
I will take my leave.

158
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Mr Lord,

159
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,790
although we found the firearms,

160
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,720
we failed to capture the ringleader.

161
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,030
What a pity.

162
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,110
This is enough for now.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,760
What should we do
about this Begonia House?

164
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,110
Let it be.

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,230
What did she call us here for?

166
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,840
What's going on here?

167
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,310
These are our contracts.

168
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,800
Who is the person over there?

169
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,000
The contracts and money are all here.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,520
From now on, you will all be free.

171
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,000
Contracts?

172
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,000
Mine.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,230
This is mine; that one's yours.

174
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,270
Yours is right here.

175
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,390
Got it. We're free now.

176
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,760
We're free.

177
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,070
Thank you, miss.

178
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,880
Thank you, miss.

179
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,570

[The Contract]

181
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,470
Didn't you hate me?

182
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,450
You and I never had any grudge
between us.

183
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,720
Any grudges

184
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,390
have all been settled one by one.

185
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,270
