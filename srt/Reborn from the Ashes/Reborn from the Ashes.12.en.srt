[Reborn from the Ashes]

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,190
I'm late.

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,960
Your Highness.

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,000
You've been wronged.

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,710
She's not the one who's been wronged.

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,550
She...

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,630
What?

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,520
The crown princess is unfaithful.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,070
She was promised to you,
but ran away with my cousin.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,960
When the truth came out,
she had my cousin killed.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,750
I couldn't bear to see you deceived.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,400
So today, I want to reveal the truth.

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,150
But she beat me badly instead.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,230
You hit her?

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,070
Does it hurt?

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880
Gong Shixian abducted my wife.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,710
I haven't even confronted you
about it yet.

19
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,230
Do you not take me seriously?

20
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,320
Your Highness, please spare us.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,110
We were misled by rumors,

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,000
and wronged the crown princess.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,360
Since your matter is settled,

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
now it's time to settle ours.

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,480
You've bullied my wife so openly.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,960
Are you disregarding

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,000
Prince Zhenbei's Mansion?

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,040
That's unjust, Your Highness.

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,710
It was the Madam who told me
to teach her manners.

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,440
I only pretended to do this.

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,670
Never would I disrespect her.

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,040
Gong Xi, how dare you!

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
How dare you frame me?

34
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,150
It was you who told me
to properly discipline her.

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,190
She's delicate and tender,

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,920
not built to endure your rough ways.

37
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,320
That's nonsense.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
I told you to teach her manners,

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,590
not to pour dog blood on her.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
It is no big deal.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,170
You didn't explain it clearly.
How can you blame me?

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,070
Alright then.

43
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,590
As long as my wife forgives you,
I won't hold it against you.

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,880
Qingran,

45
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,590
this is all just a misunderstanding.

46
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,440
You will forgive me, right?

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
I'm too tired to argue with you.

48
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,320
Lady Qingran,

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
you've finally returned.

50
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,230
I've missed you so much.

51
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,590
Oh? Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

52
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,810
You haven't even thanked me yet.

53
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,590
Thank you for what?

54
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,520
If I hadn't shown up in time,

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,630
you'd be covered in dog blood by now.

56
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,360
Even if you hadn't come,

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
I had my own ways.

58
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,960
That's true.

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,840
You always bring me

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,840
surprises.

61
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,040
My Lord,

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,260
Su Guang is tied up
with official duties tonight.

63
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,990
This is the perfect chance
for you to act.

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,670
My Lord,

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,000
when will you be back?

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,440
If someone catches me now,

67
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,670
my reputation will be ruined.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,360
Well,

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,880
I might be drowned in a cage.

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Where on earth did Su Guang
hide the account book?

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Wanyan Jin? Why did he come here?

72
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,520
Come inside.

73
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,320
This way.

74
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,920
Hurry up.

75
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,400
I've missed you so much, you foxy lady.

76
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,440
You're always so impatient.

77
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,330
Between Su Guang and me,
who do you think is stronger?

78
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,960
What wild words are those?

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,710
How could that old fool compare to you?

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Su Guang is naturally suspicious.
You embezzle silver little by little.

81
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,800
Where is Gong Xi?

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,150
Master.

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,230
What are you all doing here?

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,360
I just saw someone sneaking
into the residence,

85
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,710
so I followed quietly.

86
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,670
It turns out that it was someone
from your side.

87
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,360
It's a misunderstanding.

88
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,800
Concubine Gong really knows how to play,
a two-timing liar.

89
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,270
What kind of look is that in her eyes?

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,710
You leave now.

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,630
Alright.

92
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,000
How did things turn out?

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,920
Governor, rest assured.

94
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,400
Everything I arranged went smoothly.

95
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,110
There must be no mistakes this time.

96
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,960
Don't come looking for me
unless it's important.

97
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,150
Understood.

98
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,670
Leave now.

99
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,190
What are you doing?

100
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,230
Oh.

101
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,230
I heard a noise outside the window
just now.

102
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,800
I was worried you might be startled,
so I came to check.

103
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,190
I was sound asleep a moment ago.

104
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,630
I didn't hear a thing.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,960
But you sneak around
in the middle of the night,

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,250
and gave me quite a scare.

107
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,190
You're not sleeping late at night.
You aren't up to something bad, are you?

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,400
Why do you think
I just did something wrong?

109
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,230
Don't you have a clear conscience?

110
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,780
Why are you wrapped up
in the bedding like that?

111
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,630
Obviously,

112
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,990
I loosened my clothes to sleep.

113
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,490
Wouldn't I be cold without the cover?

114
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,840
Since you are not asleep,

115
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,490
why not come out for a walk with me?

116
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,630
I don't want to go out.

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,670
Yes, you do.

118
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,710
I think you haven't rested well.

119
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,750
Then I'll go out by myself.

120
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,520
Was the person in the study tonight
really Su Qingran?

121
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,000
What exactly

122
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,230
was Wanyan Jin looking for in the study?

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,590
Could it be

124
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,580
that Wanyan Lie discovered
Su Guang was hiding the account book,

125
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,370
so he pretended to arrange a marriage
with the Su family,

126
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,440
using this as a ruse

127
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,040
to give Wanyan Jin a chance
to look for the account book?

128
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,710
Otherwise,

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,550
why would he not care
that I spent time in a brothel?

130
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,920
My Lord,

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,570
we have found the man
who has an affair with Concubine Gong

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,470
is Ye Changyuan.

133
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,600
In truth, he is a black market merchant.

134
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,880
We know very little

135
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,270
about him.

136
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,110
Ye Changyuan.

137
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,110
So it was him.

138
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,070
He's the one
who ruined Zhijin's entire life.

139
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,390
He pushed Zhijin straight into hell.

140
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,680
Bai Ze,

141
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,720
keep a close watch on Su Guang.

142
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,600
Report to me at once
if anything unusual happens.

143
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm going to meet Ye Changyuan.

144
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,000
Understood.

145
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,510
[Su Mansion]

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,670
Today, I'll be returning
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

147
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,600
Keep an eye on Su Mansion for me.

148
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,350
If there is any sign of trouble,

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,710
you must inform me immediately.

150
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,680
Remember

151
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,070
not to alert them prematurely.

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,390
Mm.

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,680
My Lady, rest assured,

154
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,070
I'll keep a sharp watch for you.

155
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,880
By the way,

156
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,560
there's something odd I noticed.

157
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm not sure if it'll help
with your investigation.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,680
What is it?

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,470
The other day, when I went home
to visit my family,

160
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I met someone on the way.

161
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,840
She looks just like Concubine Gong's
former maidservant.

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
But that maidservant died
in an odd way later.

163
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,840
I was really shocked
when I saw that person.

164
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,990
Is it possible in this world

165
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,800
for two people to look exactly the same?

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,560
Can you find that person?

167
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,190
I should be able to.

168
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,720
Why are you staring at me like that?

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
Your Highness, Nanny Wang is here.

170
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh.

171
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,350
I just remembered
I have official business to attend to.

172
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,110
Then go quickly.

173
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,680
Go ahead.

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,230
Go ahead.

175
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,800
Let's go.

176
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,040
I saw Ye Changyuan

177
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,800
and Concubine Gong

178
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,560
enter the inn.

179
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,190
Today, Concubine Gong said she would
go out to buy Buddhist worship items,

180
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,070
I just felt something's off,

181
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,720
so I decided to follow her.

182
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,470
Sure enough, I discovered a big problem.

183
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,230
I saw her enter a room at an inn
in broad daylight.

184
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,190
That made me suspicious right away.

185
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,560
So I waited quietly for a moment.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,160
Not long after, as expected,

187
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,110
a strikingly handsome man appeared.

188
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,760
He went into the same room with her.

189
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,110
She really can't hold back at all.

190
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,470
You brought this on yourself.

191
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,760
Do you still remember Su Qingran?

192
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,840
Of course I do.

193
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,150
Never thought that village girl
would become the crown princess.

194
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
She's truly a disgrace
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

195
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,800
Ever since Su Qingran came back,

196
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,600
she's been opposing me at every turn.

197
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,110
Changyuan,

198
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,840
I need you to help me once more.

199
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,560
With just a few words,

200
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,960
I fooled this Su Qingran
until she was completely lost,

201
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,230
and then I sold he
to the Begonia House,

202
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,470
she still foolishly helped
count the money.

203
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,230
With her kind of stupid brain,

204
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,390
how could she possibly be your match?

205
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,430
Changyuan, you're truly impressive.

206
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,470
You two...

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,190
You shameless couple.

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,070
Master, please hear me out.

209
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,270
Did you kill my mother?

210
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,430
No.

211
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,150
Was it you who killed my mother?

212
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,960
No.

213
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,070
No?

214
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,880
Speak.

215
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,800
I was wrong, Ran. Please spare me.

216
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
I shouldn't have poisoned your mother,

217
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,880
nor should I have framed you.

218
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,470
I shouldn't have left you
to suffer in the countryside.

219
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,760
Qingran, I was wrong.

220
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,190
I won't dare to do it again.

221
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
You were wrong?

222
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,350
I truly know I was wrong.

223
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,920
Mother.

224
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,920
You came just in time.

225
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,800
Feiyi!

226
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,680
