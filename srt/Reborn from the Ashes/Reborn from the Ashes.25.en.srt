00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
[Episode 25]

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,630
I falsely accuse you?

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,840
Wanyan Jin, since you're so jealous,

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll let you have your fill this time.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,960
My Lord,

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,880
a jealous man is destined
to be abandoned.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,800
Be quiet.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,750
I'm still upset.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,360
I was wrong.

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,400
But you have to promise me,

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,110
stay away from Prince Han.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,710
I don't like him.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,960
You say you're not jealous.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,960
Who in the world doesn't like you?

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,840
Today it's Prince Han,

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,960
tomorrow another man will be after you.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do I have to worry every moment

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,630
that you will be taken away?

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,630
Do you really think
I'm such a fickle woman?

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,550
Even if Prince Han

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,980
is more handsome than you,

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,480
richer than you,

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,670
I am still your wife.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,670
Say that again.

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,150
More handsome than you,

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,920
richer than you.

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,750
He is more handsome than you.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,680
Why did you lure me here
with the account book?

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,520
Can't we just have a proper talk?

31
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,360
Speak.

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,070
What exactly do you want?

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,070
I want

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,710
you dead.

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,150
Someone!

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,400
Save my child!

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Someone!

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
Yi, are you alright?

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Yi, are you OK?

40
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,480
Your Highness,

41
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,150
please save our child.

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,850
Stop right there!

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,590
Bring the physician here.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,750
Your Highness,

45
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,400
Qingran didn't push me on purpose.

46
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,320
I was careless myself.

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,190
Feiyi! Hurry up!

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,590
Your Highness,

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,960
the child is lost.

50
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,800
What?

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,400
Qingran,

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,040
you have quite the nerve.

53
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,920
Knowing Feiyi is pregnant,

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,770
yet you still invited her
to the pavilion.

55
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,070
If she hadn't informed me before coming,

56
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,590
did you really think
you could get away with it?

57
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,040
I didn't push her.

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,630
Your Highness,

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,040
since this child has no ties to us,

60
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,790
there's no need to press the matter
further.

61
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,800
Nonsense.

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,000
Someone!

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,110
Take her away.

64
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,330
Hit her 20 times with a cane.

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,420
Lock her up in the prison.

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,960
Yes.

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,770
I'll walk there myself.

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,670
Feiyi.

69
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,710
I was only away from home
for three days,

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,160
and you already got into trouble.

71
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,480
Su Feiyi used the account book
to trap me.

72
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,420
That's how it ended up like this.

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,480
Think carefully.
Was there anything strange back then?

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,710
How dare they bully my woman
while I was away?

75
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,800
I'll make sure they all pay the price.

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,520
I've figured it out.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
Young Master,

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,670
I saw the truth behind the pavilion
that day.

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,710
Su Feiyi framed the crown princess.

80
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,040
She deliberately caused her own fall
and miscarriage.

81
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,170
I originally wanted
to testify for the crown princess.

82
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,810
But His Highness was so intimidating.
I dared not speak the truth.

83
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,270
Su Feiyi,

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
how dare you treat us like fools?

85
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,670
I have completed the task.

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,320
You may leave now.

87
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,520
Su Feiyi...

88
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,800
Wen Yueqian?!

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,630
You...

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,670
How did you...

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,230
Do you want to ask

92
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,920
how did I return from the underworld?

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,320
Of course, it is for three matters.

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,920
First,

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,590
the grudge of disfigurement.

96
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,710
Second,

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
the hatred of eye gouging.

98
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,260
No!

99
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,150
Third,

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,040
the pain of bloodletting.

101
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Just keep waiting,

102
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,270
waiting for your blood

103
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,190
to run dry.

104
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,400
Then all of this will be over.

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,230
Yueqian,

106
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
I was wrong.

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,040
Wen Yueqian, I was wrong.

108
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,320
What mistake did you make?

109
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,420
I shouldn't have deceived you
to take your pure Yang blood.

110
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,520
I shouldn't have been unfaithful
with Su Feiyi.

111
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,620
I shouldn't have gouged out your eyes,

112
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,320
ruined your face,
or endangered your life.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,880
I should never

114
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
have gotten Su Feiyi pregnant.

115
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,190
I was wrong.

116
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,040
But sadly, there's no cure for regret.

117
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,710
A mistake is a mistake.

118
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,520
Just go ahead and regret it slowly.

119
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,670
Wen Yueqian, please don't kill me.

120
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
Qi,

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,320
make sure you clearly see
who I really am.

122
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,270
Su Qingran.

123
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,360
Just now...

124
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,670
You scoundrel!

125
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,070
Confess everything.

126
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,800
Before,

127
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,520
I went through so much
to find pure Yang blood for you.

128
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,750
Yet you,

129
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,670
for Su Feiyi,

130
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,390
killed Wen Yueqian.

131
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
And now,

132
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,470
you're scheming with her again,

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,000
joining forces to deceive me.

134
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,390
I was framed as well.

135
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Go guard the tomb.

136
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
Don't ever come back.

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,070
I know my mistake.

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Your Highness.

139
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,960
Your Highness, don't do this.

140
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,640
Qi is too fragile.

141
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,230
He just can't take it.

142
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,150
It's all Su Feiyi's fault.

143
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,230
She must have seduced Qi.

144
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,640
Hmph.

145
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,560
Since you feel sorry for him,

146
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,800
then go with him.

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Your Highness.

148
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,040
Still making a scene here.

149
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,600
Su Feiyi,

150
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,600
you really treat me like a fool.

151
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,430
Someone!

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
Demote Su Feiyi to slave status

153
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,510
and throw her out of the Mansion.

154
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,760
Your Highness, I didn't do it.

155
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,840
They're framing me.

156
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,150
Don't forget my original intention.

157
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,040
Silence.

158
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,560
I will handle

159
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,390
today's matter myself.

160
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,040
You all go back first.

161
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,230
Su Feiyi,

162
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,960
I can refrain from demoting you
to slave status,

163
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,510
but you can no longer stay here.

164
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,760
Pack your things.

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
In a few days,

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
I will send someone to escort you away.

167
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,190
The wealth and honor you desire,

168
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,840
I will give it to you.

169
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,150
Don't bring up the account book
ever again.

170
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,070
Yes.

171
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,440

172
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,740
[Military Supplies Ledger]
is the safest place.

173
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,800
