1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Sister, you like watching the video.

2
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,480
Come out and watch it with me.

3
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm not watching it.

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
We're finally here.

5
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
At last, I can watch your home

6
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,360
and spend the New Year with you.

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Surely I'll atmosphere in your new Hovel.

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,680
This is the present couple's gift for New Year.

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,520
It's a small gift.

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,080
You must give it to your handle.

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,760
General.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,960
Suddenly the sound selbst occurred.

13
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,960
I haven't changed much.

14
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm still young.

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm already enough for you.

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
I don't want to die on a tree.

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I don't believe you think so.

18
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
I think so.

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Lin Miao Miao.

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
I understand.

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
For two years.

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
You've been cheating me for two years.

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
You've never loved me.

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
You, Lin Miao Miao,

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,560
are a selfish and weak woman.

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm leaving with you.

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,160
I'll be with you

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,560
forever.

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I only wish

30
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,560
to be with you.

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Why is Mr. Chen's image still from last year?

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Secretary Li,

33
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
this is the photo you gave me.

34
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
The image of the new year

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
has been taken.

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,160
How did you do it?

37
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
Sorry, Secretary Li.

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
I've been emphasizing

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
such important details.

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,560
But the new year is about to start.

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
No need to change it.

42
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Just use this photo.

43
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Thanks.

44
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Mr. Chen.

45
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Long time no see.

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Long time no see.

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
You don't remember me anymore?

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,720
I just didn't expect you to come back so early.

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Do you think I should report to you every time?

50
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
I was not considerate.

52
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,960
It's been a long time.

53
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,240
You've improved a lot in apologizing.

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,120
How about this?

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
You make up for your mistake

56
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
and find a quiet restaurant.

57
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,440
I'll take my fiancee

58
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,520
to meet my mom tomorrow night.

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,040
Okay.

60
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,120
Wait.

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,440
What?

62
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,920
A gift for you.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

64
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,160
Don't send it next time.

65
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,760
Do you have a boyfriend?

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,440
I've hired.

67
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,000
Hello, Mr. Chen.

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Yes, I've seen him.

69
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,960
Yes.

70
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,360
It's still as planned.

71
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,820
I heard the attack and killed her minutes ago.

72
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,220
I have disowned him.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
He's a tuna now.

74
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,660
Not bad.

75
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:26,840
He was into

76
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,080
Now, the gossip about you and Mr. Chen

77
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,960
is spreading all over the place.

78
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,520
Mr. Chen wants to know

79
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,800
what your future plans are.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,440
Of course, we'll go there for the wedding.

81
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,040
After we get married,

82
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,440
Mr. Chen

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,200
hopes that you can be a full-time wife.

84
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,200
Full-time wife?

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,080
Sister, what era is this?

86
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Are you kidding me?

87
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,680
I know that Miss Su is a public figure.

88
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,040
It's hard to make you quit easily.

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Women should be independent.

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,840
It's the best to have a double income in career and love.

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
But Mr. Chen also worked hard

92
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
to get the golden field of beauty.

93
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,280
If your daughter-in-law

94
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,960
is in the entertainment industry,

95
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
she must have a lot of time.

96
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
If you two are in a relationship,

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,960
you can be in a relationship for a long time.

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,640
She can be a good match for you.

99
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,400
But if you want to get married,

100
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,200
you can't be too happy.

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
In career,

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,320
I think...

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,400
Getting married is a good thing.

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,280
If you can't make any sacrifices,

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,640
how can you serve your future mother-in-law?

106
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Don't say that.

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,200
Of course, I'll serve my future mother-in-law.

108
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,520
I just want to remind you that

109
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,720
Mr. Chen is not a hero in a love story.

110
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,160
He changes women's speed compared to changing clothes.

111
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,080
You should know this.

112
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,840
I just hope you can

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,000
quit being a man

114
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
and protect yourself.

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
Don't fall in love with him.

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,240
Because you can't be his last woman.

117
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,880
Who said that?

118
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,080
Aren't you...

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,480
Don't think that you can bully Pei if you're my mother's fan.

120
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,360
Siyuan,

121
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,720
Mr. Lin didn't make it hard for me.

122
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,440
We're just discussing it.

123
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,400
It's not hard.

124
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
You didn't see him kill someone without blood.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,000
It's not that exaggerated.

126
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
Did you see what he said?

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,920
I know it's a test for my mother-in-law.

128
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
How can I be against the exam?

129
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Anyway, I've said everything I should.

130
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,440
Lin Miao Miao,

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,840
I think you're used to being a dog.

132
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
You're over 30 years old.

133
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,240
You came to humiliate my girlfriend

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
by being supported by my mother.

135
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,360
Miss Su,

138
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,320
I won't bother you today.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
Think about what I said.

140
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
I'll wait for your reply.

141
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I'll go and see him off.

142
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
You're mad at me?

143
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,040
How many times have you done this?

144
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm listening to your mother.

145
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
You've really become my mother's dog.

146
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,120
I'm Mr. Chen's secretary.

147
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,400
I have to do everything for him.

148
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,120
But if you're willing to pay me double,

149
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,480
I can also consider getting you a job.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
After all, you know

151
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,520
I like to get a job and earn more money.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
You won't think about it alone.

153
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,920
My mother is your big brother.

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,760
Do you know what people outside say about you?

155
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,200
Is it important to others?

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,960
Can you trade it for a dollar?

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,440
You can go to my mother's place if she wants you to.

158
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,800
Mr. Chen,

159
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,680
you'd better care more about Miss Su.

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
What if she's just pretending to be strong?

161
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,800
If you're too idle,

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,120
go find a man.

163
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't just think about destroying other people's feelings.

164
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,080
After all, I'm not

165
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,080
a woman who can't be with you.

166
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,800
If you get her,

167
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,960
who will take the responsibility?

168
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,600
I remember someone said

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,120
when you're young,

170
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,880
you should have more love

171
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
and delete your best man for marriage.

172
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,080
Isn't it?

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,280
I'll give it back to you.

174
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,400
It's okay.

175
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,200
Every second is beside me

176
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,360
I haven't promised my girlfriend yet

177
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,120
I thought this sentence was engraved in my heart

178
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,520
I can't forget the pain

179
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,720
You said that the wind and the clouds

180
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Are not in the stars

181
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Lin Zhen Miao, long time no see

182
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,040
Even if one day

183
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Time will flow slowly

184
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
When I turn around

185
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,040
I can't help but want to keep you

186
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
But in the end

187
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
You still have to go

188
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,040
