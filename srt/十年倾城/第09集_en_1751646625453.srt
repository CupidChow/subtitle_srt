The Long Ballad

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm single, and Senior is single too.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Even if he really means something to me,

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
what's wrong with him?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't I have the right to like someone else?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm just trying to help you.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What right do you have to help me?

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Chief,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
didn't you already talk to Miss Su about getting married and having a future?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why are you still worrying about your ex-boyfriend?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or are you saying that you're happy and old,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and Miss Su can't satisfy you anymore?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You have to eat what you want and watch what you want.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You'd better think it through yourself

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and stay away from my private life.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm still a little bit weak

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see the stars

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Come on.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Chu Xuan,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
do you know that

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
if you make a wish to the Lord of the Gospels,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
your dream will be burnt into the sky.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you're lucky,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
your dream will come true.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You still believe in this?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The old man said that

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
as long as you believe,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
miracles will happen.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to be with you forever.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What's so hard about that?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're already together.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's too hard.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm so ordinary and humble.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My family is poor.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm self-sufficient and self-reliant.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's why I want to feed myself.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So,

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I know that I'm not as good as you.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Besides,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you never gave me any promises.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Stop talking, Ran Ran.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's get married.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Why are you crying like that?

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you so happy?

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I just

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
can't stop crying

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
when I think of

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
my poor self.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to do a lot of things.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I want to do my best

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
to do this job well.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Siyuan.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you still thinking about

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Li Miao Miao?

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Are you?

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you still like her?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do you think I'm blind?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You two are

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
so ungrateful.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You don't take me seriously.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you still love Li Miao Miao?

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you?

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you willing to go to her?

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't sign the contract?

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Lisa, your contract.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. Chen has read it.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He has no objection.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The sincerity of Li Rui

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
is here.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then, please

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
thank Mr. Chen for me.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Siyuan,

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
sometimes,

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I really envy Mr. Li.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sign the contract.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What do you envy me for?

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's great to be a normal person like you.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Free and free.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You don't have to worry about this.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't have to worry about that.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Cry if you want to cry.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Laugh if you want to laugh.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If you want to be ambiguous,

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you're not afraid of being chased by a paparazzi.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Miss Su,

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
you really want to quit?

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll report to Mr. Chen.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Secretary Li,

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm just kidding.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You work too seriously.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No wonder Mr. Chen and Siyuan

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
look at you like this.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Miss Su, with her own strength,

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
helped Rui Rui to make a fortune.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr. Chen and Mr. Chen, of course,

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
will look more at you.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Secretary Li,

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you don't have to go back on your word.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mr. Chen didn't know me before.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He wanted me to be a full-time wife

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and let me quit.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Now he knows I can help Rui Rui.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course, he can't bear to let me disappear.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course,

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I won't let him down.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, right.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you want to buy?

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Of course, let's go.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You go first.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have a meeting with the product department.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What meeting?

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to the office.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll be back in a minute.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Send me home.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You get off first.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have something to tell you.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Can I give you more or not?

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's break up.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What did you say?

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's break up.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't you think you're shameless, Chen Siyu?

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you have someone in your heart,

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
don't blame others.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't say sorry to me.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm too stupid.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm too naive.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you think I'm ridiculous?

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, you're pretty good.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't send me any good cards.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If it weren't for him,

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
would you not have changed?

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This has nothing to do with Miao Miao.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How is it not related to him?

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's been appearing in a strange way lately.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's been pretending to be

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
a carefree person.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Who does he pretend to be?

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you know what this is called?

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is a man's watch.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It looks harsh and harsh.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a watch that can watch the weather.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What did you say?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're doing this yourself.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Are you afraid of being told?

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you dare to admit it?

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're doing this in front of me.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How can I be the one behind it?

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In front of Si Yuan and Chen Dong,

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you're pretending to be generous.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
When I was leaving behind,

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you were only arrogant and arrogant.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You dare to say

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that this is not the one behind it.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is it?

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're entangled with Chang Qi Xing.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now you want to be with Si Yuan.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You even take advantage of our relationship.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I really admire you more and more.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The man's watch and the white lotus are inseparable.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You should think before you act.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If I wanted to fool you,

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Chen Si Yuan would have been your ex-boyfriend.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What kind of person are you?

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If you didn't entangle him with us,

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
how could Si Yuan break up with me?

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's all your fault.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Stop it.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let go.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Can you stop it?

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let go of me.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
For him,

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Si Yuan,

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
breaking up is not a matter of one person.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a matter of two of us.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm telling you,

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't agree.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you understand?

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't agree!

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't you know how bloody it is?

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm so big.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's my first time being slapped.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I was so scared.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The whole parking lot

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is being echoed.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Who hit you?

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Did you drive here?

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I didn't.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I just wanted to be invisible.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just wanted to be invisible.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Do you know what I did to you?

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I hit you with my car.

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I just wanted to be invisible.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you know what I did to you?

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I just wanted to be invisible.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
Su Peipei.

203
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
I started it first.

204
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
Then you...

205
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,840
Where did you two fight?

206
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,520
What happened? Why?

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,840
You fought with Su Peipei because of Mr. Chen?

208
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm so pissed.

209
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,920
This is a good thing,

210
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,000
right?

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,960
At least it proves that Mr. Chen is thinking of you.

212
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
What are you talking about?

213
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,040
I knew it.

214
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,800
He finally can't hold it anymore.

215
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,000
He deliberately fought with Su Peipei

216
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,440
for the sake of you and me.

217
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,000
He asked you to support him,

218
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,680
be his driver and invest in him.

219
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,120
He did that to stimulate you, right?

220
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
He's a big shot.

221
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,560
I didn't realize it two years ago.

222
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
But this time,

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm sure it's right.

224
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,080
He's...

225
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,240
Nonsense. Stop gossiping.

226
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
What?

227
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,440
Help me think about it.

228
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,560
What should I do?

229
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
I remember it now.

230
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,240
What?

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
You told me that you had a crush on that jerk.

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,480
Isn't that Mr. Chen?

233
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,680
Right?

234
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,840
No.

235
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
It's not true.

236
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,320
Oh my god.

237
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,440
Miao Miao.

238
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,320
Let's drink.

239
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
It's not true.

240
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,200
I didn't realize it for so long.

241
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,480
You two...

242
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
He deserves it.

244
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
Listen to me.

245
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
Don't talk to him.

246
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,560
Do you hear me?

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,920
What?

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,080
You're so shocked.

249
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you talking about?

250
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,800
You...

251
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,960
You two...

252
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
You're both dumb.

253
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,240
You're so blind.

254
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,080
How can you not talk to him?

255
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,480
You didn't say anything.

256
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,120
Then...

257
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,720
Then...

258
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,480
You're so lucky to be with Su Pei.

259
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Where are you going?

260
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,120
You're not admitting it.

261
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,480
What?

262
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
Mrs. Chen.

263
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,240
You're so romantic.

264
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,800
Where's Mr. Chen?

265
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,720
He didn't ask you to come here?

266
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,720
The night colors are beautiful.

267
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,280
Our feelings were secret andtır.

268
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,040
The snow is melting like the yellow clouds.

269
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,240
The clouds mobile and monitoring the dream.

270
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,520
Every frame, the us and you,

271
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,920
the sky is repeating the same color.

272
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,720
We are far away, aren't we?

273
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,720
I only wish to follow you

274
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,720
to the end of the world

275
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I only wish to follow you

276
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,720
to the end of the world

277
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,720
I only wish to follow you

278
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,720
to the end of the world

279
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I only wish to follow you

280
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,720
to the end of the world

281
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
To love To heal

282
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
