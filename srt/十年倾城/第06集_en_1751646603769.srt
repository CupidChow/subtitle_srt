00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you crazy?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're going to find Chang Qixing?

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Isn't this Yangru Lake?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It depends on what you say.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What kind of stormy waves have we never seen?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll go with you.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Dattler is here in advance.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to see the result in half a day.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Miss Lin.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Chang.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're prepared today.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've been a bull horse for Mr. Chen for ten years.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, Mingrui is in this situation.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I always have the right to inquire about it.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If the big tree is good for the grain,

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mr. Chang won't think I'm a big shot, right?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's so easy to say,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
then I have to test it.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
After all, if you're a man of the dark,

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm a man of the dark.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But if it's dark and dark,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that won't work.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Even if I have this heart,

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we have to make three contracts.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's talk about the bargaining chip first, right?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come on.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everyone, let me introduce to you

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
this half-baked girl of Mingrui,

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the iron-picking big lady,

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Lin Miao Miao.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Mr. Chang said that the guest was Secretary Lin.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's the first time for people to meet

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
when they are out.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Long time no see.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm really sorry.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm late today.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I hope I didn't spoil everyone's mood.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How could it be?

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Look at our restaurant.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just that the foreign atmosphere is too strong.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I just need this beauty.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This Yin and Yang Ping is so good.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Xiao Zhou, sit here.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Miao Miao, come with me.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not here yet, Mr. Chen?

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mingrui and Weiyang have always been

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the top coffee brands in our country.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Although we have been competing all these years,

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but facing the entry of overseas brands,

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
we are in the same boat.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Although there were some small differences

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
at the bidding meeting a few days ago,

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I believe

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that Mr. Chang was just misled by some wrong news.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't accept the supply and demand plan, can you?

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You really know how to torture me.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You were just there

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and said that the uncle was good at it.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You changed your mind as soon as you sat down, right?

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All the people here are smart.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Only by maintaining the diversity of species

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
can the ecological circle last forever.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After mixing this pot of water,

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
we can still get Deman.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm afraid that there are not one or two

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
high-level consumers.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Chang,

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
what do you think about the fact that

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the Prime Minister Du Li can be promoted?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Come on.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Today,

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mr. Chang arranged us to be together.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a fate that brings us together.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's have a drink.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr. Wang,

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you appeared on this table today

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and that proves that you are on the right track.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I just take it as a game of words.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mi Wei was spilled today.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Does anyone care about the process?

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mr. Wang, you should know

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that everyone is looking at the result

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and the way of saying it.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The conditions are good.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's okay.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But it's a coincidence

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that we have a lot of capital.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We don't have enough money.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you want to cooperate,

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you may have to be sincere.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What sincerity?

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Miao Miao,

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
there are rules on the table of wine.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It happens that all of you here are witnesses.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Drink a glass of wine with me.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This matter will be covered immediately.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Take back the contract.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I will solve the problem that

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mi Wei has.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How about it?

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Mr. Chang,

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you are going too far.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But it's just a glass of wine.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The wine is a gift from God.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's worth it, Secretary Lin.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's a good deal.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's worth it.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Secretary Lin,

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you don't have to look for a beautiful woman.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can just sit on the table of wine

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and have a drink.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Mr. Chang,

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mr. Chang,

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you are so shameless.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Drink.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Miss Li Rui,

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mr. Yang is really a genius.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Drink this glass of wine.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will solve the problem that

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
you have just solved.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What are you doing?

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Mr. Chen,

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you are so rude.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You ruined the good things

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
between Miao Miao and me.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Chang,

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
don't forget our agreement.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Miao Miao,

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you didn't move

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
after I finished drinking.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What are you doing?

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you know what you are doing?

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's wrong with me?

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just a glass of wine.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mr. Chang,

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
what are you doing?

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Listen,

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I didn't just drink today.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I used to drink too.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Just for fun.

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They will forget it after drinking.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you think they will forget?

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well,

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I... I will leave first.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will leave first.

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you think they will forget?

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When did you become like this?

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I have always been like this.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have always been like this.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Otherwise,

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
how do you think I will live this time?

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't see your face.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't sleep at night.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't sleep at night.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are asking about a project.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are shocked, right?

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Listen,

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't just drink with someone today.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I met a pig's hand before.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You said you used to watch the stars and the sun.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's wrong?

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You look down on me.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Today,

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you are having a rich and rich life.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You are having a rich and rich life.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are having a rich and rich life.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you know that?

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The pain that I can't forget.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The pain that I can't forget.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The pain that I can't forget.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You said the wind was hard.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's unbearable.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't remember your figure.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Even if one day,

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
one day,

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
time will flow slowly.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When I turn around,

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't help but want to forget you.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But in the end,

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you are still...

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Go to the company.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll show you something.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You said you used to watch the stars and the sun.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's better to watch my face.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The courage to stop by my side every minute and every second.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I thought this sentence was engraved in my heart.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The pain that I can't forget.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You said the wind was hard.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's unbearable.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't remember your figure.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Even if one day,

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
one day,

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
time will flow slowly.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When I turn around,

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I can't help but want to forget you.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But in the end,

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you are still...

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Go to the company.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This coffee shop is also problematic.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The angle of this video is so bad.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where did you get it?

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're going so far.

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to the coffee shop.

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll go with you.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll go with you.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have to do something.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But this evidence is not enough.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What if that person just doesn't admit

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that he was sold by Chang Qixing?

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We don't know either.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let me see this.

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Isn't this the public relations plan of the sales team?

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then they must have no problem.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Their plan is very good.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You still know them?

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It seems that you don't know me very well.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Maiji is my other company.

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't you want to hide it from Chen Dong?

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why did you tell me?

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In your heart,

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I am a woman who is full of interests.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I am a woman who is full of interests.

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll sell you?

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Love is full of love

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't leave you even if I hide it for a while

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going to hug you in my arms

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm willing to go with you

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm willing to go with you
