Episode 18

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's hot.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's warm.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're a supervisor.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why are you still so soft?

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is it possible

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that I just came to see you?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've already told the designers

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
about the plan.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll follow your instructions.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't worry.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Stop it.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've already done half of it.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't like Banto Erfei.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who likes Banto Erfei?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sometimes, it's not a choice.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have to do it.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some friends also told me

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that at this age,

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
we shouldn't talk about love.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Just stop it.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But you know what?

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ten years.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I thought time could make everything right.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Just like what you said.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Talk more about people,

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
see the world more,

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and stop talking about death.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I did what you said.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But why am I still thinking about you?

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But you've already

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
broken me into pieces.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can't hate you a little.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why are you...

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's wrong?

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's so hot.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I need to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ceng Siyuan?

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Miao Miao is sick.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll take her to the doctor.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I have to wrap Si Feng's chair.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's soft.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The company has arranged everything.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can rest in peace.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Help your girlfriend

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to relax for one minute.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't get drunk.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can rest in peace.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's 그 dudule thinner themv�e

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Have a nice rest.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't want to let go of your greetings

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How can I move on if it's not you

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're amazing, Zeyu

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm letting go of your greetings

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We're not together yet

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then I'm blaming you

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's make up

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can forget about the past

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you mean, Zeyu

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You really want to break up with me

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We've broken up

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Give me an explanation

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I admit

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't forget her

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been avoiding her for so many years

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I thought I could forget her

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I would not love her if I didn't see her

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When I came back

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I knew I was wrong

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The sky is slowly getting cold

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want to run away anymore

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The plot of our encounter is in my mind

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The script is not stable

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No matter who can't tell the difference

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've been through your world

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've been looking for the right to be loved

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:12,780
I secretly sent you the

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I secretly sent you the

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Love you like the distant wind

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes, I understand

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll talk to the strategic department in the afternoon

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, tomorrow

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes, yes

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll come up with a plan

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I understand

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're so poor before you get better

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You don't need to save your two years of hospital

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You just care about Miss Su

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And you come to care about me

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The central air conditioner

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Can't you see who I care about?

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I know

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Of course I know

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I just experienced it once

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The back pain that others have experienced

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can take care of you

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The body is the most important

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Take a good rest

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's not a big disease

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's not a crime

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't die

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What you said

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can't die

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's like a curse

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's the benefit to you?

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's good for you

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Give you a place in your heart

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you don't have to worry so much

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Have I ever struggled?

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Have I struggled for a minute or a second?

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm at home

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Isn't it clear?

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I thought you understood

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm hungry

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you want to say it again?

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to sleep

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do you want to eat for lunch?

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You two

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You two broke up

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
How hurtful

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I used to be a scumbag

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Now it's

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Not this time

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I mean

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You see, people are sick

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a kind of emergency reaction to protect your body

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I won't fall down

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You should care more about Miss Su

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
After all, you hurt her so deeply

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You don't care

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You'd better take care of your body first

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Talk about the power

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You are a Pacific police officer

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are so fast

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I said I'm fine

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Work is a disease

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you didn't come

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
To urge me to work

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I can stay up all night

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And work all night

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're strong again

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Maybe it's salt water

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm really hungry

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hungry

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Then later

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Play by yourself

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go back to the company first

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Go ahead, don't report to me

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Miss Yue Yue

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How are you? Are you feeling better?

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Come on

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why do you take so many things?

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh my god, you don't even know

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Mr. Chen called me

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He said you were awake

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Scared me to death

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I rushed over

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Look, I bought you a lot of things

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What are these?

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is a red flower

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sunset, lychee

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sea cucumber, bird's nest

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Grass

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Zhou Wan

178
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
How much do you pay for your monthly salary?

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So much

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So much

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Isn't this for Miao's health?

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What is this?

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Small money, sprinkle water

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Zhou Wan

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What's wrong?

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wanwan

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Waner

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Ok

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ok

190
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Mr. Chen told me to buy it

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Miao, I'm your CP fan

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't sell me out

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You are so sick

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Spend so much money

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hungry?

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Taste it

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Try it

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's still hot

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wow

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You really don't let me be your CP fan for so long

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm really disappointed

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This fried pork

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Pork ribs soup and crucian tofu

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
All your favorite

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Isn't this just a common taste?

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really?

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Tell me honestly

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Which step have you two taken?

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Which step?

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Did you get to that step?

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What?

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Didn't he buy you so much stuff?

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
How would I know?

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Anyway, I heard that Mr. Chen didn't go home last night

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You don't know?

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Why did Cai Siyuan treat me like this?

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You are still in the movie theater

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't be so childish

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is the popularity that has been accumulated after a long time

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't be so serious

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I just can't get over it

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I gave up so much for him

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't even want my Singaporean roommate

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He is so good

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He borrowed an old lover

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He just dumped her after he got drunk

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Women are like clothes to feelings

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:22,140
Three years of

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I know it's not easy for you to give up a relationship

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But he hasn't been publicized yet

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It means that there is still room for you two to turn back

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He may have been fooled by a woman for a while

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a secret

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's good that he wakes up

240
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Who knows, maybe not

242
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's the matter with you and Su Peipei?

243
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The heart didn't say

244
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Snowflakes like clouds

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Clouds open dreams

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I didn't expect you and me

247
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The sky is bitter

248
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The wind is floating around

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The moon kisses the love

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Love you in a warm and cold way

251
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I will hide you in my eyes

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't want to leave

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I will embrace you in my arms

254
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The sight is so close

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I only want to follow you
