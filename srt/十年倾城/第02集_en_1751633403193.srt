00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Did he really say that?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What do you think?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think it's pretty good.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Young and energetic, and very elegant.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It suits you well, Miss Chen.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The girl is a good girl.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think she's a good girl.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
She's a good girl.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She's a good girl.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The girl is a good girl.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But she needs to be a little bit more

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
into the Chen family.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't worry.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let Miss Chen take care of herself.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I think Su Peipei

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
is still immature.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
She can still be in love.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If she really gets married,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
she can't afford to be married.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's faster to change a girlfriend

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
than to change clothes.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Su Peipei will have a way.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My daughter-in-law

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is the most important thing

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to be able to

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
take care of my son.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Instead of making up news all day long,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and putting Mi Rui on the fire.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So,

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you should help her to keep an eye on her.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Lin Miao Miao is your secretary.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She's not a marriage consultant.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Can I just have a relationship

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and not be like a criminal?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When will you come back?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And don't you want to talk to me?

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm back.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you know that the public is talking about you?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,340
They say you're a

43
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,000
and you're already affecting Mi Rui's image.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't just sit around and ask.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Really?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The news articles I saw

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
say that we're a perfect match.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We're not a family.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You just came back from abroad

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and you're already fighting with me.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not fighting with you.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not that I'm fighting with you.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's that you're looking at what you're doing.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
One is a dog barking around,

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the other is a dog being nosy.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What dog?

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What dog?

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Explain it to me!

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're interfering in my free marriage.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Aren't you a dog?

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're going to marry her back?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can't I marry her?

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can marry her if I want to.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You want to piss me off, right?

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
San Dong.

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
Who would never

68
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,400
miss a chance to exploit their own lives?

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,780
That's our job

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,720
After all,

71
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,440
a person做不到事

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:45,640
does not mean

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,920
to Audience

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,840
How come you're the editor?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm not going to work late.

76
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,960
Besides, I told my mom

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
because of Pei.

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,800
What does it have to do with you?

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
He's really something.

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
He deserves you.

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Since you're my employee,

82
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
don't be so indifferent

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
to your boss's private life.

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm the one who failed.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
You're still home at this hour?

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,120
Mr. Chen asked me to stay here for a few days.

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,520
Your legs are getting thinner.

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,520
What about you?

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,200
You're spending so much time

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,360
without Miss Su.

91
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
She's the only one who's working.

92
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Compared to her,

93
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm more attracted to your jokes.

94
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
What jokes can I see?

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,520
You're a chicken who can't be a chicken.

96
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,760
I thought you were

97
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
a chicken who can't be a chicken.

98
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,960
With my mom's temper,

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,320
she must be trying to make you a chicken.

100
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,360
Mr. Chen

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
doesn't seem to be that bad now.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,960
He seems to be more tolerant.

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
Are you kidding me?

104
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,680
Are you taking a picture of a horse's ass

105
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,720
to show that he's here?

106
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
What are you laughing at?

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
You don't have to

108
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,480
say that while taking a picture of a horse's ass

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,440
and touching your face.

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
What are you getting at?

111
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,080
Open the door and go inside.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,920
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,600
Miao Miao,

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
how long have you been following me?

115
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,120
It's been ten years.

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,480
Sometimes,

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
I have to be grateful for how time flies.

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
I remember when you were following me,

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
you just graduated from college.

120
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,160
Now you can

121
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,640
stand up for Mi Rui.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Wait a minute.

123
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,440
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,560
Mr. Can.

125
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,440
Miao Miao,

126
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
you've been with me these years.

127
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,840
Are you feeling wronged?

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,480
No, no.

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,280
I've bought a house.

130
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm not wronged.

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,440
How's the bid for

132
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,560
the entry-level right of Deman?

133
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm ready.

134
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,800
Deman is the top-ranking

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,520
and second-ranking mall in the country.

136
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,080
It's very helpful to Mi Rui

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,240
to get the entry-level right

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
and to make high-end coffee.

139
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,080
Our competitor

140
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,160
is still Weiyang.

141
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
If you can get the bid,

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,520
I'll ask you to be the CSO.

143
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,080
From now on,

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,640
you don't have to call me Secretary Lin.

145
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
I feel sorry for you.

146
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,880
After you become the CSO,

147
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,440
you don't have to feel wronged.

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,280
No.

149
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,520
I don't feel wronged at all.

150
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,760
Mr. Can,

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,880
I won't let you down.

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Don't ever say that again.

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,320
Remember,

154
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,520
you must keep your words.

155
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,920
Okay.

156
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
I'll try to be the CSO.

157
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,680
From now on, you can call me Mr. Lin.

158
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
I wish I could

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
make you sign the contract

160
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
and lock you in Mi Rui for the rest of your life.

161
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Thank you, Mr. Can.

162
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,240
Okay.

163
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
Let them in.

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
No.

165
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,240
Thank you.

166
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,160
Miss Lin, do you know who I am?

167
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,560
Do you know who I am?

168
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,040
I've paid the surgery fee for you.

169
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,760
I'll pay for the rest of the maintenance and medical expenses.

170
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,600
I only have one request.

171
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
Leave Si Yuan.

172
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,120
Does this mean to save Si Yuan?

173
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,120
He doesn't need to know about this.

174
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,760
You're forcing me.

175
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
How can there be a mother like you in this world?

176
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,080
Don't blame me for being cruel.

177
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
If I didn't provide you with the medical expenses,

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,600
your parents would have been in a bad situation.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,640
I know my son better than anyone.

180
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,640
He won't be with you in the end.

181
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,680
We're a family.

182
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,800
Your house hasn't been sold for a month.

183
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,960
You're not willing to sell less

184
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,680
and wait for the money to come in.

185
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,480
You're not willing to save your life.

186
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,920
And we're a family of real estate.

187
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,080
It's a great job to save a life.

188
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Do you think it's realistic

189
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
for you two to be together?

190
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
So you think

191
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm not worthy of him?

192
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
I know you're good at studying.

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,600
How about this?

194
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,720
I'll give you a chance.

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,920
Do your job well.

196
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,520
Leave Si Yuan.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Ten years.

198
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,720
Ten years later,

199
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
if he doesn't go,

200
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,840
and you're not married,

201
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
I won't interfere with you.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
Ten years?

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,560
One day is not enough.

204
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
One day is not enough.

205
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm a person

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,160
who pays attention to promises

207
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,840
but I don't force anyone to do it.

208
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
You've made up your mind.

209
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,840
You can come to me.

210
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,920
I've made up my mind.

211
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
We're over.

212
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,400
Don't bother me anymore, okay?

213
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,680
I'm not feeling well lately.

214
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
It's normal to forget about it.

215
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
I'll tell him

216
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
when the time is up.

217
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
Do you have a boyfriend?

218
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,000
The moon hides in the woods

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,320
After all, I'm a person

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
who can't live without a woman.

221
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,000
If you take her away,

222
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,200
who will take care of me?

223
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
The clouds open the dream

224
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,720
Every moment with you and me

225
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,160
The sky is colorful

226
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,680
The wind is around

227
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
The moon kisses the dreams

228
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,120
I'll keep loving you

229
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,040
Looking at you once

230
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,680
diesely

231
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,960
my wind alarm

232
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
coldly

233
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
My eyes look the way

234
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,840
I only wish to

235
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
There is always a star

236
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Right now

237
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Will you hold me tight?

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
The moon kisses the love

239
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Full of love

240
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
The rain will hide you

241
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I can't go

242
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I can't save

243
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I'm afraid you'll be in my arms
