Episode 15

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's going on between you and Su Peipei?

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I broke up with her.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A few days ago.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You didn't mention it sooner or later.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You just announced the brand ambassador and you just left?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You should have broken up with her.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are a demon now.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you still my son?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Didn't she send you to break up with Mi Rui?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Whatever people say.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't care.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You don't care.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The board will care.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you break up with her,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't mind.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But Mi Rui's share price has just risen.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's not appropriate to announce the break up now.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Think of a way to suppress it.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wait for a while.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It will rise again if it falls.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You are talking nonsense.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I and Miao Miao worked hard to set up the family business.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's for you.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let me tell you.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mi Rui's life today,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you are a rich man.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's all because of the price of the deal.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you know?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mi Rui.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Actually, I can just watch the ad alone today.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
After all, you two have such a good relationship.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What does it matter?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't have to go back.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll go first.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Director.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Pei Pei.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do you think?

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I think it's very good.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's turn off the light first.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Pei Pei, take a break.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay. Thank you, director.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mrs. Cen.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What wind blew you here?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's wrong?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm fine.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm fine.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm fine.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Cen asked me to come here to visit.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mr. Cen.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can call me grandma if you don't change your name.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is Mrs. Cen

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
here to declare the sovereignty with me today?

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You think too much.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The past between me and Chen Siyuan has already passed.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you two don't get along,

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
please solve it yourself.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't involve the irrelevant people.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Come on.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not a fool.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've seen it clearly now.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm just a petty concubine

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that she has been interested in.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm no match for you.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You two have been having a temper

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
with each other for ten years.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm the third one.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No wonder people outside say

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you're the big girl that Mi Rui beat.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I believe you this time.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You don't have to dig me up.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're so bitter.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've never relied on men.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've suffered a lot these years.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm the only one who knows.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have to beat my teeth or

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
put my shoes in my stomach.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Stop.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't have time to listen to you.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Since you're so aggrieved, why don't you resign?

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can't bear to lose the interest in front of you?

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or is it worth doing everything for Chen Siyuan?

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Cen.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll get back to work.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Director Kang has been praising you.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What about you?

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What do you think of me?

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I think the material is good.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And this outfit is also suitable for you.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Really?

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Everyone is watching.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you keep making that face,

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
guess what will happen to Ming Tian's head?

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What do you want me to do to you?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Cen.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You want to break up with me, then break up with me.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But you have to think about Mi Rui.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If you don't want to be caught by Jiang Hao

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and be caught by him,

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then be happy.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're a grown-up.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't let your mother worry about you.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know you.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Your mother asked you to come, right?

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
By the way, I'll give you the contract.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If I hadn't asked someone to inform Mr. Cen,

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm afraid I can't invite you now.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But it doesn't matter.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just come.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll go.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why don't you go to the ad gathering?

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You have to eat with me.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then Mr. Cen can testify.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's unnecessary for me to go.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Si Yuan is not a good guy.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He just signed the contract and broke up with me.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If I hadn't asked him to visit the ad,

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't know how these gossip will make up for it.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come on.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Look.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Although I don't like my daughter-in-law

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to do this kind of work,

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but now,

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
she can bring us a lot of positive feedback.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So you have to help me persuade Si Yuan.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
After all, you are classmates.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I...

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I...

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not good at managing the boss.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You don't have to beat him.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He listens to you.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's different between you and him is that

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
how can I download and download it?

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go to the Ad marathon.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Just watch.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There is something I want to give you.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Don't get cold.

147
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Thank you, Ceng Teng.

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,880
Secretary Lin.

149
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,160
What a coincidence.

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
What a coincidence?

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
Didn't you invite her?

152
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
You're very particular.

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,920
Why did you hide the gold in theç›’?

154
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,600
It's not for nothing.

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,040
It's a bling bling.

156
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
Why are you laughing?

157
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm funny.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,280
I just think you're really...

159
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
You've changed a lot.

160
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,120
I can't always be a little dirty boy.

161
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,760
I didn't say you're a little dirty boy.

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
That's what you mean.

163
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,160
Ceng Teng hasn't started yet.

164
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,280
I have a question for you.

165
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
What?

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,880
What?

167
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,840
Do you want to ask me

168
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
why I don't go home

169
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
during the New Year?

170
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,720
It's like this.

171
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,360
You know, in our industry,

172
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
the busier the season is,

173
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
the more we can't make money.

174
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,000
The salary is three times higher.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm just getting ahead of myself.

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm so rich.

177
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,560
When I was five years old,

178
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,960
you were my wife.

179
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,080
You...

180
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,560
You're taking advantage of me.

181
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,240
This has happened before.

182
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,280
I didn't mean to say that.

183
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,040
You forgot?

184
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,520
I remember.

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,200
When we were kids,

186
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
we played house-hunting in Huoxini.

187
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
It's not Huoxini now.

188
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm in Huoxini now.

189
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,680
I'm so old and red.

190
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm still single.

191
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,840
My mom told me

192
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
the child was with someone.

193
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
I have to be honest.

194
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,440
The child was with me.

195
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
Would you mind

196
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
having a man with a child?

197
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Of course not.

198
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Look at you.

199
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
You guys are so

200
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,840
cruel, aren't you?

201
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,600
Miao Miao.

202
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,800
You're still as cute as before.

203
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,960
But

204
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
you misunderstood.

205
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,680
I...

206
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,920
I...

207
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,520
I'll talk to you later.

208
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,600
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

209
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,520
Go ahead.

210
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,800
Great.

211
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,720
The overall design is good.

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,440
But the colors are a bit monotonous.

213
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,520
I can add some colors.

214
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
For example,

215
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,200
she...

216
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,200
Add some lace...

217
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,760
No.

218
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,640
What?

219
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,080
The paper.

220
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,720
Okay.

221
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,160
Sure.

222
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
You can discuss it.

223
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,120
Okay.

224
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
As you wish.

225
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,120
That's all.

226
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,320
What are you doing?

227
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,520
Nothing.

228
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm just visiting

229
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
Mr. Chen's office.

230
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,400
Miao Miao

231
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,120
has spoiled you

232
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
one by one.

233
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,800
You didn't knock on the door.

234
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,600
Mr. Chen.

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm a fan of your couple.

236
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,000
I have a piece of news

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,480
in my hand.

238
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
Forget it.

239
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm leaving.

240
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,280
Hello, Xiaozhou.

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
The equipment department

242
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,120
has introduced a new notebook.

243
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,400
Please get one after work.

244
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
It'll help you

245
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
improve your work efficiency.

246
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,840
Okay.

247
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,560
Mrs. Chen?

248
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,160
It's you.

249
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,440
You're here alone.

250
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Are you in a bad mood?

251
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,760
Let me tell you.

252
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,800
I saw an entertainment news two days ago.

253
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,400
Mr. Chen and Miss Su

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,680
are in love

255
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
and want to have a baby.

256
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,720
Who do you think you are?

257
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,560
Who are you?

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Why do you care

259
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,960
about other people's business?

260
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
Are you annoying?

261
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,920
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360

307
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360

314
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I'm sorry.

317
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I'm sorry.

319
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm sorry.
