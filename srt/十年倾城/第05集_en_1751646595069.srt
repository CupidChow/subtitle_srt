1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,560
Take it.

2
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,040
Here.

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,000
Take it.

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,160
Have you eaten the OSAT.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,820
What are you talking about.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,800
No, no,

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
I'm notã‚¸

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
P

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The sky is slowly getting brighter

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Stars are still sleeping

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The plot of our encounter is in our minds

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The script is played by me

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if the beautiful characters

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're drunk

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're drunk

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I said you're drunk

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're asking me

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's the matter?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't be so shy

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I secretly cooperate with you

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Love you like a distant wind

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Every moment is so simple

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So unique

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Even if it's not enough

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So what?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is it worth it?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I once gave you happiness

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But it's not enough

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Was it a dream last night?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Was it a dream last night?

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Chen Siyuan

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I bought you breakfast

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go to the toilet and eat

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You didn't leave last night

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was drunk last night

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I couldn't drive

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I had to stay in your living room for one night

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can't you pay the price?

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lin Miao Miao

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're so cold-hearted

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How many nights have you been with my mom?

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't even make a shop in your house

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you mean?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What time is it?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's late for the auction

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll see how long you can hold it

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Wait

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You drive today

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't wear high heels

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do I look more formal in high heels?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's your identity?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Follow me

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
As comfortable as you can

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Mr. Ceng

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Secretary Lin

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Good morning

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're awesome

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You just announced to the female star

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And then you went to someone else's house to spend the night

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm so happy

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm so happy

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm so happy

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're so good at car racing

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're so exciting

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why is there no strawberry hard?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I still like to play with my eyes for so many years

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Didn't your car stop at the public parking lot last night?

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Mr. Chang is so good at thinking

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's so talented at selling coffee

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Nothing to say

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's go

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. Ceng

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
How does the ice Americano made by Miao Miao's Kiss double-headed ghost taste?

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Chang

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I forgot to take the one you gave me in front of the house

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's been taken away by the toll-free one

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Really?

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Miao Miao is a staff of Mi Rui

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll arrange everything she needs

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't bother Mr. Chang

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're so considerate

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Miao Miao is the big girl of Mi Rui

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Of course she should be considerate

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The big girl?

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Isn't that the second king of the earth fighting for your inheritance?

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's just a nickname

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Mr. Chang doesn't have to make a big article

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're all colleagues

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We're all colleagues

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We can't be too far from each other

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not my gossip

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There are rumors out there

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They say you can be a full-time backup

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That means you know her

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She can do a lot of tricks

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let me ask you

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you the main character or the one who is with Su Pei?

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm the main character

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why are you so curious?

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are you in love with Mr. Chen?

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Miao Miao

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm doing this for your own good

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't be fooled by dirty things

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mind your own business

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Everyone, this way please

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is the plan of Mi Rui Coffee

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to enter the domain of the bottom-ranking brand

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I believe

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
whether it's the brand's effectiveness or influence

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it's the second choice for the bottom-ranking brand

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We also look forward to Mi Rui

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to work with Deman

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think this is a good plan

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a good idea

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think this is a good plan

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It shows Mi Rui's sincerity

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mi Rui's data is really well done

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going to withdraw it according to the rules

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But this data is unreliable

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All the sales data of Mi Rui

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
have been returned by the professionals of Deman and the company

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You may not trust Mi Rui

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But are you going to question Deman?

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mr. Chen, don't worry

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't worry

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The main thing is that recently

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
when we were investigating Mi Rui

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we found that this brand

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
has unreliable evidence

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's watch the video first

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What does Mr. Chang mean?

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We have to prove it even if we spill the dirty water

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Such a simple video

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
is put on such a high-class bidding meeting

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are too unkind

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you think we lost

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you pretend not to see it

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then you are so angry now

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You are so angry now

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are so angry now

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You are so angry now

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You are so angry now

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are so angry now

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You are so angry now

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You are so angry now

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It means this video is real

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If I guess it right

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Now the Internet is already starting to rise

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not impossible

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. Chen, search it

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Manager Zhao

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Mr. Chang's front foot just reported the video of the back

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The back foot is following up

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a little bit lagging

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to ask Deman

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to give us a few days

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The dirtier it gets, the more dirty it gets

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How about this?

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is really strange

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Give you three days

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is that enough?

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you for your trust in Mi Rui

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Your case is from Chang Qixing, right?

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I bought it myself

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What a coincidence

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Same brand

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You suspect I'm not loyal to Mi Rui

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is this about loyalty?

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You don't know what kind of person Chang Qixing is

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't know what kind of person Chang Qixing is

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What does he say, what do you believe

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What does he say, what do you believe

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You seem to know him very well

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What tone

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Who do I know

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Anyway, these measures of delivering coffee machines

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
should be useless to you

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are right

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are right

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You are right

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's useless to you

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's useless to you

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It sounds like you know me very well

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No, I know you

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You were drunk last night

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You took me as a familiar

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Say everything

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What did I say

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You have to think about it

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You said too much

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You said, Cheng Siyuan

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I accidentally lost your coffee

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I accidentally lost your coffee

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Did you?

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Of course I have

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You said, Cheng Siyuan is a bastard

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Cheng Siyuan is a bastard

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Cheng Siyuan is a bastard

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Cheng Siyuan is a bastard

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Impossible

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't say that

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What else did I say

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You said

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You said some

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hello, Mr. Chen

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I have arranged for the PR department to do it

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There will be a review in an hour

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Analyze the consumer's review

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Publicity document

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
OK

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
OK, I understand

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Are you crazy

221
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is Mr. Chen's phone

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't want to know

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What did you say last night

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't want to know

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Drunk words, dream words

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What can be true and false

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't even remember

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not like you

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You have time to find a woman to cure

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm not like you

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sister, have a cup of coffee

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
How about it

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Did you think of it

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have an idea

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What idea

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You are crazy

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You are going to find Chang Qixing

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The moon hides its beauty

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The heart didn't say

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Snowflakes like clouds

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Clouds open the dream

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Every shot of you and me

243
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The sky is colorful

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like the wind, the world is floating

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The wind is blowing

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The world is floating

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The moon kisses the love

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Slowly, slowly, I love you

249
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will hide you in my eyes

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Can't leave

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I will embrace you in my arms

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will embrace you in my arms

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The sight is close

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I just want to go with you

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will embrace you in my arms

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I will embrace you in my arms

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I will embrace you in my arms

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I will embrace you in my arms

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I will embrace you in my arms

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I will embrace you in my arms

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I will embrace you in my arms

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I will embrace you in my arms

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I will embrace you in my arms
