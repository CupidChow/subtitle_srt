Episode 16

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's all my fault, okay?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was like that.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How could there be such a heartless thing as you in this world?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am a heartless thing.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have already broken up with him.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A scumbag.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who made you a heartless thing?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because...

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I thought this sentence was engraved in my heart.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But it's the pain that I can't forget.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You said that the wind and the clouds are not as good as your body.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even if one day, one year, one day, time will slowly flow.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When I turn around, I can't help but want to hold you.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But in the end, you still need to go.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it because you have one more person by your side?

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sure he is my husband.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Can you think about it after you die?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's all my fault.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How could there be such a heartless thing as you in this world?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mr. Chen, these are the two backpacks we finally ordered after several meetings.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They will be put into the offline shop activity next month.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
See if you need to repair them.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mr. Chen.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Chen.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Where are you going?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We finally decided that these two backpacks are the New Year's edition and the New Year's edition.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
One is the Eastern style and the Western style.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Please have a look.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What about my one?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was born a long time ago.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Discuss with the design department.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,240
Add the butterfly element, blue multi-brain

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,000
Add the butterfly element, blue multi-brain

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Butterfly element

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let the design department co-workers forcefully harmonize.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mr. Chen, how about we take a break first?

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's okay.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's the progress of the software design of the first cooperative shop with Deman?

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Here, have a look.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is it that good?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why do you look like a child?

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you don't believe me, you can change another person to chase me.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The moon hides its color.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The heart is not saying.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Snowflakes are like clouds.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's this?

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a flower.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's this?

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is called a blue flash.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Under the sunlight of its wings, it will reflect a particularly beautiful light.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Just like a gemstone.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What about this?

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you want to be closer?

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I want to learn more from you.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that I can be as cultured as you.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are quite advanced.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is good.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have an idea.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to print it into a coffee cup in the future.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How childish.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to be a good friend.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How childish.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Lin Miao Miao.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The ten-year agreement has not yet expired.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can't cross the border.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Am I suitable to confess now?

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
No.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It seems that the bag is always used to transfer all kinds of things.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Just remember it in that way.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want you to remember it.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I want you to meet every day.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you waiting for my WeChat all the time?

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,400
Yes.

83
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
Did he send me a message every day?

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
No.

85
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,160
Did he...

86
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
Why do I see him smiling?

87
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,760
eeeey

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,080
eeeeeeee

89
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,760
I want to open a different book.

90
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
No.

91
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,760
Was he the only one in my heart or not?

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can really give him a sense of security.

93
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,280
Morning, Mr. Cai.

94
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
Xiaozhou.

95
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Call Secretary Lin.

96
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
If he doesn't come to work,

97
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
he's innocent.

98
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Yang Yue asked for a sick leave this morning.

99
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,200
Sick leave?

100
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,880
High temperature and fever.

101
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,480
You're so stingy.

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,760
Stingy?

103
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,360
I'd like to see

104
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,360
how you can't sit in the company today.

105
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,080
If it weren't for the sweltering of the day,

106
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,600
I wouldn't have been able to feel the heat of the sun

107
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:32,360
and the love between us.

108
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,280
If you keep being like this,

109
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm going to change the password.

110
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,600
You're full?

111
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm here to see you on behalf of the company.

112
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
I heard you had a fever.

113
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't touch it.

114
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
You won't die.

115
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm testing the condition.

116
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm not touching it.

117
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,280
You're not a doctor.

118
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,360
Why are you making trouble?

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
Go back.

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,400
No.

121
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,400
Who is it?

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
Mr. Cai, your food.

123
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,200
Mr. Deng?

124
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
When did you become so close?

125
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,560
He asked me to go to the Deman store

126
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,880
to look for a room to decorate.

127
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,920
I said I was sick, and he...

128
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I said I was in a hurry to leave.

129
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,640
I'm not going.

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
The company is busy recently.

131
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm going to the office.

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
The company is busy recently.

133
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,560
Deman's first store is about to open.

134
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,960
We have to prepare all kinds of materials and procedures.

135
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,840
You can pick whatever you want.

136
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,280
Have you finished your work?

137
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,040
I've paid the price.

138
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,520
I strictly followed

139
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,440
the company's rules and regulations.

140
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,640
When I'm better,

141
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll make up for my work.

142
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
The most important thing now

143
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,680
is to design the soft-clothed clothes

144
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,080
and work with the toys.

145
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,000
The boss personally supervises you.

146
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
The design of the soft-clothed clothes

147
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,440
is very important.

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,560
Deman's soft-clothed layout,

165
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,520
the designer has already made two plans.

166
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
I just sent you on WeChat.

167
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Which one is better?

168
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,760
I think our Mi Rui's store

169
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,840
is always in the retro style.

170
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
the style of Bauhaus

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
will be more attractive.

172
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,480
Go on.

173
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
I think

174
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,080
we still need to make it retro.

175
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,440
But soft decorations

176
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,640
like the front table and the bathroom

177
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,560
can add some bright colors.

178
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,400
Including, we can make

179
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,760
some small cardboards.

180
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
The style of the cardboard

181
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,040
can be changed once a season.

182
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,200
It's all about the style.

183
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,080
It sounds good.

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,600
But it's a little...

185
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,640
It's a little expensive.

186
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,720
It's not easy to get the Derman's watch.

187
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,240
You can't bear to lose your child.

188
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's think about it again.

189
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,840
Let's see what ideas

190
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
can save money and attract people.

191
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
Capitalism.

192
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,640
You thinkonte four seasons

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,780
has nothing to do with money,

194
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
but you think of it.

195
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,040
There are more options out there than those of failure.

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,280
There's no good

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,840
that you may be against.

198
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,000
Besides eating too many buffets,

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,640
downstairs are the rule book houses

200
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
right under you.

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,800
I就在這做想 Roger at the revel in the block.

202
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
But have you ever

203
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,480
thought what will I do

204
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
The clouds cover the dream.

205
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Every moment, you and I,

206
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
the sky is colorful.

207
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,480
The wind and snow are floating around.

208
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
The moon kisses the sky,

209
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,480
slowly telling me to love you.

210
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
The rain will hide your eyes,

211
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,480
and you will not leave.

212
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,480
I will embrace you forever.

213
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,480
My eyes are locked.

214
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I only wish to follow you.
