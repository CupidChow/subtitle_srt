Episode 16

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't you want to keep it from Chen Dong?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why did you tell me?

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In your heart,

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm a woman who is full of interests.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll sell you out?

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sell me out?

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You won't.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't be so self-conscious.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I found the evidence.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm off work.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The rain is pouring down.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If it's not the wind,

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
it's a sudden rain.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sell me out?

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You won't.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You drive today.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't wear high heels.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is it a little more formal to wear high heels and shoes?

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Follow me as comfortable.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If I remember correctly,

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
it's your birthday today.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The Legend of Princess Miaoshan

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If she asks me

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
who I choose with Lin Miao Miao,

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't remember this.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I choose you.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How many daughters have you had in the past ten years?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Haven't you heard about my fame?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Isn't it about the truth?

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why don't you ask?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ask me.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can ask me.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can answer.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can ask me.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Miao Miao.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You can ask me.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're drunk.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's solved.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now the situation has changed.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Weiyang maliciously competed to blackmail Mi Rui.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's on the hot search.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Good news.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's wrong?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Now the situation has changed.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Everyone said that

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Weiyang maliciously competed to blackmail Mi Rui.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's on the hot search.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Really?

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is finally solved.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We are so tired these days.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Great.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you want to eat?

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's have dinner together.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You want to invite us to dinner?

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then I have to choose a good restaurant.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Have a hot pot.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Have a hot pot.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sister.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Cheng.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The crisis public relations mission has been sent out.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We still can't press it down.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mai Jiting is in contact.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No matter how much you spend,

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you can solve it with the fastest speed.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the public opinion online...

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then think of a way.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to the toilet.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What are you thinking about?

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't care about you.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't put all the blame on yourself in the future.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Even if Mi Rui falls,

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
there is someone to support her.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't press you.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you need it,

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you can ask me anytime.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mr. Cheng, I don't need it.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You need it.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Take me to a place.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Where?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Su Fei Fei's place.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you doing?

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you doing?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hurry up.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Cheng changes cars so fast.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Take it.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For you.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Chen Si Yuan.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't use your means to chase girls outside on me.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't want to do this.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I bought you a car to let you pick me up

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and Pei Pei.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Chen Si Yuan.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You treat me like your maid

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
with such kindness.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's right.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can tell me

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
if you have any ideas.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
See?

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then be a good maid

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and do your duty well.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then you can live a life of peace.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hello, Mr. Chen.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, let me see.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Pei Pei is so beautiful.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I want to be with Pei Pei.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Ming Rui.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The creator of water is our family.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Pei Pei is the goddess of fortune.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I will believe you forever.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What's wrong?

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I bought the car.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think Miss Su is quite smart.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I saw her on the hot search.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She's so brave

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to come out at such a time.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're being rebelled so soon.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're my man.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm just kidding.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You see?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The sky is full of flowers.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The snow is heavy.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
When Ming Rui just decided to fight back,

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
her Weibo came.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to say it's a good show.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You haven't fought with me for so many years.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The netizens say everything.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't worry.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
As long as Si Yuan knows

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that I'm sincere to him,

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it's enough.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Your love brain.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She has all your thoughts.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Her mother doesn't like you.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What if one day,

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
she suddenly changes her mind?

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You'll be in big trouble.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In my opinion,

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you shouldn't break up with her.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're a young girl now.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Your career is more important.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But I really like her.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I haven't met her since I came back.

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you think she's...

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hello.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you Su Peipei?

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm the mother of Chen Si Yuan.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm the mother of Chen Si Yuan.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm Su Peipei.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm Su Peipei.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm Su Peipei.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm Su Peipei.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm Su Peipei.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm Su Peipei.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm Su Peipei.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm Su Peipei.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm Su Peipei.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm Su Peipei.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm Su Peipei.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm Su Peipei.

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm Su Peipei.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm Su Peipei.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm Su Peipei.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000

I'm Su Peipei.

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm Su Peipei.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm Su Peipei.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm Su Peipei.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm Su Peipei.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm Su Peipei.

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm Su Peipei.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
