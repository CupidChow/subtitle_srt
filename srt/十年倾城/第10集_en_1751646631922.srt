Episode 16

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mrs.Chen, you are so elegant.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Where is your Mr.Chen?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He let you come here?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let me introduce to you.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is Mrs.Chen of Mr.Mirui.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn't Mr.Chen's girlfriend the actress Su Peipei?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I haven't seen her before.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's wrong with the actress? You don't know men.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What is a man?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The wedding banquet is their specialty.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As long as it's a man, he will definitely cheat.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No way.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Miaomiao, if you don't want Mr.Chen,

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
remember to tell me that I want you.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can give you what he can give you.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Who are you?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll go take a look.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is wrong with him?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is this? Don't be mad at him.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This place is not gonna happen again.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I bought the car.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
I walked away with a foot on the door.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
It was so cool.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
He left me alone in the parking lot.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
Did he get his conscience eaten by a dog?

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Chen, calm down.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Calm down.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,800
You broke the house.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Are you kidding me?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How could I break the house?

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Let me calculate the bill for you.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Your mother slapped you.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Secretary Lin slapped you.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Su Peipei slapped Secretary Lin.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Secretary Lin slapped Su Peipei.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
Su Peipei slapped Su Peipei.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Su Peipei slapped Su Peipei.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Su Peipei slapped Su Peipei.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,400
Secretary Lin slapped Su Peipei.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Stop calculating.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Look.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Secretary Lin slapped Su Peipei.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
He must have given the most love.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
It's raining.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Let's go this way.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Chen Zixing.

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Why are you still here?

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
What's going on?

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
What are you doing?

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
This...

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What's going on?

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
I told you.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
You'll meet ghosts if you walk on the street.

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
You have to be careful.

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
But, sister.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,200
He just finished drinking.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
He's so dizzy.

64
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,600
Will he die?

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's go and have a look.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you okay?

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Are you dead?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you okay?

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Lin Miaomiao.

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
What are you doing?

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
Did you slap me?

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Are you crazy?

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
I saw someone

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
taking this suit and slapping you.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
I just came to see if you're okay.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
You slapped me.

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
It's not me.

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Don't move.

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
What are you doing?

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm not.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm not.

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
I'm not.

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm not.

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm not.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
What are you doing?

87
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Don't be angry.

88
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,800
I'll take care of you.

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,000
Hello?

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Hello?

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Ceng Siyu.

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Miss Lin.

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Your wife is in my hands now.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What wife?

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
I'll give you ten minutes.

96
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,400
Come here, auntie.

97
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Or I'll propose to her.

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
You decide.

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Mr. Ceng.

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,200
What's going on?

101
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Let's go.

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
Chang Jingxin was beaten by someone.

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Miao thought she was dead

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
and went to watch the fun.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
But Chang Jingxin caught her

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
and said that Miao was the one who beat her.

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,400
She's dead.

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
What fun is there?

109
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
She's back.

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
Who did Mr. Chang offend?

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
He hit his own foot with a rock.

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
He was too coincidental today.

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I have to suspect that he was the one who beat me.

114
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
I didn't beat you.

115
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,400
So why did you call me here?

116
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Mr. Ceng.

117
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
We've known each other for so many years.

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
You know me.

119
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm not unreasonable.

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Admit that she's your wife.

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
I'll let you off the hook.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What do you think?

123
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,200
I was the one who beat you.

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
You said it?

125
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Yes.

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Yu Yang, call the police.

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
He beat her and caught her.

130
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Mr. Chang.

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Miao didn't dare to beat you.

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
She said that to piss me off.

133
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
If she goes in,

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
my mom will kill me.

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Admit that she's your wife?

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm here.

137
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Say something.

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Right?

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Yes.

140
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I admit that she's my wife.

141
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Good.

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
Very good.

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,200
Who is this?

144
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Stop talking.

145
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
I can't answer.

146
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
You admit that she's your wife.

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
What about Miss Su?

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Her father?

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Fan?

150
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Fan.

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
It's hard to tell.

152
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
It's not easy to...

153
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not hard.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's simple.

155
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is Yu Yang.

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
This is Yu Yang's girlfriend.

157
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Simple, right?

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
Look.

159
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,200
We all make sense.

160
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
It's late.

161
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
The news is everywhere.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Just tell us.

163
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Miss Su.

164
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
What is yours?

165
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Ex-girlfriend.

166
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Ex-girlfriend?

167
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
Girlfriend is girlfriend.

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,400
Fiancé is fiancé.

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,800
Third is third.

170
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
What is ex-girlfriend?

171
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Mrs. Zeng.

172
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
You're so rude.

173
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,400
She's looking for Third behind you.

174
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
Sun Siyuan.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
You bastard.

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Sorry.

177
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Since you're Miss Zeng's wife.

178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
I trust you.

179
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I didn't hit you.

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Let's go.

181
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm shocked.

182
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
I need to rest.

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Can you think before you act?

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't hit you.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
What's wrong with me?

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
I know what you're like.

187
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,600
You're still pretending.

188
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Why are you yelling in the hallway?

189
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Besides,

190
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,800
I asked you to come here today.

191
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry for everything.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm not involved in your business.

205
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,200
I am.

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Okay.

207
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Now I'm the

208
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
bitch who steals other's boyfriend.

209
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Are you satisfied?

210
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
How could there be

211
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
a heartless bastard like you in this world?

212
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
Bastard.

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Yes.

214
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,600

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Okay, stop it.

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Go find someone.

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
I've already said goodbye to her.

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Just go.

219
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,600
Bastard.

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why did you kill him?

221
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
