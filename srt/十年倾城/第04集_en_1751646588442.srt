The Love by Hypnotic

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Secretary Lin.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Miss Su.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was rude yesterday.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry to apologize to you.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Apologize?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For what?

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Siyuan.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's my fault.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Secretary Lin was rude.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I was just kidding with Siyuan.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I didn't expect that she would tell you the truth.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Siyuan, you're so mean.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why did you let Secretary Lin come here?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Miss Su.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mr. Chen cares about you.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know that.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't have married me.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Secretary Lin.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How about this?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're going to choose a wedding dress and diamond ring in a few days.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can help us with the wedding dress.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
As you wish.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll get back to work.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tell me.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Are you having a good time with Lin Miao Miao?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why are you asking me this?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you want to hear a good news?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What good news?

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The investment of the wedding has been done for you.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Really?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So fast?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I thought you just wanted to coax me.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So you said it on purpose.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When did I lie to you?

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll give you what I can.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait a minute, Mr. Chen.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm almost done.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll take you back.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Secretary Lin will send me back?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Send me back?

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What are you thinking about?

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to the wedding.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll drive.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're not listening to my salary?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can a boss be a good boss?

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Cheers.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A cup of coffee.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Recommend me.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Americano.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Latte.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I have everything. What would you like to drink?

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Latte.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait a minute.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How long have you been working here?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm an intern.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We're in the same school.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My house also sells coffee.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really?

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's your name?

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When you graduate,

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
come to my house to work.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stop it, Mr. Chen.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll drive.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you unhappy?

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Did you just ask Pei Pei to apologize?

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you angry?

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You have to have the self-awareness to be a bull.

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Didn't you just say that you're my boss?

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have to do what the boss asks me to do.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How dare I be emotional?

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll take you home.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll go.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll go.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll go.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll go.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll go.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll go.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll go.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll go.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll go.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll take you home.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Put me down at the subway gate in front.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just take it as a bargaining chip.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's that?

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll take you home.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
should say something good in front of my mom.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let her think about it and talk to Pei Pei.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You've had enough these days.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's the matter between you two?

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Can you make it clear for yourself?

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Stop the car.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Stop the car.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My mom likes you so much.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can't be a good son-in-law.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Miss Su wants Mr. Chen to recognize her as simple as possible.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As long as she can agree to be a full-time wife,

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mr. Chen will accept it.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're so smart.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Can't you see that this is my mom's

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
jubilation policy?

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The purpose is simple.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let her leave.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You know you're still a womanizer.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What else?

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Actually, you know Pei Pei well.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know she's not a beast.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe you two can still be friends in the future.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Mr. Chen,

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
this is not what I meant.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mr. Chen,

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
this is not my obligation.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And,

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
can you think about it carefully

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
when you do things in the future?

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't drag me into it.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't want to be misunderstood by her.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Misunderstanding means she likes me.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We're friends.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
First,

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
we're not friends now.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Use your so-called upper and lower level description to be more accurate.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Second,

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't want to be involved

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
because I'm afraid she'll be a troublemaker.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If she asks me

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
who I choose with Lin Miao Miao,

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't carry this burden.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I choose you.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
After all, my mom can't be without you.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't be without my mom.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you understand?

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're 24 years old.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're so smart.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Take me to Mr. Chen.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To your home?

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My home?

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
How do you know where my home is?

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How can I not know?

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Chen Siyuan,

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
what do you want?

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You don't welcome me.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is there a wild man in your home?

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So what?

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Anyway, it's not as good as your situation.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It seems to be the case.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're here.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Say hello to the back door.

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm angry.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If I remember correctly,

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
today is your birthday.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Open the door.

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Who gives a birthday to someone

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
when it's empty?

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hello, your takeaway.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sorry.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I predicted your prediction.

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're really a workaholic.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Your family is like a rice-growing museum.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Isn't this an antique?

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Where's my one?

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It was born long ago.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I drank it.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
OK.

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm afraid you're nervous.

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You really hid someone?

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hiding someone in the refrigerator?

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm looking for water that I can drink.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Go ahead.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
OK.

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What wish did you make?

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is it to find a boyfriend early

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
or to get revenge overnight?

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Adults don't make choices.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Of course both.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't you also want me to get rid of the burden early?

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In case I'm too idle

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to destroy your relationship with Miss Su.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You won't

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
still think about me, will you?

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Zesiyuan,

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you're really as self-conceited as ever.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Although I don't remember it very clearly,

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I still remember that it was me who proposed the breakup.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're kidding.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're still being stubborn.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you have a game?

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
OK.

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll ask you the truth first.

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Go ahead.

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Zesiyuan,

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
how many women have you slept with

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
in the past ten years?

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know.

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I just know

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that you're not the only one.

209
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There were also many who were not in love with you.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Zesiyuan,

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's too personal.

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can send it.

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
One hand is enough?

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I can't count it.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Two hands.

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can two hands count it?

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You have three hands. Is that enough?

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,760
You're drunk.

220
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,320
Three hands.

221
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,000
You're drunk.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,480
Three hands are not enough.

223
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,000
Then I'll count less.

224
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
Haven't you heard

225
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
about my fame?

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,480
You...

227
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,400
You don't want to ask me

228
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,320
how many men I slept with

229
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,440
over the years?

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,920
Don't you want to know?

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,840
Isn't it about the truth?

232
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
Why don't you ask?

233
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Ask me.

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Ask me.

235
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,960
Ask me.

236
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Ask me.

237
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
I can answer.

238
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,560
Ask me.

239
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,240
You can say it.

240
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,640
Miao Miao.

241
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,440
Ask me.

242
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,320
You're drunk.

243
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,000
You're drunk.

244
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,600
No.

245
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm not.

246
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,120
You're drunk.

247
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm not.

248
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
I said you're drunk.

249
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,080
You're driving me crazy.

250
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,640
The wind you said

251
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,600
is so hard to breathe

252
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm so thirsty.

253
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm thirsty.

254
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,680
One day, one day,

255
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,280
time will slowly pass by

256
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,120
Miao Miao.

257
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,120
Miao Miao.

258
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,200
I can't help but want to finish you

259
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
But in the end,

260
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,680
you still have to go

261
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
But in the end,

262
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,400
you still have to go

263
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
But in the end,

264
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
you still have to go

265
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
But in the end,

266
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,720
you still have to go

267
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
But in the end,

268
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
you still have to go

269
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
But in the end,

270
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
you still have to go

271
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
But in the end,

272
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,720
you still have to go

273
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
But in the end,

274
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,720
I still have to go
