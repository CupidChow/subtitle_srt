1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,660
Jin dialì§€

2
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,960
Ton screwed

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,520
Episode 05

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,720
It's okay

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,400
We should come gather together

6
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Here

7
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,840
Both of you

8
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
have to marry

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,740
this daughter!

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,340
I want...

11
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,940
I want to...

12
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,960
I want...

13
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,380
I want to propose to my parents

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,140
on you

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,140
I...

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,300
that is...

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,420
I have something of you

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,100
is someone else

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,080
Xiguan

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,080
The sky is colorful

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,080
The wind is floating around

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,080
The clouds kiss the sky, slowly saying I love you

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:52,080
The rain will hide your eyes, not leaving

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,080
I take the wind and hold you in my arms

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:08,080
The sight is so close, I'm willing to be with you

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Do you usually take the last walk?

27
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,080
I'm working overtime, I have overtime fee

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Come here, I'll charge you

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,080
There's a star in your eyes

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Right now

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Will you hold me tight?

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
No

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,080
The moon kisses the sky, slowly saying I love you

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm watching them, they're all gone

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,080
The clouds kiss the sky, slowly saying I love you

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,080
I take the wind and hold you in my arms

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,080
The sight is so close, I'm willing to be with you

38
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:25,080
The clouds kiss the sky, slowly saying I love you

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
The rain will hide your eyes, not leaving

40
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,080
I take the wind and hold you in my arms

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,080
The sight is so close, I'm willing to be with you

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
What are you doing?

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
I don't want to be with you

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
I don't know the password

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,080
I look at you without knowing

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,080
The eyes are full of stars

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Only I'm alone

48
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
No, there's a warning

49
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
It's fine

50
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Let's go

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Miao is off work

52
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
I guess she's going on a date with Mr. San

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
What are you doing?

54
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
If someone sees us

55
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Will there be anyone?

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
What if someone is working overtime?

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
No, it's just for a while

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
What if someone sees us?

59
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Annoying

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Who?

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Go, go, go, go

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry

63
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Why are you still not off work?

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
You scared me

65
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
You scared me on the weekend

66
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm on the phone

67
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm taking a night shift to change my design

68
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Oh my god

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
That new sticker

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm cutting medicine

71
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I have to work overtime again

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm dizzy

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Then you go, hurry up

74
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
No, I have to buy a publicist

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Why don't you ask the accountant to go with you?

76
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Why are you so loud?

77
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
What if someone hears you?

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
What's wrong?

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
I found out

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
This Mi Rui is the most important

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
You're embarrassed

82
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
I think this is the best

83
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Not the best

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
No monitoring at home?

85
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
No monitoring

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Can't be done for what you think

87
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
What do you mean by doing for what you think?

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm listening with all my heart

89
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Good night and good dreams with you in the future

90
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
You, my only love

91
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Please allow me

92
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Continuously repeating the courage of love

93
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Don't worry

94
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I want to run to you

95
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Listen to the heart of the grade

96
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Wake up for you

97
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Almost missed you forever

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Lies can't hide their sincerity

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Listening

100
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Good night and good dreams with you in the future

101
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
You, my only love

102
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Please allow me

103
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Continuously repeating the courage of love

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Don't worry

105
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
No, I...

106
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Why not?

107
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
What if I can't do it?

108
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
If you have it, just save it

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm not mentally prepared yet

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
I'll buy it now

111
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I...

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm not full tonight

113
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I'll buy you a meal

114
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
I'm not in the mood for dinner now

115
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
So annoying

116
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Listen to the heart of the grade

117
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Good night and good dreams with you in the future

118
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
The sky is colorful

119
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,080
The wind is around

120
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
The clouds kiss the love

121
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Slowly say I love you

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
The rain will hide you

123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Can't leave

124
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,080
I'm going to hug you in my arms

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
The sight is so close

126
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm willing to be with you

127
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Missing you is too hard

128
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
To be with me

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
The memory is like the moon

130
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
The lotus falls

131
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,080
There is a star in your eyes

132
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Right now

133
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Will you hold me tight

134
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
The moon kisses the love

135
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Slowly say I love you

136
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
You can even read the code

137
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Chen Siyuan

138
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Why are you here?

139
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
I should be asking you this question

140
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Why are you here?

141
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm looking for Lin Miao Miao

142
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Tell me if you need anything

143
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll tell you

144
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Who are you?

145
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
President Deng is a noble man

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Didn't you see it at the party?

147
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Who do you think I am?

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
What are you doing?

149
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm going to the party

150
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
