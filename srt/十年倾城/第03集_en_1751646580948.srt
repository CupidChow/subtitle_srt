The Love of Dream

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's wrong?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're showing your drinking skills?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Did you drink it at the night club?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I heard about it.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're mocking my wine making skills.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I have no right to give you a drink.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I only serve...

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I only serve Teng Dong.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let your Yinyin Yinyan handle your business.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're so popular.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can you change your face?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Make it more innovative.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mr. Chen.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't call me Mr. Chen.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Chen Siyue.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't call me.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't laugh.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're...

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
fighting with Miss Su again?

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not as self-reliant as someone.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Besides,

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I just need to buy a gift.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In your eyes,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
it's not a big deal to buy a gift

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and spend money to solve it.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Isn't it the same for you to do business with my mom?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Didn't you say yesterday

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that you have no blood and no money?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How about this?

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll hire you to work part-time.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's definitely more than what my mom gives you.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can help me draw a sketch

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and make a PPP.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can help me draw a sketch

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to get the right match.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But she can't leave me.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She can also remember yesterday for you.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who can't get along with money?

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Come on.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Turn around and look at the picture.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've learned my lesson.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've learned my lesson.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Miss Su is more self-reliant.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I think you should

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
give her more emotional value.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Open your mouth.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chen Dong gave her a slap.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You shouldn't just give her a slap.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You should give her more company.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Spend more time with her.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can say last night.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can say now.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't just sit here and talk to me.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wait a second!

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think you should give her more company.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Spend more time with her.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
You can say it last night,

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,880
or now.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,120
But not sitting here

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
and talking nonsense with me.

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Missing someone too much

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
is like being forgotten.

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,280
Memories are like the moonlight

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
falling like the fallen petals.

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,520
There's a star in your eyes.

81
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,920
Right now,

82
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,200
will you hold me tight?

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
The moon kisses the sky,

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,320
and the sky is full of the words,

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
I love you.

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
The rain will hide you,

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,480
and the clouds won't leave.

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
I'll be the wind

89
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,360
and you'll be the rain.

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
The sight is so clear,

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,680
I'll follow you.

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,240
The moon kisses the sky,

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
and the sky is full of the words,

94
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
I love you.

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,760
The rain will hide you,

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,680
and the clouds won't leave.

97
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll hire you.

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
You can help me draw a sketch

99
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
to get Pei's attention.

100
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,240
But she can't leave me.

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,920
I'll hold you in my arms.

102
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,320
The sight is so clear,

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'll follow you.

104
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,720
Secretary Lin.

105
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,400
What?

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm in a rush.

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,800
I'll talk to you when I get to the office.

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Have breakfast before you leave.

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm in a hurry. You're in charge.

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm in charge.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,360
Have this.

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,520
If Pei knows

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
I made this breakfast for her this morning,

114
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,920
will she be moved?

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,320
What breakfast?

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,200
It's just takeout.

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Maybe.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
She might be moved and cry.

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,600
Then she'll take a picture and post it on Weibo

120
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
to let the whole world know

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,520
she has such a good boyfriend.

122
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,400
Yes.

123
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,000
Who told me to love her so much?

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,480
I'm not happy

125
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,960
to have breakfast for the one I love.

126
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
Thanks to your advice last night,

127
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,600
I can take action.

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
How about this?

129
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
When you get married,

130
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,760
you'll be the main table.

131
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,480
You don't have to work today.

132
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,960
I've told my mom.

133
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,040
She'll go to the studio with me later

134
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,200
to surprise Pei.

135
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,200
Eat up.

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
We'll leave in 15 minutes.

137
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,980
Think before you speak,

138
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
or you'll get T- succeeded.

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,600
It's the bestations I bought for Peipei.

140
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,660
Mr. Chen,

141
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,480
Yanyuan imperial規制,

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,160
I've got everything ready.

143
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,980
Miss Su will be here in no time.

144
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,740
Wow!

145
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,700
Here's a prize from a twist.

146
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,860
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

147
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,960
Miao Miao,

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,040
let me got it for you.

149
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,780
Thank you.

150
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,140
000 yuan?

151
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,700
Sister, let me get it for you.

152
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,380
Thanks.

153
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,860
Still angry?

154
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,220
Who told you not to stay with me last night?

155
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,860
I have to deal with my mom.

156
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,020
Have you done it?

157
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,340
I've made you a whole set of breakfast.

158
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,300
Still not satisfied?

159
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,420
Not satisfied?

160
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,020
What should I do?

161
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,340
Not going to the bathroom?

162
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,660
Fine.

163
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,380
Really?

164
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,580
I was just saying.

165
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,780
Let her apologize to me for what happened yesterday.

166
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,460
Didn't you say yesterday that you don't need her to apologize?

167
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,180
Yesterday is yesterday.

168
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,900
Can't you do anything about it?

169
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Still staring at me?

170
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,020
No.

171
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,580
You've been staring at her.

172
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,700
Stop it.

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,420
I'm thinking about how to solve this.

174
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,340
I said, let her apologize to me.

175
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,340
She's my mom's dog.

176
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
You know that.

177
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,660
Yesterday was my mom's idea.

178
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,180
We're all talking about big things.

179
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,780
What if she's complaining about my mom again?

180
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,260
We'll be in trouble.

181
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,580
Why do I have to listen to you?

182
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,820
I'm talking to her.

183
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,140
Fine.

184
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,820
I'll go.

185
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,380
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,620
I'm talking to Miao Miao about how to fall in love.

187
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,060
I'm too single.

188
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,900
I don't know when I can get rid of the order.

189
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,260
You have to talk to her.

190
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,900
You have a lot of experience.

191
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,980
Who said that?

192
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,340
Miao Miao just said that.

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,180
She hasn't been in a relationship for a long time.

194
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,340
You're lying.

195
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,660
Really.

196
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,780
Just one.

197
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,740
She was hurt so badly by that scumbag

198
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,100
that she doesn't believe in love anymore.

199
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,980
Don't let me see that scumbag.

200
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,220
Isn't it that the people who chase you can't count?

201
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,180
Every one is right.

202
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,580
Mr. Qin.

203
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,420
You don't have to worry about your employees' private life, right?

204
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,140
Then let's talk about something serious.

205
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,660
Do me a favor.

206
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,820
About Miss Su?

207
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,860
Yes.

208
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,300
She wants you to apologize for what happened yesterday.

209
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,940
Pei Pei didn't do anything.

210
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,020
She gave you a lesson.

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,140
I feel sorry for her.

212
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,780
I love my...

213
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,940
I love my future wife.

214
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,020
Can't I?

215
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,740
Future wife?

216
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,740
Yes.

217
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,500
I don't plan to get married.

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,940
You can't coax your future wife to drag me into the water.

219
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,220
Am I a brick?

220
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,460
Where do I need to move?

221
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,980
When you promised my mom,

222
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,460
why didn't you think of giving yourself a back-up?

223
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,980
I didn't expect you to...

224
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,460
What?

225
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,660
I just went to talk to her on behalf of Mr. Chen.

226
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,300
Why did I have to apologize?

227
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,940
Besides,

228
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,060
I'm not the one who should apologize.

229
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,580
I'm the one who should apologize.

230
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,020
I'm the one who should apologize.

231
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,460
I'm the one who should apologize.

232
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,940
I'm the one who should apologize.

233
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,180
You used to be so clear-headed.

234
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,140
You just let it go.

235
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Why is it different this time?

236
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,380
She can compete with other girls.

237
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,660
She's the only one.

238
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,620
Pei Pei is not the kind of person who can't forgive others.

239
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,980
You apologize to her.

240
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,180
We should work together.

241
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,580
Isn't that good?

242
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,100
Okay.

243
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,540
Well...

244
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,820
It turned out to be...

245
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,100
I know.

246
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,220
Do I look weird?

247
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,180
Stop!

248
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,340
ية

249
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,340
I understand what you want

250
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,340
You once said that watching the stars and the sun

251
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,340
is better than watching my eyes

252
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,340
Every minute, every second, you are by my side and staying by my side

253
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,340
My heart is like a song engraved in my heart

254
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,840
It's turned into an unforgettable pain

255
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,340
In the past, the wind and clouds you mentioned

256
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,340
were all not as strong as your heart

257
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:28,340
Even if one day, one day, time will slowly flow by

258
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,340
When I turn around, I can't help but want to keep you

259
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:40,340
In the end, you still have to leave
