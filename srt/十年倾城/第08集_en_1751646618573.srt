The Long Ballad

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Hello, you must be Su Peipei.

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm the mother of Chen Siyuan.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,600
Hello, Ms. Chen.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,200
Are you free tonight?

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,400
Let's have dinner together.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Okay.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,800
Ms. Chen, look.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:22,720
These are the

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,520
Your mother and Su Peipei fell into the water.

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
Which one do you save first?

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,320
You're talking to me.

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,720
If your mother and Su Peipei fight,

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
which one do you save?

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,720
What do you mean?

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,820
How old are you?

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
I'm 24 years old.

19
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,920
Are you 10 years old or old?

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
10 years old.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,120
24 years old.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,120
I'm a tiger.

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Because I lack water,

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,520
my parents named me Peipei.

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
Your surname?

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,520
I'm the Pisces.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,120
I know Siyuan is the Scorpio.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,520
Our new constellation is 99%.

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,320
We're a match made in heaven.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,120
Blood type?

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,720
I'm O.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Siyuan is A.

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,120
It's said that the two blood types

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,520
gave birth to cute and smart children.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,720
The most important thing is filial piety.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,120
MBTI?

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
MBTI.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm an A.

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
Inferiority complex.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,520
INFJ.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
We believe in true love,

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,920
have empathy,

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
like to give,

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
and are very suitable for partners.

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,120
You can't just say that.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Siyuan wants to marry you,

47
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,320
and I have to nod my head.

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Why do you think

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,120
I'll agree?

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,520
Because of me.

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,120
You're withstand by light.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
CHENOLA,

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,920
we're 본 superficial.

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,320
What did you think

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,520
coffee tasted like?

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,920
Restraints,

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,320
butcol 곡.

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
True.

59
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,120
It's from

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,320
a rescuer's world.

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,120
It maybe tiring

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,720
and hard.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
But

64
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,320
it's a firmer taste.

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,720
I created Mi Rui personally.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,120
In the future,

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,760
who can stand together

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,360
and who can stand up to the waves.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Of course.

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,360
Mom.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,800
Siyuan.

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,880
Mom, the new wife hasn't come in yet.

73
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,200
Why are you so talkative?

74
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,440
As the chairman of Mirui,

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
I personally interviewed

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
the brand ambassador of Mirui.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,520
Do I have to report to you

78
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,040
as the executive board?

79
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,560
What?

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Brand ambassador?

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
Are you interested in it?

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,000
Of course.

83
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Ms. Chen, you're really a good actor.

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,840
We've been working together

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,280
for the past two years.

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,160
We're also making progress in business.

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
If we can work with Mirui,

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,560
we'll definitely win.

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,720
Mom.

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
You're so sudden.

92
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

93
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
You're not being too hasty, are you?

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
When did you meet me

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,120
and talk to me?

96
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
What do you think, Miao Miao?

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,480
All of Ms. Chen's decisions

98
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,240
were made through deep thought.

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,760
Also,

100
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,240
you invested in Ms. Su's film studio.

101
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
I'll transfer the money to her tomorrow.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
Here.

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
Ms. Su.

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,040
Happy cooperation.

105
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,280
Happy cooperation, Ms. Chen.

106
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,200
Hello?

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm downstairs at your house.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,560
What?

109
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
Didn't we agree to go together?

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,080
It's like coming from the wind.

111
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,040
It's tiring and bitter,

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,040
but it's worth the effort.

113
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,960
Follow me and do your best.

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,560
Leave Siyue.

115
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
Ten years.

116
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Senior.

117
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Miao Miao.

118
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,000
It's really you, Lin Miao Miao.

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
What a coincidence.

120
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,200
Long time no see.

121
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,800
You've become prettier.

122
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,800
I was watching you from afar.

123
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,400
You were so small and skinny.

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,600
You're like a child.

125
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,080
Nonsense.

126
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,800
You've been like a child for so many years.

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
You're so old.

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
What are you doing here alone?

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,440
Our company is having a meeting today.

130
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Don't lie to me.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
You're hiding here alone.

132
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
Is it because your boyfriend is bullying you?

133
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,320
Mr. Lin.

134
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,400
Although it's impossible to just clean it up,

135
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,120
at least we can publish a magazine, right?

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,840
Mr. Deng.

137
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,360
Long time no see.

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,080
Hello.

139
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
No.

140
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
I'm not sad.

141
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,080
I'm single.

142
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,080
You two...

143
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
This is my boss.

144
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,400
The executive director of Beauty Coffee, Chen Siyue.

145
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,760
Miss Lin has been the boss for ten years

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,080
since she graduated.

147
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,880
Mi Rui.

148
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Miao Miao.

149
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,880
I didn't expect that

150
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,240
we could have a contact.

151
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm from De Man Commercial.

152
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,320
I'll be responsible for Mi Rui's line.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,360
What a coincidence.

154
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm here today

155
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
to sign the contract.

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,400
I knew it.

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
When I left home this morning,

158
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,840
there were many crickets

159
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,000
at the door of our house.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
It turned out that it was me.

161
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,040
I was so surprised.

162
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,840
Where are the crickets in the rainy days?

163
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm leaving.

164
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,120
I'll get you an umbrella.

165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,680
Miao Miao.

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Here, have some coffee.

167
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,240
Thank you.

168
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,520
Thank you.

169
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,760
Mr. Chen is so kind.

170
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,040
He's so considerate to his subordinate.

171
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,360
It's a blessing for him to work with you.

172
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,000
It's all for the sake of the family.

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,800
You don't know me well.

174
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,440
Right?

175
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,320
You're so talented.

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,040
You're the manager of De Man Commercial.

177
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,200
You're so talkative.

178
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,440
Look at the monkey's feet.

179
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,120
You're so manly.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,920
Many girls must have been

181
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
dreaming about you.

182
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,960
How can they compare to you?

183
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,360
Why don't you tell me your true colors?

184
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,600
Your phone is good.

185
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,960
It's always right.

186
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm trying to be a good friend.

187
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
Although I look mature,

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm actually a child.

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,480
You're a child.

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,600
You didn't even shave your beard.

191
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,640
You're so fresh.

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,880
If you put it that way,

193
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Mr. Chen is an early-kinder.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,560
He looks young.

195
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,000
He's so emotional and resourceful.

196
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,400
When you're with the right person,

197
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,480
you need to practice more.

198
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,480
Are you sick?

199
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Every word you say now

200
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
represents the right person.

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,320
Okay.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,920
Let's go in.

203
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,520
Let's go.

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,480
Happy cooperation.

205
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,080
Happy cooperation.

206
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,720
Mr. Deng.

207
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,720
Happy cooperation.

208
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,720
Happy cooperation.

209
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
Miao Miao won the De Man label

210
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,240
through hard work.

211
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,400
The contract

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,760
was signed by her on behalf of Mi Rui and De Man.

213
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,280
Shouldn't I shake hands with her?

214
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
In Mi Rui,

215
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm a higher level than her.

216
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
That's my honor.

217
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
Mi Rui will definitely give you

218
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,680
a satisfactory answer.

219
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm looking forward to it.

220
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
What do you mean, Chen Siyuan?

221
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
What do you mean?

222
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,920
Today is such an important occasion.

223
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
So many eyes are staring at me.

224
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,360
Why are you so hard on her?

225
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,080
Even if you have personal feelings,

226
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,840
can't you just bear it for Mi Rui?

227
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Look at your eyes.

228
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
Do you think I don't know

229
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,800
what she's thinking?

230
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,680
I need to endure it.

231
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm single.

232
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,680
You're single too.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Even if she has feelings for me,

234
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
I'll still be single.

235
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
Even if she has feelings for me,

236
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,120
what's the big deal?

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,360
Don't I have the right to like others?

238
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,680
