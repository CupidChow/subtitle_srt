Episode 16

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I read an entertainment news a few days ago.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Your Mr.Chen and Miss Su

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
are so romantic

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and they want to have a baby.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What are you?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who are you two?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why do you care about other people's business?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you annoying?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are kicked out of the game.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I know.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Your family is a good match.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One is three, five is her. Two, four, six is you.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You two are in turn.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You want to be happy?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I tell you, men are all the same.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Think with the lower body.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If she doesn't want to tell you, I'll tell you.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you know what is a man's ideal lover?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A woman like this.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A strange woman.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There is a saying,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
what you can't get is what you want.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are like this.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You will be tired of her sooner or later.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Trust me.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then I will also tell you a famous saying.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The dog's mouth can't spit out the elephant's teeth.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mr. Chang.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Show some respect.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I understand.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I know why Mrs. Chen

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
asked Mr. Chen and Miss Su to sing.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Find Xia Jia.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Change another person.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will call you Mrs. Deng.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
OK?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will call you Mrs. Deng.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will call you Mrs. Deng.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
OK?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When did this happen?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why didn't I receive the invitation?

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then don't bother Mr. Chang.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Look at you two.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are old.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You are a family.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
As a family, you can't participate in the beauty auction.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I am with Mr. Deng.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not the kind of relationship you think.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How do you prove it?

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We are clear.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Miss Lin is of course

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
a member of my Chen family.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
She is a woman of my Chen Siyuan.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are you crazy?

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you doing?

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am the host.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Have you asked me what I mean?

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You two are so match.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are wearing green hats for each other.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are not a family.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Can't we have a good talk?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you kidding me?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Have you ever respected me?

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I am your toy.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You are angry in front of so many people.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How can you think you are very powerful?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You are a bossy president.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't mean that.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then what do you mean?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I mean

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you have been avoiding me

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and avoiding me all the time.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't wait for the answer.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have to make the answer.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I am not avoiding you.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You are.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You have been avoiding me all the time.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know I have been missing you.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But you are still avoiding me.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you want to torture me,

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can let you do it.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But you have to give me a deadline.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't have to do that.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I really need a clear answer.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I am afraid I can't hold it anymore.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ten years.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ten years later,

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
if he hasn't gone,

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and you haven't married,

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I won't interfere with you.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I will.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You married to Tong Tianhe.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You are my love.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't feel the heat of the light

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in the love dream between us.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not like the night

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
is always in the dark.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Siyuan.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's take a break, okay?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's take a break and talk about our business.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why?

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wait for me to finish this part.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
How long are you going to be busy?

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How long are you going to be busy?

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is this your excuse to reject me?

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We...

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We are together again, okay?

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you have been thinking about me

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
for so many years,

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we would never have been apart.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I love you.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you hadn't just passed by,

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If I hadn't fallen asleep,

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If the sun hadn't risen,

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If the wind hadn't suddenly disappeared,

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you hadn't said goodbye,

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If the moon hadn't hidden its color,

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If the snow had not fallen,

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If the sea had not yet dried up,

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If the sea had not yet dried up,

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where are you?

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Where are you?

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
In the company.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The sea of clouds is beautiful.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Every shot of you and me

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is like a rainbow.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The wind is floating around.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The moon kisses the love.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What are you doing?

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You are holding my tie.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Just for this?

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's mysterious.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What do you think it is?

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Other services,

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If I can,

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can do it too.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I miss you too much.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not used to it.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Memories are like the moon.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The lotus fell.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There is a star in your eyes.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right now,

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Will you hold me tight?

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not used to it.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Will you hold me tight?

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The moon kisses the love.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Slowly said I love you.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The rain will hide you.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The clouds are not willing to leave.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to save you.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In the arms of the dragon.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The sight is clear.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to save you.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Come in.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mr.Chen.

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I have something to do.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going to start working.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mr.Chen, is Secretary Lin not feeling well?

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
His face suddenly turned red.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is he having too much blood?

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's probably because of Deman.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's under too much pressure.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He's staying up late.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Staying up late?

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How can he have this kind of condition?

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're here to gossip.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, right.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The scene is ready.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
These are the actual scenes.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Please take a look.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Send them to me.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wait.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't talk about Secretary Lin's illness.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're good at it.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm going to save you.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to save you.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going to save you.

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm going to save you.

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to save you.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to save you.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going to save you.

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm going to save you.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm going to save you.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm going to save you.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm going to save you.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to save you.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to save you.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm going to save you.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Snowflakes are like clouds

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Clouds are like dreams

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Every morning, you and I

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The sky is colorful

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like the wind, it's been a long time

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Flowing

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The moon kisses the sky

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Slowly, slowly

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Say I love you

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The rain will hide

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I want to see you

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I can't leave

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm going to save you

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to save you

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm going to save you

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My eyes are closed

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm willing to go with you
