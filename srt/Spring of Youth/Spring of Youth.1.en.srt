1
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,561
That's it.

2
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,689
Your gaze! Eyes!

3
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,857
Gye!

4
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,943
-Move!
-Move. Emergency patient!

5
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,699
Mom.

6
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,869
Why are the lights off?

7
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,373
Is it nighttime?

8
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,634
Unfortunately, his only hope right now

9
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,969
is a corneal transplant.

10
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,555
Mom, no.

11
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,056
I have an audition.

12
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,225
I'm going to be a singer, Mom.

13
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,270
Mom, seriously. I'm fine.

14
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,855
I'm okay, Mom.

15
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,148
It's all right, Gye.

16
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,402
My eyes are totally fine.

17
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,746
SAGYE!

18
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,040
My name is SAGYE.

19
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,834
I'm the leader of The Crown.

20
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,795
I'm the luckiest guy ever.

21
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,925
Because I have an eye that glimmers
like the brightest gem in the universe.

22
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,429
Never have I seen eyes
more beautiful than mine.

23
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,599
People say I was blessed by God.

24
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,435
That I was granted God's grace.

25
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,064
As a result,

26
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,400
I became a megastar in Korea.

27
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,944
No, I became an international superstar.

28
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,197
-Forever with you.
-Forever with you.

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,491
-We love you, The Crown.
-We love you, The Crown.

30
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,035
I let 'em burn

31
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,870
Enough thinking, I believe

32
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,122
Why think you're
The only one playing games?

33
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,457
You're arrogant

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,958
If you want to go all the way, okay

35
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,168
I'm following my instincts now

36
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,336
Depends on time

37
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,255
Move fast
You're losing in this game

38
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,549
My soul has been thirsty

39
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,844
Your voice wakes it up

40
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,180
And I hear it

41
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,433
So no more playing games

42
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,435
I'll see you tonight

43
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,729
I don't think you get it

44
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,814
Why so hot and cold?

45
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,524
Freaking awesome

46
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:58,780
You set my world on fire

47
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,659
My heart's burning up
Because of you

48
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,327
It's flaming, it's burning

49
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,203
Freaking awesome

50
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:11,334
You set my world on fire

51
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:16,631
So your cold heart will melt too

52
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,342
-Fight fire with fire
-Fight fire with fire

53
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,978
I just received some amazing news.

54
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,396
-What?
-What is it?

55
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,981
Brace yourselves.

56
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,692
Our song topped

57
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,653
the World Music Chart!

58
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,364
I owe it all to you, Crowners.

59
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,741
You made this happen for us.

60
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,954
Thanks. You know
how much we love you, right?

61
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,088
Roopretelcham.

62
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,139
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

63
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,267
We ranked number one!

64
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,312
-Goodness.
-Thank you, Mr. Jo.

65
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,731
We owe it all to you.

66
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,443
-Where's Ji-na?
-Right, well…

67
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,904
It seems as though
she came across a decent song.

68
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,867
You know how she is.
Once she's hooked, she sees it through.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,201
Is this Ms. Kim Bom?

70
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,163
I'm Producer Jo Ji-na
at Jo & Jo Entertainment.

71
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,374
I love your song
and would like the rights to it.

72
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,627
Meet me tomorrow in my office at 9 a.m.

73
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,629
Listen up!

74
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,925
Who wants to do a drinking contest with me
over this watch as the prize?

75
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,303
Bring it on!

76
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,934
Bring it.

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,691
-SUNDER! There he goes.
-Hold it together.

78
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,987
What the…

79
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,197
INO, better luck next time.

80
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,199
Bring it on, Mr. Jo!

81
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,325
You got it!

82
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,460
-Yes!
-Go, SAGYE!

83
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,171
You okay?

84
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,340
Of course. I'm fine.

85
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,765
-Sir, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

86
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,361
This melody…

87
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,128
I dream from time to time.

88
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,923
Vivid, dynamic dreams.

89
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,844
But every time I do,
I hear a certain melody

90
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,387
and see a girl.

91
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,914
It's that time again.

92
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,501
It's 5:45 a.m.

93
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,045
At this exact time,

94
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,755
I wake up from my sleep.

95
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,222
GRAND AWARD

96
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,434
Damn it. Why won't he open up?

97
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,691
Good.

98
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,861
Good.

99
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,405
Perfect.

100
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,119
What the hell?

101
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,996
Did you let yourself in again?

102
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,041
We promised not to invade
each other's privacy.

103
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,752
Says the one
who wouldn't pick up his phone!

104
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,003
What's the deal?

105
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,547
I have the day off today.

106
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,759
Are you saying…

107
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,012
Are you saying I punched Mr. Jo?

108
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,764
You really don't remember?

109
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,975
It's a mess because of that video!

110
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,646
This nutjob.

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,648
Are you saying that's me?

112
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,068
How's Mr. Jo? Is he all right?

113
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,862
-He's been hospitalized.
-Hospitalized?

114
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,781
You should worry about yourself.

115
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,576
This video is all over social media.

116
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,619
You're done for!

117
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,957
What the hell did I do to Mr. Jo?

118
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,501
What did I do?

119
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,713
It's SAGYE!

120
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,884
-Sorry, everyone.
-SAGYE!

121
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,261
Sorry. Can you move?

122
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,554
Coming through.

123
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,056
Just a second. Coming through.

124
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,475
Hold on.

125
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,644
Isn't this…

126
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,203
Don't just stand there. Hurry inside.

127
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,288
Excuse us. Sorry.

128
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,290
Hold on. Just a second.

129
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,875
Hold on.

130
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,214
Sorry about this. Just a second.

131
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,799
Coming through.

132
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,761
I'm going to be late.

133
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,903
Ms. Kim Bom? I'm sorry I made you wait.

134
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,154
It's all right.

135
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,532
As you know, we're dealing with a crisis,
so I was in a meeting.

136
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,412
Here's the contract.

137
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,457
Once you sign it, Jo & Jo will retain
all rights to the songs.

138
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,793
You'll no longer
have any ownership over them.

139
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,338
They won't be my songs anymore? How so?

140
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,924
But we're offering five times
what rookie songwriters receive.

141
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,509
That's an unparalleled offer.

142
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
But…

143
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,180
-The directors are asking for you.
-Got it.

144
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,808
I'll leave the contract,
so sign it before leaving.

145
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,435
You'll be paid in full
the second this is processed.

146
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,520
-Then…
-But…

147
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,915
And they call themselves the top agency?

148
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,502
-Can you see anything?
-I can't.

149
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,088
-What can you hear?
-Nothing.

150
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,924
Damn it.

151
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,141
How could these hands ever harm Mr. Jo?

152
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,894
I admire and respect him the most,
after my mom.

153
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,481
I must've been out of it.

154
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,484
-Maybe I should just kill myself.
-That's nonsense.

155
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,822
Jo & Jo lost 10 billion won in
market value because of that video.

156
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,449
In just two hours.

157
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,328
I bet you lied about respecting Mr. Jo.
You seemed like you were seeing red.

158
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,205
How should I know? I don't remember.

159
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,167
I remember pouring coffee cocktails
down my throat,

160
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,794
but I'm drawing a blank on the rest.

161
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,507
Why can't you see reason
whenever there's a wager involved?

162
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,717
Jeez.

163
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,178
Hey, it must be over.

164
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,183
Ji-na.

165
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,934
Come with me.

166
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,358
The group will perform
without you for now.

167
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,444
You'll be excluded and should lie low.

168
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,321
-But Ji-na--
-It's my dad's order.

169
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,323
Let's not make things worse.

170
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,824
Reporters are already coming after you

171
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,160
for being rude to fans
and accepting luxury gifts.

172
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,871
I'm only guilty
of giving back to the fans,

173
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,249
and they wanted me to speak casually
like I would to a friend.

174
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,585
Don't you know how many people
want to see you go down?

175
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,837
They're now trying
to drag The Crown down too.

176
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,090
-They're digging up other members' pasts.
-That's insane.

177
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,218
What I did has nothing to do with them.

178
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,262
Why take them down
when they did nothing wrong?

179
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,890
So lie low if you're worried about them.

180
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,642
Go back to school while on this break.

181
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,645
School? As in Hanju University?

182
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,188
That's right.

183
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,190
I'm a student there.

184
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,193
I never attended any classes, so I forgot.

185
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,699
It's just until things get quiet.

186
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,452
Show them you're serious
about your studies.

187
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,621
Then we'll have you back
in a month or two.

188
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,043
How is Mr. Jo doing?

189
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,421
-I bet he's furious.
-Of course he is.

190
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,883
He got punched by someone
he thought of as his own

191
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,593
and got his bones broken.

192
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,055
My dad is a proud man, but there's
a humiliating video of him out there.

193
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,432
All right, fine. I'll do as I'm told.

194
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,685
I won't let this affect the others.

195
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,146
If it'll get Mr. Jo to forgive me,
I'll do anything and everything.

196
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,024
Drop SAGYE from all future events

197
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,360
and write a press release
announcing his leave of absence.

198
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,321
-With SAGYE's handwritten apology too.
-Yes, ma'am.

199
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,245
You're offering peanuts
in exchange for extensive rights.

200
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,665
I ask that you do right
by my songs. From Kim Bom.

201
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,543
Good job, my puppy. Well done.

202
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,836
That hurts.

203
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,380
Did that hurt?
I shouldn't be hurting my niece.

204
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,466
You need to stay healthy
to write more songs to sell.

205
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,677
These surely aren't enough side dishes.

206
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,805
I'll quickly grill a mackerel for you.
Again, so proud!

207
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,684
My mom spilled the milk,
but you're the one cleaning it up.

208
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,895
This is some life you have, Bom.

209
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,314
I'd have kicked her out if I were you.

210
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,942
My daughter always says the right things.

211
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,694
But things that deserve a smack!

212
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,363
Why would you hit me?

213
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,533
I've been working on my toes
for two hours!

214
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,746
Auntie.

215
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,957
Yes? What is it? What do you need?

216
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,544
-Let me be clear.
-Sure.

217
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,881
Take out a loan against the house
or cause trouble like this again,

218
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,341
and you'll be dead to me.

219
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,094
Are you going to kick us out?

220
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,721
That's a power trip.

221
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,890
How could you be so cruel to the weak?

222
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,224
We're family!

223
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,352
And that's why
I've been putting up with you.

224
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,562
This money for my songs
only covered half the debt.

225
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,230
If we end up facing foreclosure,

226
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,566
we'll be evicted
whether we like it or not.

227
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,985
I didn't take out the loan for myself.

228
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,863
It was to make things better
for the three of us.

229
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,074
Why do you have to be so heartless?

230
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,035
She's right. How can you
you'll cut ties with us?

231
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,203
-Are you a type T?
-Yes!

232
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,789
I always let logic guide me,
and not my heart!

233
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,708
I'm furious as it is
so don't make it worse!

234
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,086
Why take it out on me?

235
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,337
Am I an easy target for you?

236
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,009
It's not like I did anything wrong.

237
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,888
When angry, one should eat.
Dried laver or the fried egg?

238
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,391
-Dried laver.
-Dried laver it is.

239
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,892
Those songs I sold.

240
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
I was saving them for the right artist.

241
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,356
Of course. I know that better than anyone.
Eat up for now.

242
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,693
They didn't deserve
to be sold at a cheap price.

243
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,111
Of course, I know.

244
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,988
Wait! Quiet, guys.

245
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,200
My SAGYE uploaded a post.

246
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,536
This is SAGYE.

247
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,746
-SAGYE…
-I'm sorry I disappointed you.

248
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,291
This is all my fault,
and I only have myself to blame.

249
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,545
I extend my apologies to Mr. Jo as well.

250
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,630
I apologize to my fans

251
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,091
and the members of The Crown.

252
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,219
Mr. Jo whom I love and respect,

253
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,388
this is SAGYE.

254
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,390
Whenever fame goes to my head,

255
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,101
I think about the first day we met.

256
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,520
To me, you were a blessing.

257
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,358
That line should be delivered
like a solid rock.

258
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,027
Mr. Jo.

259
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,446
Have a seat.

260
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,658
Go ahead. When holding a power chord,

261
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,036
press with the pinky
and not the ring finger.

262
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,955
It'll be more comfortable to hold
and will sound better.

263
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,123
Give it a try.

264
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,514
Nice. I think that's it.

265
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,476
You've been staying back
to practice, haven't you?

266
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,102
Did someone tell you to?

267
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,523
No, sir. I just can't call it a day
until I'm satisfied.

268
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,903
On top of that, I went from being
the main dancer to being in a rock band.

269
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,030
I see you're tenacious.

270
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,157
-What's your name?
-It's Sa Gye.

271
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,285
Last name, Sa. First name, Gye.

272
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,871
Like the Korean word
for Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons"?

273
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,540
Yes, and my mom
runs a hair salon called Vivaldi.

274
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,210
I'm really sorry.

275
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,463
I'll patiently wait until you forgive me.

276
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,885
I…

277
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,179
I was there!

278
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,768
No way.

279
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,062
No one was there.

280
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,898
So what could he have seen?

281
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,153
Is it too much to ask
for money to rain down?

282
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,091
You should be lying low,
but you're pompous than ever.

283
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,343
Cool and stylish is my middle name.

284
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,596
Just wait and see
how I take Hanju University

285
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,763
by storm.

286
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,515
-Hand me Paul already.
-Here.

287
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,354
Don't forget your umbrella.
It'll rain today.

288
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,732
It'll rain?

289
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,816
Are you kidding me?

290
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,902
As if rain will be allowed

291
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,404
on the first day of school
for the great SAGYE.

292
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,489
I'm WW, remember?

293
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,158
The Weather Whisperer.

294
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,869
Let the sun shine!

295
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,711
Weather Whisperer, my foot.

296
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,963
I should've listened to Seung-su!

297
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,220
Didn't anyone hear
that I'd be in classes today?

298
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,639
Why is nobody welcoming me?

299
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,603
Not even bad weather
can keep them away from me.

300
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,154
Now, all my clothes are wet.

301
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,282
Where's my phone?

302
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,790
Did it have to be windy too?

303
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,508
I'm loving the rain.

304
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,884
Do you remember last year?

305
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,846
As if I could forget that.

306
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,139
That's when a legend

307
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,433
was written at this school.

308
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,613
On the day of the first autumn rain,

309
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,366
a boy and a girl
who meet at the College of Art bench

310
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,619
are destined to fall in love.
Just like we did.

311
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,764
-Hey.
-Where are you?

312
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,767
The bench outside the College of Art.
It's pouring.

313
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,354
You don't have an umbrella, do you?
Stay there. I'll be there in five.

314
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,647
Actually, I'm fine…

315
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,365
Come on.

316
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,328
Found it.

317
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,372
Luck is on my side.

318
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,916
Rain!

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,127
Please stop pouring down.

320
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,420
Roopretelcham!

321
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,131
At that moment,

322
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,633
the impossible happened.

323
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,055
This melody.

324
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,794
The pounding of my heart
muffled the sound,

325
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,170
but I still heard it clearly.

326
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,880
The melody from my dreams.

327
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,799
Am I dreaming?

328
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,469
Why do I hear the melody coming from her?

329
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,015
Also, why am I tearing up?

330
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,746
What's with that melody?

331
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,083
-What?
-What's up with that music just now?

332
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,505
Bom.

333
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,300
Tae-yang.

334
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,021
How do you know my song?

335
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,316
Your song? It's your song?

336
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,114
Bom!

337
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,622
Right, Tae-yang.

338
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,338
What's his deal?

339
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,506
What?

340
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,134
It's nothing. Let's go.

341
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,188
-It's not raining anymore.
-What?

342
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,107
Right.

343
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,748
It's killing me.

344
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,542
I want to know so badly.

345
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,337
Who is she anyway?

346
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,882
How can that song be hers?
How is that even possible?

347
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,510
Bom!

348
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,304
Is her name Bom?

349
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,057
Or is it Bo-mi?

350
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,270
Tae-yang.

351
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,730
When did you get here?

352
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,818
Oh, well… I was just passing by.

353
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,862
Liar. You weren't just passing by.

354
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,080
Can't you come up with better excuses?

355
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,916
You're using Bom as an excuse to see me.

356
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,752
Why would you think that?

357
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,170
It's obvious.

358
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,339
Why are you doing this?
It's uncomfortable.

359
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,384
I'm sorry to say this,
but my heart only beats for SAGYE.

360
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,094
You being a med student

361
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,471
doesn't do anything for me
even with all the CPRs.

362
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,932
My heart won't beat for you,
so give up already.

363
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,981
Why is she like that all the time?

364
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,734
Where do her delusions come from?

365
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,029
She needs to see a professional, right?

366
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,822
Aren't I right?

367
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,743
I don't know.

368
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,578
At least she's adorable.

369
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,416
Let's go.

370
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,934
-Will SAGYE be here today? No way!
-I'm so nervous!

371
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,186
That's him.

372
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,687
-SAGYE?
-He's here.

373
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,106
-SAGYE!
-Over here!

374
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,859
-SAGYE!
-SAGYE!

375
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,863
SAGYE!

376
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,282
Hey, girls.

377
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,660
Take a photo with me.

378
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,537
All right. One, two, three.

379
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,664
Are you kidding me?

380
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,717
I need to find her.

381
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,720
I'm looking for someone.

382
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,180
Do you know anyone named Bom--

383
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,807
SAGYE, sing us a song.

384
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:10,438
-Sing for us!
-Sing for us!

385
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,565
-Sing for us!
-Well, shall I?

386
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,365
Freaking awesome

387
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:25,578
You set my world on fire

388
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,580
My heart's burning up
Because of you

389
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,624
Here I am singing on my guitar,

390
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,042
so where is she?

391
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,877
Hey!

392
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,383
Do you want to get slapped
with a noise complaint? Do you?

393
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,427
-What the hell?
-He's so annoying.

394
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,761
Yes, you!

395
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,349
-What the hell?
-What's his problem?

396
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,226
Who knows what his problem is?

397
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,769
-I don't.
-Don't mind him.

398
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,439
He's jealous, that's all.
Only see nice things.

399
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,233
Either way, that'll be all for today.

400
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,860
Just one more.

401
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,530
I'm afraid I should get to class.

402
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,992
I'll walk you
to the Department of Theater and Film.

403
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,871
I'm a Crowner, SAGYE.

404
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,625
Do you… recognize me?

405
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,462
At your concert, I screamed the loudest

406
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,339
from the standing zone!

407
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,008
That was me!

408
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,342
There's something on your face.

409
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,137
What the… Who has a mirror?

410
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,263
You're good.

411
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,849
Prettiness, cuteness, and loveliness.

412
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,522
Come on.

413
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,441
-Hey!
-Hold on.

414
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,193
"To be, or not to be."

415
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,570
You should do this.
I can't get into character.

416
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,199
Everyone, may I have your attention?

417
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,244
SAGYE is here.

418
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,164
Hi.

419
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,416
I'm Sa Gye, a freshman
studying theater and film.

420
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,168
It's a pleasure to meet you!

421
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,923
All right. Let's focus.

422
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,007
-Here we go.
-Sure.

423
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,259
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question."

424
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,511
Did they just ignore me?

425
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,762
No.

426
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,515
They're just intimidated by your presence.

427
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,933
Those wusses.

428
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,687
Guys, let's spread out and try again.

429
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,441
Lastly, you'll act out
the scene from Hamlet.

430
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,736
-Who wants to take on the role of Hamlet?
-Go ahead.

431
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,659
-Do you want to try?
-Yes, sir.

432
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,660
Come on out.

433
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,120
I bet his agency
gave him extensive acting lessons.

434
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,330
We'll see.

435
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,378
"To be,

436
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,713
or not to be."

437
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,258
"That is the question."

438
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,594
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

439
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,389
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune."

440
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,598
"Or…"

441
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,267
"To take arms

442
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,604
against a sea of troubles!"

443
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,819
Seriously?

444
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,613
I'm outraged for sure.

445
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,533
Your acting was…

446
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,160
Raw and lively,
like fish in the sea, right?

447
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,370
That was cutting-edge, right?

448
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,124
I have many talents
and am a jack-of-all-trades, you know.

449
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,084
I don't lack in any way.

450
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,296
I heard you radiated positivity.
They weren't joking about that.

451
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,549
These days,
my unique optimism is the trend.

452
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,093
The class ended, so let's grab a meal.

453
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,845
I'd love to eat at the cafeteria!

454
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,770
Since it's my first day,
lunch will be on me!

455
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,232
Order whatever you want!

456
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,360
Eat whatever you want.
Please be fond of SAGYE.

457
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,531
We'd like you to be the face
of Hanju University.

458
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,699
Of course.

459
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,826
Put everything on this.

460
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,870
-SAGYE!
-SAGYE!

461
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,831
-Yes!
-SAGYE.

462
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,626
I'm the department rep
for the entering class of 2025.

463
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,879
A lot of our classmates
are struggling financially.

464
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,340
-Financially?
-Yes.

465
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,468
They can't go on retreats,
let alone afford letterman jackets.

466
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,803
It's been bugging me.

467
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,057
I'll pay for everything
including jackets for everyone.

468
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,392
-But--
-I want to be a good classmate.

469
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,020
I've been too busy
to spend my money anyway.

470
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,313
Don't you worry.

471
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,649
-Thanks.
-Peace out!

472
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,942
Sure.

473
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,881
-What are you doing?
-Putting up wallpaper.

474
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,092
Exactly. All of a sudden?

475
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,885
-I'll put the room up for rent.
-What?

476
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,304
We need the deposit to pay off the debt.

477
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,223
We can't be evicted.

478
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,642
I'll put down your number,
so make sure to pick up.

479
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,810
Okay.

480
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,068
ROOM FOR RENT
DEPOSIT 50 MILLION WON, MEAL INCLUDED

481
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:24,002
VIEW OF THE CITY
PENTHOUSE MULTI-LEVEL LOFT, POOL HOUSE

482
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,673
Jeez, why are you so fussy?

483
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,050
People would think
your job is cleaning that piano.

484
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,844
Wrap it up.

485
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,100
Bunny-hop, it won't be long.

486
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,145
I'll earn enough money
to take you home someday.

487
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:48,151
When will I ever find her
if I spend my days answering to fans?

488
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,372
What are you up to?
Did you stay up all night?

489
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,834
Are you already heading into work?

490
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,878
The lights were on, so I came to check.

491
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,422
Whiskey at this hour?

492
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,506
Leave it.

493
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,052
This is about SAGYE, right?

494
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,638
I told you we should've handled it
by saying it wasn't a big deal.

495
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,932
I don't get
why you're not releasing a statement.

496
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,017
Does SAGYE…

497
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,312
remember what he did?

498
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,480
Not at all.

499
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,523
What did he even say to you?

500
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,069
Why did he blow a fuse like that?
He never lets alcohol speak for him.

501
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,362
Get going.

502
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,700
Being like this

503
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,827
isn't like you at all.

504
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,798
Hey.

505
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,217
I need you to look into someone.

506
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,766
I doubt anyone will recognize me now.

507
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,144
Do you know someone
by the name of Bom or Bo-mi?

508
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,606
Her hair's about this long.
She's pretty and extremely busy.

509
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,275
Kim Bom?
She's a first-year applied music student.

510
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,485
Kim Bom?

511
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,654
Applied music?
Where's the department room?

512
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,447
She should be at her part-time job.

513
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,158
Her part-time job? Where?

514
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,745
SAGYE was asking about you.

515
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,080
I told you where you worked.

516
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,206
What's the deal?

517
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,670
How do you know my song?

518
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,421
Your song? It's your song?

519
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,467
Welcome.

520
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,013
Where's Kim Bom?

521
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,098
Wait. Bom?

522
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,686
She's already left.

523
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,104
Really?

524
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,107
That's a bummer. I'll come back tomorrow.

525
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,192
I'll see you around.

526
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,528
He left.

527
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,697
No way!

528
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,116
Why was SAGYE looking for you?
How do you know him?

529
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,285
-How did you become friends?
-We're not.

530
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,080
I only met him once.

531
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,248
I should go.

532
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,085
You can't leave me hanging.

533
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,837
Tell me how you two know each other.

534
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,505
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

535
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,258
But… Bom, wait!

536
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,438
Can you move?

537
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,565
You're in my way.

538
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,944
How can that melody be yours?

539
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,404
Because I wrote it myself.

540
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,239
Exactly, but I need an explanation.

541
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,616
Hold up and talk to me.

542
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,534
Stop following me. I'm busy.

543
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,913
Do you have a guy waiting?
Why are you always so busy?

544
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,833
That's right. A guy's waiting for me.
Happy now?

545
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,085
Kim Bom!

546
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,132
I know the melody, that's all.

547
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,425
I heard it in my dreams.

548
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,428
Seriously. You again?

549
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,102
Head on first.

550
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,106
Sure.

551
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,400
Kim Bom, wait!

552
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,032
Oh, my back.

553
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,873
Stop bothering her.
You're getting on my nerves.

554
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,708
That was my last warning.

555
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,636
As if that'll stop me.

556
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,472
I'm someone who can't stand being curious.

557
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,848
Kim Bom.

558
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,102
Kim Bom.

559
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,146
Kim Bom, where are you?

560
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,984
Kim Bom!

561
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,194
Kim Bom!

562
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,196
Do you know where Kim Bom is?

563
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,324
In there.

564
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,827
Okay, thank you.

565
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,511
Stop.

566
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,096
Are you dense?

567
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,890
I see you're in a band.

568
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,434
This is the date spot?

569
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,062
Get out already. We need to practice.

570
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,981
Way to bury the lead.

571
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,775
Here. I'm joining your band.

572
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,777
It turns out that I'm someone…

573
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,656
-you need.
-What are you doing?

574
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,533
That'd be great.

575
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,201
Tae-yang's our lead guitarist,

576
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,203
but med school often keeps him away.

577
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,833
SAGYE of Hanju University
and SAGYE of The Crown finally meet

578
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,293
in our band.

579
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,545
Hold on. Who's SAGYE of Hanju University?

580
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,006
Who else but Seo Tae-yang?

581
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,135
-That's a cheap use of my name.
-Hey!

582
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,637
He's the leader of our band.

583
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,639
Tae-yang, should we take his application?

584
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,350
Yes, and use it as scrap paper.

585
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,642
He obviously doesn't qualify.

586
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,190
Look at that. You're being chicken.

587
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,733
You think I'll overshadow you.

588
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,568
I'd be scared too if I were you.

589
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,612
You can never compare to the real deal.

590
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,322
This is childish.

591
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,949
I bet you've never seen me perform.

592
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,660
That's why you're afraid.

593
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,121
Or maybe… you're insecure.

594
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,125
Why would I feel inferior to you?

595
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,836
Because you'll never come out
from under my shadow.

596
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,755
Why am I in your shadow?

597
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,216
I was first.

598
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,306
Fine.

599
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,682
Bring it on.

600
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,393
It does make me curious.

601
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,020
Are you actually good,
or is this a pissing contest?

602
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,689
But if I win, you'll stay away

603
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,691
from our band.

604
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,194
Sure.

605
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,409
-Here?
-Yes, they'll do it here.

606
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,952
What's going on with the band?

607
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,620
Tae-yang's going up against SAGYE.

608
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,165
-No way.
-SAGYE versus Seo Tae-yang?

609
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,834
Can you believe it?

610
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:24,547
-Seo Tae-yang!
-Seo Tae-yang!

611
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,759
-Seo Tae-yang!
-Seo Tae-yang!

612
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,388
-Seo Tae-yang!
-Seo Tae-yang!

613
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,766
-Seo Tae-yang!
-SAGYE.

614
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,852
SAGYE!

615
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,355
Gyu-ri's here to support you.

616
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,774
Huh? I didn't call for you.

617
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,151
This is all my fault.

618
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,154
Tae-yang has the hots for me, you see.

619
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,615
But I made the mistake
of telling him that I like you.

620
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,535
However, you're the only one for me.

621
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,828
Right. Sure.

622
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
Tae-yang.

623
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,087
You can't do this.
Don't you know when to give up?

624
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,547
Why bring SAGYE into this?

625
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,841
You must not know about love,
but this is an obsession.

626
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,384
Don't be clingy!

627
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,012
What?

628
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,308
If I win this battle,

629
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,393
you'll tell me why that song is yours.

630
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,978
That…

631
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,648
We'll talk if you win.

632
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,650
That's a promise.

633
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,695
Roopretelcham.

634
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,543
Why the heck is my heart racing?

635
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,266
All right. Over here!

636
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,522
I'm the Jindo dog of Hanju University.
Its poltergeist.

637
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,399
Gong Jin-gu, at your service!

638
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,860
-Yes!
-SAGYE!

639
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,028
-Move.
-Go, SAGYE!

640
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,613
SAGYE of Hanju University?

641
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,823
I'll make sure
you're never called that again.

642
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,993
That's exactly what I want.

643
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,204
I hate being called that.

644
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,296
Roopretelcham!

645
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,928
-Let's go.
-You're the best!

646
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,190
Watch me play. This one's for you.

647
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,444
Keep your word.

648
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,363
I have to know why I hear your song

649
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,656
in my dreams.

650
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,701
SAGYE, won't you be playing
other instruments?

651
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,996
I'm not interested in playing dirty.

652
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,291
It'll just be me and my guitar.

653
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,546
-Yes!
-Go, SAGYE!

654
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:20,848
See that?

655
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,101
That's not too shabby.

656
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:41,827
-SAGYE!
-SAGYE!

657
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,793
A showdown?

658
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,504
Of course, you're already creating drama.

659
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,980
Smiling?
What do you have in store for us?

660
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,531
No way.

661
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,825
He's mimicking drums on a guitar.

662
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,788
You can perform that live?
You've gotten even better.

663
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,832
Could my darling SAGYE lose?

664
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,250
Tae-yang has mad skills.

665
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,112
I'll tap out.

666
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,285
The competition got to my head again,
and I lost my control.

667
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,246
I lost.

668
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,664
Seo Tae-yang wins!

669
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,626
-Oh, no.
-It's all right!

670
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,336
-You did great.
-It's fine.

671
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,297
-Nice!
-You did great.

672
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,593
-Good job.
-That was amazing.

673
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:24,823
Hey.

674
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,785
-Does she go to Hanju University?
-Yes, sir.

675
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,370
Kim Bom is a student here.

676
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,331
She also seems to know Sa Gye well.

677
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,583
-Who did you say she knows?
-Sa Gye.

678
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,710
I also sent you a photo of them together.

679
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,387
They know each other?

680
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,642
Maybe The Crown rigged
the World Music Chart.

681
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,769
Think about it. He even lost to his dupe.

682
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,896
Why did he tap out?
They were neck and neck.

683
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,191
Isn't it obvious?
It was to hide that he's a fraud.

684
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,443
I bet he'll be too humiliated
to be back at school.

685
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,782
Hey, Do-hyeon, Min-jun.

686
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,120
What are you doing?

687
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,165
Well, Hanju Band turned me down,

688
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,209
but that doesn't mean
I can't start a band.

689
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,630
Audition if you're interested.

690
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,448
Don't worry. I'm not here to bother you.

691
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,867
I lost, so I won't ask questions.

692
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,327
I keep my word.

693
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,040
What's good here? Have you eaten?

694
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,794
You said you wouldn't ask questions,
so I don't have to answer.

695
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,838
Ask her to take your order.

696
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,139
Bunny-hop, let's get along like always.

697
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,318
Does she major in piano?

698
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,799
Are you kidding me, Kim Bom?

699
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,428
You're full of surprises.

700
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,023
Bom is playing the tune of spring.

701
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,651
I sense spring in every part of me.

702
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,445
I want to know

703
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,865
why she's always on my mind.

704
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,158
Why is she in my thoughts?

705
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,286
Why do I want to keep her in my eyes?

706
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,415
Hey! Join my band, will you?

707
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,417
Please, let's do it.

708
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,211
I fell for you, that's all.

709
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:31,385
What I meant to say was
that I fell for your piano skills.

710
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,178
-Join my band and--
-Cut the crap and leave

711
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,805
before I report you for stalking.

712
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,309
Wait for me!

713
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,561
I won't give up until you say yes.

714
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,445
I know what you did six years ago.

715
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,739
I was there!

716
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,224
Wait. Mr. Jo?

717
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,022
I've been dying to see you.

718
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,150
I'm sorry, Mr. Jo.

719
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,235
You have two options.

720
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,279
Enlist…

721
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,406
or go abroad to study.

722
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,366
Mr. Jo, that's out of the blue.

723
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,410
Enlist?

724
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,079
Study abroad? What about The Crown?

725
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,457
The Crown is no longer your concern.

726
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,714
I'd like your answer as soon as possible.

727
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,674
No!

728
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:58,054
I'm not saying I won't enlist.
I will someday.

729
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,099
But not right now.
Same for studying abroad.

730
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,438
Is this because I punched you while drunk?

731
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,107
I don't know what came over me.

732
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,695
But what happened six years ago?

733
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,699
You…

734
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,117
You remember everything.

735
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,537
You remember it all but--

736
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,123
No, I only remember what I said.

737
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,794
"I know what you did six years ago."

738
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,545
"I was there."

739
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,218
But that's absurd.
Six years ago, we weren't--

740
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,345
I don't want to hear it.

741
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,973
Just do as I say. Got it?

742
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,809
I won't.

743
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,270
You never once said no to me.

744
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,481
You always obeyed!

745
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,816
That's why…

746
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,068
I can refuse you at least once.

747
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,072
Sure.

748
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,201
This is where it ends for us, then.

749
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,204
But Mr. Jo…

750
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,456
Mr. Jo!

751
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,418
Mr. Jo…

752
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,886
If you won't do as I say,

753
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,432
I'll have to prepare for the worst.

754
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,326
What made you dare
to challenge our band leader?

755
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,828
You have balls.

756
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,455
On top of that,
you'll put together your own band?

757
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,377
I suggest you keep playing the role
of the pretty K-pop idol that you are.

758
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,171
If you want to keep
that pretty face, I mean.

759
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,632
I'm not in a good mood,

760
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,467
so lay off me.

761
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,890
Of course, he has an expensive guitar.

762
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,184
I hate those
who buy musical talent with money.

763
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,403
I told you to cut it out

764
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,405
and leave.

765
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,537
Who are you to order us around?

766
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,039
You think you're better than us?

767
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,124
Tell me. Do you think we're beneath you?

768
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:34,002
How are you even better than us?
You're richer, but that's it.

769
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,296
Say you're jealous if you are.

770
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,672
Move!

771
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,425
What if we don't want to and won't?

772
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,268
My arm!

773
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,228
He's out to kill us!

774
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,443
Damn it.

775
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,113
What the hell? Turn that off.

776
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,950
Turn it off!

777
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:11,164
Are you kidding me?
Is this your way of lying low?

778
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,714
Dad.

779
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,302
Ji-na, get a grip on yourself.

780
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,888
I'm kicking Sa Gye out.

781
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,603
I know you want to keep The Crown intact.

782
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,232
You're the only one
who can keep the band together.

783
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,026
The victims are refusing to settle,

784
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,279
and the fans are heavily protesting
since this wasn't your first time.

785
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,490
It won't end with only you
taking the blame.

786
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,537
I apologize for the grief I've caused.

787
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,331
To take responsibility for my actions,

788
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,333
I will leave The Crown.

789
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,294
I sincerely apologize
for any distress caused.

790
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,380
Advertisements and concerts.

791
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,424
There are billions of fines to pay.

792
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,177
House, car, building, and shares.
You must sell everything you have.

793
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,013
Except this.

794
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,306
All I need is Paul.

795
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,812
This is all the cash at your disposal.

796
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,480
Make do with that for now.

797
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,151
Why is it so heavy?

798
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,997
No way. You're the best!

799
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,708
You got a place to stay?

800
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,419
I wouldn't mind
putting you up at my place,

801
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,837
but if Mr. Jo finds out…

802
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,339
I'm sorry.

803
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,759
Don't sweat it.

804
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,969
As if I couldn't find a place to stay.

805
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,748
-Isn't that SAGYE?
-Wait, that's SAGYE.

806
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,500
I heard he assaulted someone.

807
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,340
I really have no place to go.

808
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,344
Should I enlist like Mr. Jo said?

809
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,645
Mom!

810
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,897
Of course.

811
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,107
Of course, I'm fine.

812
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,317
Work has been intense,

813
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,319
so I caused trouble to take a break.

814
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,654
Where are you right now?

815
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,699
What? The Grand Canyon?

816
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,203
You're living your dream!

817
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,496
That's so cool.

818
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,917
It's nice to quit working, right?

819
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,377
I was right, weren't I?

820
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,631
Of course not.

821
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,094
Sure. Got it.

822
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,178
Bye.

823
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,520
Walking sometimes puts me in a good mood.

824
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,189
When will I ever have the chance
to walk this freely again?

825
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,028
That leads to the university!

826
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,158
In those moments, I must walk

827
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,161
without thinking,
just following where my feet lead me to.

828
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,057
If I had the money,

829
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,977
I'd use this opportunity to sign him.

830
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,065
Or maybe not.

831
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,860
He's probably loaded already,

832
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,403
so why would he sign with me?

833
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,325
I wonder if he's okay.

834
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,410
He hasn't even been to his classes.

835
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,295
Should the moon be that pretty?

836
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,067
Have I ever lived here?

837
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,820
Why does it look familiar?

838
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,512
Nice. This is where I'll stay.

839
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,730
This isn't as advertised.

840
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,941
Where's the city view,
the multi-level loft, and pool?

841
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:16,154
You have a way of making me a liar.

842
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,823
Like I said, I never wrote any of that.

843
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,200
What will it be? Are you going to stay?

844
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,578
Of course not. This is all a scam!

845
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,538
A scam?

846
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,334
What do you expect to get
for 50 million won anyway?

847
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,877
You're the greedy one.

848
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,004
Unbelievable.
So much for that pretty face.

849
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,173
Auntie. Is someone here to see the room?

850
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,507
He won't be staying.

851
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,052
There's the landlady,
so take it up with her.

852
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,136
Over here.

853
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,521
How…

854
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,818
-Kim Bom?
-Sa Gye?

855
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,493
It hit me the second I saw her.

856
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,536
I was led here…

857
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,914
to meet Bom.

858
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,586
Why did it suddenly stop raining?

859
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,842
I have something to do. Go on ahead.

860
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,716
On the day of the first autumn rain,

861
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,802
a boy and a girl
who meet at the College of Art bench

862
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,470
are destined to fall in love.

863
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,768
Sa Gye.

864
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,899
-Here?
-Yes, that's the one.

865
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,820
These aren't very good seats.

866
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,321
Are you kidding me?

867
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,241
I went to morning prayers
so I could get these seats.

868
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,744
Since you're here, try to have fun.

869
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,329
Who knows? You might become a fan today.

870
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,582
He's not my type at all.

871
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,168
I'm up front, the standing zone.

872
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,419
-Bye. See you later.
-What?

873
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,588
You're leaving me? Bae Gyu-ri!

874
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,517
Freaking awesome

875
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,898
You set my world on fire

876
01:02:56,981 --> 01:03:01,194
My heart's burning up
Because of you

877
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,737
It's flaming, it's burning

878
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,363
Freaking awesome

879
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,786
You set my world on fire

880
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:15,458
So your cold heart will melt too

881
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,877
Fight fire with fire

882
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,464
Our song topped

883
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,842
the World Music Chart!

884
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,137
To celebrate this achievement,
I'll get you a gift.

885
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,472
-A gift?
-What does he mean?

886
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,015
Ta-da.

887
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,851
Bring this to me

888
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,355
and tell me you were here at this concert.

889
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,315
I'll take you out on a date.

890
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,462
Yes.

891
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,464
Roopretelcham.

892
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,425
Freaking awesome

893
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:12,265
You set my world on fire

894
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,977
My heart's burning up
Because of you

895
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,437
It's flaming, it's burning

896
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,564
Freaking awesome

897
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:23,609
You set my world on fire

898
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,986
Is that when it all began?

899
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,905
Is that when our fates

900
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,824
became entwined?

901
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,117
Let's focus on paying off our debt.

902
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,994
The rent will now double.

903
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,537
Double the rent?

904
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,914
I'm in?

905
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,999
Still. How can we let a guy
move in to our floor?

906
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,792
What's that jerk doing here?

907
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,128
They can't be together!

908
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,504
Break them apart.

909
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,716
Get going, then.
I'll be the one to walk Bom home.

910
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,218
Why won't you stand up for yourself
when you were wronged?

911
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,930
Only losers back down without a fight.

912
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,681
Someone told me

913
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,809
that only losers surrender
without putting up a fight.

914
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,480
If I win, you'll answer all my questions.

915
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,566
