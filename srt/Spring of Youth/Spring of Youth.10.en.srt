1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
ALL CHARACTERS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,804
<i>I must stop it.</i>

4
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>It must end here.</i>

5
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>I'm glad</i>

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>it's me and not you.</i>

7
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>Don't</i>

8
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>make Bom sad.</i>

9
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,500
Hey, Seo Tae-yang.

10
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,543
Seo Tae-yang!

11
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,216
- Tae-yang!
- Tae-yang?

12
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,884
- Hey!
- FD!

13
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,261
- What the hell?
- Call an ambulance!

14
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,514
Someone, call an ambulance!

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,973
Someone, call 911.

16
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,519
- Tae-yang!
- FD, call an ambulance. Hurry!

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,062
SAGYE, are you all right?

18
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,819
<i>Seo Tae-yang.</i>

19
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>Seo Tae-yang knew.</i>

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,413
<i>Yet, he chose to help me.</i>

21
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,585
These are Mr. Seo's belongings.

22
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,184
Gye.

23
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,686
What will happen to Tae-yang?

24
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,113
How did it go?

25
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,366
Are you sure you took care of it?

26
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,368
You see…

27
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,162
Don't tell me you failed.

28
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,330
Say it!

29
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,792
The mic had been rigged.
But instead of SAGYE,

30
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,587
Tae-yang…

31
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,465
What did you just say?

32
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,676
What about my Tae-yang?

33
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,888
It seemed as though
he knew what we had planned.

34
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,972
He suddenly jumped in.

35
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,272
<i>No.</i>

36
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>Tae-yang, no.</i>

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,361
Did you tie up the loose ends?

38
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,157
- Were you seen on camera?
- I made sure to stay in blind spots.

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,533
Just in case,

40
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,911
power to the security center
was cut for two minutes.

41
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,413
Right. No cameras were filming
at the time.

42
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,583
So no one saw you switch the mics?

43
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,419
- Probably.
- Don't give me that!

44
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,254
That's how it was supposed to be.

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,090
Lay low for the time being.

46
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,884
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,052
Father!

48
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,392
Father, what do we do? Tae-yang--

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,769
Don't make a fuss.

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,024
Don't tell me this was your doing.

51
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,611
There's no reason for you
to hurt Tae-yang!

52
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,571
I told you not to get worked up.

53
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,822
Ji-na,

54
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,282
listen to me carefully.

55
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,577
I've done everything imaginable
to help Jo & Jo thrive.

56
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
I even let go of my pride long ago.

57
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,666
All for one reason.

58
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,378
I couldn't stand being belittled
for not having money or ties.

59
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,129
Then, why did you do it?

60
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,881
Why?

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,092
If you take one wrong step,

62
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,012
people will also find out that
you stole that song.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,223
I'm sure that's not what you want.

64
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,184
Ji-na.

65
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,186
From this moment on,

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,647
you're going to have to help me,

67
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,774
no matter what it takes.

68
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,865
You know what? I'm heading inside.

69
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,285
Don't.

70
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,869
Wait here.

71
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,624
What if

72
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,252
something bad happens to Tae-yang?

73
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,046
I said horrible things
and was mean to him.

74
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,633
What if he never wakes up?

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,554
That won't happen.

76
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,514
He'll wake up for sure.

77
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
I guarantee that.

78
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,728
I'm sure of it.

79
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,690
Are you here for Seo Tae-yang?

80
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,485
How is he? How's my son?

81
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,737
Is he breathing?

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,988
Tell me he's alive.

83
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,823
Tell me I'm right!

84
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,033
He's not in immediate danger.

85
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,035
Fortunately,
the electric shock wasn't direct,

86
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,578
so he'll be fine.

87
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,129
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

88
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,309
You have no right to be here.

89
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,604
If something happens to him,
it'll all be on you.

90
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,316
Though you tried to keep it buried,

91
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,859
and I never said a word,

92
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,277
Tae-yang knew.

93
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,031
Have you ever thought about
how he would've felt?

94
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,117
How miserable he must've been?

95
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,495
Can you even imagine the pain?

96
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,541
If you don't want
to destroy his will to live,

97
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,294
then leave this hospital right now.

98
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,465
Move!

99
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,766
What was that all about?

100
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,935
How is Tae-yang's accident
Dr. Seo's fault?

101
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,687
You know something, don't you?

102
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,107
This wasn't a random accident.

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,067
Why did Tae-yang jump in front of you?

104
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,152
What are you hiding from me?

105
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,032
Bom, I have to go somewhere urgent.

106
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,493
Where do you think you're going?

107
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,749
I must go before it's too late.

108
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,293
I can't afford to be late again.

109
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,963
I'll explain everything later.

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,674
Sa Gye. Gye!

111
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,599
Detective Min,
I'm sure you heard about the accident.

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,518
It wasn't simply an equipment malfunction.

113
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,895
- Someone had it rigged.
- <i>No way.</i>

114
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,897
Who would do that?

115
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,274
The hit-and-run drivers,

116
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,193
from six years ago.
CEO Jo and Director Seo.

117
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,278
What?

118
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,780
Don't ask me why and trust me on this.

119
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,031
Just humor me.

120
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,451
<i>We must find evidence</i>
<i>at the broadcasting station.</i>

121
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,536
There may not be that much,
but there will be something.

122
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,538
I'll get over there right now.

123
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,710
What kind of nonsense is this?

124
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,588
Who'd be gutsy enough to do that?

125
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,047
And at a TV station of all places?

126
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,509
Still,

127
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,680
there's always someone insane enough
to do it.

128
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,725
Detective Oh, Detective Lee,
get ready to roll out.

129
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,477
We're off to SBC.

130
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,651
Don't even think about running.

131
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,070
Move.

132
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,328
- Let go.
- No way.

133
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,412
Let go of me!

134
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>Gye, I won't let go of this jerk.</i>

135
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,251
NO ENTRY, POLICE LINE
INVESTIGATION IN PROCESS

136
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,589
Detective, this wasn't our fault.

137
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,758
All the equipment is brand new.

138
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,384
The accident makes no sense.

139
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,179
I checked multiple times
before we began filming.

140
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,263
I get it for now.

141
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,557
We'll talk again
after we process the scene.

142
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,351
Sure.

143
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,645
Detective Min!

144
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,105
You came. Thank you.

145
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,357
What have you discovered?

146
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,860
I talked to the producer,
but nothing stands out.

147
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,529
This is odd though.

148
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,864
The power went out for two minutes
during the rehearsal.

149
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,491
The power went out?

150
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,287
That clears things up.

151
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,915
He killed the power
to disable the security cameras.

152
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,792
That's when he swapped in the wired mic.

153
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,336
What makes you so sure of this?

154
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,797
Because I was CEO Jo's intended target.

155
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,967
I'm the sole witness
to the hit-and-run case.

156
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,303
Do you really believe
the two cases are connected?

157
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,807
Absolutely. I can bet everything on it.

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,894
Okay.

159
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,521
Let's get digging then.

160
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,614
Just get lost already.

161
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,324
Why, you…

162
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,909
Get lost.

163
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,202
Get lost!

164
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,206
CEO JO

165
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,795
Mr. Jo, it appears
that Mr. Yun has betrayed you.

166
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,879
Watch your back.

167
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,882
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,233
SAGYE

169
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,987
Gye.

170
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,572
I have Mr. Kang.

171
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,865
Where should I take him?

172
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,992
Gye, wait.

173
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,493
Are you all right?

174
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,454
I heard you almost got hurt.

175
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,081
I feel bad since I got you this gig.

176
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,417
What about the thing
I asked you to look into?

177
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,003
Did Hanju Band really miss the show
because of an accident?

178
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,005
Well, I can't get a hold of them.

179
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,591
They turned off their phones
and fell off the grid.

180
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,052
I knew it was a lie.

181
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,512
That's how they got me on stage.

182
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,184
CEO Jo and Director Seo
planned this together.

183
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,395
Director Seo? Why would he target you?

184
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,939
He hates me as much as CEO Jo does.

185
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,274
Are you sure about this?

186
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,238
I've actually been looking
into Director Seo lately,

187
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,533
and he gets together with CEO Jo
almost every day.

188
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,203
The two of them
have been together all day today.

189
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,164
What did you find on Director Seo?

190
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,671
It's a top-secret piece
we've been putting together.

191
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,215
Dr. Seo changed the operation schedule
with no valid reason,

192
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,258
and a patient died wrongfully as a result.

193
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,220
The floor leader from the ruling party
skipped the line.

194
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,264
They say the presidential office
is involved.

195
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,102
When will that piece hit the air?

196
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,479
I can give you more on Dr. Seo.

197
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,360
The MRI came back clean.

198
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,946
So why isn't he waking up
when his vitals are normal?

199
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,532
Could there be another issue?

200
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,700
That's been puzzling us.

201
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,702
He's not even responding to stimulation.

202
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,622
It's as if the patient
is refusing to wake up.

203
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,292
Could he have experienced
any psychological trauma?

204
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,006
My son is strong.

205
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,092
I know he'll soon wake up.

206
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
<i>I…</i>

207
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,362
have feelings for her.

208
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,579
Would you like to see him?

209
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,709
What? Me?

210
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,547
I feel like my son would want to see you.

211
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,915
I don't think

212
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,501
I've ever held your hand first before.

213
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,462
But why is it so cold?

214
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,173
It was always so warm.

215
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,928
Tae-yang.

216
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,430
Did you really do this to protect Gye?

217
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,768
I'm scared, Tae-yang.

218
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,188
Please.

219
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,066
Can you please wake up?

220
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,527
I'll do whatever you say.

221
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,044
You should head home.

222
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,296
I'll call when he wakes up.

223
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,590
No, thanks.

224
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,926
I'd rather stay.

225
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,261
Just do as I say.

226
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,638
I'm here, and so is the medical staff.

227
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,432
Besides,

228
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,685
you make me uncomfortable.

229
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,148
I understand.

230
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,505
Director Seo, are you all right?

231
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,675
Don't worry too much.

232
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,427
They said he was fine.

233
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,220
He'll wake up soon.

234
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,684
Fortunately, no evidence
was found at the scene.

235
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,228
Mr. Kang executed the task perfectly.

236
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,356
We won't be implicated, so don't worry.

237
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,526
We were blessed.

238
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,280
Who'd suspect you
when Tae-yang was put in the hospital?

239
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,448
Right?

240
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,127
Open your mouth again,

241
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,212
and I might just end you.

242
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,603
Over here.

243
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,521
Where's my son?

244
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,609
Where did he go?

245
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,320
What were you all doing?

246
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,572
Find him. Find my son immediately!

247
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,620
HANJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

248
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,916
Mr. Choi!

249
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,502
Have you seen Tae-yang?

250
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,878
He just left the hospital.

251
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,630
Where did he go?

252
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,923
I'm not sure.

253
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,175
I only saw him buy flowers
and get in a cab.

254
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,426
Flowers?

255
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,973
Take me to Paju right now,

256
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,391
where his mom is.

257
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,435
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

258
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,729
Later.

259
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,400
I couldn't stand him
when he was messing with us.

260
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,986
But now I'd gladly take that over this.

261
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,447
What on earth happened?

262
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,574
Why was there a sudden issue with the mic?

263
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,661
What is it?

264
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,205
Am I the only one in the dark again?

265
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,999
Tell me if you know anything.

266
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,501
What we know for sure is that
this was deliberate.

267
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,378
Right? I knew it.

268
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,464
What kind of sicko
would do something like this?

269
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,882
Who was it?

270
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,176
Would we be sitting here if we knew?

271
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,469
Of course not.

272
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,805
Gosh, this is horrible.

273
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,849
I'm too traumatized to keep at this.

274
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,934
I'm out. Nothing you offer
could convince me to stay.

275
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,644
My job as a website manager?

276
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,896
I'm done with it!

277
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,985
Auntie,

278
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,779
didn't you see someone suspicious
outside the green room?

279
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,948
You were touring the TV station.

280
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
At the TV station,

281
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,579
Mom would've looked the most suspicious.

282
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,165
I didn't see anyone suspicious,

283
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,958
but there was this colossal jerk.

284
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,336
- A colossal jerk?
- You know, the security guard.

285
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,255
He took my camera for using the flash

286
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,965
and deleted all the photos I took today.

287
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,301
He looked menacing, like a thug.

288
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,470
Was he actually a security guard?
Tell us more.

289
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,767
Well, you see…

290
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,977
Gosh, I love Rowoon.

291
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,564
Hello.

292
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,694
Why haven't I come across any celebrities?

293
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,529
I bet they'll come through this door.

294
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,243
These look great.

295
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,331
What the… Who the heck are you?

296
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,416
You can't take photos back here.

297
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,210
I didn't take a lot of photos.

298
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,338
You did just now. I saw the flash go off.

299
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,422
Oh, right.

300
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm the manager of TWO SAGYE,
the band that's playing today.

301
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,928
I was only taking photos of them
to put on our website.

302
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,930
There aren't any photos
of other celebrities.

303
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,474
What now?

304
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,643
Don't they look good?

305
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,271
What the… What are you doing?
Why are you deleting my photos?

306
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,982
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to do this?

307
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,653
Be grateful I didn't take your camera.

308
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,662
As if I'd let you take it.
Who does he think I am?

309
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,956
What the hell? Is he security?

310
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,458
That was a power trip, wasn't it?

311
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,710
You're dead meat. I'm coming after you.

312
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,341
SECURITY CENTER - RESTRICTED
AREA, AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

313
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,265
I took a photo of that prick.

314
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,475
This is him.

315
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,480
- Wait, this guy!
- What is it? Do you recognize him?

316
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,567
He's the Grim Reaper
of Jo & Jo Entertainment.

317
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,027
The annoying assistant
at CEO Jo's beck and call.

318
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,822
At concerts, he shoves fans aside,
saying it's to protect the artists.

319
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,615
I know that face all too well.

320
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,118
Why was the assistant
in the security center?

321
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,703
No wonder it's odd.

322
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,331
Could he have…

323
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,338
Wait. Hold on!
Does this mean I caught the culprit?

324
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,925
My gosh! Call Gye immediately
and tell him I caught the guy.

325
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,302
- I'll do it, Auntie.
- Sure.

326
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,803
No way.

327
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,933
ELECTROCUTION ACCIDENT

"STUNNED"
FANS SHED TEARS OVER SEO TAE-YANG'S INJURY

331
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,648
- Father, what do we do?
- What now?

332
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,568
- The police arrested Mr. Kang.
- What?

333
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,488
No, wait. There's no need to be nervous.

334
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,449
Nothing has happened yet.

335
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,993
There's no proof. No proof…

336
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,247
Wait.

337
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,930
CEO Jo, please come with us
to the police station.

338
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,806
Why? What is the meaning of this?

339
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,476
- Father…
- Ji-na, call my lawyer!

340
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,936
This is against the law!

341
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,771
Dad!

LEE HAE-JIN
DEC 1975 - SEP 2012

343
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,721
If you don't want
to destroy his will to live,

344
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,224
then leave this hospital right now.

345
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,187
No…

346
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,737
No.

347
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,247
No. No!

348
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,498
You brat!

349
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,750
You brat!

350
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,211
What are you doing up there?

351
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,213
It's dangerous. Get down here right away.

352
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,426
Tae-yang.

353
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,888
The day we buried Mom here,

354
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,598
I promised her this.

355
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,185
That I'd never make you sad.

356
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,272
That's why I went to med school
like you wanted

357
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,607
and tried to live by your rules.

358
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,237
But now…

359
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,825
I regret having lived that way.

360
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,703
I should've abandoned you then as well.

361
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,913
Let me explain.

362
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,582
Get down here.

363
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,171
I'm not at all happy to be alive.

364
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,508
I didn't want to wake up.

365
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,762
I'm ashamed to be alive and well.

366
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,639
My own father

367
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,894
is a cruel man
who made the woman I love suffer.

368
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,232
So what do I have to live for
and what dreams am I supposed to have?

369
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,739
I'm too ashamed to keep living my life.

370
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,866
If anything happened to me,

371
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,286
it could've hurt you. So, for your sake--

372
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,621
Enough with the excuses.

373
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,501
I'm done…

374
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,256
being your son.

375
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,968
I want…

376
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,641
to be with Mom.

377
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,226
What?

378
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,646
Tae-yang, wait!

379
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,980
Tae-yang, hold on.

380
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,607
Hold on.

381
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,568
I'm sorry.

382
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,739
What do you need me to do?

383
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,116
Tae-yang, wait.

384
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,119
Tae-yang!

385
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,046
Tae-yang…

386
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,304
Confess to everything
and pay for what you did.

387
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,850
Sincerely ask for Bom's forgiveness.

388
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,019
Then, I promise you this.

389
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,481
Even if you hit rock bottom…

390
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,111
I won't leave your side.

391
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,242
Until the very end…

392
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,496
I'll stand by your side.

393
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,298
All right. Now, come back down.

394
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,441
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE
SAFE COUNTRY

395
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,318
You're here.

396
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,361
Right, and I have the video Auntie filmed.

397
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,487
Let's go.

398
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,948
Bom.

399
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,034
Just a second.

400
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,456
Brace yourself.

401
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,501
I'm ready for anything.

402
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,712
I'm not as fragile as you think.

403
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,934
- You're here.
- Right.

404
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,397
CEO Jo,

405
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,858
I'm sure you know Mr. Kang Seok-hui.

406
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,193
Yes, he's my assistant.

407
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,403
Did he do something wrong?

408
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,157
Mr. Kang sabotaged the mic
at the broadcasting station,

409
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,533
and Seo Tae-yang

410
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,994
was almost badly injured when
he received an electric shock from it.

411
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,581
How does that concern me?

412
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,251
Don't play dumb.

413
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,671
We have proof that your assistant

414
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,382
tried to erase evidence
from the security center.

415
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:17,033
What kind of person
even thinks to do something that cruel?

416
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,619
Did you think the truth would die with me?

417
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,790
What do I even get from killing you?

418
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,874
That way,

419
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,085
your hit-and-run accident would never

420
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,087
come to light.

421
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,966
October 8th, 2019, before dawn,

422
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,719
you fled after causing an accident
at the Mahyeong-dong intersection.

423
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,554
We also confirmed that you received

424
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,265
off-the-books treatment
at Hanju University Hospital.

425
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,727
You seem to have been quite drunk.
I can bring in the doctor who treated you

426
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,770
to give a witness statement.

427
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,738
I'll tell you what happened.

428
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,906
You're right.

429
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,200
I rigged the mic and swapped it in.

430
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,827
It was to harm Sa Gye.

431
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,120
Mr. Kang!

432
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,455
Continue.

433
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,539
On whose orders?

434
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,623
It was…

435
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,463
Sa Gye.

436
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,299
What is this crap?

437
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,177
Gye ordered me to do it.

438
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,138
He wanted to frame CEO Jo
who kicked him out of the band,

439
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,057
and planned the whole thing.

440
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,851
He wanted to be injured but not severely,

441
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,020
and I did as he asked.

442
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,064
That's a lie! I never told him that.

443
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,899
It's the truth.

444
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,197
Sa Gye has been threatening my father
all this time.

445
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,242
He came to our house and threw a tantrum,
demanding to be taken back.

446
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,911
He even smashed my dad's car.

447
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,582
You're still such a cheap shot.

448
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,168
The same goes for Kim Bom right here.

449
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,670
She's been threatening me without basis,

450
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,422
accusing me of copying her song.

451
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,384
The main offenders in this case

452
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,594
are Sa Gye

453
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,097
and Kim Bom.

454
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,229
How could you say that to Bom?

455
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,939
Do you really think those lies will fly?

456
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,235
Whether I'm lying or not, it's up
to the detectives to figure it out.

457
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,986
What's certain is that

458
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,739
you hold a grudge against Jo & Jo.

459
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,534
But you crossed the line this time.

460
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,412
The greatest victim in all of this

461
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,207
is our artist, Seo Tae-yang.

462
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,920
It's all a lie.

463
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,466
I'll confess.

464
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,718
It was me.

465
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,845
I had Mr. Kang

466
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,264
tamper with the mic to hurt Sa Gye.

467
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,640
Are you out of your mind?

468
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,102
No, it's not true.
Director Seo isn't in his right mind.

469
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,146
You must believe me.

470
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,814
Quiet!

471
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,862
All of this happened…

472
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,240
because CEO Jo and I…

473
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,203
killed Kim Bom's mother.

474
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,129
Six years ago,

475
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,922
someone fled the scene

476
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,508
after hitting Kim Bom's mother.

477
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,260
That was me.

478
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,139
What

479
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,933
are you talking about?

480
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,105
- Why would you--
- Seo Min-cheol, shut up!

481
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,110
Not me. I know nothing about this.
I didn't do it!

482
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,945
That night,

483
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,657
Kim Bom's mother was still breathing…

484
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,828
and she held out her hand
asking us for help.

485
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,874
But I didn't take her to the hospital.

486
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,878
I was afraid
I'd get caught for drunk driving.

487
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,173
I was terrified about losing everything.

488
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,382
So,

489
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,718
I abandoned an injured patient,

490
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,387
and fled the scene.

491
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,681
Sa Gye found out.

492
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,100
And to shut him up,

493
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,770
CEO Jo and I came up with an awful plan.

494
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,150
<i>Fortunately,</i>

495
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,195
<i>no evidence was found at the scene.</i>

496
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,572
<i>Mr. Kang executed the task perfectly.</i>

497
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,326
<i>We won't be implicated, so don't worry.</i>

498
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,314
Bring her back.

499
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,069
Bring my mom back.

500
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,446
Do it.

501
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,785
Aren't you a great doctor?

502
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,997
A doctor who saves lives.

503
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,458
You could've saved hers!

504
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,720
I don't need your apology.

505
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,932
Just bring my mom back.

506
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,143
My mom…

507
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,604
You could've saved her!

508
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,356
Bring her back!

509
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,740
Bring my mom back.

510
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,754
Bom.

511
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,549
Bom.

512
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,641
You knew everything.

513
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,020
I couldn't

514
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:21,940
tell you.

515
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,817
I was worried you'd be miserable again.

516
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,902
Who are you

517
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,323
to call the shots on my despair?
Who are you to decide that?

518
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,866
This concerns my mom.

519
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,495
I should've known about this sooner.

520
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,247
Does wearing a clueless smile
mean I'm happy?

521
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,916
What went through your head

522
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,711
when Jo Ji-na stole my song
and Director Seo insulted me?

523
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,297
Why didn't you tell me not to hold back?

524
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,548
At the very least…

525
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,053
I shouldn't have let the people

526
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,223
responsible for my mom's death
walk all over me!

527
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,687
I'm sorry.

528
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,359
I'm sorry.

529
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,618
I don't want to see your face right now.

530
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,918
<i>What I did for Bom</i>

531
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,921
<i>wasn't really for her sake after all.</i>

532
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,174
<i>This had to happen eventually.</i>

533
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,636
<i>But maybe I could've resolved this sooner.</i>

534
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,514
<i>I made the wrong call,</i>

535
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,975
<i>and I owe Bom an apology for it.</i>

536
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,229
<i>It was around 6:30 in the morning.</i>

537
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,857
<i>I was about to head home</i>
<i>after being on call all night.</i>

538
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,694
<i>But Director Seo called me urgently</i>
<i>to the isolation ward in the ER.</i>

539
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,779
<i>When I got there,</i>

540
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,449
<i>I saw him and his friend.</i>

541
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,826
<i>Both of them were completely drunk.</i>

542
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,620
<i>He was bleeding</i>
<i>from a laceration on the forehead,</i>

543
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,456
<i>and I gave him 11 stitches.</i>

544
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,418
<i>He ordered me not to write up the chart,</i>

545
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,754
<i>which led to a heated argument.</i>

546
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,715
<i>That rumor quickly spread</i>
<i>throughout the hospital,</i>

547
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,799
<i>and…</i>

548
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,636
<i>That obviously got me</i>
<i>on Director Seo's bad side.</i>

549
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,139
Seo Min-cheol, that piece of shit.

550
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,767
I can't watch this. Turn it off.

551
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,983
<i>CEO Jo Sang-heon's arrest,</i>

552
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,862
<i>along with the plagiarism scandal</i>
<i>involving The Crown's new hit song,</i>

553
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,407
<i>has led to public criticism</i>
<i>of Jo & Jo's unethical conduct.</i>

554
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,037
<i>Jo & Jo's artists held a press conference</i>
<i>to request contract termination,</i>

555
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,914
<i>while rumors circulate</i>
<i>about the agency being sold…</i>

556
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,208
Today, Director Seo Min-cheol
received his first ruling.

557
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,628
But he made it clear
that he does not intend to appeal.

558
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,505
After his sentence was finalized,

559
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,174
<i>the Korean Medical Association decided</i>
<i>to permanently revoke</i>

560
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,592
<i>Director Seo's medical license.</i>

561
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,639
<i>The door that had once easily opened,</i>

562
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,808
<i>has been shut for days.</i>

563
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,103
<i>As if to say she'd never</i>
<i>open her door again,</i>

564
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,147
<i>Bom slept for days on end.</i>

565
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,566
<i>A month went by.</i>

566
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,651
<i>And then two.</i>

567
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,238
<i>She slumbered like she was in hibernation.</i>

568
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,564
Bom-bom, you're amazing!

569
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,191
How hard did you practice this?
That was incredible.

570
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,359
Really?

571
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,153
Yes, it was beautiful.

572
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,489
You look the happiest
when playing the piano.

573
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,741
That makes me happy too.

574
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,829
I love you, my daughter.

575
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
<i>I will</i>

576
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,975
<i>be gone for a while.</i>

577
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,103
<i>It pains me to see my aunt crying nonstop.</i>

578
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,689
<i>And looking into your eyes</i>
<i>reminds me of my mom,</i>

579
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,524
<i>making it hard to breathe.</i>

580
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,902
<i>I feel like I let my mom down.</i>

581
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,281
<i>I want to forget about everything</i>
<i>and focus on finding what I want to do.</i>

582
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,202
<i>I have to be happy</i>
<i>so that my mom can be happy too.</i>

583
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,498
<i>Take care, Sa Gye.</i>

584
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,092
Bom!

585
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,927
Kim Bom!

586
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,734
<i>Soon after Bom left,</i>

587
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,070
<i>Sa Gye also left without saying a word.</i>

588
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,907
<i>No one has heard from him since then,</i>

589
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,703
<i>not even I, his last remaining fan.</i>

590
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,549
2 YEARS LATER

591
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:30,599
<i>The harsh, never-ending winter</i>
<i>passed twice.</i>

592
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,436
<i>And spring came to find us as always.</i>

593
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,652
Yes, this is Kim Bom.

594
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,433
Excuse me!

595
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,771
How do you even walk that fast?

596
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,774
Me? What is this about?

597
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,234
I bought this on the plane for you.

598
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,611
It's chocolate.

599
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,906
I know things weren't easy on this tour.

600
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,200
You looked after all those sick people.

601
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,370
You'll join us
next time we volunteer, right?

602
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,455
- I'm not sure--
- Please do.

603
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,665
Everyone loves you.

604
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,542
I'll be waiting.

605
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,178
HIT SONGWRITER KIM BOM!
WELCOME BACK!

606
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,433
Welcome home! We missed you!

607
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,522
- We love you, Kim Bom!
- Kim Bom!

608
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,900
- We love you, Kim Bom!
- We love you, Kim Bom!

609
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,027
No way!

610
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,364
My gosh.

611
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,282
How can you be this cold and relentless?

612
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,201
Not once did you come home
in these two years.

613
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,662
You couldn't hold it against me
even if I had sold this house.

614
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,624
I thought you might,
which is why I came back.

615
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,628
Our house is still intact.

616
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,838
You brat.

617
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:29,385
That reminds me.
I made a welcome drink just for you.

618
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,011
It's <i>sikhye</i>.

619
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,805
Try it.

620
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,306
Just look at that rice float.

621
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,183
I've been taking cooking classes lately.

622
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,394
- I'm the best in my class.
- Really?

623
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,439
It has a nice color to it.

624
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,489
What the hell?

625
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,908
- This is insane.
- What's wrong?

626
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,619
It's delicious.
Did you really make this?

627
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,121
Right?

628
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,622
- Haven't I gotten better?
- Yes.

629
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,584
Goodness me. What did I tell you?

630
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,628
They might actually want me
on <i>Culinary Class Wars</i>.

631
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,175
Hold on a second.
I have more. Let me bring all of it.

632
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,138
Now's the time to rinse your mouth.

633
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,227
It's torture now that I'm not used to it.

634
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,647
How can she go from bad to worse?

635
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,566
Tell me about it.
She's making me lose weight.

636
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,901
I'll be all bones at this rate.

637
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,195
Still,

638
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,864
I didn't get homesick in the US,
thanks to the food you sent me.

639
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,948
Thanks.

640
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,159
Those side dishes were so good.

641
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,660
Side dishes? What do you mean?

642
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,079
Come on.
You know I like freshly made kimchi.

643
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,707
So you sent me kimchi and <i>seokbakji</i>
twice a month,

644
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,043
along with stir-fried anchovies
and dried squid.

645
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,213
Seriously? How could I have sent you that
when I have barely enough for myself?

646
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,090
Could you have eaten
what was meant for someone else?

647
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,343
They say we lose judgment
when we're hungry.

648
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,887
Don't fly out for the time being.
They'll want you for theft.

649
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,641
Ta-da!

650
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,185
How's this? Is this enough for you?

651
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,104
Let's drink
until it comes out of our noses.

652
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,982
This is…

653
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,442
for Jin-gu.

654
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,489
- Gyu-ri!
- That's a lot!

655
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,242
And this is for me.

656
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,288
By the way, Bom,

657
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,082
have you heard from Gye?

658
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,546
I haven't heard from him and I'm worried.

659
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,756
He took time off from university ages ago

660
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,842
and was discharged from the military too.
So how could he not reach out to us?

661
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,094
That heartless brat.

662
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,012
- Mom, let Bom get changed first.
- What?

663
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,639
Do you know something?

664
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,933
- I bet you do.
- I really don't.

665
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,518
Really?

666
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,853
That reminds me!

667
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,147
Is what I heard true?
Your song is releasing soon.

668
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,067
Do top artists in the US
actually want to work with you?

669
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,653
Yes, I got lucky.

670
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,614
Girl, how is that luck?

671
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,867
It's because I did a good job raising you.

672
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,621
I can now proudly tell your mom
I did my best.

673
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,748
- My gosh.
- What about school?

674
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,877
I'm dropping out.
That's one of the reasons I came back.

675
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,422
I'm with you on this completely.

676
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,048
Just quit that darn university.

677
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,842
Look at these two.
They spend more on drinks

678
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,052
than they do on tuition. Unbelievable.

679
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,304
All right, then.

680
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,348
Let's bring it in
for the successful songwriter Kim Bom.

681
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,474
Here.

682
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,603
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

683
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,313
VIVALDI

684
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,734
LICENSED HAIRSTYLIST

685
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,281
Sir, how would you like your hair?

686
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,950
Rather than the Paris style,

687
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,161
the Scandinavian style
has been trending lately.

688
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,123
I've been all over Europe
and I know what's hot out there.

689
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,917
Are you sure you can do this?

690
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,419
Look at my hair.

691
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,839
You know the Oscar Awards, right?

692
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,216
Demi Moore wore her hair just like mine.

693
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,427
Why would Demi Moore
copy your hairstyle, Mom?

694
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,304
That's ridiculous.

695
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,848
Just let me cut it the way I want.

696
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,350
Got it.

697
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,854
What the heck is this?

698
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,149
How can I be seen outside with this hair?

699
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,610
You're killing me, Mom!

700
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,781
It's fine. I can blow-dry it out.

701
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,742
Maybe I took too long of a break.
My hands are rusty.

702
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,995
Exactly. Besides, I told you
to pack up the salon.

703
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,665
You've chased all your clients away
with how bad you are.

704
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,959
I doubt this will bring in more.

705
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,171
What can I do when cosmetology
doesn't excite me anymore?

706
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,548
These days,

707
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,259
I've been having a blast
making side dishes.

708
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,560
Look at how much softer
the cabbages are now.

709
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,979
Nice.

710
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,108
Today, we'll make <i>geotjeori</i> and <i>seokbakji</i>.

711
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,818
While I'm at it,

712
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,903
I'll make some side dishes
to share with our neighbors.

713
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,155
That'll promote my food
and help spread the word.

714
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,324
Who comes to a salon to have kimchi?

715
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,826
They come here for haircuts.

716
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,327
And why do you always make so much?

717
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,870
It'll take us ages to make this.

718
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,498
It won't take long.

719
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,999
You know I have fast hands.

720
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,793
Besides, I have you to help.

721
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,629
Get to work!

722
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,427
A client. Someone's finally here
for a haircut after a week!

723
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,595
Welcome!

724
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,973
Isn't this the side dish place?

725
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,266
I heard about your tasty kimchi.

726
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,435
- What?
- It's not a side dish place,

727
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,019
but you're right about the tasty kimchi.

728
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,189
Do you live around here?
I'll make some for you right away,

729
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,649
- so just wait a moment.
- Sure.

730
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,735
Don't you want some stir-fried anchovies
or dried squid as well?

731
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,446
I have the magic touch, you see.

732
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,364
I'd love all of that.

733
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,533
Let me know if you'd like anything.

734
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,617
Sure. Thanks.

735
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,369
Right. Please have a seat.

736
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,455
Got it. This already looks tasty.

737
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,473
Bom will be my only concern.

738
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,557
Just Bom.

739
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,769
What are you up to?

740
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,775
What else?

741
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,655
<i>Bom-bom!</i>

742
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,782
Come on. Get up here already!

743
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,065
Why aren't you bundled up?

744
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,858
<i>Did you dress up for your shift?</i>

745
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,198
My…

746
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,325
Bom-bom.

747
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,448
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Why won't you sue?</i>

748
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,617
I've had it with their dirty tricks.
And you…

749
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,160
Stay out of my sight.

750
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,122
I called you here because
our last memory together was the worst.

751
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,791
<i>I thought this sweetness</i>
<i>would mask that bitterness.</i>

752
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,516
Exactly. So why would we come here
for a date?

753
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,270
We'll be standing in line all day.

754
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,063
Taking photos at popular spots

755
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,107
and enjoying delicious food is Dating 101.

756
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,152
What if the last bagels
go to the people ahead of us?

757
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,488
Bom-bom, come on.
I'm the lucky SAGYE, remember?

758
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,366
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
you get the world's finest…

759
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,951
<i>bagels.</i>

760
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,713
I'm heading to take the bus,

761
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,049
and eating on it is strictly prohibited.

762
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,092
You're only allowed drinks with lids.

763
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,386
What?

764
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,514
A pretty and smart girl taught me that.

765
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,641
It's proper etiquette.

766
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,277
<i>I just saw SAGYE.</i>

767
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,613
<i>SAGYE? Who's SAGYE?</i>

768
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,199
<i>You know, the former member of The Crown.</i>

769
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,045
SAGYE

770
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,755
SAGYE, OFFICIAL FAN SITE

771
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,260
SAGYE, I MISS YOU
SOMEONE SAW SAGYE TODAY!

772
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,929
This is from today.

773
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,391
IT'S THE FIRST UPDATE ON HIM
SINCE HIS MILITARY SERVICE

774
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,017
DIDN'T A CROWNER
GIVE THOSE TO HIM?

775
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,228
DIDN'T THEY SAY HE SEES FANS
AS A WAY TO MAKE MONEY?

776
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,939
HIS FORMER AGENCY
STARTED THAT RUMOR IT'S A LIE!

777
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,650
JO & JO STARTED IT
AFTER KICKING HIM OUT - POOR HIM

778
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,528
I SAW HIM
AT HANJU UNIVERSITY ONCE

779
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,154
HE WAS WEARING SOCKS
FROM A FAN (PHOTO)

780
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,882
To celebrate this achievement,
I'll get you a gift.

781
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,509
Ta-da.

782
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,345
Bring this to me

783
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,849
and tell me you were here at this concert.

784
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,809
I'll take you out on a date.

785
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,936
Catch!

786
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,197
Bom, what are you up to?

787
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,365
Care to join us for a drink?

788
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,451
Sure, I'd love that.

789
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,994
I'm craving spicy sea eel.

790
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,078
That sounds delicious.

791
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,541
Let's go.

792
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,959
- Let's go.
- Come on!

793
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,171
I can't wait.

794
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,422
Hello!

795
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,340
Seo Tae-yang!

796
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,016
Should we go somewhere else?

797
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,980
Don't. I was just about to leave.

798
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,982
Can I have the bill?

799
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,203
Let's go.

800
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,207
Want to see something funny?

801
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,333
You?

802
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,793
Ta-da.

803
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,923
Nice, Tae-yang!

804
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,007
Something like this.

805
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,592
Bom.

806
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,220
Come on over and sit.

807
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,388
Right.

808
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,560
I didn't know he was in Korea.

809
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,479
Why haven't I seen him around though?

810
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,773
I hope he's not drowning himself
in alcohol.

811
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,609
Just a second.

812
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,862
Tae-yang.

813
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,115
Tae-yang!

814
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,835
It's been a while.

815
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,711
Have you been in Korea?

816
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,257
Yes.

817
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,926
What have you been up to?

818
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:21,972
Did you quit music?

819
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,682
I did.

820
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,393
Have you found peace?

821
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,770
Tae-yang.

822
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,689
You can find peace with it now.

823
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,732
It's about time you did.

824
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,401
It wasn't your fault.

825
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,918
My mom came to me in my dream last night.

826
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,757
She wanted me to tell you
that she's grateful.

827
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,968
I'm grateful too, Tae-yang.

828
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,636
For helping me live through tough times.

829
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,974
For never leaving my side.

830
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,977
I mean that.

831
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,314
I wanted to tell you that.

832
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,284
I'll get going.

833
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,039
Take care.

834
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,416
It was nice seeing you.

835
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,753
Will we…

836
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,799
see each other again?

837
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,807
<i>Maybe,</i>

838
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,352
<i>if we meet randomly like today.</i>

839
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,065
I'll be in touch, Tae-yang.

840
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,900
I'll see you around!

841
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,195
I will.

842
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,377
What are you doing?

843
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,131
You startled me.
Don't sneak up on people like that.

844
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,092
My heart nearly stopped.

845
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,010
You're outside my house.

846
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,015
Why are you even here?

847
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,434
Why else would I be here?

848
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,269
To rob you or house-sit?

849
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,106
I heard you were back in Korea,
so I came to see you.

850
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,900
How did you know I was back?

851
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,861
I'm someone who keeps in step
with the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

852
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,946
Of course, I know.

853
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,740
You've been working at an NGO, right?

854
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:46,992
Should you be working with them

855
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,660
when you're not even a doctor yet?

856
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,166
Blood was your trigger.
Have you overcome that trauma?

857
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,168
I heard you were like Superman out there.

858
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,337
Are you stalking me?

859
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,881
What do you want?

860
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,885
I'm known
for never saying things like this.

861
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,887
This will be a one-time thing,

862
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,305
so listen carefully.

863
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,850
Seo Tae-yang, the white lab coat

864
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,227
actually suits you.

865
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,062
You didn't look so bad
with the guitar, either.

866
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,358
Why do you only volunteer
out in the wild like that?

867
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,861
People aren't as interested in you
as you like to think.

868
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,113
Let them gossip if they want to.

869
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,032
It's their breath they're wasting.

870
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:28,867
People

871
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,535
soon forget.

872
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,454
So, stop worrying about what people think,

873
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,080
and go back to school.

874
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,958
Don't be a snob
who lets his talents go to waste.

875
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,626
Not just anyone can get into med school.

876
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,337
Unbelievable.
Get off your high horse, will you?

877
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,257
I hate everything about you,

878
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,675
but that's your worst quality.

879
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,013
Stop looking at me.

880
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,223
Did you miss me that much?

881
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,477
Go if you have nothing more to say.

882
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,438
I was going to,
whether you told me to or not.

883
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,815
I have other places to be, you know.

884
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,318
Anyway, here.

885
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,070
Take it.

886
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,615
What's this?

887
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,575
- A bomb.
- What?

888
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,787
It will explode if you don't open it
within an hour, so don't wait.

889
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,606
<i>Jin-gu.</i>

890
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,150
<i>What are you doing?</i>

891
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,277
<i>Hey, Bom.</i>

892
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,446
<i>What is this?</i>

00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,531
<i>Gyu-ri.</i>

894
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,158
<i>Seo Tae-yang.</i>

895
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,953
<i>On his eyebrows.</i>

896
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,250
<i>- Cheese.</i>

897
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,460
<i>One, two, th--</i>

898
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,717
<i>One, two. That's it.</i>

899
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,970
<i>- All right!</i>
<i>- Who do you think will win?</i>

900
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:15,181
<i>Yes! Seo Tae-yang wins.</i>

901
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,891
<i>Sorry!</i>

902
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,854
- <i>Get over here.</i>
- <i>Take that.</i>

903
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,566
- <i>What the--</i>
- <i>Hey, Tae-yang.</i>

904
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,234
<i>It was me.</i>

905
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,660
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

906
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,545
<i>That's a wrap!</i>

907
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,756
<i>One, two, three!</i>

908
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,676
- TWO SAGYE, forever!
- TWO SAGYE, forever!

909
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,308
TWO SAGYE - KIM BOM,
GONG JIN-GU, BAE GYU-RI, SA GYE

910
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,436
AND SEO TAE-YANG

911
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,065
DEDICATED TO TWO SAGYE'S ETERNAL
STICK-IN-THE-MUD, SEO TAE-YANG

912
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,421
What took you so long?

913
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,882
I came here as soon as you called.

914
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,759
What's going on?
Why do you need a guitarist?

915
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,553
SUNDER must have enteritis,
judging by the diarrhea.

916
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,347
- Oh, no.
- He's getting an IV drip.

917
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,182
So fill in for him for a bit.

918
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,267
But people will recognize me.

919
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,812
Sing behind the curtain
until SUNDER arrives.

920
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,897
Can you do that?

921
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,692
I barely got The Crown back on track.

922
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,153
They'll be goners
if they mess up this show.

923
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,363
Got it.

924
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,990
Yun Entertainment's fate hangs
in the balance,

925
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,325
so I'll do whatever I can.

926
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,297
<i>Let's all have some fun, yeah</i>

927
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,135
<i>You and me, we will become one</i>

928
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:20,056
<i>Together, let's sing it</i>
<i>At the top of our lungs</i>

929
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,393
<i>Raise the level higher</i>

930
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,480
How has he been holding back
when it's clearly his passion?

931
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,487
<i>Today is a special day</i>

932
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,704
<i>Today is a special day</i>

933
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,291
Yes, Dad.

934
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:47,792
I'm ready to head out.

935
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,794
I'll major in management
like you want me to,

936
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,671
so please grant me a wish.

937
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,091
Please meet my girlfriend just once.

938
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,552
I've had feelings for her for three years.

939
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,179
You can do that much, can't you?

940
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,764
Jin-gu, I'm heading out!

941
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,766
To where?

942
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,810
The university. I'm dropping out today.

943
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,395
I won't be gone long.

944
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,479
See you at the office.

945
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,066
GAMJA MARKET

946
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,112
That was great.

947
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,196
Take a breather.

948
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,372
Wait. It's from Game Money.

949
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,084
<i>I can't wait any longer.</i>

950
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,669
<i>Give me my money back right now.</i>

951
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,671
<i>This is clearly a breach of contract.</i>

952
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,965
<i>You went off the grid</i>
<i>when I told you to perform.</i>

953
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,050
<i>I'm done being your fan.</i>

954
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,969
<i>I've been saving up the money.</i>

955
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,846
<i>But how can you ask me</i>
<i>to pay it back right now?</i>

956
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,097
<i>Let me pay in installments.</i>

957
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,265
<i>I'm not negotiating.</i>

958
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,433
<i>If you don't have the money,</i>

959
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,185
<i>bring the guitar to Hanju University.</i>

960
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,687
What the hell?

961
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,439
Where would I get that kind
of money right now?

962
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,402
Paul.

963
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,821
This is wrong.

964
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,409
That'll get you to show up.

965
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,786
Jin-gu.

966
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,378
Why are you dripping with luxury today?

967
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,922
Did you buy new clothes?

968
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,301
This is exactly why
you're stuck in poverty.

969
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,887
For someone that's broke,
you sure are vain.

970
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,597
Return it right this second.

971
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,765
Return it!

972
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,308
I borrowed it. It's not mine.

973
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,018
Is that true?

974
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,603
Who did you borrow it from?

975
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,730
It's high-end.

976
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,402
Have you been working
as an extra these days?

977
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,737
- What?
- An extra for TV and movies.

978
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,657
Who got you the gig?
Can you take me with you?

979
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,451
I have to be on set
to catch the director's eye,

980
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,745
which will then lead to auditions.

981
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:48,913
I want to get into acting.

982
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,790
Take me with you.

983
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,875
Please take me with you.

984
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,419
Extra, my ass.

985
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,878
You're way off.

986
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,338
I got a job.

987
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,548
Don't follow me out.

988
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,134
Jin-gu, wait for me!

989
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,054
Take me with you.

990
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,515
Stop following me.

991
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,934
- Bae Gyu-ri.
- Yes?

992
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,394
Let your senior teach you a lesson.

993
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,562
My senior?

994
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,230
Sure, just take me with you.

995
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,732
Come on.

996
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,943
- Nice. I'm keeping this. No.
- Put that down.

997
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,069
- Put it down.
- There.

998
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,071
- What?
- Sweet, right? Now, take me with you.

999
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,365
Come on, play with me.

1000
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,908
Have some fun with me!

1001
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,636
What do you think you're doing?

1002
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,685
What the…

1003
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,730
Are you out of your mind?

1004
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,817
Why are you dropping out
when you studied hard to get in?

1005
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,068
Won't you regret this?

1006
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,320
WITHDRAWAL FORM
KIM BOM

1007
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,864
I won't. I'm only just beginning.

1008
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,199
Thank you for everything.

1009
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,658
I'll return as a success.

1010
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,912
Once a Hanju-er, always a Hanju-er.

1011
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,288
Wish me luck.

1012
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,372
Sure.

1013
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,786
What were you expecting?

1014
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,705
As if he'd be here.

1015
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,003
<i>That's when</i>

1016
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,340
<i>something extraordinary happened.</i>

1017
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,131
Hi.

1018
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,217
It's been so long.

1019
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,554
Right?

1020
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,600
Have you been well?

1021
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,518
Yes.

1022
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,728
I have…

1023
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,152
Actually,

1024
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:08,946
I've been a mess.

1025
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,827
I was wondering
how I could return this to you.

1026
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,884
I'm sorry it took me this long.

1027
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,015
Take the call.

1028
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,517
I don't have to.

1029
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,189
Take it. I'm gonna get going.

1030
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,857
I said I don't have to take it.

1031
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,442
Just take it. I'm fine--

1032
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,319
I don't have to take it,
so why won't you listen?

1033
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,446
Is this call that important?

1034
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,114
More important than running into you?

1035
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,241
You returned the necklace,
and you're done?

1036
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,911
Are you only sorry
for giving it to me late?

1037
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,955
Your contract was never terminated.

1038
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,998
You're still mine.

1039
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,877
So why did you never call?

1040
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,598
How

1041
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,309
could I have reached out?

1042
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,145
I shouldn't.

1043
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,232
I can't make your life miserable either.

1044
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,234
Who says you would?

1045
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,405
You moron. You said you'd take me
wherever I wanted to go.

1046
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,865
That you'd let me see whatever I wanted.

1047
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,868
We agreed to see
the northern lights together.

1048
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,085
You said this won me a date.

1049
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,837
I could cash it in at any time.

1050
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,132
So, keep your word.

1051
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,427
Why did you even send me food?

1052
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,347
You're the one I waited for.

1053
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,850
Is there nothing left between us now?

1054
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,811
I can finally…

1055
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,442
look into your eyes without feeling sad.

1056
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,737
I don't see my mom anymore.

1057
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,240
I see you.

1058
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:32,381
I missed you.

1059
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,846
I thought about you every day.

1060
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,477
So, I came here every day,
hoping to run into you.

1061
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:52,985
I missed you so much, Gye.

1062
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,158
Promise me this.

1063
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,202
No matter where I am,

1064
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,080
you'll come and find me.

1065
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,304
I promise.

1066
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,655
<i>The spring I had been waiting for</i>

1067
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,782
<i>finally found me.</i>

1068
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,450
<i>Like destiny.</i>

1069
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,744
<i>The Spring of Youth.</i>

1070
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,006
<i>You've given me so much, never forget</i>

1071
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,384
<i>Without you, there's a hole in my heart</i>

1072
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,761
<i>Stuck deeply in my head</i>

1073
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:04,348
<i>I was clumsy at love</i>
<i>I must've been so young back then</i>

1074
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,517
<i>I didn't know you were hurting</i>

1075
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,561
<i>And did whatever I wanted</i>

1076
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,605
<i>I think about you every day</i>

1077
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,068
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

1078
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,491
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

1079
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:30,082
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

1080
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,420
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

1081
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,553
<i>I hear time will do the work</i>

1082
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,640
<i>It'll help me forget about you</i>

1083
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,654
<i>Only until then will I give it my all</i>

1084
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:04,658
<i>I'll hold out, even if it's just for a day</i>

1085
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:26,347
