1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,895
The melody I played for my mom,
the white piano, and the bunny sticker.

4
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,105
That's how you knew about them.

5
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,441
It wasn't just a coincidence.

6
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,493
Don't feel indebted to me.

7
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,246
Don't feel like you owe me anything, Gye.

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,583
I think my mom sent you to me…

9
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,879
so I wouldn't worry.

10
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,966
Thanks.

11
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,638
I don't deserve your kind words.

12
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,974
All I did was receive.

13
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,768
Don't say that.

14
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,895
Looking into your eyes

15
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,899
tells me my mom passed away peacefully.

16
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,529
I was afraid she might have been
in pain and suffering.

17
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
I'm certain…

18
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,704
my mom passed away peacefully.

19
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,961
Her heart must still be beating
somewhere out there.

20
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,465
In another recipient.

21
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,011
I'm finally at ease now.

22
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,722
I feel like myself again.

23
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,475
I can breathe again, Gye.

24
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,944
It's snowing.

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,292
<i>Even in death, I'll never leave your side.</i>

26
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,462
<i>Perhaps as a star, the moon, or the snow.</i>

27
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,964
I might even come back
as those Christmas lights,

28
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>just to keep watch over you.</i>

29
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,932
<i>Mom,</i>

30
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,559
<i>thanks</i>

31
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>for coming to see me like you promised.</i>

32
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,189
<i>Skip the event</i>
<i>if you're not feeling up to it.</i>

33
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,192
<i>I mean that.</i>
<i>Do whatever you're comfortable with.</i>

34
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>Bom, I don't know what I can do</i>
<i>that would help you most.</i>

35
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,118
<i>Do I speak the truth about what happened,</i>

36
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,579
<i>or keep quiet so you can stay happy?</i>

37
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,750
Did you manage to pull yourself together
while on probation?

38
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,753
Yes, sir. I've been waiting
for you to call on me.

39
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,130
If you'll forgive me,

40
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,590
I'll do whatever it takes
to make up for my mistake.

41
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,720
There's something you must look into.

42
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,430
Just say the word.

43
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,359
Check the whereabouts of SAGYE
in October 2019.

44
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,362
Who was in his life,
and what was he doing?

45
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,448
Get me every detail you can,

46
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
no matter how small.

47
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,786
Report back to me
with everything you find on him.

Who would've believed you were
against this at first?

52
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,267
Only a former fangirl
would know what to do.

53
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,436
While we're at it,
let it be the loudest welcome ever.

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,773
Surprise the heck out of him
by showing him we don't care.

55
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
Absolutely!

56
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,071
- What can I do to help?
- I thought you weren't going to come.

57
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,325
As if you keep your every word.
We're allowed to change our minds.

58
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,830
Don't act so high and mighty.

59
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,084
- That's pretty.
- It suits you.

60
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,378
You don't need to do a thing.
Everything's set up.

61
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:25,551
Once Tae-yang gets here, we'll perform
the highlight of our festival piece.

62
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,803
You remember it?

63
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,387
Only a pea-brain would forget.

64
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,767
How did you know
that my brain was the size of a pea?

65
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,063
Where should these go?

66
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
Over there.

67
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,822
- Here?
- No, a little more to the left.

68
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,577
It looks good.

69
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,171
Tae-yang, wait.

70
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,965
Can you talk a bit about the school?

71
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,427
Sure. This is Hanju University
where I am a student.

72
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,179
Isn't the campus beautiful?

73
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,431
- It is.
- It is.

74
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,100
Med students have their classes
in that building.

75
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,229
And this is where my former school band
gathers to practice.

76
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,773
Would you like to see their studio first?

77
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,692
- We'd love that!
- Shall we?

78
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,028
When do you drop your next song?

79
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,864
Were you born this handsome?

- Welcome, Tae-yang!
- Welcome, Tae-yang!

83
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,046
Don't try to escape me.

84
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
Hang on.

85
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,055
Where are you going, Tae-yang?

86
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,433
Have you already forgotten
where our studio was?

87
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,560
Our studio is that way.

88
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,812
Are you seriously trying to embarrass us?

89
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,814
There must be a misunderstanding

90
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,567
because I'm here to visit
Hanju Band today.

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,197
Tae-yang, you're here!

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,491
- We've been waiting for you.
- Seo Tae-yang!

93
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,783
I'd like to introduce

94
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,037
the club I've been
practicing music with for a long time.

95
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,039
It's Hanju Band.

96
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,171
What are you talking about?
You were in TWO SAGYE.

97
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,342
TWO SAGYE? Are you guys still active?

98
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,428
I thought you had disbanded.

99
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,267
The vocalist quit
after losing interest in singing.

100
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,145
That's what I heard.

101
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773
What the heck is he saying?

102
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,820
I'm just here to support
the university's one and only band.

103
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,532
- Nice!
- Seo Tae-yang!

104
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,617
- Absolutely.
- Seo Tae-yang!

105
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,621
Tae-yang has only been
the leader of Hanju Band.

106
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,457
He takes great pride
as the vocalist of a genuine band.

107
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,544
How dare you try to get a piece of him
now that he's a star?

108
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,047
This isn't the place
for a shabby band with no legacy.

109
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,423
Did he come here to screw us over?

110
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,842
Why you…

111
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,599
Can't you see all these cameras?

112
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,270
Tae-yang, shall we?

113
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,905
I see the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

114
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,783
You're just like your father.

115
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,871
- You!
- Seo Tae-yang!

116
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,415
- Hold on.
- Gyu-ri!

117
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,041
- Wait.
- Gyu-ri!

118
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,378
- Not me. I'm not in Hanju Band.
- Seo Tae-yang!

119
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,964
I'm in TWO SAGYE!

120
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,432
I can't believe I still had this on.
That jerk!

121
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,894
He knew our cover went viral
but still asked if we hadn't disbanded.

122
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,814
How can he sound more like a jerk
with every word?

123
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,149
Just forget it.

124
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,526
We can consider it over
between us forever!

125
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,195
We'll say he was never
one of us to begin with.

126
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,822
He pisses me off!

127
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,408
This calls for something spicy.

128
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,952
Jin-gu, how about level five chicken feet?
You can eat it, right?

129
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,580
You eat the feet of chicken? Why?

130
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,916
Why would you eat the feet when
there are so many other things to have?

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,086
You're clueless. Nothing melts away stress
like spicy chicken feet.

132
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,673
Besides, you look like someone
who would eat any kind of feet.

133
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,427
Let's go, Bom.
You look totally out of it too.

134
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,930
Actually, I'm fine.

135
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,059
Go and enjoy the food. We'll stay here.

136
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,770
"We"? Hang on.

137
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,813
You want to be alone, is that it?

138
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,985
Fine. Whatever.
I'll let it slide, being as cool as I am.

139
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,279
Jin-gu, we'll eat by ourselves.

140
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,490
You'd better not regret this.

141
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,325
Wait. I want <i>malatang</i> too.

142
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,119
- Wait…
- Whatever it is, we'll clean our plates!

143
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,752
I'm sorry for pushing this on everyone.

144
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,338
Forget it.
You shouldn't be apologizing anyway.

145
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,632
Say so if this upsets you.

146
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,134
I don't want you to hide it
in front of me as well.

147
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,808
How about we cheer ourselves up a little?

148
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,769
I've kept it a secret to be modest,

149
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,438
but I'm excellent on the keyboard too.

150
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,029
- Are you leaving already?
- When will you be back?

151
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,450
- Tae-yang.
- Will you come back?

152
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,826
- Thanks.
- Come again.

153
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,119
- Bye.
- See you around.

154
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,841
Wait. Hold on.

155
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,677
Your next event is an invitational.
If you miss it, I'm screwed.

156
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,012
I won't be long.

157
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,514
Tae-yang, wait. Hey!

158
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,477
Can't we end this?

159
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,897
Is this why you showed up on campus?

160
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,234
Is publicly humiliating TWO SAGYE
what you wanted to do?

161
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,779
I had to take drastic measures
to get you to leave the band.

162
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,241
Others can criticize me all they want,
as long as I get to be with you.

163
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,702
- What do you mean?
- Bom.

164
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,705
Can't you leave TWO SAGYE?

165
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,582
There are other ways
to achieve your dream.

166
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,417
I'll ask Jo & Jo to create a new label--

167
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,793
I've already started my own label,

168
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,546
and signed Gye as an artist.

169
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,091
- What?
- You might not see it that way,

170
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,219
but I'm already working hard on my dream.

171
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,096
Gradually,
I'll take all the necessary steps.

172
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,058
Why must it be this way?

173
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,979
Do you really want to never perform
on a proper stage because of him?

174
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,981
You're drifting further from your dream.

175
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,983
What if you never achieve it?

176
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,860
I hate it when you get like this.

177
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,445
Why do you keep pushing it?

178
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,449
I'll believe in you and cheer you on,
wherever you are and whatever you do.

179
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,745
But why do you keep disappointing me?

180
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,086
Let's drop this.

181
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,302
Don't go.

182
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,142
I thought I didn't need you,
that I could bear being alone.

183
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,981
But I was wrong.

184
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,151
You've been randomly popping into my head,
driving me crazy.

185
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,657
For me…

186
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,328
it's always been you.

187
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,551
You're a great guy.

188
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,888
But…

189
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,476
I don't feel that way about you.

190
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm going to do right
by Gye and the others…

191
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,194
and delete your number.

192
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,032
This is goodbye.

193
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,133
<i>Bom, you poor thing.</i>

194
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,595
What if she comes looking for me
but can't find me?

195
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,680
Not her eyes.

196
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,599
Tell them not to take her eyes!

197
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,189
MOM

198
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,073
Hello? Bom, where are you?

199
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,240
Tae-yang…

200
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,660
My mom is still not home.

201
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,954
<i>She's not picking up her phone either.</i>

202
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,330
Why are you like this again?

203
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,540
<i>Your mom passed away.</i>

204
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,921
Oh, right.

205
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,966
My mom's in Heaven.

206
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,719
She must be freezing…

207
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,056
Lying on the cold ground alone…

208
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,527
Mom, are you cold?

209
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,946
I'll warm you up soon. Hang tight.

210
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,828
Bom.

211
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
What are you doing here? Snap out of it!

212
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,964
I want to see Mom.

213
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,801
Take me to her.

214
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,309
Doctor,

215
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,396
please help my Bom.

216
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,939
My Bom can't die.

217
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,900
Please save her, doctor.

218
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,464
Hey. Let's head to school.

219
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,799
You have PE today, right?
Do you have your gym clothes?

220
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,096
Why won't you leave me alone?
I said I wasn't going to school.

221
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,931
By the way, I looked for a piano teacher.

222
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,476
You need to take lessons
for college admission prep.

223
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,603
I'll help you with math and Korean
whenever I'm free.

224
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,439
I bet you didn't have breakfast.
I made you sandwiches.

225
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,024
I said I don't want any!

226
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,279
Stop coming by.

227
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,574
I won't play the piano or study.

228
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,534
What good would going to college do?

229
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,087
The sandwiches tasted bad anyway.

230
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,589
I'll try harder tomorrow.

231
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,217
It's cold outside. Bundle up.

232
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,968
I'll be back tomorrow.

233
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,515
Stop coming by.

234
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,643
Don't come back.

235
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,396
<i>Stop pestering me!</i>

236
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>Tae-yang, I appreciated everything.</i>

237
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,616
<i>You helped me get into college,</i>

238
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,369
<i>and through music,</i>
<i>I started dreaming again.</i>

239
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>I'm letting go of your hand now.</i>
<i>You should let go of mine.</i>

240
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,752
<i>Goodbye.</i>

241
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,144
Where did she go all by herself?

242
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,729
Is she having chicken feet without me?

243
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,608
MS. KIM

244
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,905
- Hey, Ms. Kim.
- Hey. I bet it's nice to hear from me.

245
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,408
Not really. What's this about?

246
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,534
<i>Nothing much.</i>

247
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,995
I just thought
I'd buy a kimchi fridge today.

248
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,706
A kimchi fridge? That's out of the blue.

249
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,709
The one at home is too small, too old,

250
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,835
and makes creepy noises.

251
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,839
<i>Even you laughed at it.</i>
<i>So I definitely need a new one.</i>

252
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,841
<i>I was going to have it fixed,</i>

253
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,887
but how can you fix a ten-year-old fridge
when even people are beyond fixing?

254
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,347
I wasn't going to say this,

255
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,143
but it still frustrates me to think
that I tried to fix my gambling husband.

256
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,686
By the way, are you busy?

257
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,938
I was in the middle of something.

258
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,773
So, what is it?

259
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,358
Nothing much.

260
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,612
Can I get an advance on my salary
to buy a new fridge?

261
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>That's all.</i>

262
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,282
- An advance?
- That's right.

263
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,660
Come on. I'm not asking for free money.

264
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,245
<i>Just an advance on my own salary.</i>

265
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,165
Don't tell me you won't approve.

266
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,833
Of course, I'd never say that.

267
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,294
- It's not like you want a new house.
- Right.

268
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,129
<i>- Just a second.</i>
- Sure.

269
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,757
What was your account number again,
Ms. Kim?

270
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,051
<i>Hello?</i>

271
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,177
<i>Hello?</i>

272
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,721
Ms. Kim, I'm in the elevator

273
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,932
and can't… hear…

274
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,395
What was that?

275
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,607
Where am I supposed to get that money
when we don't have any gigs lined up?

276
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,069
MS. KIM

277
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,326
PART-TIME HELL

278
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,204
Of course. There's always a way.

279
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,377
Mr. Jo, I have something.

280
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,544
What is it?

281
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,257
Something unexpected happened
to SAGYE six years ago.

282
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,516
Are you sure you have a bike?

283
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,310
That looks like the kind of bag
you'd carry walking.

284
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,230
Oh, right.
I parked my bike way over there.

285
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,066
I couldn't drive it up here
since the alley was too narrow.

286
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,527
Illegal parking is a big issue these days.

287
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,620
- I'll be back in a flash.
- Sure.

288
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,374
- Boss.
- Yes?

289
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,501
I'm only asking, just in case.

290
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,877
Just in case? About what?

291
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,005
I couldn't get a two-month advance
on my salary, right?

292
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,300
Do you know who I am?

293
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,676
Not really. We just met.

294
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,721
Yet, you still ask for an advance?

295
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,889
TRADITIONAL CHINESE CUISINE
SWIFT DELIVERY, OPEN 24 HOURS

296
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,896
Sure. I may not have a motorcycle,
but I have legs as fast as one.

297
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,774
Let me show you how I won
the celebrity running competition.

298
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,944
Ready, set, go!

299
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,786
UNDER REPAIR

300
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,330
Wait. Which unit was it again?

301
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,748
DELIVERY DELICIOUS

302
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,874
Unit 2502.

303
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,209
The 25th floor?

304
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,219
It's not too bad.
I get to work out while on the job.

305
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,888
How lucky am I?

306
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,514
Let's go!

307
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,055
Who is it?

308
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,642
You ordered Chinese, right?

309
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,729
The elevator was out of order,
so I had to walk up 25 stories.

310
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,023
I'm sure the noodles
haven't gone mushy, though.

311
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,733
That's how fast I am.

312
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,945
I didn't order Chinese.

313
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,783
What? Three bowls of <i>jjajangmyeon</i>
and one large <i>tangsuyuk</i>.

314
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,743
Isn't this Baekjo Apartments?

315
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,328
It isn't.

316
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,205
You're at Baekja Apartments.

317
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,583
If you're going to throw it out,
leave the food and I'll eat it.

318
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,585
If not, get going.

319
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,802
I'll get going, boss.

320
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,847

CEO JO

322
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,984
Hello?

323
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,986
Get your ass down to the office.

324
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,612
What do you want?

325
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,824
You'll know once you get here, you fraud.

326
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,751
What did you want to say?

327
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,295
Shouldn't a witness be able

328
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,923
to see something
in order to actually witness it?

329
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,472
Someone who couldn't see
witnessed a car accident?

330
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,184
How does that make sense?

331
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,478
MEDICAL RECORDS

332
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,358
SA GYE

333
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
You received a corneal transplant

334
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,821
from Kim Bom's mother.

335
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,407
Was it out of guilt you felt for Kim Bom?

336
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,746
Since she helped you,

337
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,832
you wanted to repay her
in any way you could.

338
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,584
Is that why you lied

339
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,046
about being a witness
and blamed innocent people?

340
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,547
You have some nerve.

341
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,722
I know what I saw.

342
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,641
My eyes remember what happened.

343
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,936
What could you have seen
when you were blind in the hospital?

344
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:26,358
Back in October 2019,
you were blind while at Wonjung Hospital.

345
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:30,904
The evidence is clear, but you still had
the police question an innocent person.

346
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,323
Does the world seem like a joke to you?

347
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,533
You two killed Bom's mom.

348
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,037
That's also clear as day.

349
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,039
Snap out of your delusions.

350
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,793
If this evidence goes to the police,
you'll face charges

351
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,378
for making false accusations.

352
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,171
Got it? I won't show leniency.

353
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,256
I won't even settle.

354
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,468
I'll see to it that you're forever
isolated from the rest of the world.

355
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:57,389
Bring it on if you're that confident.
Press charges and hold a press conference.

356
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,266
There's no such thing
as the perfect crime.

357
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,809
The more attention this case gets,

358
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,436
the more evidence will surface.

359
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,107
You're finally coming clean.

360
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,734
You framed us
without any tangible evidence.

361
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,403
Just be honest and admit

362
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,572
that you're scared to death
of what I might do.

363
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,661
I see you went to great lengths
digging up my past,

364
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,955
but that won't change the facts.

365
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,083
Feel free to press charges
for false accusations at any time.

366
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:38,763
- Are you really going to press charges?
- I'll observe him for now.

367
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:43,143
But if he babbles to the police again,
I'll have to play this card.

368
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,566
How did you not know that your artist
had been temporarily blind?

369
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,901
How could I when he actively hid it?

370
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,489
It creeps me out
to think Kim Bom's mother was his donor.

371
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,953
What if he really remembers
what the dead woman saw?

372
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,122
Don't be ridiculous.
This isn't science fiction.

373
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,374
Then how do you explain what he remembers?

374
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,378
We already have the upper hand.
Nothing else matters.

375
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,343
Anyway, Mr. Kang really came through.

376
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,804
It's not easy to obtain
someone's medical records.

377
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,601
Put pressure on Mr. Kang to gain
more leverage over Sa Gye.

378
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,165
Where are you going at this hour?

379
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,085
Geez, you startled me.

380
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,711
- Are you up already?
- Yes.

381
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,755
I signed up
for a gym membership yesterday.

382
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,173
All that pumping of the muscles.

383
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,884
See how tight they are.

384
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,969
My session starts soon, so…

385
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,349
You've got time to hit the gym
but not to send me my money?

386
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,729
Do you know
how humiliated I was yesterday?

387
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,981
I waited until the shop had to close
for the day,

388
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,566
but you ignored all my calls. Why?

389
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,694
Oh, of course. The new fridge.

390
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,533
Ms. Kim, I was swamped yesterday
and completely forgot to mention this.

391
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,201
I put the money into a fund.

392
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,578
It'll take a few days to withdraw it.

393
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,704
All of it?

394
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,456
- You don't even have a few million?
- No.

395
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,251
I panicked after I got robbed
and moved all of it.

396
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,627
When can you get your money?

397
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,338
I'm not exactly sure. It's a foreign fund,
so it could take a while.

398
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,092
Just be patient for now. Besides,
you shouldn't rush to buy appliances.

399
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,470
They say a new model
is coming out next week. Then…

400
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,682
- Darn.
- Goodness. What's with your leg?

401
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,643
By the looks of it,
you need a new trainer.

402
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,645
- I can't switch trainers.
- Why not?

403
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,980
I'll get you your refund.

404
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,483
Why call a meeting
so early in the morning?

405
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,651
There's something to discuss.

406
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,028
The money we were being paid for our gigs.

407
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,655
Don't you think it was excessive?

408
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,366
Who would pay five million won
to an amateur band like us?

409
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,910
That's the cost of doing business
in today's economy.

410
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,622
Come to think of it,
we haven't had any gigs lately.

411
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,999
Maybe we should lower our price.

412
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,295
I think Gye's been paying us
out of his own pocket.

413
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,174
No way.
Why would Gye waste his money on us?

414
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,633
To boost our self-esteem.

415
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,220
He accepted gigs that barely pay
and has been paying us himself.

416
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,222
What if he's broke now that he was robbed?

417
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,767
- He said he got it back.
- I think he's been lying.

418
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,311
Now that you mention it,
he seems troubled these days.

419
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,272
He hasn't been able to sleep,
just tossing and turning all night.

420
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,857
I even caught him talking in his sleep.

421
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,402
Hold on. Are you saying he's broke?

422
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,030
Where did he go then?
I doubt he's working part-time.

423
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,114
Could he be…

424
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,367
going around asking people for money?

425
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,984
There's nothing inside it.

426
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,782
I see you're practicing hard
for the music show.

427
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,243
Why join a band if you're
always going to do your own thing?

428
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,536
Why not debut as a soloist?

429
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,705
Get here earlier starting tomorrow.

430
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,750
By an hour. We'll be practicing
at least ten hours a day.

431
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,837
Hey. I know you've been
the buzz these days,

432
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,130
but you're in no position
to boss us around.

433
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,758
The band's playing together
on the music show next week.

434
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,510
Keep that in mind.

435
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,846
Together?

436
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,932
Also, whatever I earn
will be split evenly among the members.

437
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,018
However,
lip-syncing will no longer be allowed.

438
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,855
The Crown will perform live only.

439
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,566
I'm not asking you to like me.

440
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,069
But since this is business,
let's not get in each other's way.

441
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,793
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

442
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,589
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

443
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,845
SEONGRYONGGAK

444
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,723
I'm back…

445
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,768
Hey, you're back!

446
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,855
Boss, do all of these need
to be delivered?

447
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,107
Who orders this much Chinese
when it's not even Black Day?

448
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,067
Stop yapping and get on with it.

449
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,944
There was a graduation
at a nearby school today.

450
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,781
Seriously, when do I get a break?
I've been working nonstop since 7:00 a.m.

451
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,784
Don't you know this place provides
around-the-clock delivery?

452
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,411
Who said making money was easy?

453
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,289
Stop yapping and get going.
We're already backed up.

454
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,965
Who are you?

455
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,636
That's for me to deliver. What…

456
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,762
Excuse me.

457
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,805
Excuse me!

458
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,519
LEAVE THE GROUP ORDER TO ME!

459
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,854
What?

460
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,820
Is this for me?

461
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,199
How did you know I was hungry?

462
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,701
Are you perhaps a fan?
Why are you helping me out?

463
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,252
Thanks, lady. You're the coolest!

464
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,385
Why does she seem familiar though?

465
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,447
No way.

466
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,241
I'm heading out.

467
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,619
Tangerines!

468
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,413
That's hilarious.

469
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,623
- Seriously?
- That's so funny.

470
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,960
How long will you keep this up?
Tangerines are my favorite.

471
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,753
So what?

472
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,922
You sure have an appetite
for someone who's broke.

473
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,508
I'm never going to give in,
so get going already.

474
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,804
Come on! Don't be petty about food.

475
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,015
That's right, I'm petty. So what?

476
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,891
Now, get going.

477
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,729
That's hilarious.

478
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,369
Stop!

479
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,415
What is this?
Kidnapping someone in broad daylight?

480
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,500
You've got some nerve.

481
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,711
You're dead meat today.

482
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,381
How dare you?

483
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,675
- You criminal.
- Gyu-ri, you're wrong. He's--

484
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,303
He's a loan shark.
I don't care how shady you are.

485
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,513
Who lets a student borrow
from a loan shark?

486
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,057
No, you have it all wrong!

487
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,143
Anyway, I have to be somewhere,
so we'll talk when I get back.

488
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,478
- Let's go.
- Sure.

489
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,772
No, you can't!

490
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,898
No way!

491
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,316
You jerk. Don't…

492
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,276
Get your meat hooks off her!

493
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,361
- Mom!
- Gyu-ri!

494
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,113
Who the hell are you?

495
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,450
Ms. Kim, what are you doing?
Please calm down.

496
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,868
How can I calm down?

497
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,788
Get behind me this instant. Go on.

498
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,165
Who do you think you are?
You're in my territory, mister.

499
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,293
How dare a loan shark
lurk around my house?

500
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,337
- Go! Leave.
- Yes, shoo!

501
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,423
That's one polite loan shark.
Just get lost.

502
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,133
Get back in your car.

503
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,802
- Drive off!
- Exactly.

504
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,886
- That's it.
- Leave!

505
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,721
Don't you dare come back.

506
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,681
Or I'll break your legs!

507
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,684
He's gone, so please cool it.
Nothing happened to me, okay?

508
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,061
Exactly!

509
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,189
Don't you dare lay a finger on Jin-gu!

510
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,816
You've got another thing coming!

511
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,944
Our Jin-gu may be broke,
but that doesn't mean he's easy prey.

512
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,445
I'll make you pay!

513
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,033
<i>She just called me "our" Jin-gu.</i>

514
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,662
<i>Gyu-ri referred to me as "our" Jin-gu.</i>

515
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,497
<i>Gyu-ri said that.</i>

516
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,226
That's all I made in a week?

517
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,568
REPORTER HAN

518
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,322
Hey, Mr. Han. It's Gye.

519
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,783
Do you have any gigs for us?

520
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,368
<i>None, actually.</i>

521
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,788
<i>Because of Jo & Jo,</i>
<i>no one will let you perform even for free.</i>

522
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,625
Right, I got it.

523
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,879
Please reach out
if anyone wants us at an event.

524
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,463
Thanks.

TUITION PAYMENT NOTICE

527
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,025
Is it time to pay my tuition already?

528
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,040
You can't!

529
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,583
What are you even thinking?

530
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,418
Sell off your other half?

531
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,836
Are you nuts?

532
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,006
He's wrong.

533
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,926
Right now, this is the only way
to come up with money.

534
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,010
That's right.

535
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,845
Now's the time to sell it.

536
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,933
No way. Don't do this!

537
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,147
What am I even thinking?

538
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,982
Only think about Bom.

539
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,152
You can't be the reason
she takes time off school.

540
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,617
ITEM FOR SALE

541
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,786

SELLING THE GUITAR

544
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,667
I'LL BUY IT

545
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,834
<i>I'll buy it.</i>

546
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,503
That was fast.

547
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,004
Maybe it's a scam.

548
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,466
<i>I'm afraid the price will be quite steep.</i>
<i>And it's nonnegotiable.</i>

549
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,260
<i>I don't care.</i>

550
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,011
<i>Just name the price.</i>

551
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,473
<i>Let's meet up right away. When and where?</i>

552
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,433
<i>Are you at Hanju University at the moment?</i>

553
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,352
<i>No way. How did you know that?</i>

554
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,063
<i>Well, I'm a fan of yours.</i>

555
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,815
<i>First, text me your account number.</i>

556
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,025
<i>I'd like to receive the item remotely.</i>

557
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,777
<i>No way.</i>

558
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,364
<i>I can't hand my dear friend over</i>
<i>to someone I haven't met.</i>

559
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,033
<i>Meet me at the university's front gate</i>
<i>in one hour.</i>

560
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,623
Where is this person?
Maybe it was a prank?

<i>What the hell?</i>

564
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,632
<i>You made me wait hours out in the cold.</i>

565
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,301
<i>I never agreed to meeting you.</i>

566
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,678
<i>Anyway, I wired the money.</i>

567
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,804
<i>Check your account.</i>

568
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,016
<i>You sent me money</i>
<i>without checking the item?</i>

569
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,600

570
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,727

<i>I don't need the guitar right away.</i>

GAME MONEY

575
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,288
Is this for real?

576
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,041
You're giving me all this money?

577
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,711
But why? Are you a godsend?

578
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,756
<i>I already told you why. I'm a fan.</i>

579
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>Return the favor by continuing to perform.</i>

580
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,763
<i>Just don't forget</i>
<i>that the guitar belongs to me now.</i>

581
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,982
I heard Father was looking for me.

582
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,611
Take me to his office.

583
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,243
How is this even possible?

584
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,122
You can actually buy the fridge now?

585
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,041
The fund must've released
your money early.

586
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,667
It happened that way. Shall we?

587
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,835
Sure. Wait, hold on.

588
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,964
I feel bad saying this at this moment,

589
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,009
but the kimchi fridge I wanted
doesn't speak out to me anymore.

590
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,803
It's way too small.

591
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,763
It's not big enough
to accommodate the family.

592
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,640
You know how much kimchi we have.

593
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,185
Winter kimchi, aged kimchi, <i>dongchimi</i>,
spring onion kimchi, <i>seokbakji</i>, and--

594
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,605
We have that many?
Why was none of it served?

595
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,689
Is that so?

596
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,026
Whatever. Today, feel free
to buy any model you want.

597
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,611
Buy one that's used in restaurants.

598
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,446
I changed my mind.
I don't want to make kimchi.

599
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,073
Because you don't want to make any…

600
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,035
- Wait. You don't want a new one?
- That's right.

601
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,329
I have a job now.
When would I have the time

602
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,289
to make kimchi when I'm so busy?

603
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,582
I wasn't thinking straight,

604
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,752
but a bigger fridge
only means more room for booze.

605
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,337
- Absolutely.
- Right.

606
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,548
Still, I'd like that advance.

607
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,176
I want to pay Bom's tuition this semester.

608
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,555
As her aunt, I should support her
now that I have the money.

609
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,640
Why did you bring me out here then?

610
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,268
Oh, that? Right.

611
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,979
I had something to buy, that's all.

612
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,355
- Buy what?
- What?

613
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,691
- What do you have there?
- What?

614
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,068
Don't! Have you lost your mind?

615
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,736
Be gentle!

616
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,780
Be gentle, will you? My babies!

617
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,241
What are all these?

618
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,287
Why would you go through my bags?
I got them because they were on sale.

619
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,374
As the band's manager,
I should have something proper to wear.

620
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,627
- You chose these over the fridge?
- Of course not.

621
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,379
- And Bom's tuition?
- I'll pay for that.

622
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,214
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

623
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,341
I knew it.

624
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,969
Ms. Kim!

625
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,138
Give me a huge advance on my salary!

626
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,764
I can't believe Ms. Kim.

627
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,272
What are you doing here?

628
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,398
It's nothing.

629
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,362
Haven't you been eating?
Why have you lost so much weight?

630
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,032
I bought extra while grocery shopping.

631
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,116
Forget it.

632
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,534
Then throw them away.

633
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,995
Damn.

634
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,915
You need to eat
to have the energy to hate me.

635
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,042
If not, just accept my money.

636
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,964
Seung-su.

637
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,220
I have a favor to ask.

638
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,722
October 12, 2019.

639
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,350
Can you see if Mr. Jo received
medical treatment?

640
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,310
I confirmed he wasn't at work,

641
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,146
but I was wondering
if he received medical treatment.

642
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,357
That's when the car accident happened.

643
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,818
Sure. I'll look into it.

644
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,820
Strike that. I'll get you an answer.

645
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,905
It won't be easy.

646
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,908
If Mr. Jo had received medical care
at Hanju University Hospital,

647
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,618
there might not be a record of it.

648
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,870
I'll handle it.

649
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,875
Thanks.

650
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,848
We're filming a special episode
for The Crown today.

651
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:40,933
I know.

652
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,061
You insisted that the whole band be
on the show.

653
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,189
Blindly looking out for others
can come back to bite you.

654
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,108
Finish your breakfast.

655
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,907
Father.

656
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,868
Could you…

657
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,997
do something for me?

658
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,332
As in?

659
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,631
I know you dislike Bom…

660
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,510
but please allow Jo & Jo…

661
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,139
to sign her.

662
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,683
Kim Bom?

663
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,104
In return, I'll do whatever you say.

664
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,149
I won't disappoint you in any way,
so please…

665
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,819
Please allow it.

666
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,781
CEO Jo will have to approve
if you put in a good word.

667
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,452
I…

668
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,080
have feelings for her.

669
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:56,425
I thought you had come to your senses,
but your head's still in the clouds.

670
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:01,764
I've been holding on the best I can
just to see you succeed,

671
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,266
so how long will this continue?

672
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:09,188
All you have to do is play your part
eating the meal that's been served.

673
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,272
Is that so hard to do?

674
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,902
Are you too lazy to even roll around
in the palace I built for you?

675
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,070
Why?

676
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,489
Why does it have to be Kim Bom
of all people?

677
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,408
Why won't you give her a chance?

678
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:26,246
Stop saying she's ominous or whatever
and tell me why you really hate her!

679
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,251
Was Sa Gye here that day…

680
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,131
to talk about Bom?

681
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,134
Shoot.

682
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,304
Damn it!

683
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,979
Father.

684
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,941
You're bleeding.

685
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,777
Why would a little blood scare anyone?

686
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,861
What is it?

687
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,697
Is it because of your mom?

688
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,325
Are you still haunted by that day?

689
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,166
Hurry,

690
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,293
and get that treated.

691
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,671
This doesn't even count as an injury.

692
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,091
Whatever it is, it will become nothing

693
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,593
over time.

694
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,430
I know it sounds cruel,

695
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,932
but that's how the world works.

696
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,103
<i>Director Seo was wrong.</i>

697
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:35,149
<i>A wound that doesn't heal properly</i>
<i>will leave a scar.</i>

698
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,111
<i>All accidents leave behind</i>
<i>a trace or a record.</i>

699
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,321
CEO JO

700
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,240
Talk.

701
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,869
What? Sa Gye?

702
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,458
Turn the car around. Floor it to Jo & Jo.

703
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,968
What nonsense did you hear
this time around?

704
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,847
You're right.

705
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,975
I was in the hospital recovering
from an eye injury.

706
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,061
But it turns out
I wasn't the only one there.

707
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,232
Both of you were
at Hanju University Hospital's ER,

708
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,693
being treated for injuries
from a car accident.

709
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,947
When you decided
to look into my medical records,

710
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,450
didn't you think I could check yours too?

711
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,039
You went to great lengths to hide it
and made sure it stayed off the books.

712
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,336
That's why you went
to Hanju University Hospital.

713
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,505
No.

714
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,714
That never happened.

715
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,674
What proof do you have?

716
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,303
I heard from the ER doctor
who was on call that day.

717
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,474
I'm well-connected at the hospital,

718
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,809
especially since I donated a billion won
to the cancer wing.

719
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,938
The doctor on call that day
got into an argument with you

720
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,773
and transferred to a different hospital.

721
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,484
That's how I was able
to easily hear the truth.

722
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,278
This is all because you lived a good life.

723
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,823
There are many doctors
who hold a grudge against you.

724
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,367
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

725
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,660
I just couldn't understand.

726
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,037
As a doctor,
you took an oath to save lives.

727
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,624
How could you have abandoned
a woman injured in a car accident to die?

728
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,377
But today,

729
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,213
I finally got my answer.

730
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,386
You were drunk behind the wheel.

731
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,973
According to the doctor,

732
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,475
it was hard to stitch you up
because you were completely wasted.

733
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,938
I didn't expect both of you
to be such vermin.

734
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,734
After all you've done,
you hoped to be a proud father?

735
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,405
You were shameless enough
to lead a successful life.

736
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,031
Aren't you afraid…

737
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,578
that your child will pay for what you did?

738
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,083
You said we should go to the police.

739
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,127
Sure, let's do that.

740
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,964
- We'll get to the bottom of this.
- SAGYE.

741
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:09,094
Digging up the truth
after all these years won't help anyone.

742
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,013
What are you saying?

743
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,264
Are you out of your mind?

744
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,266
It wasn't me. I did nothing wrong.

745
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,475
I know nothing about this!

746
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,685
We're way past hiding this.

747
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,188
SAGYE.

748
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,818
Would Kim Bom be able to handle the truth?

749
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,238
The agony will be enough
to make her want to die.

750
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,073
Are you good with that?

751
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,743
Is that your way of looking out for her?

752
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,369
Bom…

753
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,122
is strong.

754
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,459
It's up to her
to rise above the hardships.

755
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,671
Besides, she'd hate to see
shameless pricks like you go unpunished.

756
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,219
So don't try to use her as an excuse,
and pay for what you did.

757
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,056
I'll see you at the police station.

758
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,309
SAGYE, wait.

759
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,992
This is what I got
from that doctor on call.

760
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,536
He'd be happy to testify
if it comes to that.

761
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,122
Let me know what else I can do.

762
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,026
I'll cut right to the chase.

763
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,444
What's with you and my dad?

764
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,531
What business did you have with him again?

765
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,617
I know he's inside,
so don't think about lying.

766
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,160
Ask him yourself.

767
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,124
No, I want to hear it from you.

768
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,543
Who are you to harass my father like this?

769
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,794
Who do you think you are?

770
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,715
If you want to do right by Bom,

771
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,426
stay out of my way.

772
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,778
How dare you drag me
into the hole you're in?

773
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,240
You were behind the wheel.
You crashed into that other vehicle.

774
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,033
How does that change anything?

775
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,119
The car was registered in your name,

776
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,414
and you were indeed in the car
at the time.

777
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,958
Why did you fall asleep at the wheel?

778
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,461
Considering how drunk you were,
you should've stayed alert.

779
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,713
Says the one who was fast asleep
next to me.

780
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,633
At least I wanted to take her
to the hospital.

781
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,844
You suggested abandoning her
because she was beyond saving.

782
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,555
You're the one
who killed Kim Bom's mother!

783
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,348
Shut your trap.

784
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,745
Arguing about this
won't help our situation.

785
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,998
If SAGYE goes to the police
and tells them what he knows,

786
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,292
they'll launch an official investigation.

787
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,669
We'll be done for.

788
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,839
This is our last chance
to stop the truth from getting out.

789
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,883
What are you suggesting?

790
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,638
We'll have to silence him.

791
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,516
For good.

792
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,022
<i>Please…</i>

793
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,401
<i>Please tell me it's not true.</i>

794
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,279
<i>Please, just anyone.</i>

795
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,657
<i>Tell me it isn't true.</i>

796
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,461
<i>I see the apple doesn't fall far</i>
<i>from the tree.</i>

797
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,132
<i>You're just like your father.</i>

798
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,884
<i>You're just like your father.</i>

799
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,807
Tae-yang.

800
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,563
Where's your head at? You almost got hit.

801
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,190
You really should get going though.

802
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,151
Tae-yang?

803
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,861
What's wrong?

804
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,905
Is it nerves?

805
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,698
But it's not even a live show.

806
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,826
Hanju Band will be joining
as a special guest,

807
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,203
so you just have to stick to the script.

808
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,749
Tae-yang?

Detective Min, this is Sa Gye.

816
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,248
Could we meet?
I have something to give you.

817
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,877
Right. I'll stop by soon.

819
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,638
- Hey, Mr. Han.
- <i>Hey.</i>

820
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,349
I got you something. Something huge.

821
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,725
Did you book a gig for us?

822
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,311
Not just any gig. You'll be on TV.

823
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,189
<i>TWO SAGYE will make its TV debut.</i>

824
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,650
Really? When?

825
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,568
Actually, it's today.

00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,821
- <i>You're filling in for someone.</i>
- Today?

827
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,782
It's not like you need to practice
to sound good on stage.

828
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,535
You only have to say a few words
and perform a song.

829
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,161
<i>What do you say? You'll do it, right?</i>

830
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,706
This is a blessing in disguise.
You can't pass this up.

831
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,541
Sure. Which show is it?

832
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,135
We're finally going to perform on TV!

833
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,762
How long have we waited for this moment?

834
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,056
Us performing for sweet potatoes
was not too long ago.

835
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,474
We hung in there all right.

836
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,767
We did out best!

837
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,935
We went through so much.

838
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,104
Someone even had to spend
his own money on us.

839
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,481
We should be proud we never gave up.

840
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,358
Gye, this isn't a dream, is it?
It's real, right?

841
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,152
A TV station wants us on a show, right?

842
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,738
Are you that happy?

843
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,198
How can I not be?
Not everyone can be on TV.

844
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,827
I'm proud of you. You managed something
even the agency head couldn't do.

845
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,371
My wish came true.

846
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,165
You should know

847
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,127
we'll be the guest performers
on The Crown's special episode.

848
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,091
- What?
- The Crown's special episode?

849
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,634
Are you saying Seo Tae-yang

850
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,138
booked us as his guest performers?
Did something happen to his head?

851
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:54,309
Hanju Band was set to perform,
but they got into an accident.

852
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,523
We don't have to say yes.
We can call it off.

853
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,030
Good.

854
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,115
I'd rather not do it.

855
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,660
Sure. Let's not do it.

856
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,080
Come on. That's not fair.

857
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:18,208
Tae-yang must feel sorry
for what he did to us.

858
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,544
It's only right to accept an apology.
Don't you agree?

859
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,421
Absolutely.
I got over it after chicken feet.

860
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,714
Did something happen?

861
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,009
Let's swallow our pride and do this.

862
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,844
Come on.

863
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,767
The Crown is performing as a group
for the first time since SAGYE left.

864
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,894
Trust me, the show's going
to get people talking.

865
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,106
Hey!

866
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,149
Are we in a position to be picky?

867
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,362
No.

868
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,158
Sure, let's do it.

869
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,369
Why should I sulk anyway?

870
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,579
An opportunity like this is rare.

871
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,167
Are you sure about this?

872
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,089
I'm sure. I really want to do this.

873
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,051
Here. TWO SAGYE, what are we?

874
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,177
- Rebels!
- Rebels!

875
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,887
TWO SAGYE, what is our motto?

876
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,806
- Persevere and prevail!
- Persevere and prevail!

877
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,142
- TWO SAGYE, forever!
- Forever!

878
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,269
We'll go for drinks after the show.

879
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,353
- Are you in?
- I'm in!

880
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,563
I should shower.

881
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,730
Me too.

882
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,204
What do you think? Don't I look snatched?

883
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:23,541
You won't even be on stage,
so what's with all the fuss?

884
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,419
I better look this good for my first time
at a broadcasting station.

885
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,255
Who knows?
A casting director might notice me.

886
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,760
Sure. Today, do whatever you want.

887
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,554
Let's go, guys. We'll practice on the way.

888
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,309
<i>It's over for SAGYE now.</i>

889
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,906
You're all done.

890
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,580
I don't know what this is about,

891
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,959
but we'll talk after you wrap up the show.

892
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,547
Alone.

893
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,398
ROWOON'S BLUE DAY

894
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,276
I want to know what you think, Tae-yang.

895
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,409
Sorry?

896
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:43,663
Is there someone or a memory
you can't forget that has inspired you?

897
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,627
I…

898
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:53,798
Well…

899
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,261
Right. The bandmates from my college band.

900
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:02,432
As a med school student,
I went through many tough times,

901
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:05,101
but playing in the band kept me going.

902
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,689
Thanks to that,
I got to perform in another band.

903
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,697
That's why we have invited the band here.

904
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,326
The band that genuinely inspired Tae-yang.

905
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,286
Today's surprise guest.

906
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,288
Please welcome TWO SAGYE.

907
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,130
Two, three.

908
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,466
- Hi, we're TWO SAGYE.
- Hi, we're TWO SAGYE.

909
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:52,649
It's an honor to be invited here
as a surprise guest for Tae-yang.

910
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:57,111
We'll be performing the very first song

911
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,657
we sang together as a band with Tae-yang.

912
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,661
It's the one we spent
days and nights perfecting.

913
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,912
Here we go.

914
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,459
Wasn't Hanju Band supposed
to be the surprise guest?

915
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,087
They got into an accident,
so we had to make a switch.

916
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,339
An accident?

917
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:23,763
<i>It can't be.</i>

918
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,185
Someone, call an ambulance!

919
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,146
<i>- Are you sure you took care of it?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

920
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,316
<i>If you take one wrong step,</i>
<i>people will also find out.</i>

921
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,484
<i>No matter what it takes.</i>

922
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,902
<i>This wasn't a random accident.</i>

923
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,820
<i>What if something bad happens?</i>

924
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,447
<i>What if he never wakes up?</i>

925
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,116
<i>But why is it so cold?</i>

926
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,118
<i>It was always so warm.</i>

927
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:10,995
<i>I'm scared.</i>

928
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,998
<i>Can't you please wake up soon?</i>

929
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,082
<i>Please.</i>

930
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:19,253
