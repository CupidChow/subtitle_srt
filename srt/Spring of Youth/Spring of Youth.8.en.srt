1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
ALL CHARACTERS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,719
Seo Tae-yang!

4
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,471
Look over here!

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,057
- He's so good-looking!
- I love you!

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,267
Please, can I shake your hand?

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,979
<i>It felt like a dream.</i>

8
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>I thought I had imagined her</i>
<i>because I missed her so much.</i>

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>But there stood Bom.</i>

10
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,296
He's so handsome!

11
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,432
Do you think you can walk?

12
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,517
Yes.

13
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,310
He's so handsome!

14
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,897
No way.

15
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,527
Tae-yang.

16
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,197
Is something the matter?

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,074
No.

18
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,492
Let's head this way, then.

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,835
That was humiliating.

20
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,295
Seriously, I just had to fall there.

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,050
Bom.

22
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,854
Did you get hurt?

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,234
- Apply these, at least.
- But I'm fine.

24
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,614
Thanks.

25
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,699
Do you…

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,243
need a ride home?

27
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,121
No, I'm good.

28
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,206
Your crew's probably waiting.
You should go.

29
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,375
Do you also hate

30
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,668
that I signed with Jo & Jo?

31
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,342
Who cares what I think?

32
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,969
All that matters is that you're happy.

33
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,221
You're a real celebrity now.

34
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,806
You're not the boy next door anymore.

35
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,976
Is that all?

36
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,061
I wish you the best.

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,396
I'm rooting for you.

38
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>Of course, we don't expect payment.</i>

39
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,079
We'll even set up
our instruments ourselves.

40
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,041
Just let us replace
any performer that ghosts events.

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,627
Thank you!

42
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,379
I'll call you
once we wrap things up, Mr. Han.

43
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,174
By the way!

44
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,343
I'm not sure if I mentioned it,

45
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,846
but I love you deeply, Mr. Han.

46
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,910
We're all set, boss!

47
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,371
TWO SAGYE's official website manager,
Kim Ja-young,

48
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,373
is ready with her camera and your snacks!

49
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,124
- Good job!
- Yes!

50
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,129
But what are all these?
There's barely enough room for us.

51
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,548
I packed some food and snacks.

52
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,217
But it still doesn't seem like enough.

53
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,011
We might as well
just carry around a fridge.

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,515
I know from my days as a fangirl.
Events are all about waiting.

55
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,141
You have to eat to keep your energy up.

56
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,393
- Indeed!
- You're the best, Mom.

57
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,479
Do we really have a gig though?

58
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,356
Why won't you tell us where we're going?

59
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,235
The Christmas concert at SNU!

60
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,823
What? They're letting us perform?

61
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,199
- Yes.
- How does that make sense?

62
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,201
How did you make it happen?

63
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,204
I saw that the lineup was insane.

64
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,623
CNBLUE, N.Flying,
and somehow, we're in it too?

65
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,625
We're in it because it's us.

66
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,669
We're practically legends
on campus these days.

67
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,505
Are you lying?
We're not listed on the website.

68
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,715
- What?
- No way.

69
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,216
Easy, easy. Cool it.

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,176
We were brought in as a surprise guest,

71
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,428
which explains the secrecy.

72
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,554
The moment we show up,

73
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,056
jaws will drop to the floor!

74
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,851
Let's hit that stage and tear it up!

75
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,562
Are they paying us?
Or is this charity on our end?

76
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,063
As if.

77
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,191
I already got paid in full, just in case.

78
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,235
- In advance?
- Ms. Kim.

79
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,945
Gyu-ri, here. And Bom!

80
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,905
- Jin-gu, catch.
- Here!

81
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,532
- No way.
- Is this for real?

82
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,328
So, Bom, quit your part-time jobs
and give the band your all.

83
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,872
Of course!
"Part-time" isn't even in my vocabulary!

84
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,248
I've never heard of it.

85
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,917
I'm impressed, you punk!

86
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,756
Hold on.

87
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,632
When did you decide
to get so casual with me?

88
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,843
What? Aren't we the same age?

89
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,845
Technically, my birthday is earlier.

90
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,180
You.

91
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,599
Get cheeky with me,
and you've got another thing coming.

92
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,350
Got it? You'll pay big time.

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,479
All right, we get it.
Now, take your seats.

94
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,606
Okay, then. Why don't we

95
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,608
hit the road?

96
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,444
BOM-BOM

97
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,363
Come in.

98
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,868
You wanted to see me?

99
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,953
You're here.

100
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,039
You heard you're hosting
Gayo Daejeon tomorrow, right?

101
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,457
Right, yes.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,167
I was checking your wardrobe
for the event.

103
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,629
The stylists sent me a few options,

104
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,258
but I wanted to be the one
to dress my artist.

105
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,384
It's a huge event.

106
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,595
Can't I wear my own clothes?
I'd rather be myself.

107
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,180
No way.

108
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,765
You need to wear H brand.

109
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,851
The announcement hasn't been made yet,

110
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,270
but you'll soon be their ambassador.

111
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,313
The first Asian ambassador, might I add.

112
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,731
Congratulations.

113
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,941
But how?

114
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,901
I'm still a nobody.

115
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,280
The reporters assigned to you
have been posting photos,

116
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,200
and the response has been great.
You sure have the figure for it.

117
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,077
Director Seo also played a major role.

118
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,872
He bought the outfits you wore
that were in stock,

119
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,166
and they sold out in record time.

120
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,710
He backed you on a scale
that reflects his standing.

121
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,005
H brand's head office gave us a call.
They were clearly pleased.

122
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,007
Going forward,

123
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,718
you will be the face
of Jo & Jo Entertainment.

124
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,012
You have what it takes.

125
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,558
Ms. Jo, you have a way
of making someone feel good.

126
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,603
I'm grateful you see me that way.

127
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,522
Why don't you take off that hoodie
and try this on?

128
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,691
Sure.

129
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,658
Which one should I try on?

130
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,953
This one.

131
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,042
Black seems to be your color.

132
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,356
It looks good.
We'll go with that for tomorrow.

133
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,483
With so many reporters
attending the event tomorrow,

134
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,235
you'll want to look your best.

135
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,319
Right.

136
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,324
I have to practice now, so I'll get going.

137
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,682
What happened here?

138
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,059
What are these shoe prints?

139
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,395
Wait. Were we robbed?

140
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,688
Robbed?

141
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,064
Darn it.

142
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,148
Mom!

143
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,775
Let's call the cops first.

144
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,153
He could still be in the house.

145
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,907
Gye's suitcase full of money is upstairs.
His money!

146
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,117
Oh, no!

147
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,373
No one's here.

148
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,876
What is it?

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,211
It's gone.

150
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,547
His suitcase is gone!

151
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,633
- Gone? What do you mean it's gone?
- What else? It was stolen.

152
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,094
Who was it? Who knew he had money up here?

153
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,554
You obviously knew.

154
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,889
Do you have any idea
how much money was in there?

155
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,891
There were wads of 50,000-won bills.

156
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,643
Poor Gye.

157
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,853
How do you know that?

158
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,606
How else?
I opened the suitcase and looked inside.

159
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,608
- Why?
- Well…

160
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,280
What is this?
You can't seriously be suspecting me.

161
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,073
Me, the upright Kim Ja-young?

162
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,700
Gyu-ri, I'm your mom.

163
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,201
What does that have to do with anything?

164
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,412
Now that I think about it,

165
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,332
weren't you the last one
to leave the house?

166
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,293
You went back in to use the bathroom,

167
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,170
and then again to get instant coffee.

168
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,963
You also went in to get us jelly.

169
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,675
Didn't you go back and forth
to and from the house six times in total?

170
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,428
All while the rest were in the van.

171
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,554
It was you!

172
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,933
What the hell are you saying?

173
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,935
I was just getting more snacks

174
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,105
which you so kindly
stuffed your face with.

175
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,482
Of course!

176
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,069
I wonder who had the easiest access
to the suitcase.

177
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,989
Since Gye's your roommate,
you knew exactly when to take the money.

178
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,408
Usually, it's the guilty one
who points fingers at others.

179
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,370
It's him. You stole it, didn't you?
Gong Jin-gu, you.

180
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,996
Why would I steal it?

181
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,499
It's no surprise.
You're broke and turning to loan sharks.

182
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,793
It wasn't me. And who says I'm broke?

183
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,004
Mooching off Gye doesn't mean I'm broke.

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,215
- No!
- What is it?

185
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,009
Look.

186
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,803
I have money.

187
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,514
See? There's your proof.

188
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,307
When did you put the money in your wallet?

189
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,601
This is mine.

190
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,311
How can we tell? Prove that it's yours.

191
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,855
What do you mean?
I've always had this money.

192
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,982
It's probably the money from the suitcase.

193
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,569
I know who's responsible.

194
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,737
It wasn't Jin-gu or Ms. Kim.

195
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,281
- Of course!
- I knew you'd see I was innocent.

196
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,283
I set a trap to catch the thief.

197
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,499
- What's that?
- What is that?

198
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,795
- A hidden camera?
- I knew someone would steal it.

199
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,296
If I threw money around,

200
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,425
I figured Mr. Jo
would have someone steal it.

201
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,301
I'm sure this caught the thief.

202
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,138
This can prove Mr. Jo's new crime.

203
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,722
- Go on, then.
- Let's see it.

204
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,890
- Do you see the thief?
- Well?

205
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,195
I need to step out for a bit.

206
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,074
Where are you going?
At least tell us who stole it!

207
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,715
How dare you accuse me?

208
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,050
You messed with the wrong person.

209
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,510
Guys…

210
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,184
Ms. Kim, please! I'm sorry!

211
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,487
Gye.

212
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,865
When did you get here?

213
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,541
What did he offer?

214
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,960
A new apartment unit?

215
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,088
Half of Jo & Jo?

216
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,258
Is that why you betrayed me?
For the money?

217
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,430
Makes sense.
After all, who doesn't like money?

218
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,724
But how could you of all people do this?

219
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,100
You of all people

220
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,645
shouldn't betray me.

221
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,774
If you had the slightest bit
of conscience…

222
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,819
you'd never have done this.

223
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,871
When I lost my vision,

224
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,208
my mom said we shouldn't tell you.

225
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,418
It would've crushed you,

226
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,838
so we agreed to take it to the grave.
Because we cared about you.

227
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,967
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,593
You betrayed my mom,

229
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,346
even though she truly cared about you.

230
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,973
You prick!

231
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,564
Ms. Mok, how's Gye?

232
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,690
Can he…

233
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>see?</i>

234
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,819
Well…

235
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,283
Of course. I'm fine, Seung-su.

236
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,450
Really?

237
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,245
What a relief.

238
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,289
<i>Do you have any idea how worried I was?</i>

239
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,999
You're in the US, right?

240
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,834
Go about your job, guilt-free.

241
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,377
You know how lucky I am.

242
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,214
I'll visit you in the hospital
as soon as I get back.

243
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,592
No, don't. I'll soon be discharged anyway.

244
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,010
And once I'm discharged,

245
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,305
my mom and I are going on vacation.

246
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,514
What about the audition?

247
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,309
You practiced your butt for it.

248
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>I don't think I'm ready.</i>

249
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,565
Anyway, don't worry about me,
and work hard. Got it?

250
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,358
<i>I'll call you</i>
<i>when I get back from my trip.</i>

251
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,196
You're not even worth it.

252
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,116
When my website was hacked,

253
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,576
I suspected you.

254
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,705
You were the only person
who had my login details.

255
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,333
While setting up
the hidden camera in my room…

256
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,503
I hated myself for suspecting you.

257
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,423
My mom adored you.

258
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,469
I owe it to my mom…

259
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,264
to never see your face again.

260
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,126
Gye isn't back yet?
Is he still not picking up?

261
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,752
No.

262
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,673
Anyway, what's with these flowers?

263
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,258
Gye bought them yesterday.

264
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,386
He dug up the flower garden
to make room for those.

265
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,431
He can be so weird.
Who plants flowers in this cold?

266
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,642
- They were my mom's favorite.
- What?

267
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
It's nothing.

268
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,105
It's cold out here, hurry inside.

269
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,773
Gye can be super persistent

270
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,817
and won't come home
until he catches the thief.

271
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,985
Gosh, it's cold.

272
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,050
And those flowers?

273
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,238
THE LATE YU JEONG-AE

274
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,966
- You owned a white one, didn't you?
- How did you know that?

275
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,885
So did you have one?
With the bunny sticker on it.

276
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,512
<i>I'm going to visit my mom tomorrow.</i>

277
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,889
Would you come with me?

278
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,849
- Your mom?
- Yes.

279
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,227
Sure. Of course.

280
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,271
Tae-yang. Do you know where Gye is?

281
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,565
Gyu-ri, have you seen Gye?

282
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>Does Gye know my mom?</i>

283
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,157
<i>No way.</i>

284
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,326
<i>He would've already said something.</i>

285
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,412
<i>Then why was he visiting her by himself?</i>

286
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,041
<i>What's this strange feeling?</i>

287
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,211
<i>What is Gye hiding?</i>

288
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,923
What took you so long?

289
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,841
Did you catch that darn thief?

290
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,844
Where's the money? Did he hide it already?

291
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,055
Was he from Jo & Jo? Did he confess?

292
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,474
No.

293
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,558
I was mistaken.

294
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,102
What do you mean?
Who was caught on camera?

295
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,230
I didn't recognize him.

296
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,606
What do you mean?

297
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,192
You said CEO Jo was behind it.
Were you mistaken?

298
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,487
I have the worst hunches
for someone as smart as I am.

299
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,697
I got the money back though,
so don't worry too much.

300
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,367
Anyway, I should wash up.

301
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,119
Hold it. Are you sure
you got all the money back?

302
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,329
Was none of it spent?

303
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,665
Did you hand that punk over to the police?

304
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,041
That's what I said.

305
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,293
So don't worry about it and sleep tight.

306
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,094
You were up?

307
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,887
Where were you?

308
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,847
You weren't taking our calls.

309
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,975
I had a thief to catch.

310
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,395
I feel good. It served as a workout.

311
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,801
Are you done revising
the Seo Tae-yang articles?

312
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,054
We sent back the revised versions.
The articles will be posted soon.

313
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,266
Hold it off for a moment.
I want to go over them myself.

314
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,560
But we even checked for typos.

315
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,728
What is this about?

316
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,313
Something was left out.

317
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,356
Send me the original
and the revised versions.

318
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,119
I'm sorry, but could you hold off
on uploading the articles?

319
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,538
- I'm sorry.
- I'm terribly sorry.

Please help me.

327

SEUNG-SU

328
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,654
Gye.

329
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,988
Why are you here?

330
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,157
I said I never wanted
to see your face again.

331
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
This is for you.

332
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,453
Take all of my savings.

333
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,872
It'll be around what was in the suitcase.

334
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,750
Does giving this to me ease your guilt?

335
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,795
Does what you did magically get erased?

336
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,089
If so, I won't take it.

337
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,758
Keep the money you love so much
and live with the guilt.

338
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,468
I don't plan on forgiving you.

339
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,263
Who are you to forgive me or not?

340
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,806
I never asked for your forgiveness.

341
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,143
Why do you keep trying
to understand others like a naive fool?

342
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,188
Stop pretending to be nice.

343
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,816
Why lie about going blind?

344
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,943
I never asked you to!

345
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,404
If you had told me back then,

346
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,323
I wouldn't have pulled
this douchebag move.

347
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,076
Why did you let me become a scumbag?

348
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,870
Because I didn't want to blame you.

349
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,247
How was that wrong?

350
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,583
Actually, it was wrong of you.

351
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,917
Why would you put me first?

352
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,795
It's because you're so soft

353
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,882
that Mr. Jo and I were able
to take advantage of you.

354
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,258
Put yourself first instead.

355
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,887
Tell Mr. Jo this.

356
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,806
Taking that money was a huge mistake.

357
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,976
I'll make him pay for it many times over.

358
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,440
The SUV you asked about.

359
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,152
I know whose it was.

360
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,989
It was Director Seo's.

361
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,158
What?

362
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,953
Wonil News featured its interview
with Director Seo today.

363
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,706
The SUV in the article
is the one you've been looking for.

364
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,959
I saw Secretary Kang's wife
driving it around.

365
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,794
From the way Mr. Jo tried to bury it,

366
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,671
it must be the one.

367
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,508
How much of what you're saying
can I believe?

368
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,260
That's right.

369
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,138
You shouldn't believe me too easily.

370
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,433
Always doubt what others tell you.

371
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,729
And don't cheekily go around saying
you'll forgive someone like me.

372
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,876
THREE GENERATIONS OF DOCTORS,
DIRECTOR SEO MIN-CHEOL

373
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,147
<i>If the SUV belonged to Director Seo,</i>

374
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,608
<i>what does that mean?</i>

375
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,486
<i>Was Director Seo</i>

376
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,531
<i>also there when the accident occurred?</i>

377
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,835
<i>Why did it have to be Director Seo?</i>

378
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,628
<i>Why Tae-yang's dad of all people?</i>

379
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,547
<i>This will crush Bom!</i>

380
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,887
<i>Why can't I be the one you love?</i>

381
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,310
<i>Why can't I be the one you love?</i>

382
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,399
What do you have lined up today?
Will you be home late?

383
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,652
I'm waiting for my manager to drive me.

384
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,988
- Sure.
- I heard from Ms. Jo

385
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,449
that you went out of your way
to make me a brand ambassador.

386
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,367
Thank you.

387
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,454
But let this be the last time.

388
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,789
I see Ms. Jo told you something
she shouldn't have.

389
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,375
It was only an investment.

390
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,503
You gave up being a doctor for this.

391
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,255
So, go all in.

392
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,300
Will you be late again today?

393
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,510
You've been quite busy these days.

394
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,554
Is something up at the hospital?

395
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,515
Not really. I just have a lot
of year-end gatherings.

396
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,154
Director Seo,
you know who I am, don't you?

397
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,199
- What is this?
- I'd like some of your time.

398
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,701
This concerns something very important.

399
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,370
I'm on my way to work.

400
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,246
Make an appointment if you want to talk.

401
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,212
I once saw you and Kim Bom

402
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,588
having a conversation.

403
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,048
For someone so highly educated,

404
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,550
you said the cruelest things
to someone half your age.

405
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,219
At that moment,

406
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,014
I realized you were not the man
you appeared to be.

407
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,225
What are you getting at?

408
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,227
But I realized I was wrong.

409
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,270
You are exactly the man you appear to be.

410
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,273
You can't hide
the vicious monster you are.

411
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,400
Sorry, I missed that.

412
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,529
See a doctor if you're sick,

413
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,948
rather than playing word games
with a busy man.

414
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,326
Wonil News published an article today
praising you for your remarkable work.

415
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,869
I'm sure you read it.

416
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,748
You likely had them include that old photo
to highlight your father-son bond.

417
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,419
But, you see,

418
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,046
that was a huge mistake.

419
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,260
The SUV in that photo
is the one from that night

420
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,887
from six years ago,

421
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,514
when you killed someone…

422
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,903
What…

423
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,739
nonsense is this?

424
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,991
You come and accuse me--

425
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,452
I saw this SUV that night.

426
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,288
You and CEO Jo hit another vehicle

427
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,582
and fled the scene.

428
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,959
Says who?

429
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,628
Kim Bom? Did she say I killed her mom?

430
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,298
I never said

431
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,925
that Bom's mom was the victim.

432
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,763
I still had my doubts,

433
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,056
but everything was true.

434
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,311
How can a doctor at a university hospital,
respected by the whole nation,

435
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,397
abandon a dying person?

436
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,860
And you call yourself
the nation's leading doctor!

437
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,238
The least you could've done
was take her to a hospital.

438
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,158
Stop this nonsense and get lost.

439
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,660
Do I need to call the cops?

440
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,746
Go ahead and call them right away.

441
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,916
We'll discuss in detail
what happened that night.

442
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,627
You're out of your mind. Move!

443
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,755
- Don't try to escape me.
- Take your hand off him!

444
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,387
I told you to let go.

445
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,472
Stay out of this.

446
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,475
- This doesn't concern you.
- What?

447
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,893
That's enough.

448
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,812
He's not worth your time.

449
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,107
Tell me what this is about.

450
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,151
What beef do you have against my dad?

451
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,904
- Tell me!
- If I do, you'll regret it.

452
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,489
Cut the sarcasm and tell me.

453
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,161
Can I say the truth in front of your son?

454
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,956
If you're innocent,
perhaps you can answer me.

455
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,792
Don't pay attention
to what this nutcase is saying.

456
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,545
He's being petty
because you took his place.

457
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,505
As if I can't handle a kid like him
on my own.

458
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,423
Just stay focused and go about your day.

459
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,801
Think about what you can do
to put this punk in his place.

460
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,927
Get going.

461
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,763
There's your manager. Get going now.

462
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,517
Why do you need to put up with this?

463
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,435
I won't let him be disrespectful
towards you.

464
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,272
I've got it under control, so go.

465
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,995
Even someone like you
has something to fear.

466
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,914
Thank you for letting me know
that your son

467
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,250
can be used as leverage.

468
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,629
If you tell my son any of this nonsense,

469
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,797
I'll end you.

470
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,216
If you hurt Bom in any way,

471
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,552
I'll take action.

472
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,430
I see that you don't intend to confess,

473
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,265
so I'll see you at the police station.

474
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,184
You'd better brace yourself.

475
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,158
Tae-yang.

476
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,165
Is something up?

477
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,794
No, everything's fine.

478
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,297
Are you sure?
I hope nothing's troubling you.

479
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,674
There shouldn't be any secrets between us.

480
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,010
That reminds me. CEO Jo is asking for you.

481
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,512
People have been eating up
your TV performance.

482
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,640
They're raving about your singing.

483
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,018
You're being invited
to one show after another,

484
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,063
including year-end events,
international talk shows,

485
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,940
fan meet-and-greets, and ad campaigns.

486
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,733
Hard to decide
which one we should do first.

487
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,694
They're more interested in you
than in the group itself.

488
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,657
Even the fans who were hesitant
about a new member have come around.

489
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,910
What can they say now that
you've proven yourself as a singer?

490
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:38,581
After hosting Gayo Daejeon today,
you'll gain even more popularity.

491
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,417
Ms. Jo, increase media coverage
and send out viral advertisements.

492
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,710
Got it, sir.

493
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,215
Only good things are being said
about Director Seo's recent article.

494
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,592
In this industry,
even your wealth can put you ahead.

495
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,387
Be grateful for having
a well-respected father.

496
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,974
We even got a call from Hanju University.

497
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,476
- They want you to visit your school.
- Hanju University?

498
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,562
The college newspaper requested
an interview, but don't worry about it.

499
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,232
I'll organize a schedule,
starting with ad campaigns.

500
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,485
It'll take him months to get through
the fan meet-and-greets and ad campaigns.

501
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,614
What if I visited Hanju University first?

502
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,533
But that's not a priority.

503
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,410
Afterwards, when you have the time--

504
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm on leave, but still a student there.

505
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,415
Visiting the lecture halls
and practice studio with my juniors

506
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,291
will make for a great PR.

507
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,794
Why the practice studio?

508
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,379
Please allow this, Mr. Jo.

509
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,841
Sure, if that's what you want.

510
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,925
Get it arranged.

511
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,558
Today, we're having hairtail
for breakfast!

512
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,603
No way.

513
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,272
I bet it's from Jeju.

514
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,404
There isn't any for you.

515
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,115
Go all the way to Senegal if you want any.

516
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,200
Seriously. What's your problem?

517
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,869
Is it because of the lost money?

518
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,329
You and your grudges!

519
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,125
That's right.
I can definitely hold a grudge. So what?

520
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:09,088
Could you please remove his face
from the table?

521
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,133
Auntie, stop it. Don't be mean over food.

522
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,385
So mean.

523
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,137
You say that as if you're never petty.

524
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,597
Being petty is fine for you Zoomers,

525
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,265
but when I do it, I'm a Boomer?

526
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,767
Unbelievable.

527
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,982
<i>This beautiful hairtail</i>

528
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,503
That came alive in my mouth.

529
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,213
It's delicious!

530
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,840
Goodness. By the way, where's Gye?

531
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,675
I grilled high-quality hairtail

532
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,178
to give our boss an energy boost.

533
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,931
Gye's not home.
He went out early this morning.

534
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,850
He went out? Already?

535
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,603
I can't believe he missed
a breakfast like this.

536
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,438
Did he go out to book us another gig?

537
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,066
Don't worry.

538
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,652
I'll thoroughly enjoy this
on his behalf as well.

539
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,074
I won't let my hard work go to waste.

540
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,786
Why should I make breakfast

541
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:26,290
for someone who accused me of stealing?

542
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,584
Get lost.

543
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,470
Eat up, girls.

544
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,555
You're impossible.

545
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,516
A broke person
shouldn't have to starve too.

546
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,059
That's just cruel.

547
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,438
Eat up.

548
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,531
I'm hungry.

549
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,494
I bet that hairtail is delicious.

550
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,126
Jin-gu, get up.

551
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,544
I got you some hairtail.

552
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,504
Really? How?

553
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,174
I stashed some of it
while she wasn't looking.

554
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,259
I was so worried that I would get caught.

555
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,385
No way.

556
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,638
- I'm too touched to eat this.
- Dig in.

557
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,061
Still,
eating someone's leftovers is a bit…

558
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,314
You haven't starved enough.

559
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,733
I skipped eating
so I could get you some of this.

560
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,443
Forget it, then.

561
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,652
I was only joking.

562
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,487
Join me. You said you didn't eat.

563
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,281
I ate with that spoon.

564
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,490
Who cares?

565
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,411
- Here. You first.
- What?

566
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,502
I'm good, so eat up already.

567
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,962
Mom will kill me if she finds out.

568
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,135
Did you…

569
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,472
risk your life to get me this hairtail?

570
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,848
Because I was hungry?

571
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,994
Seriously? Haven't you heard of knocking?

572
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,622
Why are you so jumpy?
Didn't you hear me knock?

573
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,083
Gyu-ri brought me hairtail and… Wait, no!

574
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,877
She needed to borrow a hair tie.
Where did I put mine?

575
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,462
Let's see. A hair tie…

576
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,550
Jin-gu, do you know where Gye went?

577
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,594
Gye? He was already gone
by the time I woke up.

578
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,181
He couldn't sleep all night,
as if he were worried about something.

579
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,808
- Really?
- Yes.

580
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,230
- Enjoy the hairtail, then.
- Sure.

581
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,737
- Did she tell us to eat the hairtail?
- She did.

582
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,449
- Let's eat the hairtail, then.
- Got it.

583
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,635
Why would he butt in?

584
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,347
I can't believe that dumbass
actually defended his dad.

585
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,810
Why am I even letting that moron
bother me?

586
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,687
Bom will be my only concern.

587
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,771
Just Bom.

588
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,651
What are you up to?

589
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,743
What else? I'm planting flowers.

590
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,619
As someone who values life,

591
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,580
gardening is my hobby.

592
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,499
How can you say you value life

593
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,877
when you're planting flowers in winter?

594
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,379
Who says flowers can't bloom in winter?

595
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,757
These can withstand the harsh cold.

596
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,051
Or so the florist told me.

597
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,847
Where were you this morning?

598
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,641
You're hiding something from me.

599
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,685
Tell me.

600
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,978
Is something up?

601
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,732
What would I be hiding? Just get to class.

602
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,443
I'm busy today, so I'm skipping mine.

603
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,662
<i>No one was at the scene,</i>

604
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,415
<i>so what could he have possibly seen?</i>

605
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,835
<i>The car was scrapped, and the victim died.</i>

606
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,923
<i>That's right. He has no proof.</i>

607
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,592
Director,

608
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,261
Kim Bok-rye's case
took a complicated turn.

609
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,471
What now?

610
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,473
The hospital didn't issue
an official statement.

611
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,017
Word spread that her surgery
was postponed that day,

612
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,562
and an SBN current affairs reporter
is determined to publish a story.

613
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,481
Let them write if they wish,

614
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,858
but make sure they're aware
of slander charges.

615
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,027
However,

616
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,072
a tribute show honoring the late Ms. Kim
is in the works.

617
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,450
If we're not careful, we could
end up under police investigation.

618
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,994
A police investigation, my ass.

619
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,830
Look.

620
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,498
The president called in a favor,

621
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,458
and I saved the life of a floor leader.

622
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,628
How am I responsible
when she was simply old and frail?

623
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,506
All I did was save the life
of someone who was worthy.

624
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,842
Not all lives have equal value.

625
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,053
Sir, that comment seems uncalled for.

626
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,473
Please don't say that
to any of the reporters.

627
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,437
Anyway, the hospital
won't release an official statement.

628
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,689
I'm sure Mr. Kwon
will dig us out of this mess.

629
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,069
What is it?

630
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,071
<i>Director, you have an external call.</i>

631
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,156
Patch me through.

632
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,911
Yes, this is Director Seo Min-cheol.

633
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,621
<i>Hello, this is the police.</i>

634
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,751
And?

635
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,338
A witness came forward
about a hit-and-run accident.

636
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,384
<i>We ran the license plate,</i>
<i>and the car came back registered to you.</i>

637
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,052
I'm afraid you'll need to come down here.

638
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,433
Are you sure you saw it?

639
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,102
Someone famous like you shouldn't lie.

640
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,856
- It's a punishable crime.
- I'm sure. I saw it myself.

641
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,066
I was at the accident site that day.

642
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,277
You were just a young student back then.

643
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,779
Why were you there at that hour?

644
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,907
- Do you have proof?
- Proof?

645
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,283
My own eyes are proof of that.

646
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,703
I'm sure it was this car.

647
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,665
What took you so long to come forward?

648
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,585
I only became sure after seeing a photo
of the car in today's article.

649
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,588
Not many units of that model
were imported into Korea.

650
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,299
Please thoroughly investigate
the car owner.

651
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,760
However, I'd appreciate it

652
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,804
if you didn't inform
the victim's family just yet.

653
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,972
Why is that?

654
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,769
Because…

655
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,314
the family could feel guilty
about being in the dark

656
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,026
about the true cause of her death
up until now.

657
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,623
Move!

658
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,584
- Don't try to escape me.
- Take your hand off him!

659
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,797
- I told you to let go.
- Stay out of this.

660
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,048
<i>This doesn't concern you.</i>

661
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,843
I see you're still here.

662
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:38,347
You need to get going so you can get
your makeup done and check your wardrobe.

663
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,517
I was about to go.

664
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,519
You still have some time
for coffee though.

665
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,354
Thank you.

666
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,695
Maybe ease up on the caffeine.

667
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,862
You look sleep-deprived.

668
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,116
The more I see you,

669
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,618
the more I realize how caring you are.

670
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:03,914
Would you like to have dinner with me
to celebrate your debut as a show host?

671
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,543
I skipped all my meals today
trying to organize your schedule.

672
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,128
Or how about a drink?

673
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,797
Did you set a date
for my visit to Hanju University?

674
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,090
It's tomorrow morning.

675
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,509
I made arrangements
with the college newspaper.

676
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,137
The presence of entertainment reporters
and well-known streamers

677
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,680
will create strong publicity.

678
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,766
I'll take a rain check on that meal.

679
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,935
I haven't been on campus for a while

680
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,146
so I should get some gifts.

681
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,397
Thanks for this.

682
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,116
<i>Why can't I be the one you love?</i>

683
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,457
<i>Only until then will I give…</i>

684
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,750
Kim Bom!

685
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,044
So this is where you were.

686
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,545
Hello.

687
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,838
- You haven't heard, right?
- Hear what?

688
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,132
Tae-yang will be on campus tomorrow.

689
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,427
First I'm hearing of it.

690
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,097
He accepted the invitation as soon
as the college newspaper reached out.

691
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,391
How freaking loyal is that?

692
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,143
The place will be swarming with reporters,

693
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,562
and I expect TWO SAGYE
to give a warm welcome as well.

694
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,022
Is Tae-yang really coming?

695
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,607
What did I just tell you?

696
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,484
Since this was his old band,

697
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,278
he'll be donating the latest equipment.

698
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,989
It's supposed to be a surprise,
so play dumb. You know what I mean.

699
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,325
Lucky you.

700
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,952
What do you even call this?

701
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,246
That you've been blessed?

702
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,624
Hey, are you ready to be blessed?

703
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:32,044
Gather your bandmates
and do some spring cleaning, will you?

704
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,672
All this dust! Open some windows too.

705
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,132
Also, put up a banner while you're at it.

706
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,218
Get ready to party, all right?

707
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,680
Closing door!

708
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,851
Tae-yang's coming here?

709
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,399
How long are you going to keep
a busy man here?

710
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,775
Like the witness said,

711
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,194
the car that you own

712
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,738
was one of the three imported into Korea.

713
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,533
We confirmed that the other two
weren't in Seoul at the time.

714
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,201
What does my owning the car

715
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,579
have to do with the hit-and-run case?

716
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,790
All you have
is a baseless witness statement.

717
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,041
Exactly.

718
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,794
So please try to recall
what you did at that exact time.

719
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,213
What else is there to do at that hour
besides sleep?

720
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,508
I'm a doctor who heads to work
at 6:00 in the morning.

721
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,678
We've already confirmed
that you weren't at work that day.

722
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,098
This is hardly something I want to do.

723
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,058
But that singer,
who supposedly saw everything,

724
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,269
is being awfully persistent.

725
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,522
He called again just now
claiming that he saw everything.

726
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,066
He can even describe the scene
and how the victim was lying.

727
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,695
SAGYE is a troubled singer
who was removed from his band

728
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,030
following assault allegations.

729
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,199
You'll be held accountable
for treating me like a suspect

730
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,993
just on the word of that punk.

731
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,120
- But--
- On top of that,

732
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,622
you said this happened six years ago.

733
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,042
How can he still remember every detail?

734
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,963
SAGYE is making this up out of spite.

735
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,217
Is there a reason for him
to be vindictive against you?

736
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,639
I'm Director Seo's attorney.

737
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,349
You'll now relay your questions to me.

738
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,157
It's me. We need to meet up right now.

739
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,453
That punk knows everything.

740
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,874
That my car caused the accident
and that I was a passenger.

741
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,334
What are you talking about?

742
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,710
How did Gye find out?

743
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,879
Was he actually there?

744
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,464
That's physically impossible.

745
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,633
Still…

746
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,052
he managed to identify the vehicle.

747
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,600
Why is this photo in the article?

748
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,685
- How--
- I slipped up.

749
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,938
I gave that photo to the reporter.

750
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,272
You handed this over?

751
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,398
Have you lost your mind?

752
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,942
I said I slipped up!

753
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,026
You slipped up?

754
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,029
How can you even say that,
given this situation?

755
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,074
You just served our heads
on a silver platter!

756
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,369
So? Are you saying
I'm the only one to blame?

757
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,120
You were the one
who was asleep at the wheel.

758
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,998
You caused the accident,
and you pushed us to drink!

759
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:19,878
You're the one who sent my assistant home.
I wouldn't have driven had he been there!

760
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,421
You sly rat.

761
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,759
Of course. We were never
on the same level anyway.

762
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:26,885
Level?

763
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,682
I mean, did you really think
you were on my level?

764
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,606
A desperate nobody came to me
asking for help,

765
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,025
so I invested
out of the goodness of my heart.

766
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,987
Did you think that made us friends?

767
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,488
Don't be delusional.

768
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,533
If I hadn't invested in your company,

769
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,660
you wouldn't even be drinking
in a place like this.

770
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
Hey!

771
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,250
I'm warning you.

772
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,878
If this damages my son's career
in any way,

773
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,384
your company and even your life
will hang in the balance.

774
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,475
Make sure that Sa Gye doesn't talk.

775
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,561
Do whatever…

776
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,022
is necessary.

777
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,446
TWO SAGYE BAND

778
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,781
Bom, what are you? Mother Teresa?

779
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,241
How could you agree to that?

780
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,201
- I won't do it.
- Neither will I.

781
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,912
Why should we be used
to promote Seo Tae-yang?

782
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,331
What's the issue?

783
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,625
It's a fact that Tae-yang
was a member of this band.

784
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,753
We could promote our band,
so I don't see what the problem is.

785
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,465
- What is this?
- Hey, I'm glad you're here.

786
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,509
I don't know why, but Tae-yang
is gonna waltz on to campus tomorrow.

787
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,386
The now-famous rock star
will bring reporters

788
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,764
and visit TWO SAGYE at our studio.

789
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,892
- Why should we stay for that?
- Talking about this is a waste of energy.

790
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,685
Why should we welcome someone
with a banner

791
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,646
when he's been getting in our way?

792
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,981
Tomorrow, we're closing the studio!

793
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,483
No one is allowed to enter.

794
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,569
Bom, don't you remember
what happened at the ski resort?

795
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,113
I do, but that was done by his agency.

796
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,076
Even if it was Tae-yang,
he had every right to be upset with us.

797
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,583
Bom, I'm against this too.
I hate the idea.

798
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,836
Not you, too. I already told
the college paper we'd do it.

799
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,172
Perhaps this is him
extending an olive branch.

800
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,466
Just think of it as a gig.

801
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,634
I said

802
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,761
I can get us more gigs.

803
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,887
Don't worry about that.

804
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,598
Just this once, please do as I say.

805
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,643
Please.

806
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,481
I want nothing more
than to do what you want,

807
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,899
but not this.

808
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,819
I don't want to see that punk's face.

809
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,487
So don't think about seeing him either.

810
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,410
You know what?

811
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,162
I guess seeing him won't be so bad.

812
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,040
Wouldn't it be pathetic
to be just as petty?

813
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,835
He has money to throw around
and will even donate instruments.

814
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,713
Why shouldn't we take advantage of that?

815
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,797
Why should we avoid him?

816
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,633
I'm going to get myself
a new set of drums.

817
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,511
This is us using him,
not the other way around.

818
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,054
Right, Bom?

819
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,351
Yes, of course.

820
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,145
Why don't we start by cleaning the studio?

821
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,813
I made myself clear.

822
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,566
Seo Tae-yang won't step foot
inside this studio.

823
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,070
What the…

824
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,739
That wasn't him. It was the wind.

825
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,116
The wind slammed the door shut.
It wasn't him.

826
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,784
Swoosh and bang.

827
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,340
Why don't you hate Tae-yang?

828
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,343
How can you forgive him so easily,
no matter what he does?

829
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,221
- Is he that special to you?
- I just…

830
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,309
get where he's coming from.

831
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,187
I feel bad for him and such.

832
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,355
What is there to even feel guilty about?

833
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,566
Why are you always so understanding?

834
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,447
He gave, and I always received.

835
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,450
Now, I want him to be happy too.

836
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,541
Gye.

837
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,128
Please don't storm off.

838
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,464
I won't be able to function
knowing you're upset.

839
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,134
It's almost Christmas.

840
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,480
When did I storm off?

841
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,565
You're still obviously upset.

842
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,193
This is just how I always look.

843
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,742
What should we do about Tae-yang tomorrow?

844
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,744
Can I decorate the studio?

845
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,996
I'm asking for your permission.

846
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,458
Decorate it or not.

847
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,377
It's not like you ever do what I say.

848
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,556
Father, are you all right?

849
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,600
Why did you drink so much?

850
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,352
It's all right.

851
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,145
I'm fine.

852
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,774
Your dad will never fall.

853
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,823
What is this about?

854
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,408
Is it Sa Gye?

855
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,244
What's been going on between you two
that's been bothering you?

856
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,455
Please tell me.

857
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,041
I'll handle him from now on.

858
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,336
Tae-yang.

859
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,922
My son.

860
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,174
If you truly want

861
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,845
to look out for your foolish father,

862
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,306
then…

863
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:08,059
under no circumstances
can you let Sa Gye get the best of you.

864
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,272
Do whatever it takes

865
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,232
to beat him.

866
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,359
Please.

867
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,444
You must.

868
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,488
If you don't, I'll…

869
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,798
It's so pretty.

870
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,175
Mom, over here.

871
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,135
Careful.

872
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,902
- Mom!
- My goodness.

873
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,323
Bom-bom, you're home.

874
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,242
My daughter.

875
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,954
What is wrong with you?

876
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,957
Why couldn't I reach you today?
I thought something had happened.

877
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,794
Goodness me. Did I leave my phone inside?

878
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,007
I had my hands full today
buying and decorating the tree.

879
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,385
Did I worry you?

880
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,178
But why were you even worried about me?

881
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,515
How could you ask me that
after making me worry all day?

882
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,558
Why are you acting like it's no big deal?

883
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,228
How can you smile right now?

884
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,106
I'm seriously mad at you!

885
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,941
Don't be upset with me.

886
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,443
I'm perfectly fine.

887
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,617
You know I can't live without you.

888
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,202
You can't die.

889
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,413
If you leave me like Dad did,

890
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,331
I'll follow you to the grave too.

891
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,835
Why would you say something so terrifying?

892
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,421
Besides, I'm the one
who can't live without you.

893
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,924
How could I leave my gorgeous daughter?

894
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,177
Even in death, I'll never leave your side.

895
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,098
Perhaps as a star, the moon,

896
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,559
or the snow.

897
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,603
I might even come back
as those Christmas lights,

898
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,064
just to keep watch over you.

899
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,152
When did you decorate the tree?

900
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,156
Why do you say that? Is it pretty?

901
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,909
Yes, very.

902
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,998
I've been working my butt off
so I could surprise you.

903
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,543
Ta-da.

904
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,174
It's beautiful.

905
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,593
Merry Christmas, my daughter.

906
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,804
Let's love each other even more next year.

907
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,643
I love you, my daughter.

908
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,767
<i>Gye,</i>

909
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,144
<i>I send this from Iceland.</i>

910
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,022
<i>I was lucky enough to get a clear view</i>
<i>of the northern lights on the first day.</i>

911
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,024
<i>You said you had been here before.</i>

912
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,360
<i>I prayed while watching them.</i>

913
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,571
<i>That I was grateful</i>
<i>you were able to see again</i>

914
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,200
<i>and take in this beautiful scenery.</i>

915
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,619
<i>Let's see it together next time, Son.</i>

916
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,414
Did she become

917
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,375
an organ donor?

918
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,710
He was acting strange.

919
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,754
He asked when Bom's mother passed away.

920
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,714
But this must mean we were meant to meet.

921
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,092
<i>You were the little girl from my dream.</i>

922
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,804
Bom!

923
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,600
What are you doing down there?
Get up here already.

924
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,060
I'll show you something cool!

925
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,817
Bom-bom!

926
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,026
Bom-bom!

927
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,153
Come on. Get up here already!

928
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,739
<i>It was you.</i>

929
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,116
<i>It was you.</i>

930
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,747
<i>And you were here all along.</i>

931
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,587
You poor thing.

932
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,796
Not her eyes.

933
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,381
What if…

934
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,966
What if Mom won't recognize me?

935
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,636
What if she comes looking for me
but can't find me?

936
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,478
Bom-bom!

937
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,741
Well? Isn't it like the northern lights?

938
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,868
You wanted to see them, remember?

939
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,996
Make do with these for now
until we can go to Iceland together.

940
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,041
I worked at the speed of light
to surprise you.

941
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:20,390
Decorating the tree with just lights
and no ornaments is the latest trend.

942
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,891
You know I'm on top of the trends.

943
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,313
What is it?

944
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,276
Is it bad? Is it too plain?

945
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,446
But it's a Christmas gift.
Can't you at least fake a smile?

946
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,574
How is this like the northern lights?

947
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,912
I never asked for a Christmas tree.
This is what you do after storming off?

948
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,457
I'm sorry. I won't be angry anymore.

949
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,212
Are you really upset?

950
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,422
Whatever.

951
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,340
You don't even know what I like.

952
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,425
Tell me, then.

953
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,760
Just name it, and I'll buy it for you.

954
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,221
Big, fluffy snowflakes.

955
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,599
Big, fluffy snowflakes?

956
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,185
You said you'd get me anything.
You promised.

957
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,479
I looked forward
to a white Christmas this year.

958
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,275
Thought you might,

959
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,570
which is why I came prepared with snow.

960
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,703
This is how grand
a Christmas present should be, right?

961
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,457
Whatever you wish for will come true.

962
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,917
Whatever you say will come true.

963
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,294
<i>Roopretelcham.</i>

964
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,129
You know that, right?

965
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,556
Bom.

966
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,642
I have something to say.

967
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:48,936
What is it?

968
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,107
Merry Christmas.

969
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,838
Gye.

970
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,384
You don't have to do anything
for me anymore.

971
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,179
My wish just came true.

972
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,849
You don't have to plant flowers
in the garden.

973
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,394
And the hydrangeas at the columbarium.

974
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,396
Stop replacing them.

975
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:34,982
The columbarium?

976
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,111
What do you mean? What hydrangeas?

977
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,196
You even went there yesterday.

978
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,824
I'm not stupid, you know.

979
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,660
You can stop bringing my mom flowers.

980
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,578
Hydrangeas don't last long anyway.

981
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,874
I'm just doing it because I want to.

982
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,335
I promised I'd go with you that day,

983
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,129
but I let you down.

984
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,257
I felt terrible.

985
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,801
Is it because of what I said before?

986
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,887
That I'm worried my mom would resent me?

987
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,890
I don't feel that way anymore.

988
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,644
My mom told me so.

989
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,690
She never resented me.

990
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,027
Not even once.

991
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,241
How could you possibly know
what she thinks?

992
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,409
Because right now…

993
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,123
you're telling me with your eyes.

994
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,754
Where has she been breathing…

995
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,632
and what has she been seeing?

996
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,887
I've always wondered.

997
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,276
I'm sorry.

998
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,112
I'm sorry, Bom.

999
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,240
For being happy while you were hurting.

1000
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,912
<i>I feel even worse</i>
<i>for liking you despite that.</i>

1001
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,622
Don't say that.

1002
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,125
I'm glad it was you, Gye.

1003
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,127
Can I…

1004
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,005
try touching your eyes?

1005
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,047
<i>I'm finally at ease now.</i>

1006
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,674
<i>I can breathe again, Gye.</i>

1007
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,551
<i>Only think about Bom.</i>

1008
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,803
<i>We're finally going to perform on TV!</i>

1009
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,222
Gye, this isn't a dream, is it?
This is real, right?

1010
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,265
<i>My wish came true.</i>

1011
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,350
<i>Check the whereabouts of SAGYE.</i>

1012
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,394
<i>Any kind of accident will leave behind</i>

1013
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,854
<i>- a trace or a record.</i>
<i>- See you at the police station.</i>

1014
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,815
<i>Who are you to harass my father like this?</i>

1015
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,734
<i>If you want to do right by Bom,</i>

1016
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,402
just stay put and don't do anything.

1017
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,654
<i>Bom, for me, it's always been you.</i>

1018
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:13,743
