ALL CHARACTERS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,469
<i>Roopretelcham.</i>

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,895
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

5
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

6
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,690
<i>The time that we had</i>
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

8
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>I find new things to do</i>

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

11
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,283
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

12
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,620
<i>Oh, my, my, my</i>
<i>I think about you every day</i>

13
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,707
<i>Counting three-sixty-five</i>
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,347
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

16
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,442
<i>I hear time will do the work</i>

18
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>It'll help me forget about you</i>

19
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,500
<i>Oh, no. It looks like we blew a fuse.</i>

20
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>What now?</i>

21
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,419
<i>Shouldn't we stop filming?</i>

22
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,339
<i>No way. I said we'd be filming this</i>
<i>in a single take.</i>

23
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>Didn't you see the sparks?</i>

24
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>I can't. I'm not dying here today.</i>

25
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>No one's going to die.</i>

26
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>Gyu-ri.</i>

27
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,943
Hey, wait.

28
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,863
THE CROWN NEW MEMBER REVEAL
COUNTDOWN

29
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,958
SEO TAE-YANG

30
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,049
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

31
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

32
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,637
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Tae-yang.

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,306
I'll do my best as The Crown's new leader.

34
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,197
Director Seo Min-cheol's son?

35
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,573
The dad is friends with CEO Jo

36
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,575
and owns a large share of the agency.

37
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,953
I get it now. Strings were pulled.

38
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,955
His dad landed him the leader role.

39
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,873
He didn't even have to train.

40
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,999
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
AT FIRST SIGHT

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,125
HE COMMANDED THE WHOLE STAGE
ON HIS OWN

42
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,419
EVEN HIS NAME IS HOT
AND OMG THAT FACE?

43
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,046
THE CROWN'S NEW LEADER REVEALED
ON DECEMBER 1ST, 10 A.M.

44
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,302
THE CROWN'S NEW LEADER REVEALED
ON DECEMBER 1ST, 10 A.M.

45
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,016
Bom, did you know about this?

46
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
No.

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
I had no idea.

48
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,983
Seo Tae-yang, you bastard.
How could you do this?

49
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,151
How can he be in the same band
as those jerks

50
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,695
who kicked SAGYE off his throne?

51
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,531
And who does he think he is,
replacing SAGYE?

52
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,450
His spot should be off-limits!

53
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,496
- I'll call him.
- Don't.

54
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,207
He doesn't know the truth
and should get out while he can.

55
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,583
This is Tae-yang's choice.

56
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,043
It's not our place to meddle.

57
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,922
<i>I won't have to feel bad either.</i>

58
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,550
Regardless of how I start my career…

59
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,844
You won't care, right?

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,809
It's not like Jo & Jo
ever wronged Tae-yang.

61
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,187
I bet his dad pulled strings
to get him into a top agency.

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,232
With this in his back pocket,
he dared say he wouldn't leave TWO SAGYE.

63
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,484
That just pisses me off!

64
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,988
What about our video?
Is it getting a lot of views?

65
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,156
As if!

66
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,826
We're just about the only ones
clicking on it!

67
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,245
I'm sure things will improve.

68
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,665
The Crown just released big news,
so more people will look them up.

69
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,335
Who knows? The algorithm might do
its magic and make us go viral.

70
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,547
That's bound to happen.

71
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,104
<i>The person you called is unavailable</i>…

Sir, you should see this.

76
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,799
What is it? What's going on?

77
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,010
Someone just uploaded a cover of the song.

78
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,066
<i>It's the best cover of our song so far.</i>

79
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,986
This arrangement is fire! How can
the cover be better than the original?

80
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,363
It sounds completely different.

81
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,531
Did a real person sing this?

82
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,034
- He's a beast on those notes. It's sick!
- This is insanely good.

83
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,161
Who can pull off high notes
in chest voice like that?

84
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,082
I'm totally sold on this vocalist.
He'll forever be my role model.

85
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,917
This definitely deserves a comment.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,377
- Hit like.
- Right.

87
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,797
- This isn't a promo stunt on our part.
- It wasn't us.

88
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,049
Of course not. Why would we hide it?

89
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,551
- We're just as baffled.
- Absolutely.

90
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,761
Can you believe it?

91
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,805
The cover is more popular
than the new member reveal.

92
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,141
The view count is no joke!

93
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,767
It just became the most trending video.

94
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,103
SUNDER's comment must've given it a boost.

95
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,646
- Exactly.
- Do you think they have an agency?

96
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,773
They must be professionals,
given how good they are.

97
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,692
- Can you tell who it is?
- No clue.

98
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,446
They'll reveal their faces once it exceeds
three million views, and they're close.

99
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,865
Should we gather the members of The Crown?

100
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,742
Filming their reaction to the cover
could hook core fans.

101
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,578
Compared to variety shows,
self-made content--

102
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,913
Why are you so hyped about this?

103
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,877
The focus of this company right now
is Seo Tae-yang, a new brand.

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,837
His reveal was overshadowed,

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,756
so why are you so excited
about a viral cover?

106
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,322
VIEWS
SUBSCRIBERS

107
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,573
We should upload it.

108
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,285
Now that it has over three million views,

109
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,206
we'll upload the video
we filmed without our hats.

110
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,961
- Here we go. One, two, three.
- Three.

111
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,880
THE CROWN, SEE YOU LATER COVER
FACE REVEAL

112
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,678
See? My plan worked out!

113
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,138
That's me, Kim Bom!

114
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,184
TWO SAGYE is finally making its debut.

115
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,019
Bring it in.

116
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,355
One, two, three.

117
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,899
- TWO SAGYE, forever!
- TWO SAGYE, forever!

118
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,695
- Hey, let's get to school.
- Got it.

119
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,447
Move it!

120
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,699
- What is it?
- Out of the way, Mom.

121
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,078
What is it? Why are you leaving me out?

122
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,997
You Zoomers. Unbelievable!

123
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,292
What were they watching? The Crown?

124
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,384
They're so good.

125
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,306
Sa Gye?

126
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,934
- Has Sa Gye always been this good?
- This is insane.

127
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,436
- Is it Sa Gye?
- No wonder the vocalist sounded so good.

128
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,552
- Go, Sa Gye!
- Go, Sa Gye!

129

THE FACES BEHIND
THE CROWN'S COVER SONG

130

PENALTY NOTICE

132
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,978
TWO SAGYE.

133
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,143
I have a request, Mr. Jo.

134
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,645
Give me your full support.

135
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,230
Make me a more successful artist

136
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,024
than Sa Gye.

137
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,818
If it means I can erase
his presence from The Crown,

138
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,695
I'll do anything.

139
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,198
You'll do anything?

140
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,618
Are you sure you can outdo Sa Gye?

141
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,827
Yes.

142
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,913
I can do it.

143
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,338
Good, then go outshine him.

144
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,300
I'll help you soar as high as you want.

145
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,630
Guys, pack up your things.
We finally booked a gig!

146
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,632
- Really?
- Really?

147
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,968
Buckle up.
You'll be performing like crazy now.

148
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,636
What event? How much are we getting paid?

149
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,680
Come on. Just tell us already!

150
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,391
Haenam Sweet Potato Festival.

151
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,227
A base payment and a bonus
if there's a big crowd.

152
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,062
It sounds like a real banger!

153
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,404
SWEET POTATO

154
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,282
How can we take the bus
with all this stuff?

155
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,783
Call a truck, will you?

156
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,410
Then we'll be in the red.

157
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,163
Who knew we'd get paid
with sweet potatoes?

158
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,081
We got onions as a bonus.

159
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,042
Bom, you should've negotiated better.

160
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,044
They should at least cover our transport.

161
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,130
Is that the best you can do
as the producer?

162
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,718
That's enough.
We still have more events lined up.

163
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,802
Where to next?

164
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,721
A ski resort.

165
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,599
A ski resort!

166
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,767
You know only good singers
perform at ski resorts.

167
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,479
Bom booked a good one for us.
Give it up for her!

168
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,523
How much will we get paid there?

169
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,401
Five million won.

170
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,486
- Five million?
- No way!

171
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,446
See? I told you she's competent.

172
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,490
No other amateurs would get
five million to perform.

173
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,367
Two boxes of sweet potatoes
aren't bad at all for our first gig.

174
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,536
Based on my experience with an agency,

175
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,331
I've never come across
such a perfect producer.

176
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,292
At this rate,
we'll be able to afford a truck soon.

177
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,711
The bus is here.

178
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,348
I'm not carrying mine.
SAGYE, I'm not carrying mine!

179
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,474
I'll get it.

180
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,808
Forget it.

181
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,987
What a crowd. Are they all here to see us?

182
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,031
That's how hot TWO SAGYE is at the moment.

183
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,866
You'll get used to this in no time.

184
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,994
We became famous overnight.
Jeez, I'm super nervous.

185
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,496
Where's the event staff?

186
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,331
In the waiting room.

187
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,041
Where's the waiting room?

188
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,793
- Over there?
- There?

189
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,086
Let's go.

190
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,844
- I think it's over there.
- What?

191
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,680
2025 PYEONGCHANG WINTER
FESTIVAL - SPECIAL GUEST

192
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,890
Special guest! Do you see that?

193
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,017
Let's head inside.

194
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,144
What the heck?

195
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,396
What is it?

196
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,523
- It's locked.
- It's locked?

197
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,025
Why is it locked?

198
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,528
But we have to perform soon.
What's going on?

199
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,779
Why can't I hear anything?

200
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,447
- Can you call them?
- Sure.

201
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,494
<i>The number you have called</i>
<i>is not in service.</i>

202
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,037
- What? Is no one answering?
- <i>Please check again.</i>

203
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,247
Actually…

204
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,209
- the number isn't in service.
- What do you mean?

205
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,752
You just spoke with them.

206
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,922
It took three hours
and three buses to get here.

207
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,258
- Are you sure we're in the right place?
- I'm sure.

208
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,426
Pyeongchang Ski Resort.

209
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,510
2025 PYEONGCHANG WINTER FESTIVAL

210
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,431
- Here they come.
- Finally.

211
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,516
- Hello.
- Hi, we're TWO SAGYE.

212
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,310
Can you open the door for us?

213
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,353
- Hello.
- Hello.

214
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,981
- Hello. Got it.
- Guys, grab your things.

215
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,570
2025 PYEONGCHANG WINTER FESTIVAL
SEO TAE-YANG

216
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,406
This way, please.

217
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,305
Can you close the door?

218
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,099
I want it to be quiet
before I get on stage.

219
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,517
Of course.

220
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,145
How is Seo Tae-yang here?

221
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,025
Guys.

222
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,694
You can't be here, so can you move?

223
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,364
We're the band TWO SAGYE.

224
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,574
Where's the event coordinator?

225
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,493
- That's me.
- Right.

226
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,744
You must be Mr. Oh Jeong-hwan.

227
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,788
- Hello.
- Hi.

228
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,456
I'm Kim Bom. We talked on the phone.

229
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,583
You booked us to perform at 5 p.m. today.

230
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,919
I was surprised
to hear your number wasn't in service.

231
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,672
There's no one by that name here.

232
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,800
- Sorry?
- There must be a misunderstanding,

233
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,636
but we booked Seo Tae-yang
for a fan sign event.

234
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,222
Seo Tae-yang, a member of The Crown.

235
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,474
No other band was booked.

236
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,143
Anyway, this is a restricted area.
How did you get back here?

237
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,271
- Will you get over here and handle this?
- Yes, sir.

238
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,690
- But…
- You'll have to leave.

239
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,984
- This is a restricted area.
- Go on.

240
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,027
- Please leave.
- You should leave.

241
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,738
- Hurry along.
- Please leave.

242
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,282
Please get going.

243
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,285
This is a restricted area.

244
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,749
<i>Was TWO SAGYE meant to perform here?</i>

245
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,085
<i>You didn't mention that.</i>

246
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>You can't defeat your adversary</i>
<i>without trampling over them.</i>

247
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,636
<i>Were you expecting to make it to the top</i>
<i>without such determination?</i>

248
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,639
<i>Still…</i>

249
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,687
STILL, THIS IS…

250
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,117
Let me get this straight.

251
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,079
Somebody tricked us into booking a gig
that was never real

252
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,373
by luring us with a payment
of five million won.

253
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,877
But it Seo Tae-yang
turned out to be the actual guest.

254
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,921
What are the chances?
Could it be any fishier?

255
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,798
Jo & Jo probably pulled some strings.

256
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,594
Our cover's outshining the original,
and they probably couldn't stand that.

257
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,889
Still, they're playing way too dirty.
Who do they think they are?

258
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,892
Is this really how
a multi-billion-dollar company operates?

259
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,977
Wait. We can't be certain
that it was Jo & Jo.

260
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,395
Maybe…

261
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,190
this was Seo Tae-yang's doing.

262
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,528
He could've used a burner phone
to fake-call us.

263
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,947
Just to mess with us!

264
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,532
I'm right!

265
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,077
There's nothing money can't do.
Like father, like son.

266
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,203
That's a possibility.

267
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,621
He flat-out ignored us earlier.

268
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,707
- He thinks he's a superstar.
- What a jerk.

269
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,376
He acted upright and all,

270
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,420
but stealing our gig is
what he resorted to?

271
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,381
Come on. Let's mess up
this fan sign event.

272
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,258
I dare that bastard to call the cops.

273
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,427
- Hey.
- You're dead meat!

274
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,763
- Come on.
- Wait till I get my hands on you!

275
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,390
You prick. You're done for!

276
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,563
I can't take this.

277
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,608
Forget our chance to perform.
Since we're here…

278
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,497
Let's have some fun.

279
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,667
- Let's have some fun.
- What?

280
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,960
Let's have some fun!

281
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,130
I'm in.

282
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,093
Hey!

283
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,993
TWO SAGYE
EVENT BOOKING PAGE

284
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,663
DELETE POST?
DELETE

285
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,924
And Tae-yang's fan sign event?

286
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,134
I just got word that they just wrapped up.

287
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,679
Apparently,
they couldn't get enough of him.

288
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,766
And Sa Gye?

289
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,477
They packed up and left.

290
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,230
Have you been careful
with the burner phone?

291
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,314
Yes, sir.

292
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,777
Continue deleting all performance requests
received through TWO SAGYE's website.

293
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,322
General TV stations, cable networks,
and any other media outlets.

294
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,450
Make sure TWO SAGYE doesn't appear
on any of those.

295
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,203
Okay, sir.

296
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,797
<i>Seung-su, it looks like</i>
<i>TWO SAGYE's website has been hacked.</i>

297
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,008
<i>Fake requests keep coming in,</i>
<i>while real ones get deleted.</i>

298
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,178
<i>Can you check if CEO Jo is behind this?</i>

299
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,898
<i>It's not Mr. Jo.</i>

300
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,651
<i>He's been putting all his effort</i>
<i>into promoting Seo Tae-yang.</i>

301
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,530
Have you seen the northern lights before?

302
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,659
Yes, when I was in Iceland.

303
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,621
How was it?
I bet it's a class above sunsets.

304
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,957
What's it like to see something
blindingly beautiful?

305
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,002
Are the lights enchanting and charming?

306
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,296
Beats me. I don't really remember.

307
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,714
I was too sleepy.

308
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,966
We were on our Europe tour.
After three days of performing,

309
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,052
I'd be in another country, and then again
in another after three days.

310
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,679
That's why.

311
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,307
No way. That was rude of you.

312
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,851
How can you doze off
watching the northern lights?

313
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,186
Most people don't even get
the chance to see it.

314
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,273
My mom really wanted to see them too.

315
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,614
<i>I honestly don't even remember</i>
<i>the northern lights.</i>

316
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,950
<i>After regaining my vision,</i>

317
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,161
<i>I was looking at them with new eyes,</i>

318
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,038
<i>but I didn't realize back then</i>

319
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,332
<i>how special they were.</i>

320
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,083
That's why, someday,

321
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,710
I'll go and see

322
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,338
the northern lights.

323
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,674
I'll wait for the best time to see them,

324
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,218
and witness them with my own eyes.

325
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,220
I'll…

326
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,723
take you there.

327
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,810
What? Why would you?

328
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,021
I'll save up and go alone.

329
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,901
The northern lights
aren't visible every day.

330
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,029
The timing has to be right,
and you also have to be lucky.

331
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,656
So, let me go with you.

332
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,159
As if.

333
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,536
The Arctic or the Antarctic,

334
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,955
I'll make sure you see everything
you missed out on.

335
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,501
Start marking the places
that you'd like to visit on a map.

336
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,421
- You're all talk.
- Bom!

337
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,757
Bom, help me!

338
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,258
- I'm coming.
- Help!

339
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,552
He's too strong. Help me, please.

340
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,929
Here.

341
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,681
What? Hey, stop that!

342
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,974
<i>Bom's laughing.</i>

343
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,520
<i>All I ever want is to keep her smiling.</i>

344
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:21,024
<i>I want her to see</i>
<i>only the beauty life has to offer.</i>

345
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,403
<i>But what if she finds out</i>
<i>how her mom died?</i>

346
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,157

TRENDING VIDEOS

348
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,457
The cover song has gotten
over 30 million views.

349
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,543
It's going viral.

350
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,003
I've been trying to fend off the media,

351
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,256
but they're more interested in TWO SAGYE
than The Crown.

352
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,007
It's only temporary.

353
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,344
Their fame will fizzle out
if they continue to stay invisible.

354
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,138
We could cut The Crown's promotion short.

355
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,764
That's not an option.

356
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,101
How much longer do we have to hear
they prefer the cover over the original?

357
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,936
They're even comparing the vocalists.

358
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,231
Is SUNDER unable to belt high notes
using chest voice?

359
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:05,110
There isn't a male vocalist
who can hit those notes using chest voice.

360
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,862
What about Sa Gye, then?

361
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,197
How did he get so good
after leaving the band?

362
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,075
You're the one who kicked him out.

363
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,746
Things wouldn't have gotten this far
if you hadn't plagiarized.

364
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,593
Hello, Director Seo.

365
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,928
I could hear you arguing
out in the hallway.

366
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,141
That's not good for the company, is it?

367
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,268
It's nothing serious.

368
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,897
Go on out.

369
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,106
Actually,

370
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,066
she should be here for this.

371
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,653
Right. I'll stay.

372
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,910
You know,

373
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,539
I didn't think you were working so hard
to ruin my son's chances.

374
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,292
I'm trying my best.

375
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,378
I've been accommodating
his requests and demands,

376
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,173
assigning him reporters
who will write only favorable pieces.

377
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:12,552
Whether you admit it or not,
your recent project was clearly a flop.

378
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,931
You failed to create any buzz,
even after signing a hotshot member.

379
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,267
Truth is,
you let Sa Gye get the better of you.

380
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,022
That's why I'll get more involved
in Tae-yang's career from now on.

381
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,609
I can't let him sink and drown
just because he boarded a leaky boat.

382
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,110
That will never happen.

383
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,737
How can you be so sure?

384
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,116
You've probably heard,

385
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,328
but I completed a tricky surgery
on the floor leader of the ruling party.

386
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:42,749
I'll be in as many interviews as possible,
so use that to create a buzz.

387
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,876
Understood, sir.

388
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,004
- The PR Team will take point.
- Producer Jo.

389
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,673
Have Tae-yang

390
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:54,177
be the first Asian ambassador for H brand.

391
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,929
What do you say? Can you do it?

392
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,013
Sorry?

393
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,393
But that brand is too high-end.

394
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,561
And what's Jo & Jo? A five-and-dime store?

395
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,563
No wonder.

396
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,691
I don't care how much it'll cost.

397
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,152
From now on, I'll make sure
to carry my son all the way to the top.

398
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,531
He'll sit on a throne
that no one dares to challenge.

399
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,993
- One, two, three.
- That's the same.

400
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,078
No, it's different. Take a closer look.

401
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,290
Sorry I'm late.
I came straight from my event.

402
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,042
- How much have you practiced?
- That'll be all for today. Pack up.

403
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,419
Sure.

404
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,586
Done already?

405
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,588
Tomorrow will be
our first performance as a band.

406
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,840
Our practice time is limited.

407
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,551
If you were worried,
you shouldn't have booked a separate gig.

408
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,469
And you did so without our consent.

409
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,847
The agency schedules these events.

410
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,973
Is that so?

411
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,559
But word is, CEO Jo takes orders from you.

412
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,602
Is that not true?

413
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,854
What a jerk.

414
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,648
The rehearsal's at 5 p.m.,
so gather around by noon.

415
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,348
We should talk.

416
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,601
You know how busy I've been
with all the performances.

417
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,686
I couldn't care less.

418
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,523
It seems like you care a lot, though.
It wasn't intentional, but I'll apologize.

419
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,361
TWO SAGYE happened to ruin
your historic day of joining The Crown.

420
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,446
Maybe you should've given us a heads-up.

421
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,200
I never thought you'd sign
with that lousy agency.

422
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,537
What are you getting at?

423
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,040
Do you really want to stoop down
to Jo Sang-heon's level?

424
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,085
It's lame to mess with our gigs,
don't you think?

425
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,171
But you had every right to be pissed,
so I'll let this one slide.

426
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,756
What if you don't?

427
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,554
I'm planning to take down Jo & Jo.

428
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,100
If you don't want to get hurt,
leave the agency on your own terms.

429
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,768
That's what I came here to say.

430
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,353
Why?

431
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,689
Are you that pissed off
that I replaced you?

432
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,317
I don't want you to get caught up
in this feud.

433
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,111
Bom doesn't want that.

434
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,404
Don't pretend you care about Bom.

435
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,656
You ditched her,
and now you're barking this nonsense?

436
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,784
I didn't wait outside in the cold
just to bark nonsense.

437
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,703
This is the most honest
I've been with you.

438
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,332
Leave Jo & Jo.

439
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,000
Jo Sang-heon's a piece of trash.

440
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,878
You're better than that.

441
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,380
You saying that

442
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,466
makes me think Jo & Jo is a great company.

443
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,719
Is it too good to give away?

444
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,555
Take me seriously, will you?
Jo & Jo plagiarized Bom's song.

445
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,099
How could you work
with scumbags like them?

446
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,226
Plagiarism?

447
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,900
Next time, come at me
with something better.

448
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,445
I know Bom.

449
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,614
She wouldn't sit back and sing a cover
of her own song if it had been stolen.

450
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,744
- She wouldn't keep it quiet from me too.
- Because you chose Jo & Jo,

451
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,246
she's letting this crappy situation
slide for your sake.

452
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,081
Because she's kind to a fault!

453
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,208
Do you know Bom that well?

454
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,627
More than I do?

455
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,212
I gave you my warning.

456
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,924
I'm set on taking down
the shady Jo & Jo Entertainment.

457
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,761
I'll get it done,
whether you're with them or not.

458
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,220
So don't regret this later.

459
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,181
I'm looking forward to it.

460
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,686
I'll be waiting.

461
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,439
I'm always down for a fight with you.

462
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,431
Everyone will probably be asleep.

463
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,059
That's hilarious!

464
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,647
- Can you believe it?
- It's so funny.

465
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,067
You're home late.
What's that in your hand?

466
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,570
It's beer.

467
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,032
I was thirsty, you see.
Maybe it's too dry in here.

468
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,243
The fridge is stocked with beer.

469
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,412
Ms. Kim doesn't make side dishes
but stocks the fridge with beer.

470
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,707
We didn't have the ale I like.

471
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,877
Anyway, don't mind me and enjoy the show.
That looks fun.

472
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,635
No way!

473
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,269
What is it?

474
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,646
What did he stash in the fridge
so secretly?

475
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,065
What's that? Isn't it beef?

476
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,860
No way. That's more premium
than prime-cut beef.

477
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,319
The marbling on that is insane.

478
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,988
That selfish brat.

479
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,074
How can he keep a stash for himself
when we live under the same roof?

480
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,910
What's with all the vegetables?
He hardly eats any.

481
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,289
- Maybe that isn't just for himself.
- Of course, it is.

482
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,708
He wouldn't have hid this
if he was going to share.

483
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,669
- That ungrateful brat.
- Right? What should we do?

484
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,713
Do you even have to ask? Heat up the pan.

485
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,590
Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.

486
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,476
<i>The Arctic or the Antarctic,</i>

487
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,605
<i>I'll make sure you see everything</i>
<i>you missed out on.</i>

488
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,901
<i>Start marking the places</i>
<i>that you'd like to visit on a map.</i>

489
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,874
Are you still up?

490
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,168
I was just about to turn in.

491
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,211
Early morning shift.

492
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,671
At what time?

493
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,923
I leave the house at 6 a.m.

494
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,303
Have breakfast before you go.
I'll grill some meat for you.

495
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,471
Meat?

496
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,098
Oh, that. It just landed in my lap.

497
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,851
<i>Anyway, have breakfast</i>
<i>before you leave tomorrow.</i>

498
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,853
I'll set the table and wait for you.

499
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,438
<i>You need to stay healthy.</i>

500
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,273
<i>You have a lot to do as a producer.</i>

501
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,444
What are you up to now?

502
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,279
I'm talking to you on the phone.

503
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,657
I have something to say to you.

504
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,201
- Go ahead.
- <i>Don't be surprised.</i>

505
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,178
What?

506
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,265
Were these doors always this easy to open?

507
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,976
Shouldn't doors be more secure?

508
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,645
This is an invasion of privacy.

509
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,403
And this… This is cheating.

510
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,904
My door is over there.

511
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,990
Come through there
if you have something to say.

512
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,242
You have no fear, do you?

513
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,705
Gye, are you still interested
in signing with me?

514
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,375
Can you promise me
you won't take it back again?

515
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,424
What if I can?

516
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,009
I want to sign you

517
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,553
as my first artist.

518
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,017
If you sign me,
Jo & Jo will only come after you harder.

519
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,184
Can you handle that?

520
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,646
That's why I'm doing it.
We're young, aren't we?

521
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,731
You're down, right?

522
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,322
It's an honor.

523
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,994
I can't pay you now,

524
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,747
but I will give the industry standard
once I've earned enough money.

525
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,416
Until then, this will be collateral.

526
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,842
Why would you give me that? Forget it.

527
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,511
- No way.
- You know what this means to me.

528
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,930
This means you can't run away.

529
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,766
If you change your mind again,

530
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,768
the fine will be 1,000 times higher.

531
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,023
I can't accept this.

532
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,027
I don't need a signing bonus
from you, so--

533
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,111
Take it,

534
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,447
or the deal's off.

535
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,426
I'm your producer for real from now on.

536
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,512
Let's do this.

537
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,271
Can I name your agency?

538
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,569
Sure. What will it be?

539
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,737
Bom-bom.

540
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,366
Spring is my favorite
out of the four seasons.

541
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,592
Cheers.

542
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,180
Do you know what the best drink is?

543
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,932
<i>Somaek</i>? Whiskey?

544
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,308
Or is it Chateau Moulin?

545
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,726
All wrong. It's free drinks.

546
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,106
It's thrilling to secretly sneak food.

547
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,816
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it? Let's dig in.

548
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,278
- It's a work of art.
- Right?

549
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,780
- I know a thing or two about meat.
- Right.

550
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,990
And this…

551
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,616
is the real deal.

552
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,869
The quality of this beef is outstanding.

553
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,871
You're broke, yet you
care so much about the meat quality.

554
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,497
Stuff your mouth before we get caught.

555
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,707
Hurry.

556
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,458
Cheers.

557
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,843
My heart just dropped.

558
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,220
Why are you standing there like a ghost?

559
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,484
Hold on. Are you crying?

560
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,611
Are you crying?

561
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,695
Why?

562
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,947
The meat…

563
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,035
is too darn good.

564
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,584
I didn't have a lot.
It's just that your mom insisted.

565
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,378
It's nothing to cry about. Go on and eat.

566
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,088
There's still about a kilo of meat left.

567
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,298
No!

568
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,051
I'm having it all by myself.

569
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,136
No one else can have it.

570
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,513
SAGYE bought this,

571
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,351
and I'm going to have all of it!

572
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,271
It's all mine!

573
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,900
What…

574
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,077
No!

575
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,332
Bom-bom.

576
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,795
I'll grill you meat some other time.

577
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,713
Today, stick to this instant coffee.

578
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,882
It's really hot,
so cool it down before drinking it.

579
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,636
But I'm off to work at a cafe.

580
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,346
It serves coffee made from roasted beans--

581
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,057
So? Are you saying
the coffee I made is worthless?

582
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,183
Of course not. I'll drink it.

583
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,352
The coffee someone else
makes for me is the best.

584
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,187
Especially instant coffee. Thanks.

585
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,064
This isn't coffee made by just anyone.

586
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,524
- What?
- It's CMS.

587
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,819
Coffee made by Sa Gye.
How special is that?

588
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,571
I'll get going.

589
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,665
Why aren't you bundled up?

590
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,083
Did you dress up for your shift?

591
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,877
I'm sure you'll be stubborn
and walk there.

592
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,838
You never listen, do you?

593
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,176
- We've been barely able to perform, so--
- Look.

594
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,387
I'll book us gigs.

595
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,766
Make sure you don't catch a cold.

596
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,560
That'll really put a damper on things.

597
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,065
Does an artist have to
look after his producer too?

598
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,402
Have a good one.

599
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,660
<i>Bom-bom!</i>

600
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,786
You'll catch a cold.

601
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,372
You know you shouldn't leave
your neck exposed in the cold.

602
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,874
Right, I forgot.

603
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,419
Here's a hand warmer.
It's a must for a pianist.

604
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,254
I forgot that too.

605
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,423
How do you expect to study abroad
if you're this clumsy?

606
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,925
Why don't you just stay? Please?

607
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,927
Just stay here with me.

608
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,681
My life will be boring without you around.

609
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,266
Mom, come on.

610
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,353
How can you not support me
when I'm dying to go to Juilliard?

611
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,605
It's the least you can do
for your daughter's future.

612
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,650
My daughter means more to me
than that Juilliard or whatnot.

613
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,029
Don't be on my case later on
for not getting married.

614
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,073
I'm going to live with you forever.

615
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,699
- I'll get going.
- Wait.

616
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,201
Why don't I give you a ride?

617
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,619
It's too cold today.

618
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,413
I'll go with Mi-yeon.
Gosh, I'm already sweating in my neck.

619
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,498
See you later!

620
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,376
Bom-bom, have a good day.

621
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,712
Keep the muffler.

622
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,506
You don't have to give it back.

623
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,737
Why is it so cold today?

624
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,164
I can't believe you three.

625
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,875
How could you silently gobble up
almost 2 kilos of beef

626
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,627
in the middle of the night?

627
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,629
What are you, thieves?
The "Lupin of Meat"?

628
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,590
Who are you calling thieves?
That's just wrong.

629
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,136
I saw the meat, and my hands
just instinctively grabbed it.

630
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,179
And that's what thieves do.

631
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,223
Taking what belongs to others
without a word.

632
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,058
We didn't eat any meat.

633
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,309
Didn't you bring home beer?

634
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,437
Yes, of course!

635
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,063
You bought beer home last night.

636
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,442
So what if I was thirsty and took a sip?

637
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,069
Does that give you the right
to give me an earful?

638
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,529
Unbelievable.

639
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,823
I'll keep my hands off
whatever you bring home.

640
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,076
Don't you feel bad for Bom?

641
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,453
She had gigs all day yesterday

642
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,038
and got an early morning shift,
so I wanted to grill her some meat.

643
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,832
But you went and ate it all.

644
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,126
And you call yourself her aunt?

645
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,878
Shouldn't a cousin be more caring?

646
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,838
Was the beef meant for Bom?

647
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,339
I had no idea.

648
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,508
But if I'm being honest,

649
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,510
Gyu-ri had most of it.

650
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,638
You should've seen her stuff herself.
She's pale from eating so much.

651
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,348
It's actually true.

652
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,352
Do you have indigestion?
Why have you been zoning out?

653
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,315
- So what?
- Gosh.

654
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,774
I already ate it!

655
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,027
Do you want me to throw it up?

656
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,696
I'll keep on eating
whatever's meant for Bom.

657
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,324
Goodness.

658
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,287
Is she for real?

659
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,499
Why isn't Gyu-ri working part-time?

660
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,876
Why is only Bom providing for the family?

661
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,586
What about you? How is this fair?

662
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,006
"Those who don't work shouldn't eat."
You don't know that?

663
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,133
Of course, I'd like to get a job.

664
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,177
But Bom keeps insisting that I don't.

665
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,847
She says staying put and not causing
trouble is the way to help her.

666
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,225
I'm dying to be out and about too.

667
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,351
Then do so.

668
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,561
- Where?
- Ms. Kim. Can you drive?

669
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,356
I don't own a car, but I'm licensed
to drive trucks and buses.

670
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,774
And you know how to take photos.

671
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,651
I'm incredible at it.

672
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,486
Back in high school,
I was the vice president

673
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,238
of Shin Seung-hun's Seoul fan club.

674
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,156
I used to be a WM.

675
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,659
- What's a WM?
- A website manager.

676
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,745
They follow celebrities around
and post the photos they take online.

677
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,706
Every famous celebrity has
a website manager with them

678
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,832
wherever they go.

679
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,169
- It's settled, then.
- What?

680
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,420
Ms. Kim Ja-young.

681
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,966
- You've been hired.
- As what?

682
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,926
You just got a job as TWO SAGYE's WM.

683
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,844
- Me?
- Let's go.

684
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,721
Website managers need good equipment,

685
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,140
so let me spend some money on you.

686
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,892
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

687
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,852
Ms. Kim, a camera should be black.

688
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,938
That's too gloomy.
What about this white one?

689
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,106
- I want this.
- You're clueless.

690
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,899
The key to a camera is the lens.

691
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,442
- The lens?
- You must have the right one.

692
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,819
Can I get the longest one?

693
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,195
Absolutely. How much is this?

694
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,530
That looks like a thermos.

695
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,323
A thermos? What a joke.

696
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,409
- But--
- What? Do we drink from it?

697
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,997
Guys, are you going to buy that?

698
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,583
- Get going.
- Hold on.

699
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,668
Come back when you're ready to purchase.

700
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,752
We're

701
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,920
- buying.
- Buying!

702
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,046
Unbelievable.

703
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,548
- Move.
- What do you take us for?

704
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,383
Here you go.

705
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,135
Thank you.

706
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,553
You're amazing!

707
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,679
Applause!

708
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,265
I'll start practicing.

709
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,934
- Start watching videos and practice.
- Got it.

710
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,061
We want the fastest.

711
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,646
Nonsense. The coolest.

712
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,231
No, the one with the best value.

713
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,983
The best value. You know what I'm saying?

714
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,239
Jin-gu, Ms. Kim, over here.

715
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,325
I found the perfect vehicle for us.

716
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,161
What do you think?

717
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,830
- This van?
- Yes.

718
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,832
Sweet, right?

719
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,756
Ms. Kim!

720
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,507
Ms. Kim, wait!

721
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,551
- What…
- Ms. Kim, please.

722
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,761
Stop!

723
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,015
Even though it's a used car,

724
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,184
he chose a van
with the best upgrades and features.

725
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,436
He also bought a high-end camera
worth over ten million won.

726
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,730
It was fully paid in cash.

727
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,690
In cash?

728
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,610
He still has some money left?

729
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,820
He seemed to have a lot of money
in his suitcase.

730
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,577
Didn't I say that I didn't want to see you
for the time being?

731
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,538
Did you think you could fake loyalty
with a few lousy photos?

732
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,208
Sir, please let me make it up to you.

733
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,918
I won't make another mistake.

734
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,253
The car seemed too nice to scrap.

735
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,714
Clearly, I wasn't thinking straight.

736
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,175
It's been going on for six years!

737
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,177
How could you have kept the car
all this time?

738
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,681
On top of that,
you told people it had water damage?

739
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,476
Just how many times
have you ignored my orders?

740
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,645
I swear it only happened that one time.

741
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,189
I made a terrible mistake, sir.

742
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,693
So? Did you actually
have it scrapped this time?

743
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,861
Yes, sir.

744
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,530
I took it to the junkyard myself

745
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,825
and watched as it was crushed
into a piece of metal.

746
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,326
There's even a video of it.

747
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,204
Please don't let me go, sir.

748
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,374
It's going to take you a long time
to make up for this.

749
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,210
Lay low until I summon you again.

750
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,847
Were you already here?

751
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,974
I got in early myself.

752
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,642
We just ended our practice session.

753
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,311
What? But we were to gather at noon.

754
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,396
Who said so?

755
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,106
Did I say that?

756
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,066
Guess you didn't hear
that the rehearsal is now at 2 p.m.

757
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,485
Anyway, we finished our practice
and are heading out.

758
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,321
Is this even the song…

759
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,074
we're performing today?

760
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,618
Who knows? Sit this one out
if you think you can't do it.

761
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,078
This is childish.

762
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,331
Like it or not, we're in the same band.
Are shows a joke to you?

763
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,376
They aren't,

764
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,879
so step down as leader and get lost.

765
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,338
We don't accept you as a bandmate.

766
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,424
What were you doing
while we spent five years

767
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,717
struggling to reach the top?

768
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,135
Absolutely nothing.

769
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,304
All you did was join
an already successful band.

770
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,454
HANJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

771
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,667
I appreciate you agreeing
to this interview.

772
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,503
Thank you so much.

773
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,007
I hope you say good things
about Hanju University Hospital.

774
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,551
This recent surgery had nothing to do
with the hospital.

775
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,386
Your success was mostly your own.

776
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,014
I'll write a good article
that focuses on you.

777
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,934
That wasn't my intent.

778
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,937
Still, it's rewarding to see
that my patient's prognosis

779
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,605
has been positive after the surgery.

780
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,608
Your son joined The Crown
as its newest member.

781
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,776
Congratulations.

782
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,946
If you need promotional content,
I could include a family photo.

783
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,281
Goodness, Ms. Hong.

784
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,950
That's really not necessary.

785
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,494
Hold on. Let me see
if I have a decent photo.

786
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,956
I actually have a few right here.

787
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,416
Would these work?

788
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,210
Goodness me.

789
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,170
The two of you look so close.

790
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,214
You seem like a great father.

791
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,966
Gosh, I'm hardly one.

792
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,636
You know better than anyone that I spend
most of my time in the hospital.

793
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,555
I don't interfere in my son's life.

794
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,098
Instead, with these hands,

795
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,018
I hope to be a doctor
who continues to save lives.

796
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:39,022
Wouldn't that be the best gift
a father could give his son?

797
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,281
What the hell?

798
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,503
You…

799
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,631
Don't just stand there.
Let's get to rehearsal.

800
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,305
I felt uncomfortable riding
in the same van anyway,

801
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,681
so I appreciate it.

802
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,474
I wondered if I should
a few times to be polite.

803
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,478
What the hell?

804
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,275
- Over here. Seo Tae-yang, over here!
- Tae-yang!

805
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,860
- It's him.
- Yes, just like that.

806
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,653
- That brand looks great on you.
- Seo Tae-yang!

807
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,948
- I love it. Nice.
- That's great.

808
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,366
Can you look this way too?

809
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,035
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

810
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,578
- Coming through.
- Amazing outfit.

811
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,538
- Excuse us.
- We're coming through.

812
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,832
- Please let us through.
- Coming through!

813
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,710
Director Seo,

814
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,129
I have something to report.

815
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,923
- Later. I need a break.
- It's urgent.

816
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,593
Ms. Kim Bok-rye just passed away.

817
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,225
She died?

818
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,062
I believe we missed
the critical window for her surgery.

819
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,818
Her chances of survival were slim anyway.

820
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,029
I only agreed to the surgery
as a humanitarian effort

821
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,573
to help the poor woman.
There's no need to feel guilty.

822
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,368
The problem is that Ms. Kim
was a prominent figure in Suncheon.

823
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,329
People looking to arrange the funeral
are on their way to the hospital.

824
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,622
What are you talking about?

825
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,374
You said she lived alone
without any family.

826
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,958
She doesn't have any family,

827
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,921
but many people
have received financial aid from her.

828
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,131
She even left behind an inheritance
of over 60 billion won.

829
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,467
Sixty billion won?

830
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,470
In her will and testament,
she said she's leaving everything

831
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,971
to Hanju University Hospital.

832
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,682
Are you sure about this?

833
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,935
Reporters have already gotten wind of it
and have been calling.

834
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,897
What should we do if they find out
that we postponed her surgery?

835
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,194
We'll begin the rehearsal for The Crown.

836
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,331
<i>Your eyes are always somewhere else</i>
<i>Never on me</i>

837
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,251
<i>But still, I am always here for you</i>

838
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,296
<i>Why can't I be the one you love?</i>

839
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,805
<i>Only until then will I give it my all</i>

840
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,851
<i>I'll hold out, even if it's just for a day</i>

841
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,196
<i>See you later</i>

842
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,079
Thank you.

843
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,919
Your childish antics end here.

844
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,506
Unless you're as good as I am,
I suggest that you follow my lead.

845
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,300
No matter what song you play,

846
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,427
I'll be able to keep up.

847
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,102
<i>His voice has a power</i>
<i>that can rival Sa Gye's.</i>

848
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,563
<i>Visually striking and skilled</i>
<i>on the guitar. He's perfect.</i>

849
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,273
<i>He might</i>

850
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,567
<i>even overshadow Sa Gye.</i>

851
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,029
These are articles about Seo Tae-yang
that will be released tomorrow.

852
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,281
Before they are posted online,

853
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,867
we will review each
and every one of them carefully.

854
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,787
Articles that could tarnish
our artist's image

855
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,705
will be sent back for revision,

856
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,832
so review them thoroughly.

857
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,083
- Got it.
- Understood.

858
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,210
Go, team.

00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,640
HIS SON IS STUDYING
IN THE PRE-MEDICAL PROGRAM

863
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,724
AT HANJU UNIVERSITY

864
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,482
<i>Isn't this…</i>

865
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,484
<i>the same SUV from before?</i>

866
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,861
<i>Isn't that Mr. Kang's wife?</i>

867
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,113
<i>Check out that fancy car.</i>
<i>It looks expensive.</i>

868
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,575
<i>Was the SUV Director Seo's?</i>

869
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,205
CUT

870
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,543
CEO JO

871
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,552
Sa Gye bought a high-end camera
and even a van.

872
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,137
This means he'll get down to business
and take on real gigs.

873
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,391
I have no idea what he's scheming.

874
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,726
Haven't we blocked all their gigs?

875
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,772
Well, SBN's Reporter Han
has been helping him.

876
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,025
He's been arranging unpaid gigs for them.

877
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,110
Unpaid gigs?

878
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,863
How's that even possible?
What money could Sa Gye have left?

879
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,408
Didn't he leave the company penniless
after paying the cancellation fee?

880
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,287
I felt bad for him,
so I gave him some money.

881
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,791
No wonder he's still on his high horse.

882
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:54,462
He bought a car using the company's money
and has been funding his gigs with it!

883
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,299
That's how he's still been running wild.

884
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,010
Go get that money back right now.

885
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:01,928
Sorry?

886
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,806
We need to stop that cheeky clown
and keep him in check!

887
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,226
Brats like him need to struggle
to afford food and gas

888
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,853
in order to come to their senses.

889
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,396
That…

890
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,774
I can't do that.

891
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,819
- You can't?
- Sa Gye has already lost a lot.

892
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:21,114
He's desperately floundering
in an attempt to make a comeback.

893
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,658
I don't get why you must take it this far.

894
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,704
Does he seem like
he's floundering desperately to you?

895
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,290
He's coming after me like a madman.

896
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,044
If I don't take him down,
he'll end up crushing me.

897
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,004
Why would he be after you?

898
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,300
He's not the kind of person
who would harm anyone.

899
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,845
If Sa Gye releases an album
under TWO SAGYE

900
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,805
and regains popularity and influence,

901
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,600
Jo & Jo will suffer an irreversible blow.

902
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,187
To save Jo & Jo,

903
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,564
he must never set foot
in this industry again.

904
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,070
No way. I can't do that.

905
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,824
I won't tell Sa Gye that I saw the SUV.

906
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,952
You can trust me on that.

907
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,495
I'm sorry, sir.

908
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,830
I'll understand if you fire me.

909
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,251
If you take care of this matter,
you will be compensated for your troubles.

910
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,588
I could even
promote you to chief director.

911
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:19,756
I'm not interested.

912
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,592
I'm even looking to buy
an apartment unit in your name.

913
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,469
I'd rather live without an apartment

914
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,596
than live with guilt.

915
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,516
How about five percent
of Jo & Jo's shares?

916
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,143
I'll give you five percent.

917
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,728
With that,

918
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,690
you'll be able to buy more
than a few buildings in Gangnam.

919
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,024
You'll have enough money

920
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,403
to support your family for generations
without working.

921
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,154
Jo & Jo

922
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,574
is your first ever workplace.

923
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,120
Don't you want to stand with me
to protect Jo & Jo?

924
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,501
This is a dump.

925
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,961
Just kill me already.

926
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,255
So much for looking decent.
It's a clunker.

927
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,258
I've been rubbing and scrubbing,
but it's still filthy.

928
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,052
A clunker, you say?
Don't say that to our Bom-bom Car.

929
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,887
Bom-bom Car, my ass.

930
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,014
- What?
- By the way,

931
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,807
why have we been doing all the cleaning?

932
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,142
Get rubbing too.

933
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,102
Those who enjoyed the meat
have the energy.

934
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,396
Not me though.
I've only been fed an earful.

935
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,274
You bring up the beef every ten minutes,
especially when cornered.

936
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,234
Starting today, I'm going vegan.

937
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,361
All right, guys. Keep it up.

938
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,072
We'll be travel around in this,
performing all across the country.

939
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,824
It should be as shiny as a new van.

940
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,704
Jin-gu, use a handheld vacuum
to clean the inside.

941
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,205
I can still see the dust.

942
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,041
- Where? Here?
- Yes.

943
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,250
Clean every inch.

944
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,086
- Sure.
- Dust the floor mats as well.

945
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,049
Hey! Stop bossing me around.

946
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,968
I can't take this anymore.
Do you even have any gigs booked for us?

947
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,429
What if we bought all of this for nothing?

948
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,972
Don't worry about that.

949
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,099
I have us fully booked for a month.

950
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,435
- A month?
- Already? For a month?

951
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,520
- Yes.
- No way!

952
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,814
You will pay me, right?
You promised a monthly salary.

953
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,777
If you make me work for free
since I'm family, I'll call the cops.

954
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,321
Just make sure to cover living expenses
once you get paid.

955
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,947
Stop mooching off Bom.

956
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,741
When did I ever mooch off her?

957
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:12,160
The payments we get
will be split evenly, right?

958
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,787
You don't get extra because you invested.

959
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,663
I hear you, okay?

960
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,333
But if you don't work hard,
I'll fire you both.

961
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,876
Go!

962
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,838
Gosh, it's freezing.

963
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,424
When will Bom be back?
I wanted to give her a ride.

964
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,552
A ride?

965
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,764
I should call her.

966
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,558
I'll do it.

967
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,186
I was just about to call her anyway.

968
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,690
It's me. Where are you?

969
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,485
- Why are you at a department store?
- What?

970
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,487
- Is she at a department store?
- Yes, working.

971
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,656
What are you saying? I'm at our studio.

972
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,907
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

973
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,617
- No!
- What do you mean?

974
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,577
Mom wants something
from the department store.

975
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,704
Yes, pajamas.

976
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,290
- Pajamas?
- She needs them tonight to help her sleep.

977
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,334
Apparently, they're made
with quality cotton.

978
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:05,797
Since you're there, can you pick up
a blusher, mascara, and lip gloss for me?

979
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,090
You'll be late?

980
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,675
That's too bad.

981
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,720
What the hell was that?

982
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:16,182
Bom has a shift at the department store
and will be home late.

983
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,809
There's team dinner, too.

984
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,312
- A part-timer goes to a team dinner?
- I don't know.

985
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,649
That being said, is Bom the one
you have to give a ride to?

986
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,942
Can't you give me one instead?

987
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,027
No. I can't.

988
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,993
Give me a ride instead!

989
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,495
Let it be me!

990
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,623
Take me on a drive!

991
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,128
Hey, Gyu-ri. Calm down, will you?
When Bom gets home--

992
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,463
No!

993
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,714
Today!

994
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,132
Right this moment!

995
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,887
Only give me a ride in the van!

996
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,516
Would it kill you
to give me what I want for once?

997
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,019
I thought your fans always came first!

998
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:04,355
Why can't it be me?

999
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,444
Yes! Step on it. Honk, honk.

1000
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,949
Gyu-ri, we've been driving around
for about 30 minutes.

1001
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,159
So?

1002
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,702
Well…

1003
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,914
- It wasn't enough!
- Exactly!

1004
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,417
It should be at least an hour.
Let's go, Bom-bom Car!

1005
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,926
I told you not to call it Bom-bom Car.

1006
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,096
I said no such thing.

1007
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,973
Maybe you heard wrong.

1008
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,809
I clearly said Bung-bung Car.

1009
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,276
- Gyu-ri.
- Please…

1010
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,571
don't say anything.

1011
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,491
Just for a while.

1012
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,954
Let's stay like this.

1013
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,878
I can't see the side-view mirror.

1014
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,630
I'm good now.

1015
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,342
<i>You jerk.</i>

1016
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,177
<i>You prick.</i>

1017
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,180
<i>I devoted my teen years to you.</i>

1018
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,308
<i>Yet, you think</i>
<i>even this is a waste of your time.</i>

1019
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,060
<i>All you care about is Bom.</i>

1020
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,687
<i>You're crazy about Bom!</i>

1021
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,939
<i>How could you?</i>

1022
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,274
<i>How could you?</i>

1023
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,652
What are you doing?

1024
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,945
Why are you getting out?

1025
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,238
I'm done being your fan.

1026
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,282
I'm done!

1027
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,741
I'm now off

1028
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,744
to find true love for myself.

1029
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,455
Wait. Where are you going?

1030
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,419
I loved you, SAGYE.

1031
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,921
A whole lot.

1032
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,300
Why does she suddenly want
department store pajamas?

1033
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,426
