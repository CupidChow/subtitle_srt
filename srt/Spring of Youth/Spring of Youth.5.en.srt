00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,596
Mom.

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,682
I won first place.

5
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,518
- <i>I won the grand prize in the contest.</i>
- Really?

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,437
That's amazing. I'm so proud of you!

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>This is amazing. You're the best!</i>

8
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,274
Bravo!

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,319
This is why I said I'd fly out to the US.

10
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,904
Like that would've been possible.

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>What do you mean?</i>

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,532
I even booked a flight,
but you canceled it.

13
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,286
No one was there to give you
flowers on your big day!

14
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,829
It's upsetting.

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,790
I'll be in Korea for the school break.

16
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,458
You'll see me soon.

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,210
<i>Are you still out, Mom?</i>

18
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,629
Yes, I'm on my way home.

19
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,589
<i>I stayed back to sort out the books.</i>

20
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,299
I don't think I told you this,

21
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>but the CEO of Choijin Group's daughter</i>
<i>attends my school.</i>

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,472
So cool, right?
She's beautiful and also loaded.

23
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>She'll be attending winter school</i>
<i>during the break.</i>

24
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,060
Can I go, too?

25
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,687
I won't get to see you as much, then.

26
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,482
Winter break is long,
and we'll see plenty of each other.

27
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,068
<i>But I want to be her friend.</i>
<i>Can I please go?</i>

28
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,237
I really want to go.

29
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,447
All right, fine. You can go.

30
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,825
You can do whatever you want.

31
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,077
Mom, I love you so much!

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,620
I love you, my daughter.

33
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,459
Bom-bom, it looks like a blackout.

34
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,169
So scary. What's up with this weather?

35
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,881
What's wrong with that car?

36
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,235
Mom?

37
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,200
Mom?

38
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,827
Mom, what's going on?

39
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,288
Answer me, Mom.

40
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,165
Mom, can you hear me?

41
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,709
<i>Mom…</i>

42
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,378
<i>Mom.</i>

43
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,672
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Help.

44
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,382
<i>Answer me, Mom!</i>

45
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,594
Please help me.

Bom.

49
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,088
Mom?

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,965
Why did you send me away?

51
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,802
I could've lived, you know.

52
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,806
You should've waited one more day.

53
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,772
What am I supposed to do now…

54
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,818
when I want to see you?

55
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,125
Mom…

56
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,391
Mom!

57
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,143
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- Bom, no.

58
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,562
Bom, your mom's gone.

59
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,606
My mom. I'm taking it all back!

60
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,984
<i>I'm not donating my mom's organs!</i>

61
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>Mom!</i>

62
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,997
Are you up?

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,712
Why aren't you in bed?

64
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,463
I said I was fine.

65
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,924
You were sleep-talking.
What if you catch a cold?

66
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,555
What about Gye? Is he home?

67
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,181
Did he call?

68
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,101
- He just called.
- What?

69
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,478
What did he say?
Did something happen to him?

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,938
Why didn't he take my calls?

71
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,940
He drank with a friend and passed out.

72
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,191
He must've been wasted.

73
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,943
I told you he'd be fine.

74
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,653
You worried over nothing.

75
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,739
Now, relax and get some sleep.

76
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,801
Gye?

77
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,679
Hold on. When did you get here?

78
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,223
Hey.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,310
Why did you have so much to drink?

80
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
Pull yourself together. What's going on?

81
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,314
Seung-su.

82
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,402
Can I crash here tonight?

83
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,124
What happened to me?

84
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,250
Don't ask me.

85
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,419
All I did was let a drunk
crash on my couch.

86
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,094
Come and settle your stomach.

87
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,846
I made a hot soup
with kimchi and bean sprouts.

88
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,267
No, I don't feel like eating.

89
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,646
Seung-su, can I crash here
for a few more days?

90
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,356
- You don't mind, do you?
- No.

91
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,399
I'll be back.

92
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,818
Hey, Gye!

93
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,236
Where are you going?

94
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,409
KIM BOM

95
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,121
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>
<i>You will be redirected to voicemail…</i>

96
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,414
Why haven't I seen Gye today?

97
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,166
Is he upset over a few chores?

98
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,460
SAGYE didn't come home last night, did he?

99
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,006
He wasn't answering my calls, either.

100
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,717
He should've at least called me
of all people.

101
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,344
Did he stay out all night?

102
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,805
When one crawls back home,
the other doesn't.

103
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,723
What is this? An inn?

104
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,352
Just so you know, staying out all night
doesn't get you a rent discount.

105
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,396
Could his fans have kidnapped him?

106
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,691
I don't know who you get it from,
but you say the wildest things.

107
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,651
I think I know what this is about.

108
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,697
Yesterday, he was acting strange.

109
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,700
He came to me
asking when this house was built

110
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,784
and about Bom's…

111
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,580
He asked when Bom's mother passed away.

112
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,747
Why would he ask that?

113
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,791
He thinks he's too good for this house.

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,461
It sounded like he didn't want to
live in a dead woman's house.

115
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,546
Does he believe in ghosts or something?

116
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,631
Don't be ridiculous. SAGYE was baptized.

117
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,341
- He was baptized?
- Yes.

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,179
Anyway, would he want to live here
after his fans cleaned us out?

119
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,431
I'd leave if I were him.
He has the money to do it.

120
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,476
He only moved in here to slum it for fun.

121
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,022
With SAGYE gone, I've lost my appetite.

122
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,984
Says the one who had three bowls of rice.

123
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,445
If you had your appetite,
we'd have to call the rice police.

124
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,281
Mom! You complain when I don't eat
and again when I eat too much.

125
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,074
Do you hate me? I'm your daughter!

126
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,826
You deserve it the least.

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,746
You're the only one in this house
who eats for free!

128
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,499
Still, it beats having
both Dad and me freeload.

129
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,136
Here you go.

DATE OF CORNEAL TRANSPLANT
OCTOBER 12TH, 2019

132
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,397
Could I perhaps find out
who the donor was?

133
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,732
Or maybe where they live.

134
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,234
Please.

135
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,362
Hospital policy would forbid that.
And we do not know, either.

136
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,906
Got it.

137
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,417
Move. Emergency patient!

138
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,253
Move!

139
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,463
- You'll be okay.
- Out of the way.

140
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,442
Mom, I'm sorry!

141
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,944
Don't kill my mom!

142
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,697
I'm not donating my mom's organs!

143
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,031
Mom!

144
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,326
- Oh, dear.
- Mom!

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,579
Mom!

146
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,877
<i>Gye, a donor cornea has become available.</i>

147
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,297
Mom, is that true?
Will I be able to see again?

148
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,756
You'll be fine now.

149
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,426
My Lord, thank you so much.

150
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,013
Gye, this is incredible news!

151
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,097
Congratulations.

152
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,516
- Donations don't usually happen this fast.
- Right.

153
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

154
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,935
<i>- You're lucky.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

155
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,395
<i>You must be over the moon.</i>

156
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,648
<i>Goodness.</i>
<i>Can you be any luckier?</i>

157
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,984
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

158
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,694

<i>Where do I even begin?</i>

172
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,016
<i>Do I tell Bom what I know?</i>

173
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,560
<i>That it was Mr. Jo who killed her mom?</i>

174
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,104
<i>How would I prove it, though?</i>

175
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,148
<i>That I saw it through her mom's eyes?</i>

<i>Sa Gye was just at the accident site</i>
<i>in Mahyeong-dong.</i>

180
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,970
Are you sure?

181
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,430
I'm sure. It was him.

182
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,598
<i>We need a plan.</i>

183
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,851
He might bring us down
if we just sit still.

184
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,769
<i>All right, fine.</i>

185
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,396
I'm in a meeting right now,

186
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,565
so I'll call you back later.

187
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,618
Unfortunately, we'll have to delay

188
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,621
- the release.
- I said that wasn't an option!

189
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,582
The world tour must take place as planned.

190
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,834
If we lose people's trust,
it'll be all over.

191
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,003
Don't you know how cruel
this industry can be?

192
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,924
What did the members say?

193
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,261
They don't have a leader yet,
so they haven't voiced their opinion.

194
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,389
They can't think if there's no leader?

195
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,687
<i>Have you been well? This is Jo Ji-na.</i>

196
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,190
Hello, how have you been?

197
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,816
You're still writing songs, right?

198
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,569
If you're selling,
I'm willing to offer top dollar.

199
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,612
BOM'S

200
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,740
I don't have any.

201
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,408
You don't?

202
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,203
No. Besides, I won't be selling
my songs anymore.

203
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,665
I'll be producing them myself.

204
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,334
Is that so?

205
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,544
What a shame.

206
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,380
No matter how good your songs are,

207
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,342
<i>it'd be hard find success</i>
<i>without a big agency's support.</i>

208
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,594
Have you decided on an artist
for your song?

209
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,554
- Yes.
<i>- Already?</i>

210
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,098
I hope that artist isn't SAGYE.

211
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,351
I'm sorry, but I'm late for my class.

212
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,977
We'll talk later.

213
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,246
This is the first song I've written.

214
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,873
Would you take a look?

215
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,886
You… wrote this?

216
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,349
Yes. I worked on it to refine my skills.

217
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,101
What do you think?

218
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,354
It may need to be arranged quite a lot,
but it could work as the title track.

219
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,314
Why didn't you show this to me sooner?

220
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,526
Even its hook is catchier
than the one we had.

221
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,612
Get me the A&R Team this instant!

222
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,738
Yes, sir.

223
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,829
Detective! Hello, sir.

224
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,664
A witness?

225
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,000
How can a witness show up after six years?

226
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,295
They said the car had skidded in the rain
and flipped over.

227
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,838
Is that wrong? Did someone see something?

228
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,382
Auntie, breathe.
Let's hear what he has to say.

229
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,468
It happened long ago, so we're
checking the case file again.

230
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,389
It happened on the night of the blackout
caused by Typhoon Lucy.

231
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,058
- That's right.
- The security cameras were down,

232
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,103
and a shelter-in-place order was issued,
leaving no witnesses.

233
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,187
Right.

234
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,440
But someone claims
to have seen the accident.

235
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,733
No way.

236
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,235
And who's that?

237
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,362
<i>He's on his way here.</i>

238
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,447
<i>He'll arrive soon.</i>

239
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,658
Bom, my gosh.

240
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,713
POLICE

241
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,179
<i>Could I call myself a witness?</i>

242
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,723
<i>Should I say I saw it in my dreams?</i>

243
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,225
<i>But what proof do I have?</i>

244
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,812
<i>What if nothing is uncovered</i>
<i>even after I come forward?</i>

245
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,150
<i>What if I end up hurting Bom?</i>

246
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,654
<i>What if this puts Bom in danger?</i>

247
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,323
What did the witness see?

248
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,369
That an SUV swerved across the center line
and crashed into the victim's car.

249
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,037
Then, the SUV fled the scene.

250
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,748
A hit-and-run? Are you kidding me?

251
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,209
That's right.
I remember there being another car.

252
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,587
Before the accident, my mom mentioned
a reckless car on the road.

253
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,465
The victim's car burned down,
so there's no evidence.

254
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,177
Why won't you believe what she's saying?

255
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,554
Her mom couldn't have caused
this accident on her own.

256
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,473
She never even got
a speeding ticket. Right?

257
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,309
She'd drive safely even down a ski slope.

258
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,477
Lady!

259
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,271
Nowadays, the police
no longer sleep on cases.

260
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,608
If another vehicle was involved,
there would've been some kind of evidence.

261
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,527
The case was closed
because there was no evidence.

262
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,030
How dare you blame us
for not investigating properly?

263
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,616
That wasn't what I meant.

264
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,160
I always respect the police.

265
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,954
You're doing a difficult job.

266
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,500
Why did the witness wait until now
to come forward?

267
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,212
Well, the witness's statement
wasn't credible to begin with.

268
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,089
He said he was 14 at the time,

269
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,215
but he seemed confused

270
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,552
about whether he saw it in person
or just in his dreams.

271
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,430
He couldn't even explain
what he was doing outside at 5 a.m.

272
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,182
- Detective Min?
- Fine, I'll be there shortly!

273
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,893
- Could we get his contact information?
- Right.

274
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,396
He called from a pay phone. Just a second.

275
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,696
<i>It must've been a fake tip-off.</i>

276
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,033
<i>He got scared</i>
<i>when asked to give a statement in person.</i>

277
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,703
I knew something wasn't right.

278
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,747
We put up a banner for a year,

279
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,083
hoping to find a witness
but to no avail. Darn.

280
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,960
Why the long face?

281
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,754
This is for the best.

282
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,215
A hit-and-run? Just the idea of that
made my heart sink.

283
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,926
I'm sorry I put you through this.

284
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,137
Are you heading home?

285
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,347
Yes, I'm completely fried.

286
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,933
I wouldn't even have the energy
to go to Hawaii for free.

287
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,060
What about you?

288
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,644
I have to get to work.

289
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,271
I'll take the subway from here.

290
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,857
Just take the day off.
It's hardly worth it.

291
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,984
My mind wanders when I have nothing to do.

292
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,448
- What's this?
- Take a cab home.

293
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,574
See you at home.

294
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,618
But…

295
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,122
How is she caring about my cab fare
when she must be shaken up herself?

296
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,541
Unbelievable.

297
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,252
I'm so darn upset.

298
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,713
Why would anyone lie
about something like this?

299
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,965
I hope birds poop on your head!

300
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,647
Why are you here again?

301
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,066
Would you rather see me
drop out of school?

302
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,527
Threaten me all you want.
I won't move back home.

303
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,323
There's something I need to tell you.

304
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,285
It won't take long.

305
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,005
I always hoped to pass down
these medical books

306
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,800
my father gave me.

307
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,719
I wanted you to become a skilled doctor.

308
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,515
But now I see that I was being selfish.

309
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,979
Drop out of university
if that's what you want.

310
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,732
You win.

311
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,111
You may drop out of med school.

312
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,572
After you moved out,

313
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,782
I gave it a lot of thought.

314
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,871
What could be the best decision
I could make as your father?

315
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm sorry for overlooking…

316
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,501
what you wanted.

317
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,047
Do you mean that?

318
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,176
Your mother's gone,

319
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,596
and you're all that I have.

320
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,350
If I lose you too…

321
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,646
the whole doctor thing
would be meaningless.

322
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,068
If you want to do music…

323
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,488
If that's your dream, chase it.

324
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,657
But do it properly

325
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,785
rather than wasting time in a school band.

326
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,581
Sign with a major music agency,
receive proper support,

327
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,249
and reach the top in that field.

328
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,878
Don't waste even a second of your life.

329
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,923
Then, I'll support you wholeheartedly.

330
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,926
You're allowing me

331
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,386
to play in a band?

332
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,140
You said so yourself.

333
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,017
That your mom

334
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,020
was the happiest when she was on stage.

335
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,940
All I wish for is your happiness.

336
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,900
That's all I want.

337
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,245
I own a substantial share
in Jo & Jo Entertainment.

338
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,041
The Crown is looking for a new member.

339
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,671
You'll be warmly welcomed
if you join the band.

340
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,924
Are you suggesting

341
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,802
I take over SAGYE's spot?

342
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,304
Why not?

343
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,306
Had I not objected initially,

344
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,017
you would've become
the first member of The Crown.

345
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,229
That was ages ago.

346
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,532
I like the band I'm in now.

347
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,033
I'm not planning to leave,

348
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,077
and I definitely don't want
to replace SAGYE.

349
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,788
You'll be taking the spot
that was originally yours.

350
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,123
His position in the band

351
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,000
was supposed to be yours.

352
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,214
BLIND AUDITIONS

353
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,596
That's all I have prepared. Thank you.

354
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,557
Good job.

355
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,350
Next please.

356
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,436
Hello, I'm Performer Number 35.

357
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,479
Please begin.

358
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,552
That's all. Thank you.

359
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,928
Roll up the blind.

360
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,687
Hello, I'm Number 35, Seo Tae-yang.

361
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,982
It's an honor to audition
to be a trainee for The Crown.

362
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,277
I'm confident in my skills
as a vocalist and lead guitarist.

363
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,404
You're Tae-yang, aren't you?

364
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,198
Dr. Seo's son.

365
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,242
It was purely your talent

366
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,412
that got you through that audition.

367
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,538
You came out on top.

368
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,373
If you hadn't backed out,

369
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,584
Sa Gye wouldn't have been able
to join The Crown.

370
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,629
He was chosen last
to take over the position that was yours.

371
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,756
I have nothing more to say.

372
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,716
Goodbye.

373
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,260
Tae-yang.

374
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,972
Tae-yang.

375
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,438
He'll come around.

376
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,111
Unbelievable.

377
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,321
I'm here, okay?

378
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,240
<i>You and that temper of yours.</i>

379
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,741
<i>Bom's feeling down today,</i>

380
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,828
<i>so make sure she has a great time</i>
<i>to distract her. Got it?</i>

381
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,454
<i>Buy her something tasty too.</i>

382
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,206
She's not a kid, is she?

383
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,208
Who am I, her babysitter?

384
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,919
I'm feeling like poo too
because I haven't seen SAGYE all day!

385
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,879
Are you my mom or hers?

386
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,888
Please place your basket on the counter.

387
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,144
What is all this?

388
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,646
Why do you need so much makeup products?

389
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,523
I'm Bae Gyu-ri.

390
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,943
The Bae Gyu-ri who won't even take out
the trash without falsies.

391
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,988
How's this? It has a matte finish.

392
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,072
Gosh, no way!

393
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,741
I definitely look better with glossy lips.

394
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,827
So, are you buying or not?

395
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,246
- Will you test all 100?
- Here, you try.

396
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,123
And get fired for it?

397
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,457
There are cameras everywhere.

398
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,168
No one's here, so who cares?

399
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,506
Even men apply makeup these days.
A 20-year-old girl should look better.

400
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,508
Are you kidding me? It's so pretty!

401
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,510
Your lips are calling for a kiss!

402
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,761
Whatever.

403
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,807
Of course. It's not like
you've ever been kissed before.

404
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,809
Your lips are dry from a lack of love.

405
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,645
Of course, I've been kissed before.
What do you know?

406
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,273
Wait. Have you kissed someone?

407
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,900
Who?

408
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,193
Some AI-generated guy?

409
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,737
Where did you two meet? In the metaverse?

410
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,374
Hey. Try this on, too.

411
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,961
- That's enough.
- This has a brighter color.

412
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,007
All the shopping makes me hungry.
What should we have?

413
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,593
I was going to say that dinner's on me,

414
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,428
but I spent all my money.
You have some, right?

415
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,846
I don't.

416
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,139
You must've been paid.

417
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,183
Bom, when you're feeling down,

418
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,685
head straight for beef. I'd like sirloin.

419
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,729
I haven't had any in forever.

420
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,439
Well, it's been longer for me.

421
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,732
You're so heartless.

422
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,943
What do you say to bagels, then?

423
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,112
This place has been blowing up
on social media lately.

424
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,489
You've never been, right?

425
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,741
Still. Wasn't it fun in a way?

426
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,825
We got to chat,

427
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,953
smell baked goods,

428
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,372
and hold hands.

429
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,212
Come on. You can at least
get me this much.

430
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,631
You're buying, okay?

431
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,635
<i>I'm now terrified to see you</i>

432
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,136
<i>through these eyes.</i>

433
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,432
<i>How could I possibly</i>
<i>make my way back to you?</i>

434
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,184
Let's do this.

435
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,728
<i>Oh, you know</i>

436
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,232
<i>I'll never say goodbye, just see you later</i>

437
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,568
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

438
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

439
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,491
<i>Say "I'll see you later"</i>

440
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,703
<i>Tell me it's never really bye, bye, bye</i>

441
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,956
<i>Where'd you go with my love</i>
<i>Where'd you go with my heart, yeah</i>

442
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,167
<i>I need all of your worth</i>
<i>I need all of your love</i>

443
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,546
<i>A love darkened, eclipsing the light</i>
<i>Where you're gone</i>

444
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,924
<i>The cherished memories now</i>
<i>Love is gone</i>

445
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,470
<i>Your eyes are always somewhere else</i>
<i>Never on me</i>

446
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,807
<i>But still, I am always here for you</i>

447
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,103
<i>Why can't I be the one you love?</i>

448
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,313
<i>Oh, you know</i>

449
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,356
<i>I'll never say goodbye</i>

450
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,108
What do you think? Good, right?

451
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,861
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

452
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,325
Producer Jo, great job all around.

453
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,492
This will be a huge hit.

454
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,661
Make sure the choreography is up to par.

455
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,996
- Of course.
- Pick up the pace.

456
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,164
- Yes, sir.
- Sure.

457
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,837
Hey, you're here.

458
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,966
It was a full day of recording,
and things have been hectic.

459
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,593
Did it go smoothly?

460
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,887
Yes, this song's hook is far better
than the one we had.

461
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,472
With a little rearrangement

462
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,807
and a music video directed
by the industry's best,

463
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,851
we can flip this setback
into an opportunity.

464
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,564
You said Gye was at the accident site.

465
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,983
Catch your breath first.

466
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,569
Where are you with Sa Gye's replacement?

467
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,156
We'll get to that eventually,
after we release this album.

468
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,532
I'd rather you rush it.

469
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,036
Why? Do you have someone in mind?

470
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,872
My son.

471
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,375
Tae-yang? Is he willing?

472
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,168
I'll make him.

473
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,422
I'll do what I can
to get Tae-yang on board,

474
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,674
so don't fill the leader spot.

475
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,968
His addition to the band

476
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,970
will surely create a buzz.

477
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,767
He's Hanju University Hospital Director's
only son and a med student.

478
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,186
But what changed your mind?

479
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,897
You were adamant about having
a third-generation doctor.

480
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,820
We should follow
the natural order of things.

481
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,447
Now that Sa Gye knows the truth
about that day,

482
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,284
I can't let my son be around them.

483
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,582
But I must ask.

484
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,920
Why was Gye at the accident site?

485
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:38,174
No need to wonder about that.
What's certain is that he has no proof.

486
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,384
How can you be sure?

487
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,763
If he had proof, he'd be blackmailing us.

488
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,141
He remained silent for six years.

489
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,352
What he saw or heard isn't our problem.

490
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,147
We can keep pretending
like nothing happened.

491
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,608
So don't be chicken.

492
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,819
That's as good as losing.

493
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,364
That's easier said than done.

494
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,325
As long as we feign ignorance,

495
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,704
even the biggest problems

496
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,748
will seem trivial.

497
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,128
That's why we worked so hard
to be successful too.

498
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,923
Sure.

SEO TAE-YANG

502
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,783
- Talk.
- <i>You prick!</i>

503
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,075
<i>What the hell?</i>

504
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,870
<i>If you were fine, why didn't you pick up?</i>
<i>What were you doing all day?</i>

505
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,956
Nothing. I had some things
to take care of.

506
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,124
<i>You darn prick.</i>

507
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,336
<i>Do you know how worried Bom was?</i>
<i>All night, she…</i>

508
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,466
<i>Why aren't you coming home?</i>
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

509
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,260
My manager's place.

510
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,888
<i>Was it that hard to tell us that?</i>

511
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,681
<i>Did you think we'd chase you down?</i>

512
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,936
<i>Just so you know, I told Bom</i>
<i>you drank too much and passed out.</i>

513
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,606
Is Bom all right?

514
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,316
<i>If you're worried, check on her yourself.</i>

515
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,859
<i>Or call her this second.</i>

516
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,320
<i>I won't help you</i>
<i>if you mess up like this again.</i>

517
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,876
What were you doing in the dark?

518
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,420
Seung-su.

519
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,634
What if you were the reason
someone's life was miserable?

520
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,178
What would you do?

521
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,306
What? Did you have a nightmare?
Or are you still hungover?

522
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,891
If the truth could hurt them,

523
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,436
is it right to pretend you don't know

524
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,772
and stay in their life?

525
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,902
You must have the right answer.
You're ten years older than me.

526
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,447
You don't have to live longer
to know the answer.

527
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,907
You need to walk away from them.

528
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,452
You can't be around someone
who you caused grief for.

529
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,454
You'll be hurting them all over again.

530
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,458
Of course.

531
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,169
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

532
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,424
Meanwhile, I had to skip meals
and work on new choreography.

533
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,092
It's been hectic.

534
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,011
- Is there an issue?
- Didn't I tell you?

535
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,097
The Crown's new title track
was flagged for plagiarism,

536
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,349
so they had to redo it. It's a real mess.

537
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,019
We could clean up the mess
since the album hadn't dropped.

538
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,187
Otherwise, we would've had
to cancel everything.

539
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,275
I feel bad for Mr. Jo.
He's been totally out of it these days.

540
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,027
Feel bad for him, my ass.

541
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,236
What?

542
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,490
When did you start working at Jo & Jo?

543
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,868
We just celebrated the Foundation Day.

544
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,913
So, six years.
I'm a founding member, you know.

545
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,414
Why do you ask?

546
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,832
Well…

547
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,834
Did Mr. Jo ever…

548
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,003
cause a car accident?

549
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,131
- Was he behind a car accident?
- I'm just asking.

550
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,718
Mr. Kang always drives him around.

551
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,970
I thought Mr. Jo can't drive at all.

552
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,764
Does he even have a license?

553
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,433
Do you remember
what car he had six years back?

554
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,353
I'm not sure.

555
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,980
What was it? He's had so many cars that--

556
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,441
Wasn't it a black or gray SUV?

557
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,154
Actually, I can't remember the color.
I couldn't see because of the lights.

558
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,948
But I did see a roof box.

559
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,326
How could you have seen his car
six years back?

560
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,829
You hadn't even signed with us then.

561
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,748
Are you still hungover?

562
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,253
Could you not ask why
and just confirm what car he had?

563
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,965
I need to know what car
he owned back then.

564
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,633
You can, right?

565
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,678
All right. I'll look into it.

566
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,431
Of course, I can do that much for you.

567
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,812
Is he upset with me?

568
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,983
How so? And why?

569
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,568
How could he ghost me?

570
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,323
Just wait till you show up.
You're done for. I'll totally ignore you.

571
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,416
Good morning. You're up early.

572
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,459
- You seem to be in a good mood.
- What?

573
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,504
Yeah, I feel great.
Great weather, isn't it?

574
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,588
Are you going somewhere?

575
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,716
I'm meeting someone.

576
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,095
You're on a break. Aren't you traveling?

577
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,223
Even when you had hardly any time,
you still flew abroad for shows.

578
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,225
I have to be around for the band.

579
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,770
Oh, right. TWO SAGYE.

580
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,148
We've gone too long without practicing.

581
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,484
Why don't we practice up here
until we're allowed back in the studio?

582
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,820
- On the rooftop?
- Yes.

583
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,406
- Sounds good.
- Exciting!

584
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll announce in the chat
that we're gathering at 5 p.m.

585
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,037
You should call Gye too.

586
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,543
He's been ghosting me.

587
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,920
Leave him be. He must be busy.

588
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,551
I'm on my way to meet him.

589
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,470
Do you want to come too?

590
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,430
Where is he?

591
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,599
I want to go with you.

592
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,330
Hi.

593
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,123
Rat bastard.

594
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,337
Sa Gye, you!

595
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,691
You're fine, so I'll let it slide.

596
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,820
We'll resume band practice
on the rooftop of my house today.

597
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,364
It's at 5 p.m., so don't be late.

598
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,984
I'm

599
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,111
quitting TWO SAGYE.

600
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,866
Why?

601
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,409
It seems lame now,

602
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,870
and I want out.

603
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,000
Is it because

604
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,836
I asked you to sign with me?

605
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,464
You don't have to if you don't want to.

606
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,051
I was never going
to sign a contract with you.

607
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,930
Since I formed this band,

608
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,100
I can break it up, right?

609
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,104
You agreed…

610
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,983
to sing my song.

611
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,320
Why are you doing this?

612
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,739
Like I said, it's gotten boring.

613
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,826
The song is meaningful only to you.

614
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,872
So don't expect me
to show up for practice.

615
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,665
I won't be there.

616
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,375
I'll move out soon too.

617
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,253
Bye.

618
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,707
Didn't I tell you

619
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,418
not to mess with Bom?

620
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,711
She deserves respect!

621
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,381
Didn't you know?

622
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,508
I'm a player.

623
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,676
What?

624
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,179
I hate being in serious relationships.

625
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,766
Isn't this what's best for you?

626
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,353
Shut up.

627
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,982
Did you put together the band
just to have a little fun?

628
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,775
Were you always this irresponsible?

629
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,819
A bastard like you
doesn't deserve to do music.

630
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,404
You don't deserve Bom either!

631
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,490
Don't show your face to her again.

632
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,867
If you do, I'll end you.

633
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,476
Why should I always
take care of the food waste?

634
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,854
I swear she's not my mom.

635
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,235
Sweet ride.

636
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,531
Bae Gyu-ri?

637
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,949
No way. Is that really you?

638
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,202
No, I'm not Gyu-ri. I'm her friend.

639
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,787
Then why'd you come out of her house?

640
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,372
I slept over.

641
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,124
Oh, is that so?

642
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,584
Is Gyu-ri up too?

643
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,461
No, she's asleep. Come back another time.

644
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,047
It's rude to show up at someone's place
early in the morning.

645
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,798
The band's practicing here today,

646
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,469
so I came by for some breakfast.
Can I not?

647
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,346
I've been homeless
since the studio shut down.

648
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,847
Why are you telling me…

649
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,557
Why are you telling me of all people?

650
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,142
Did someone say we offer lodging?

651
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,853
Can't you provide that much
for a bandmate in need?

652
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,522
I heard Gye moved out.

653
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,817
Can't I stay in his room while he's away?

654
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,902
It's fine, right?

655
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,071
Says who?

656
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,572
My mom won't have it.

657
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,492
It'll be fine!

658
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,495
I'm sure Gyu-ri will put in a good word.
You're not her, are you?

659
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,996
What?

660
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,916
Eye booger.

661
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,834
Where are you going, Jin-gu?

662
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,299
My gosh.

663
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,052
Is this Fuji or Hongro?

664
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,012
I personally prefer Aori.

665
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,264
Grab some Aori apples
next time you go grocery shopping.

666
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,101
By the way, I prefer meat over vegetables,

667
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,937
and I must have fried eggs
and grilled fish with every meal.

668
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,063
Do you have hairtail?

669
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,316
What are you doing?

670
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,319
Does this look like a soup kitchen to you?

671
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,823
I'm not taking this for free.
Gye already paid his rent,

672
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,741
so just think that I'm him.

673
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,410
Why should I think that

674
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,578
when you're not Gye?

675
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,164
I never allowed someone like you
to stay with us.

676
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,375
But Tae-yang seems lonely.

677
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,919
The sun has eight friends
in the solar system,

678
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,964
but our Tae-yang
is all alone in that room.

679
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,050
I know, but why is that your concern?

680
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,136
I'm his friend, so of course, I'm worried.

681
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,220
My gosh.

682
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,181
- Jin-gu.
- Gyu-ri!

683
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,602
Where did you find this stinky loser?

684
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,230
I won't let him stay here
even if I get paid a million.

685
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,023
I grew up too sheltered for this.

686
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,692
Get him out of here!

687
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,695
- After I get what I need.
- Sure.

688
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,534
Jin-gu, delete my photo right now.

689
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,785
Wait, you can't…

690
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,122
This? But it's not a photo of you.

691
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,749
It's a photo of your friend.

692
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,340
Two can play at this game, Jin-gu.

693
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,425
I saw everything.

694
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,261
- See what?
- A mobster's car dropped you off.

695
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,638
I'm good at picking up on stuff like this.

696
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,434
You used a loan shark.

697
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,563
You blew all your savings on crypto,
and a loan shark came after you.

698
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,231
A loan shark? Me?

699
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,816
I know I'm right.

700
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,153
You crash in the studio
and shower in the campus restrooms.

701
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,114
Even in the summer,
you always wear that long coat.

702
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,365
You're obviously broke.

703
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,494
What other explanation is there
for someone like you riding in a limo?

704
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,621
Don't tell me

705
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,749
you already let them take
one of your kidneys.

706
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,626
No wonder you don't look so good.

707
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,710
What do you mean?

708
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,879
Wait.

709
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,464
But I bet I look better than this!

710
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,382
Give me that!

711
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,551
- Hand it over.
- Let's see.

712
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,386
Please delete it.

713
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,225
<i>Today's band practice is canceled.</i>

714
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,656
I'm hungry.

715
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,074
Aren't you?

716
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,245
I got it.

717
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,624
Tae-yang,

718
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,584
I can really hold my liquor, can't I?

719
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,838
I've been working so many hours lately

720
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,966
that my liver…

721
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,094
hasn't had a chance to be ruined.

722
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,389
It's as clean as a baby's.

723
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,851
- Have some of this.
- Only wimps eat food with drinks.

724
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,397
Drinking without food is the only way
to relieve stress.

725
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,943
Slow down, Bom. You're drunk.

726
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,661
- Bom, want to see something funny?
- You?

727
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,454
I can be funny too, you know.

728
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,041
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>What are you going to do, Tae-yang?</i>

729
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,047
Check this out.

730
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,800
One, two…

731
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,097
This bottle must've been in stock
for too long.

732
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,558
Just a second.

733
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,102
Ta-da.

734
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,067
I didn't think you could do such things!

735
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,945
Jeez, my stomach.
I'll get abs at this rate.

736
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,323
How are you so hilarious?

737
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,907
- Come on.
- I can do other things too.

738
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,951
Really? Like what?

739
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,215
- Nice, Tae-yang!
- Something like this.

740
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,343
Wow, is there more?

741
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,469
More?

742
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,764
Show me!

743
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,308
Go, Seo Tae-yang!

744
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,434
Show me!

745
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,687
<i>Cheers in the orchard</i>
<i>At the edge of the village</i>

746
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,780
I'm so sorry.

747
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,577
You two seem friendly.

748
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,912
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,413
Why did you do that to us?

750
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,332
- Sorry?
- Tell me.

751
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,168
No, don't.

752
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,839
You think this is your living room?

753
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,132
Why you…

754
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,388
What? You got a problem?

755
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,936
I'm feeling tipsy.

756
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,938
Goodness.

757
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,022
Bom.

758
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,608
Bom?

759
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,653
What's the matter with her today?

760
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,530
Bom, let's go home.

761
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,739
Here. Get on my back.

762
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,075
One, two, three. There you go.

763
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,331
Sir, we'd like to get our check.

764
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,209
Theirs, too.

765
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,753
We'll get going, then.

766
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,213
Good night. Bom, say bye.

767
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,631
- Bye.
- That's it.

768
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,391
Tae-yang, can you slow down a bit?

769
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,311
All that running is making me sick.

770
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,313
Right. I'm sorry.

771
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,065
I'll slow down.

772
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,954
Bom, are you crying?

773
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,457
Bom.

774
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,794
Tae-yang, thank you for today.

775
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,338
I got to laugh my heart out.

776
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,257
You laughed,
That's all that matters to me.

777
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,553
Just say the word,
and I'll do it all again.

778
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,433
No. Don't you dare do it again.

779
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,435
Try to be funny again,

780
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,061
and you'll regret it.

781
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,568
How can you be so not funny?

782
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,737
Gosh, my stomach.

783
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,031
Have you been fooling me this whole time?

784
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,074
- What?
- Weren't you crying?

785
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,534
Why would I cry?

786
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,870
It was so funny
that I had to bite my tongue.

787
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,332
Tae-yang, you should practice harder.

788
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,458
It was all amateur hour.

789
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,377
Do you know how hard it was for me
to force myself to laugh?

790
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,671
Everyone at the bar
was dumbfounded by your jokes.

791
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,050
Come on. Let's go.

792
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,301
That sobered me right up.

793
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,098
Still, you managed a swift getaway.

794
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,183
I'll give you that.

795
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,436
Hey, Kim Bom. Get back here.

796
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,063
- No!
- You're done for if I catch you.

797
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,147
Hey.

798
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,246
All right, fine.

799
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,499
I'm sorry, okay? Are we good?

800
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,087
Have I ever told you

801
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,338
that I have feelings for you?

802
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,549
What?

803
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,633
I like you.

804
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,927
I have since you were in middle school.

805
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,097
I've always

806
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,516
liked you.

807
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,480
I like you too.

808
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,899
After my mom passed,

809
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,068
I relied on you a lot.

810
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,778
You were always like a brother to me.

811
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,282
That's not what I want.

812
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,244
Can't you see me differently now?

813
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,913
Do I not have a chance?

814
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,513
I have feelings for someone else.

815
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,849
Don't like him.

816
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,602
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

817
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,812
- He doesn't like you--
- I don't want to hear it.

818
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,731
That's my choice to make.

819
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,067
I'd appreciate it if you kept out of it.

820
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,676
Does she major in piano?

821
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,932
What the hell?

822
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,366
What are you doing?

823
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,539
Why don't we have a proper conversation?

824
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:05,043
You've lost your mind.
Do you want to be put behind bars?

825
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,878
You're not a top star anymore.

826
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,588
You're just a washed-up jester.

827
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,678
I'm giving you one last chance.

828
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:15,929
Only because…

829
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,433
you were like my father to me
at one point.

830
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,644
Tell me why you took off that day.

831
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,604
She could've been saved!

832
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:31,027
What's certain is that he has no proof.

833
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,029
What he saw or heard

834
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,322
isn't our problem.

835
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,658
<i>We can keep pretending</i>
<i>like nothing happened.</i>

836
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,035
<i>Exactly. There's no proof.</i>

837
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,787
<i>I can't let him get to me.</i>

838
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,124
Why do you keep throwing
ridiculous accusations at me?

839
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,418
If you're going to make threats,
do it right.

840
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,962
Back up your claim with hard evidence!

841
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,716
What you just did was probably recorded
on my dash cam.

842
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,135
That's what you call evidence.
Do you hear me?

843
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,472
I see.

844
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,265
I appreciate the advice.

845
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,892
Call the police if this pissed you off.

846
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,020
Hold on.

847
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,606
It's unusual to see you drive.
They say it's going to rain.

848
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,401
You must be comfortable
driving in the rain.

849
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,960
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR SEO MIN-CHEOL

850
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,132
Min-cheol, how did it go with Tae-yang?
Will he join The Crown?

851
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,969
If you get him to join,

852
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,013
I'll give my all to make him a star.

853
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:43,809
He'll become an irreplaceable artist,
leaving SAGYE to fade into the past.

854
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,154
Where were you?

855
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,075
Hold on.

856
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,701
Why do you have that with you?

857
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,955
Just because.

858
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,582
Were you reminded of that day?

859
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,584
Every time I see this,

860
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,878
I get as nervous as I was
back in boot camp.

861
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,257
I've held onto it to ensure
I never make that same mistake again.

862
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,760
Is this what I think it is?

863
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,345
Didn't you know?

864
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,224
I had just joined the agency
and was overwhelmed.

865
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,433
You were rushed to the ER,

866
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,644
and my business trip
to the US was the next day.

867
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,145
It was a nightmare.

868
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,482
The thought of you going blind
made me sick to my stomach.

869
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,043
Gye!

870
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,921
- Move!
- Move. Emergency patient!

871
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,676
Ms. Mok, this is Seung-su.

872
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,386
Gye…

873
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,847
hurt his eyes.

874
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,350
Mom. Why are the lights off?

875
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,352
Is it nighttime?

876
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,566
<i>Unfortunately, his only hope right now</i>
<i>is a corneal transplant.</i>

877
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,860
You're lucky your optic nerve
wasn't damaged.

878
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,613
If it had been, I don't think
I could've lived with myself.

879
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,200
You were given another chance
for being the good person you are.

880
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,411
Let's go.

881
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,290
I was blessed?

882
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,961
Me?

883
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,466
That thing you asked about. Mr. Jo's SUV.

884
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,634
Yes.

885
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,469
You were wrong.

886
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,222
Mr. Jo never owned an SUV.
I personally checked with the auto team.

887
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,226
That can't be.

888
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,854
It's cold. Let's head inside.

889
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,439
Gosh, it's chilly.

890
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,819
Does that mean
the vehicle wasn't Mr. Jo's?

891
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:28,473
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR SEO MIN-CHEOL

892
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,817
Hello, Dr. Seo.

893
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,486
What do you want this time?

894
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,505
<i>I bet you have a headache.</i>

895
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,133
<i>Take the medicine</i>
<i>before dealing with your hangover.</i>

896
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,343
<i>Also, I got you a new phone.</i>

897
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,429
<i>Yours had a cracked screen.</i>

898
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,473
<i>I'm sure this much is allowed</i>
<i>as a brother.</i>

899
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,210
<i>Why would you replace my phone</i>

900
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,421
<i>when it's me who broke it?</i>

901
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,798
<i>I appreciate the gesture,</i>

902
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,551
<i>but I don't think I can accept</i>

903
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,721
<i>either the phone or your feelings.</i>

904
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,889
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

905
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,933
<i>I have a class early in the morning,</i>
<i>so I'll head off first.</i>

906
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,441
TWO SAGYE BANNED
FROM USING THEIR STUDIO

907
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,109
DUE TO VIOLATION
OF SCHOOL REGULATIONS

908
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,709
<i>What do you want this time?</i>

909
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,795
I knew you wouldn't be thrilled
to hear from me,

910
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,630
but that's quite rude of you.

911
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:11,219
I apologize if I came off rude.

912
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,972
I say this
so that you won't get the wrong idea.

913
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,015
Don't think I'm asking for a favor.

914
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,934
<i>I'm just telling you where we stand.</i>

915
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,521
<i>I've decided to fully support</i>
<i>Tae-yang's music career.</i>

916
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,607
<i>Since he's taking time off</i>
<i>from school for this,</i>

917
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,569
<i>he should begin his career</i>
<i>with the best support possible.</i>

918
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,488
Fortunately, Tae-yang was offered
an incredible opportunity.

919
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,740
One I don't want him to miss.

920
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,035
That's why I'm telling you to let him go.

921
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,788
<i>Let him swim in a larger pond.</i>

922
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,833
<i>What do I do?</i>

923
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,627
<i>I can't reject his feelings</i>

924
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,297
<i>and ruin his dream too.</i>

925
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,050
<i>Is this the only thing I can do</i>

926
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,052
<i>for Tae-yang?</i>

927
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,559
Tae-yang, did you hear the news?

928
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,520
Bom just called.

929
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,231
Bom…

930
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,908
What are you doing?

931
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,701
You're breaking up the band?

932
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,582
The person who founded it wants to.
How can we be TWO SAGYE without Gye?

933
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,794
Is SAGYE really going to quit the band?

934
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,797
Why is he suddenly abandoning us?
There's no good reason to.

935
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,424
That jerk!

936
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,842
Has he lost his mind?

937
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,677
He thinks he can do whatever he wants.

938
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,221
Where is this jerk right now?

939
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,223
Don't blame him.

940
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,100
We've been banned from playing
at school events.

941
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,728
What's the point of practicing
when we can't perform?

942
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,188
On top of that, we're down…

943
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,190
a vocalist.

944
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,275
Is Gye all that matters to you?

945
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,028
Do we mean nothing to you?

946
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,613
Does this band belong only to Gye?

947
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,366
I risked everything to join the band.
To do it properly.

948
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,910
So, find a more promising band.

949
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,621
Don't let us hold you back.

950
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,753
I'm sorry, Jin-gu.

951
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,547
This is my limit.

952
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,175
I'll try to find a way
to get you back into Hanju Band.

953
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,510
Kim Bom!

954
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,886
Are you kidding me?

955
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,224
I invested just as much
as all of you in TWO SAGYE.

956
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,768
I believed this band was worth it!

957
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,646
Don't you need our consent
to break up the band?

958
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,023
I won't ever agree to it.

959
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,201
TWO SAGYE…

960
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,163
doesn't have a future.

961
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,834
It ends here.

962
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,171
Hey.

963
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,465
Bom, wait.

964
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,385
You can't end it like this.

965
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,390
I see you've finally realized
your place and disbanded.

966
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,559
Why did you even bother
making such a fuss?

967
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,103
As if they could hold out
with the school in their way.

968
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,522
Don't even think about
crawling back to Hanju Band.

969
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,816
We don't have it in us
to forgive traitors.

970
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,790
Is it because of what I said yesterday?

971
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,002
- That--
- No.

972
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,713
I've had enough, that's all.

973
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,801
I guess I wasn't in my right mind.

974
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,223
I believed it could all work out
even though I never had what it took.

975
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,187
It was a pipe dream.

976
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,148
I hope…

977
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,985
you get to do what you want.

978
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,573
Don't waste your time with me.

979
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,795
NEW MOBILE DEVICE CONTRACT

980
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,299
Should I transfer all the photos too?

981
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,456
No, the photos…

982
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,709
I won't transfer them.

983
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,550
Thanks for making the decision
so quickly, Bom.

984
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,678
<i>Don't thank me.</i>
<i>It's what I should have done.</i>

985
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,389
<i>His father is clearly looking out for him,</i>

986
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,267
<i>so who am I to get in Tae-yang's way?</i>

987
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,687
<i>I've been selfish and greedy</i>
<i>this whole time.</i>

988
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,814
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

989
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,358
Well, at least you've finally let him go.

990
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,862
Just make sure I don't need
to call you about this again.

991
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,823
Ma'am.

992
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,116
Do you need something, Dr. Seo?

993
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,535
Some stuff will be arriving
for Tae-yang's room.

994
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:30,079
Make sure the room is cleaned in advance.
Please get on it.

995
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,539
Yes, Dr. Seo.

996
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,815
Sa Gye, you jerk.

997
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,948
Why did you do this? Why?

998
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,007
I'm moving

999
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,384
back home.

1000
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,053
Good, welcome back home.

1001
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,471
I was waiting for you.

1002
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:38,397
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

1003
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,108
What the hell?

1004
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,070
Bom, what's wrong?

1005
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,238
This…

1006
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,656
This? What?

1007
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,325
What is this song?

1008
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,494
Oh, this song?

1009
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:54,705
It's The Crown's new song
that dropped at noon today.

1010
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,916
Isn't it great? I just love it.

1011
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,044
I thought the group would tank
after SAGYE's departure but…

1012
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,542
<i>When did you steal my song?</i>

1013
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,877
What are you saying I stole?

1014
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,879
<i>- Let go.</i>
<i>- If you go after them without a plan,</i>

1015
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,382
- <i>they might bury you.</i>
- <i>Save the advice.</i>

1016
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,592
I don't trust you either.

1017
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,261
<i>Like you said,</i>
<i>only the two of us knew this song.</i>

1018
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,347
<i>That song is yours.</i>
<i>So defend it with your life.</i>

1019
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,600
<i>I'll continue to fight.</i>
<i>I won't let them have it.</i>

1020
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,394
<i>I'll help you. Let's prove it together.</i>

1021
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,313
<i>Don't you care about what'll happen?</i>

1022
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,731
You're pure evil.

1023
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:06,819
