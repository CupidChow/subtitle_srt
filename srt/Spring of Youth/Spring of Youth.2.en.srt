1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,637
-Kim Bom?
-Sa Gye?

4
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,347
You're the landlady?

5
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,558
You're the one looking to rent?

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,063
So much for only being a good pianist.

7
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,773
You're also good at telling lies.

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,441
A penthouse, you say?

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,027
What? What did I lie about?

10
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,988
I wasn't lying
about it having a view over Seoul.

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,990
"Pool" in Korean is "plants."

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,202
You get the upper floor and the rooftop
which makes it a multi-level loft.

13
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,121
What about any of that is wrong?

14
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,291
What's with all the yelling up here?

15
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,793
If he doesn't want the room,

16
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,336
tell him just leave…

17
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,254
Do you also live here?

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,216
What a surprise.

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,967
-Mom.
-Yes?

20
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,053
Am I dreaming?

21
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,640
Why am I seeing things?

22
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,767
This thing I'm seeing

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,895
is also talking to me.

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,856
-SAGYE!
-What the…

25
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,275
-Gyu-ri!
-What?

26
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,239
SAGYE's here.

27
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,740
SAGYE's in our house.

28
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,120
Still. How can we let a guy
move in to our floor?

29
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,830
Besides, he's a total stranger.

30
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,792
Everyone's a stranger in the beginning.
We can gradually get to know him.

31
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,836
Me! I'll switch rooms.

32
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,380
I'll take the room upstairs.
You can have mine downstairs.

33
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,215
I thought you were done with him.

34
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,800
You said he turned out to be a jerk.

35
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,594
I thought you said loving him
was a waste of your time?

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,015
Everyone makes mistakes.

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,976
I just made up my mind.

38
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,019
I'll be SAGYE's last fan and supporter.

39
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,523
You embarrassing brat.

40
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,692
I can't believe you.

41
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,736
Bom, you never know
what'll happen in life.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,906
He may have hit rock bottom,
but who says he'll stay there?

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,284
Once he makes a comeback,

44
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,453
people will eventually find out that SAGYE

45
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,415
used to rent a room here!

46
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,001
Then this place will become
a popular tourist spot.

47
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,920
Fans will line up to visit,
and the price will skyrocket.

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,923
The house price will skyrocket?

49
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,221
That'll be 100,000 won.

50
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,140
Do you have 100,000 won?

51
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,725
-Here you go.
-This is the former home

52
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,602
of international superstar, SAGYE.

53
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,229
The price has already increased tenfold.

54
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,772
Tenfold.

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,818
Love could also blossom.

56
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,742
I can't wait any longer, Gyu-ri.

57
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,785
Marry me!

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,870
I love you!

59
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,380
Still, living with a guy
will be uncomfortable.

60
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,840
Wait.

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,218
Who knows when we'll get
another prospective tenant?

62
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,012
Let's focus on paying off our debt.

63
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,555
I won't let him bother you.

64
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,515
You know me. I already made arrangements.

65
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,143
Ground rules for co-ed living!

66
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,979
Breakfast at 7 a.m. sharp.
Dinner at 8 p.m.

67
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,147
Location, first-floor kitchen.

68
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,149
Late by five minutes? No meals for you.

69
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,275
Absolutely none.

70
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,403
I have to be up at 7 a.m.?

71
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,989
That's going to be a problem.
I get up at 6 a.m., you see.

72
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,575
Don't youngsters sleep in?

73
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,286
I can't cook that early. Then…

74
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,371
Pass on that for now.

75
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,539
No showing skin inside the house.

76
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,167
Always walk around
wearing a top and bottom.

77
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,044
The living room is off-limits
after midnight.

78
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,295
No fraternizing.

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,422
Make a move on my daughter and…

80
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,218
Well, that won't happen anyway.

81
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,429
For sure? That's a bit offensive.

82
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,265
Either way, I'll be watching.

83
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,516
Lastly, the deposit.

84
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,477
I won't take monthly installments,
so by tomorrow morning--

85
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,355
What?

86
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,775
Fifty million won, right?

87
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,696
Why would you carry cash around?

88
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,156
I don't know. My manager gave it to me.

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,326
Young and rich. That's my SAGYE.

90
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,246
How much cash does he have?
Even rock bottom is high ground for him.

91
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,081
Have I finally found it?

92
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,209
The money I can have right now,
and not in some unforeseeable future?

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,460
Okay!

94
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
You're in!

95
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,172
-Yes!
-I'm in?

96
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,799
-You're moving in!
-Really?

97
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,510
I'm moving in!

98
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,687
Mr. Jo, I won't give up on music.

99
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,481
I'll make the most impressive comeback.

100
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,572
Kim Bom?

101
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,324
She still has the same smile.

102
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,207
I've seen that piano before.

103
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,045
Is this the bunny
from that restaurant piano?

104
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,630
Is this your hideout?

105
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,802
It's nice up here.

106
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,099
I'm curious. How did you end up here?

107
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,434
Why here, of all places?

108
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,103
Here's how.

109
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,190
I let the moon guide me,

110
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,192
and you appeared before my eyes.

111
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,911
Tell me about the melody,
and I'll pull you up.

112
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,204
What?

113
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,413
What if I won't?

114
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,706
Then I'll let go.

115
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,334
That's unfair. Pull me back up.

116
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,753
Doesn't this prove how curious I am?

117
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,839
I'll let go. I mean it.

118
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,008
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

119
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,719
My mom bought me a piano when I was seven,

120
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,013
and that's the first song I wrote.
Happy now?

121
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,152
What about you, then?
How did you hear my song in your dreams?

122
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,988
Was that a lie? I bet it was.

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,117
Do I seem like I have nothing better
to do than lie?

124
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,370
Lying isn't my thing.

125
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,956
How do you know my song, then?

126
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,292
How can you know
what hasn't even been recorded?

127
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,920
I thought about it,

128
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,589
and I probably heard it from somewhere.

129
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,634
I have golden ears
that remember every melody

130
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,760
they hear.

131
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,564
That's how I concluded
we must have met at least once before.

132
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,566
We've met before?

133
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,609
We have? When?

134
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,701
This was a new dream.

135
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,995
A white piano.

136
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,080
A bunny sticker.

137
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,916
For the first time, I got to look

138
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,751
at the girl's face clearly.

139
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
It was Bom.

140
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,319
Coming to this house
might not have been a coincidence.

141
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,426
It's uncomfortable.

142
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,719
It's too uncomfortable.

143
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,097
He may be my future golden ticket,
but this is still wrong.

144
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,516
Hey, Bom.

145
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,269
Remove the beverages advertised by SAGYE
and send them back.

146
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,729
His former agency is smart.

147
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,899
They're taking everything back
and have offered a full refund.

148
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,985
His agency?

149
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
Yes.

150
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,155
How could they cut him off so heartlessly?

151
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,406
What?

152
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,494
Is that what they really did?

153
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,579
Are you kidding me?

154
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,591
Jeez.

155
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,437
How long have you been standing there?

156
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,940
From when you started playing the piano.

157
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,234
You owned a white one, didn't you?

158
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,569
How did you know that?

159
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,572
-Did my aunt tell you?
-So you did have one?

160
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,948
With the bunny sticker on it.

161
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,617
No way!

162
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,371
Bom, wrap things up here
and complete the handoff!

163
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,873
-I'm coming.
-Are you her boyfriend?

164
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,417
-Are you her boyfriend?
-What?

165
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,630
-Are you her boyfriend?
-What?

166
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,552
-Sir, let's head inside.
-You're him, right?

167
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,891
I have so much on my plate
that I have no time for others,

168
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,312
but I'll ask this
since I just can't make sense of it.

169
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,647
Why won't you stand up for yourself
when you were wronged?

170
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,191
Me? How was I wronged?

171
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,694
You didn't assault the guys in the band.

172
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,323
Are you a pushover
or some kind of peacekeeper?

173
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,033
How did you know that?

174
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,994
I know more about you than you think.

175
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,455
Anyway, learn to protect yourself.

176
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,457
Only losers back down without a fight.

177
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,666
Got it?

178
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,834
Got it.

179
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,878
Seriously.

180
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,299
And you call yourself a superstar?

181
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,928
You're so annoying!

182
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,309
-It's him, right?
-Would you stop it?

183
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,019
Why is she upset about it

184
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,479
when I'm not making a fuss?

185
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,484
Does that mean she trusts me?

186
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,029
Why though? Did she see something
in her dreams too?

187
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,089
What's that jerk doing here?

188
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,259
Knowing I have someone's trust

189
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,470
empowers me like a blast of dynamite.

190
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,939
RECRUITING BAND MEMBERS

191
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,194
Hi, everyone!

192
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,696
Hi.

193
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,659
I'm sure you know
I'm recruiting band members.

194
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,829
I know Hanju University
has its own band, Hanju Band.

195
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,541
However, I'll be doing music
that isn't like theirs.

196
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,084
Hip-hop-rock!

197
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,130
I can't believe this punk
is back on campus.

198
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,881
Attention-seeking yet again.

199
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,133
He is handsome, though.

200
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,012
So, what instruments can you play?

201
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,640
People still play them for real?
Don't computers do everything?

202
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,600
I can't sing, but I'll be the vocalist.

203
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,979
Don't you need a manager?
I'm a skilled driver and show host.

204
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,069
Hey, over there.

205
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,490
What the? Wasn't he taking time off?

206
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,659
He saw me.

207
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,787
Can you excuse me?

208
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,039
I heard you were in the hospital.

209
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,417
Have you been discharged already?
How are you?

210
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,502
We're barely living.

211
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,213
I only came by to say hi.

212
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,090
-Don't be tense.
-Tense? Me?

213
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,676
-Let's go.
-Sure.

214
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,348
Why are you walking on your bad leg?

215
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,558
Doesn't it hurt?

216
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,853
Run!

217
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,648
You want us to race?

218
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,985
I guess they don't know I won first place

219
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,528
at the K-pop idol track meet.

220
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,864
Ready, set, go!

221
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,785
That nutjob!

222
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,848
Why did you come at me like that,

223
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,185
playing the media,
lying about me assaulting you?

224
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,395
You wouldn't settle
and dragged it out. Why?

225
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,776
I bet someone put you up to this.
Someone who wanted to ruin me.

226
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,070
Who was it?

227
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,154
Whatever!

228
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,583
I can't possibly run anymore.

229
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,961
Call the guy right now.

230
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,299
I told you not to call.
That I'd be the one calling.

231
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,759
Sa Gye's on campus.

232
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,094
You said you'd protect us.

233
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,972
So why is he living it up,
trying to start his own band?

234
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,977
Sa Gye showed up on campus, sir.

235
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,853
I thought he was enlisting.

236
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,730
He already rented a room,

237
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,024
which turns out to be owned by Kim Bom.

238
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
They're living under the same roof?

239
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,117
How could this be?

240
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,994
I can't tell if it's a coincidence,

241
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,954
but I confirmed
that Sa Gye knocked on her door

242
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,789
and signed the lease.

243
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,421
I shouldn't have kicked him out
so hastily.

244
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,965
It only made things worse.

245
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,884
They can't be together!

246
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,135
Break them apart.

247
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,178
Get him to enlist or send him abroad!

248
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,598
I don't care how, just get it done!

249
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,477
PETITION FOR RESTRAINING ORDER

250
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,065
ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT

251
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,069
-It's been a while.
-What's up?

252
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,327
Hey, it's begun.

253
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,080
Separate the victims from their attacker.

254
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,916
-Separate them!
-Separate them!

255
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,002
Sa Gye will apologize to his victims,

256
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,712
and abandon his idea to start a band.

257
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,756
-Abandon the idea!
-Abandon the idea!

258
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,468
Sa Gye is only back in classes

259
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,470
to avoid enlistment.

260
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,347
-That's all it is!
-That's all it is!

261
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,516
The second semester…

262
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,226
Don't you have anything to say to that?

263
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,687
They make a solid point.

264
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,024
Do you know you're making
the entire department look bad?

265
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,527
Guys, if we don't take action,
it'll seem like we're condoning violence.

266
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,780
-Absolutely.
-That's some A-grade bullshit.

267
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,784
He's your classmate,
and that's what you say?

268
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,868
What?

269
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,454
-Professor.
-Professor.

270
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,333
I will boycott any class
that Sa Gye attends.

271
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,668
What will it be, guys?

272
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
-I agree.
-Same here.

273
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,631
I'm also returning the jacket
bought by their attacker.

274
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,216
I'll also return mine.

275
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,093
-I'll return mine.
-Hey.

276
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,803
I'm also returning mine.

277
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,971
Where are you going?

278
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,306
How could you change tune so quickly?

279
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,059
An emergency meeting
is being held in the president's office.

280
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,853
-Sa Gye out!
-Sa Gye out!

281
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,982
-Sa Gye out!
-Sa Gye out!

282
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,566
-Sa Gye out!
-Sa Gye out!

283
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,528
NO MORE SECOND CHANCES!
EXPLAIN YOURSELF

284
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:35,786
-Sa Gye out!
-Sa Gye out!

285
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,956
-Sa Gye out!
-Sa Gye out!

286
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,040
Wait, I have…

287
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,835
SAGYE is to leave! Out with SAGYE.

288
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:47,631
-Sa Gye out!
-Sa Gye out!

289
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,717
Students are complaining
about your presence

290
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,301
on campus and in classes.

291
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,929
We're worried about Hanju University
gaining a reputation

292
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,306
for letting an assailant
walk freely on campus.

293
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,268
Why don't you take time off
and serve your time in the military?

294
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,061
They'll forget
by the time you are discharged.

295
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,771
We're saying this for your sake.

296
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,107
For my sake?

297
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,777
I hate to say this, but I don't want to.

298
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,032
I may not have done well in school,
but I'm not stupid.

299
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,700
Someone told me

300
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,618
that only losers surrender

301
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,495
without putting up a fight.

302
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,747
I will enlist someday,

303
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,123
but not like this.

304
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,042
I won't go there to hide.

305
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,378
I'll get going, then.
I have a band to start, you see.

306
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,714
What if I prevent you
from starting a band?

307
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,550
What right do you have?

308
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,218
I can exercise any right

309
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,512
to protect the school's interests.

310
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,972
Hanju University

311
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,224
is already sponsoring one band.

312
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,311
I'm starting the band for the school too.

313
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,189
Stop me all you want. I'll keep going.

314
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,690
I'll see it through.

315
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,485
Okay, fine.

316
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,403
How about this, then?

317
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,448
If you manage to form a club
with over 300 students by today,

318
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,576
the school will back off
and not make any more requests.

319
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,328
Wait. Did you say 300?

320
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,497
That's just ridiculous.

321
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,499
How can a school club
have over 300 people?

322
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:08,212
Over 300 students have signed
the petition urging the school

323
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,589
to stop you from attending classes.

324
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,884
You should have at least
as many students supporting you

325
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,513
for the other side
to agree to let you stay.

326
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,932
If I gather 300 students,

327
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,643
will you approve my band?

328
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,105
However, if you fail, you will drop out
or take leave of absence.

329
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,526
I want you gone so that you're no longer
a problem for the university.

330
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,403
At this rate, we'll lose our sponsor.

331
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,405
CEO JO SANG-HEON

332
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,620
Sure.

333
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,746
You wait and see.

334
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,665
I'll get it done.

335
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,256
I don't know who's threatening you
with their sponsorship,

336
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,507
but tell them this.

337
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,425
That they're the reason

338
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,846
I'm forming this band no matter what.

339
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,222
You have

340
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,891
until 6 p.m. today.

341
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,939
Thank you.

342
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,130
Who are you here to see?

343
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,257
Producer Jo Ji-na.

344
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,718
I have something to tell her about SAGYE.

345
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,803
I'm Kim Bom. She knows who I am.

346
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,054
What is this about?

347
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,225
Ms. Jo is out of the office, I'm afraid.

348
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,187
How do you know Ms. Jo?

349
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,148
Ms. Jo bought the rights to my songs.

350
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,276
My agency bought the rights to your songs?

351
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,617
So you're saying

352
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,288
that SAGYE was only defending himself
and that it wasn't assault.

353
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,499
That's right. I saw how it went down.

354
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,043
How are you even better than us?

355
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,336
You're richer, but that's it.

356
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,963
Say you're jealous if you are. Move!

357
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,716
What if we don't want to and won't?

358
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,433
-My arm!
-He's out to kill us!

359
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,311
The other guys picked a fight first.

360
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,396
I posted what I saw online,

361
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,523
but it kept getting deleted
for some reason.

362
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,400
As if someone was deleting it on purpose.

363
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,568
Did you perhaps

364
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,112
film a video
that could back up your claim?

365
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,322
A video

366
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,574
that proves it was
self-defense as you said?

367
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,078
No, I didn't get around to that.

368
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,164
The victims provided the police
with a video.

369
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,582
Because of that footage,

370
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,168
it's difficult
to refute Sa Gye's alleged actions.

371
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,836
The video that was revealed

372
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,838
didn't show how the boys
harassed him first.

373
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,216
Hasn't it occurred to you
that they could be lying?

374
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,136
Isn't it the agency's responsibility
to prioritize its artist?

375
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,723
And why exactly should I believe you?

376
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,558
I'm surprised.

377
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,271
Why does it sound like
you don't want to believe me?

378
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,024
Isn't believing what isn't explained
what true trust is about?

379
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,902
Are you really the head of the agency
whom Sa Gye loves

380
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,655
-and respects?
-I'm sorry,

381
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,700
but I no longer represent Sa Gye.

382
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,995
Who I should protect right now
is The Crown.

383
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,706
So you'll turn a blind eye?

384
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,749
If that's for the best, gladly.

385
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,918
Sa Gye's on his own now.

386
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,797
If he had no one on his side,

387
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,883
I wouldn't have come here today.

388
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,346
If Sa Gye heard this,

389
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,640
he would be heartbroken.

390
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,518
Who are you to Sa Gye?

391
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,730
Why do you ask?

392
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,274
I don't see why I have to answer that.

393
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,076
We will now begin anatomy dissection.

394
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,760
How was anatomy dissection?

395
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,475
It was… fine.

396
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,311
That's a boring way to put it.

397
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,273
Your experience today
will stay with you forever.

398
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,068
A divine level of thrill,
if I dare say so.

399
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,903
I should wash up.

400
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,363
Hold on.

401
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,574
Are you off to that band or whatnot again?

402
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,077
Are you still at it?

403
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,079
You're no longer a pre-med.

404
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,663
You shouldn't waste time.

405
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,957
How you were in a showdown

406
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,835
in front of the entire student body
even reached my ears.

407
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,879
No wonder you had to retake your test.

408
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,215
A disgrace for the son
of Hanju Uni Hospital's director.

409
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,719
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,347
The band…

411
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,016
I'll quit it soon.

412
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,936
You'd better keep that word.

413
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,147
Of all things, I didn't raise a loser.

414
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,024
I provided only the best support.

415
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,111
I know.

416
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,906
This evening at 6 p.m.,

417
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,826
you'll observe
the minimal invasive surgery on a newborn.

418
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,953
Seeing it firsthand will be useful to you.

419
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,456
This is a privilege you get
only because you're my son.

420
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,294
I appreciate it.

421
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,379
Don't be late.

422
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,305
Three hundred students?

423
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,452
You again?

424
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,123
I must admit your dedication makes it fun.

425
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,543
Do you think you can
form a band after assaulting us?

426
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,838
Also, I heard you bought your way
into this school.

427
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,299
Did you pay for the field?

428
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,468
Or did you fund the construction
of some of the lecture halls.

429
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,596
What year are you living in?

430
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,306
Do you still think that shit flies?

431
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,725
It's true you donated a billion won
to the med school.

432
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,435
Your agency admitted that.

433
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,479
I made the donation after enrolling.
Anonymously, as well.

434
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,441
So how did my former agency admit to that?

435
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,653
There are no secrets in this world.

436
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,406
Besides, you had ulterior intentions.

437
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,492
It was to get good grades
even after skipping classes.

438
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,120
What now? Are you going to hit me again?

439
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,955
Fine. Do it.

440
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,207
Kill us, why don't you?

441
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,210
I was put on academic probation
last semester.

442
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,420
Who would pay to get
an academic probation?

443
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,508
I'm dead curious.

444
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,929
Why are you going the extra mile
to kick me out?

445
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,972
Can't you tell me?

446
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,183
I can't stand being curious, you see.

447
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,394
-Apologize to us first--
-An apology?

448
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,772
Apologize to me first for coming at me.

449
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,691
I didn't leave The Crown
because I felt bad about the assault.

450
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,028
We couldn't afford another scandal.

451
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,698
So I'm keeping quiet for the group
despite being wronged.

452
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,993
As if we care.

453
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,495
Let us be clear.

454
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,748
Hanju University will only have one band.

455
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,458
No one will support yours.

456
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,586
We'll see about that.

457
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,422
Even the university president
told me to gather members.

458
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,716
Now, stop getting in my way,

459
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,677
and shove your faces out of my sight.

460
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,841
My heart's burning up
Because of you

461
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,677
It's flaming, it's burning

462
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
Why aren't you joining me?

463
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,763
Sure.

464
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,061
I don't care if it looks like
we're losing our minds

465
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,693
On this harsh and windy morning

466
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,990
Why so hot and cold?

467
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:09,419
So your cold heart will melt too

468
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,937
Seriously, Bom?

469
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,897
Is it really you?

470
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,567
Thanks to Gyu-ri,
I memorized all of The Crown's lyrics.

471
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,612
I'm sure that qualifies me
to be in your band.

472
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,197
I'll be on the keyboard.

473
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,034
How was that?
Didn't I get their attention?

474
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,702
Good. Good vocals.

475
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,162
Good outfit.

476
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,461
What the… We gathered quite an audience.

477
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,633
Guys!

478
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,886
Do you know
how much that performance was worth?

479
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,515
It's worth so much
that I can't even put a price on it.

480
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,350
However,

481
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,562
you enjoyed the performance for free
without any hassle.

482
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,646
Right?

483
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,856
-Yes.
-Yes.

484
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,400
-Aren't I right?
-You are!

485
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,029
Hey, Kim Bom. What are you doing?
Have you lost it?

486
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,907
Hang on. Were you listening
to us for free too?

487
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,036
I'm not trying
to squeeze money out of you.

488
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,330
There's only one thing I want

489
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,583
in exchange for that performance.

490
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,251
Let's keep it simple, guys.

491
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,837
Just sign the band application
before you go.

492
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,922
I've mapped out each of your faces,

493
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,466
so don't run off.

494
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,011
All right. Who wants to join the band?

495
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,512
Me!

496
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,805
I'll join, no questions asked.

497
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,600
Do not just stand there.

498
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,684
Sign it already.

499
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,855
I know you want to.

500
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,407
-Give me one.
-Get one off the ground.

501
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,328
Seriously? Not you too, Jin-gu.

502
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,412
Shut up,

503
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,747
and sign one yourself.

504
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,211
Hi, we're recruiting band members.
Please sign up if interested.

505
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,087
-Hi.
-Do you like rock bands?

506
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,464
Not really.

507
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,341
-Hello.
-Hi.

508
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,967
We're recruiting new band members.

509
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,260
I already have this much.

510
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,513
What about you?

511
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,849
Let's do a celebratory dance.

512
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,645
Go over there and gather more.

513
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,729
Go on.

514
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,857
That's 227, 228, and 229.

515
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,692
RECRUITING BAND MEMBERS

516
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,361
We're still 71 short.

517
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,906
We still have about an hour left.

518
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,494
Come on. We're now in the homestretch.

519
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,205
We'll find people to sign these forms.

520
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,915
What? How?

521
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,999
Run.

522
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,964
Bom.

523
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,049
You weren't interested at first,

524
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,884
so why the sudden change of heart?

525
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,136
I'm sorry,

526
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,722
but I no longer represent Sa Gye.

527
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,850
Sa Gye's on his own now.

528
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,686
You…

529
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,858
-I want to make you a star again.
-What?

530
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,695
I mean…

531
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,071
Everyone's being a jerk.

532
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,785
Wait for me!

533
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,631
We're up against
The Crown's main vocalist SAGYE.

534
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,967
He may have been kicked out,
but he's still a huge star.

535
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,012
Even the Merchants Association
will side with him.

536
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,346
Exactly.

537
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,976
Tae-yang, shouldn't you get involved?

538
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,357
There have been many bands,

539
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,067
but we're the only ones that survived.

540
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,361
So? You'll just sit back and watch?

541
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,156
They even have Kim Bom and Gong Jin-gu.

542
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,574
Aren't you pissed?

543
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,992
This is a matter of pride.

544
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,579
Fine. I'll handle this.

545
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,709
I'm off to class.
Have everything ready for me.

546
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,419
-Sure. Got it.
-Sure. Got it.

547
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,426
RECRUITING BAND MEMBERS

548
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,971
Go, SAGYE!

549
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,990
…is a facial nerve.

550
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,785
The trigeminal nerve has three branches.
The ophthalmic nerve,

551
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,996
the maxillary nerve,
and the mandibular nerve.

552
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,040
The facial nerve exits the skull

553
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,501
through the stylomastoid foramen,

554
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,796
and divides into two branches
at the parotid gland.

555
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,349
FATHER

556
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,142
The surgery begins at 6 p.m.

557
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,727
Get there early and stand by.

558
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,944
T-1MINUTE

559
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,320
Thank you.

560
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,197
Thanks.

561
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,449
Thank you.

562
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,076
Two, three, five.

563
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,238
Don't you think this is playing dirty?

564
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,658
We have a minute to go.

565
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,786
How many do we have?

566
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,788
We're at 299, and only need one more.

567
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,790
We can't let it end like this.

568
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,544
It's Seo Tae-yang!

569
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,256
Make way!

570
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
It's 6 p.m. sharp.

571
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,111
I take it you failed.

572
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,447
None of your business.

573
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,366
-Just get lost.
-I don't want to, though.

574
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,913
Get lost! All you do
is play dirty tricks to get in my way.

575
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,873
Actually, I can do more.

576
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,750
The guitar.

577
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,187
It's not too late, right?

578
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,357
The hero always makes
a grand entrance at the very end.

579
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,526
You'll join our band?

580
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,860
But why?

581
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,071
Tae-yang, what's going on?

582
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,657
What's this dog shit?
You said we should dump all over him.

583
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,080
You seem to be the one talking dog shit.

584
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,962
I do music with people, not dogs.

585
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,090
Could Sa Gye succeed in forming a band?

586
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,509
Are you trying to jinx it?

587
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,512
He already knows
we've been faking our injuries.

588
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,683
If things go south, we'll have
to cough up the settlement we received.

589
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,727
That's 100 million won.

590
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,980
Hold on.

591
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,284
I dislocated my arm.
It's for real this time!

592
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,120
Press charges if you want.

593
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,498
Don't forget the doctor's note
from Hanju Uni Hospital.

594
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,751
What is it? Should I fix your leg too?

595
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,171
You clowns.

596
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,797
I'd better not see you again.

597
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,804
Welcome, SAGYE of Hanju University!

598
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,307
Does this mean

599
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,475
the official union of the two SAGYEs?

600
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,394
SAGYE OF THE CROWN
AND SAGYE OF HANJU UNIVERSITY

601
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,564
How about naming our band TWO SAGYE?

602
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,691
Sweet, right?

603
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,413
I see he doesn't listen to others.

604
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,165
-Out of my way!
-Can you move?

605
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,959
Move, damn it! What the…

606
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,169
As promised--

607
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,420
SAGYE!

608
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,546
Thanks.

609
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,673
Here are 300 application forms.

610
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,385
Three hundred?

611
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,887
Yes, 300!

612
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,431
-Bom, no way!
-We have 300.

613
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,891
Invite all 300 band members.

614
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,477
I'll show them who's young and rich!

615
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,399
Invite everyone.

616
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,238
Mr. Jo, what do I do?

617
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,740
It now looks like I approved of the band.

618
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,909
It'll be impossible to shut this down.

619
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,452
Just impossible!

620
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,204
-To TWO SAGYE!
-To TWO SAGYE!

621
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,288
CONGRATULATIONS
TWO SAGYE

622
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,707
SAGYE
1ST-YEAR THEATER AND FILM, GUITARIST

SEO TAE-YANG
1ST-YEAR MED SCHOOL, GUITARIST

626
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,761
BAE GYU-RI
1ST-YEAR THEATER AND FILM, UNKNOWN

627
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,805
Why is it just the five of us?

628
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,473
Where are the remaining 295 members?

629
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,392
-They couldn't make it.
-Why not?

630
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,560
-I paid for 300 servings in advance.
-What?

631
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,896
Midterms start next week.

632
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,190
-They can't make time until after.
-What?

633
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,650
Even after the exams,

634
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,902
no one will have time
because of internships,

635
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,862
enlistments, and additional studying.

636
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,199
Seriously? Is it just us five
in this band, then?

637
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,287
-And then there's Gyu-ri.
-Me?

638
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,205
You can't even play an instrument.

639
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,000
Come on. Of course, I can contribute.

640
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,127
I'll play to my strengths
as the stage producer.

641
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,298
Sound, outfits, sponsorship, and others.
I can do everything.

642
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,050
We're here. That's what matters.

643
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,427
Exactly!

644
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,304
I prefer the tight-knit group of five.

645
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,514
Is that so?

646
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,849
Wait. I'm not drinking.

647
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,310
I got into trouble after drinking,
so no alcohol.

648
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,645
Instead, I'll grill the meat for you.

649
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,025
You? Have you grilled meat before?

650
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,652
Of course. This isn't rocket science.

651
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,529
Leave it to me.

652
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,619
You're so cool.

653
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,126
So manly.

654
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,261
Leave it to you?

655
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,347
Everything's burned. What now?

656
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,395
Over here. I see a few that aren't burned.

657
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,480
-Where?
-Here.

658
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,029
Kim Bom, you did great work today.

659
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,827
Open wide.

660
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,289
Here's to celebrate
the launch of TWO SAGYE!

661
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,755
Look at his face.

662
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,256
Are you kidding me?

663
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,134
His face!

664
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,720
-Take that!
-Hey!

665
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,222
-What the…
-You too!

666
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,265
Don't you dare.

667
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,946
Like that, spring had found me.

668
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,366
Like a miracle.

669
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,205
Spring. It was spring.

670
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,853
MY BRO SEUNG-SU

671
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,151
-Hey, Seung-su.
-Do you know a Kim Bom?

672
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,695
She came to see Producer Jo this morning
to talk about you.

673
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,656
She did? How does she know Ji-na?

674
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,491
Apparently, she sold songs to Ms. Jo.

675
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,245
Since Ms. Jo was out of the office,
she met with Mr. Jo instead,

676
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,372
which I happened to overhear.

677
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,416
So? What did she say?

678
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,169
She claimed your innocence
in the assault case.

679
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,420
She said she's a witness.

680
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,671
She saw it?

681
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,382
-How?
-How should I know?

682
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,426
Mr. Jo's reaction was the real kicker.

683
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,887
He wasn't interested in helping you.

684
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,930
How can he cut you off like that?

685
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,892
Then, he kept asking the girl
about her relationship with you.

686
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,059
Can you believe it?

687
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,395
Do you know what she said?

688
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,814
Stop asking questions
and just cut to the chase.

689
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,233
"Why do you ask?"

690
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,944
"I don't see why I have to answer that."

691
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,447
She then bolted out of the office.

692
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,533
She was so calm and icy, so damn cool.

693
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,410
Mr. Jo's here. I should go.

694
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,495
Bye.

695
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,335
That was completely unexpected.

696
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,463
Why would Mr. Jo…

697
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,266
She claimed your innocence
in the assault case.

698
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,643
She said she's a witness.

699
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,163
What?

700
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,917
SAGYE!

701
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,128
SAGYE?

702
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,631
-Over here.
-Oh, what?

703
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,343
We're headed to the library to write
our essays. Would you like to come?

704
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,512
Do we also have an assignment?

705
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,557
We only have essays
and no exams for midterms.

706
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,183
Want to know something interesting?

707
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,603
I may not seem like it,
but I'm close to flunking my classes.

708
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,480
Don't I look smart though?

709
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,274
I look like I'll get top grades.

710
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,193
No, you look as uninterested
in your studies as I am.

711
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,279
You think I'm like you? Thanks.

712
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,241
Hey, Bom.

713
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,827
Are you going too?

714
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,996
Yes.

715
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,831
I told you midterms are next week.

716
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,666
I have heaps of essays to write.

717
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,049
I knew it.

718
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,802
Why come to the library just to sleep?

719
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,846
He's irritating us
who are trying to study.

720
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,308
He had a long day today.

721
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,400
Anyway, thanks for joining the band.

722
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,279
Now that the band leader has jumped ship,

723
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,905
it must be a chaos over there.

724
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,038
I joined for you.

725
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,833
If you feel like you owe me,
do something about it.

726
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,844
However, if you fail, you will drop out
or take some time off.

727
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:03,390
I want you gone so that you're no longer
a problem for the university.

728
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,185
At this rate, we'll lose our sponsor.

729
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,274
It's true you donated a billion won
to the med school.

730
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,984
Your agency admitted that.

731
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,695
Mr. Jo's reaction was the real kicker.

732
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,989
He wasn't interested in helping you.

733
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,908
How can he cut you off like that?

734
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,375
Don't mind me.

735
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,812
Dad, please. Not that.

736
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,619
What the hell?

737
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,162
This guitar means the world to me.

738
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,417
You damn loser.

739
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,377
You turned down a golden opportunity

740
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,711
for this crappy shit?

741
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,880
You joined a band led
by that imbecile SAGYE

742
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
who's being accused of assault?

743
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,926
Did you think I wouldn't know?

744
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,679
My eyes and ears are everywhere
at Hanju University.

745
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:27,057
I know whom you meet
and everything you do!

746
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,185
Throw these out this instant.

747
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,187
I've had it with your childish antics.

748
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,399
If you want to pursue music,
leave my house.

749
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,359
Leave and live as you please.

750
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,112
I bet this is all because of Kim Bom.

751
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,281
Did she talk you
into doing music with her?

752
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,242
How dare she think
she has a chance with my son?

753
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,452
That damn orphan.

754
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,581
All you can give this girl
is your pity. Got it?

755
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,500
If you want to date,
find a girl who's on your level.

756
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,252
Don't date some riffraff.

757
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,550
You can hit me and slander me
all you want.

758
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,011
But not about Bom.

759
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,597
Don't you know who I'm doing this for?

760
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,058
I'm doing this for you.
Because I want what's best for you!

761
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,269
It's for your sake, not mine.

762
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,813
To save your own face and reputation!

763
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,732
I never wanted to go to med school.

764
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,984
-I did so to please you--
-You brat!

765
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,863
Let go of me.

766
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,283
How dare you glare at me?

767
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,870
I'll do as you wish.

768
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,798
What are you doing?

769
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,510
Are you actually leaving?

770
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,262
Like you said,
I'm going to live my life the way I want.

771
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,807
Don't tell me
you're running off to that girl.

772
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:51,892
Wake up, will you?

773
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,311
What the heck do you like
about her? She's a mere orphan!

774
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,646
Do people know

775
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,191
what a lousy person you are?

776
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,068
What?

777
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,695
You might be a respected doctor to others,

778
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,822
but to me,
you're the most atrocious person.

779
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,034
I believe I did my duty to you as a son
by getting into med school.

780
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,285
Goodbye.

781
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,996
Tae-yang, stop.

782
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,040
Stop right there.

783
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,333
Seo Tae-yang!

784
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,211
If you leave now,
you won't ever be allowed back!

785
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,022
But we don't have any empty rooms.

786
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,191
You do.
The one you're renting out upstairs.

787
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,153
Sa Gye said we could share.
Apparently, it's spacious enough.

788
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,863
When did I say that?

789
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,532
He said now that I've joined the band,

790
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,201
it'll be easier to practice
if we live in the same house.

791
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,829
He doesn't look it,
but he must get lonely.

792
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,914
SAGYE, were you lonely?

793
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,249
You should've told me!

794
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,001
No way. I didn't say that.

795
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,045
I'll never bunk with that jerk.

796
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,714
Kick him out already!

797
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,216
-Did Director Seo approve?
-Of course.

798
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,552
It's closer to school
which cuts down the commute.

799
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,470
That's true.

800
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,681
It was scary being just us girls here,

801
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:17,060
but now we have
two tall and handsome men under our roof.

802
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,146
The rent will now double.

803
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,440
Double the rent?

804
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,483
Was I right to come here?

805
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,568
Of course.

806
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,987
I hope we get along.

807
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,074
Why isn't anyone listening to me?
I'm saying no.

808
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,035
As the original tenant, I have rights--

809
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,953
Help me unpack, will you?

810
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,831
This band wouldn't exist
if it weren't for me.

811
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,007
I'll let you stay since it's late,

812
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,842
but find a new place first thing tomorrow.

813
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,137
I paid the entire deposit.
You can't freeload like this.

814
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,639
I'll split the deposit.

815
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,351
I could even pay it all.

816
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,435
Then, maybe you move out.

817
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,732
Unbelievable.

818
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,109
How did a dumbass like you
get into med school?

819
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,112
I was here first, so I have rights.

820
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,074
I liked Bom first. Since middle school.

821
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,158
I guess

822
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,494
I have the right to pursue her first.

823
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,954
Let's play it fair.

824
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,500
You and Bom
in the same house on the same floor?

825
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,794
I can't allow that.

826
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,922
Besides, this arrangement
doesn't seem all too bad.

827
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,299
I'll only be home to sleep anyway.

828
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,436
Hey. Don't even think
about crossing this line.

829
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,064
Keep your smell and your snoring
on that side of the room.

830
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,652
Don't even grind your teeth.

831
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,245
Typhoon Lucy is moving
through the metropolitan area

832
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,205
with maximum instantaneous wind speed
reaching 40…

833
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,666
Strong wind and rain are to be expected,

834
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,043
so please refrain from going outdoors.

835
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,549
Please stay clear of streams
and mountainous areas…

836
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,883
What the hell?

837
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,093
It stinks.

838
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,470
Are you kidding me?

839
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,096
When will we clean this up?

840
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,016
That reminds me! I'm sorry about this,

841
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,144
but I have classes back-to-back today.

842
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,270
-What?
-Hey!

843
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,899
I have classes too.
We'll clean up together later.

844
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:10,817
Hey.

845
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,447
I can't believe they bailed on us.

846
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,909
Jin-gu, you have a free period…

847
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,202
You said free period…

848
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,956
Jin-gu, that slacker.

849
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,168
Jindo dog of the club room, my ass.

850
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,678
All right. Let's get cleaning.

851
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,610
-One, two, three.
-Right.

852
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,321
Jeez, you're strong.

853
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,667
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED

854
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,424
Here.

855
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,815
Hey, are you done?

856
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,458
You're getting a call.

857
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,127
Can you let me go?

858
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,297
What? Oh, sure.

859
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,682
Hey, Ji-na.

860
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,310
Did Kim Bom join your band?

861
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,438
Mr. Yun told me. What a surprise.

862
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,065
I heard she sold her songs to you.

863
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,358
What are they like?

864
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,692
Unique,

865
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,402
but it makes you hum along.

866
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,406
It seemed as though she was reluctantly
selling them for money.

867
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,658
She was quite bold.

868
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,744
I'll buy her songs at an even better rate,
so tell her not to look elsewhere.

869
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,788
And you're super picky.

870
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,373
You must've really liked them.

871
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:15,418
It's a shame. They'd be perfect for you.

872
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,962
Are they that good?

873
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,089
Should I get you anything
for your new band?

874
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,548
Tell me whatever you need.

875
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,258
Can't I be

876
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,886
your anonymous sponsor
behind my dad's back?

877
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,555
No way. It'll only keep me
in the doghouse longer.

878
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,476
I'll be in touch.

879
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,022
Are you already off to your part-time job?

880
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,774
Yes.

881
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,860
I've taken on more shifts.
I must be in a money-grubbing mode.

882
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,405
I'll be working until the evening
and won't be back.

883
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,489
See you.

884
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,491
If you're that busy,

885
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,619
when will we practice and build teamwork?

886
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,790
Set aside time for practice
three days a week.

887
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,626
I never got around to that
even in my old band.

888
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,628
I can't find the time.

889
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,173
But I'll practice at night alone
to keep up with the band.

890
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,258
Bye!

891
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,974
Bye!

892
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,186
Hi.

893
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,323
Where's the piano?

894
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,242
The piano?

895
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,368
I sold it.

896
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,662
Someone wanted it badly.

897
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,747
What?

898
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,166
How can you sell it?

899
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,209
You promised to sell it to me one day.

900
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,336
When? It'll take you forever to save up.

901
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,881
Anyway, now that the piano's gone,

902
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,425
you don't have to come in for work.

903
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,719
You know how business
has been slow lately.

904
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,221
Hiring part-timers
has only put me in the red.

905
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,348
But sir,

906
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,934
how could you…

907
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,020
Ta-da!

908
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,980
Is this piano really mine?

909
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,567
Of course. It's for your seventh birthday.

910
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,778
Bom-bom, are you that happy?

911
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,237
I'm over the moon!

912
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,489
Mommy's happy too.

913
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,033
This is mine now.

914
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,952
Mom, you're also mine.

915
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,043
Take care, sir.

916
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,754
-Right.
-Thank you for everything.

917
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,880
Sure.

918
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,657
Bunny-hop.

919
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,327
How are you here?

920
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,500
What's going on?

921
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,293
I'm buying your time.

922
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,173
What are you saying?

923
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,592
And I'll refuse your refusal.

924
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,220
The restaurant owner told me

925
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,848
the piano was the reason
you kept working there.

926
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,057
So what else could I do?

927
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,309
I needed to make an investment
for my band.

928
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,396
Come to the practice three times a week.
That's all I ask of you.

929
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:25,859
Why are you going to such great lengths?

930
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,026
Because I want us

931
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,821
to be in a band for as long as possible.

932
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,338
Aren't you going to play it?

933
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,386
See what I did?

934
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,514
I played mi.

935
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,376
You know what? I have to go.

936
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,546
Where are you going? What's this about?

937
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,631
Hey!

938
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,463
Mr. Kang?

939
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,848
What are you doing here?

940
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,309
I wanted to see you, so I asked around.

941
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,270
I see you're not thrilled to see me.

942
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,730
Ji-na's been keeping me updated.

943
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,443
It's the drink we had that day.

944
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,778
Coffee cocktail.

945
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,573
I thought about this from every angle.

946
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,867
But I was still confused,
so I came here to ask once again.

947
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,703
I don't care how menacing I was.

948
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,956
You still shouldn't treat me
the way you are.

949
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,791
What are you getting at?

950
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,128
How long will you keep
avoiding my question?

951
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,006
Are you avoiding it on purpose?

952
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,883
Why are you taking it this far?

953
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,719
Wasn't kicking me out of The Crown enough?

954
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,222
Why are you trying to get me
kicked out of the university too?

955
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,349
What are you having Mr. Kang look into?

956
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,559
What's your interest in Bom?

957
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,060
Why are you doing this?

958
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,687
What did I ever do to you?

959
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,732
Just tell me already.

960
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:15,945
You…

961
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,700
Are you saying you don't know
what you did?

962
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:22,869
I don't.

963
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,705
But I'm dying to know.

964
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,082
That's why I'm going to turn

965
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,084
into the jerk from that night.

966
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,216
If I win, you'll answer all my questions.

967
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,218
About whatever you're hiding

968
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,429
and what happened six years ago.

969
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,291
Why didn't he say anything?

970
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,421
Why didn't he lose it
like he did that night?

971
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:14,689
Excuse me, but aren't you SAGYE?

972
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,694
Who knew I'd get to have
a celebrity customer?

973
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,240
What could've been so upsetting

974
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,160
that it made you
drown yourself in alcohol?

975
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:31,497
Drink prices have gone up lately,
and soju is now 7,000 won a bottle--

976
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,999
What the…

977
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,380
Why won't he pick up
after leaving like that?

978
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,906
Sa Gye?

979
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,662
Did you have a lot to drink?

980
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,581
I thought you were staying sober.

981
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,128
Pull it together, will you?

982
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,463
Can you walk?

983
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,231
My…

984
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,192
Bom-bom.

985
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,183
Mom?

986
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,274
Don't take advantage of Bom again.

987
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:06,277
But liking her first
doesn't mean she's yours.

988
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,570
Love isn't first come, first served.

989
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,072
He shows up whenever he wants.

990
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,699
He's so annoying.

991
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:12,867
My fellow bandmates!

992
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,202
We're officially set to perform
at the university festival.

993
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,704
You should show them

994
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:19,707
that SAGYE is still a star
despite the setbacks.

995
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,584
Drop out of school and quit the band.

996
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,753
It'll only hurt Kim Bom.

997
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,714
I could put her in danger?

998
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,090
Bom!

999
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,135
