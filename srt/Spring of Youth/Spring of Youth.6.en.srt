1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
ALL CHARACTERS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,351
The guitar I mangled before.

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,897
I got you another just like it.

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,317
I know it'll be hard,
but could you forgive me, slowly?

6
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,284
I rearranged your room
the way I thought would work best.

7
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,660
I hope you'll like it.

8
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,915
I also received confirmation
from The Crown's agency.

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,667
The rest is up to you.

10
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,005
I'll do it.

11
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,256
I will.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,217
No, I'll give it my all.

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,844
So that no one remembers
who I'm replacing.

14
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,805
I'll outshine Sa Gye.

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,350
I'll prove myself.

16
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,810
Good.

17
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,978
We're good now.

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,232
Everything is finally back
on the right track.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,240
JO & JO ENTERTAINMENT: CEO JO
SANG-HEON ARTIST: SEO TAE-YANG

20
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,457
I truly welcome you as the new member
and leader of The Crown.

21
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,670
- Thank you.
- All in due time,

22
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,548
you'll greet the members
once the album is released.

23
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,467
It'll be kept under wraps from the media
for the time being.

24
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,760
That's fine by me.

25
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,519
Is the new song out today?

26
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,565
That's right.
It'll be dropped today exactly at noon.

27
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,608
That's in ten minutes.

28
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,199
It's good.

29
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,286
- The song's incredible.
- The Crown nailed it again.

30
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,955
It's amazing!

31
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,873
THE CROWN'S STILL GOING
FOR A REASON

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,172
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

33
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,844
What the hell?

34
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,638
Bom, what's wrong?

35
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,723
- This…
- What?

36
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,141
This? What?

37
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,810
What is this song?

38
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,062
Oh, this song?

39
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,232
It's The Crown's new song
that dropped at noon today.

40
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,693
Isn't it great? I just love it.

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>You're still writing songs, right?</i>

42
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,452
<i>If you're selling,</i>
<i>I'm willing to offer top dollar.</i>

43
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,165
What's with her?

44
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,424
<i>…to let you go</i>

45
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,928
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

46
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,222
<i>Say "I'll see you later"</i>

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>Tell me it's never really bye, bye, bye</i>

48
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,398
Can I ask how you came up with this song?

49
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,777
I felt down, so I went to the ocean.

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,364
I walked past a woman there,

51
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,950
and I saw myself in her.

52
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,743
Her eyes looked so sad,

53
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,955
but she kept her head held high,

54
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,456
making her seem even lonelier.

55
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,502
That's when the melody and the lyrics
of this song came to me.

56
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,380
Do you mind if I ask why you were sad?

57
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,133
Were you going through a breakup
with someone you loved?

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,427
Truth be told,

59
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,265
I had a crush on someone for a long time.

60
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,143
Someone as charming as you didn't have
your feelings reciprocated?

61
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,561
That's hard to believe.

62
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,982
It's that kind of bias
that makes me feel even lonelier.

63
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,150
But I'm over it now.

64
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,529
I feel like I've moved on
to a new chapter in my life.

65
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,907
I'm ready to experience

66
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,867
new love.

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,003
Why did The Crown release
your song as their own?

68
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,839
- Did you sell it to Ji-na?
- Of course, I didn't.

69
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,590
That song is about me and my mom.

70
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,051
Why would I sell it to anyone? Move.

71
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,178
I'll go with you.

72
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,347
Why? How is this your business?

73
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,975
I'm the only one
who knows the song is yours.

74
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,228
You can't do it alone. You don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

75
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,772
No one in there will believe you.

76
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,774
I don't trust you either.

77
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,443
So stay out of my business.

78
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,902
If you keep getting in my way,

79
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,156
I'll assume you sold off
my song to Jo Ji-na.

80
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,033
Like you said,

81
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,243
only the two of us knew this song.

82
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,001
You can't go in there.

83
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,919
Tell her it's Kim Bom.

84
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,588
This is urgent, and I must talk to her!

85
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,423
It's hard to say
when the interview will end.

86
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,133
You should make an appointment first.

87
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,344
Aren't you Kim Bom?

88
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,890
What brings you here?
Are you here to see me?

89
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,518
- Do you really not know why I'm here?
- Why else would I be asking?

90
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,813
Did something happen to Gye?

91
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
Fine.

92
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,947
If you're really clueless,
I'll say it right here.

93
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,326
Are you sure you don't mind
having reporters here?

94
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,912
I wouldn't mind,

95
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,498
but it's rude to keep a guest
standing in the hallway.

96
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,665
Shall we head inside?

97
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,101
Let's hear it, then.

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,895
Why did you barge in here
without an appointment?

99
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,814
When did you steal my song?

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,981
Why did you do this?

101
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,568
The lyrics and music
of The Crown's new single match mine.

102
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,113
What do you mean?
What are you saying I stole?

103
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,781
Don't act dumb.

104
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,033
You altered the chords
and the arrangement,

105
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,618
but even that…

106
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,954
It was too obvious.

107
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,872
Are you talking about

108
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,916
the song you sold to me?

109
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,876
No, not that!

110
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,295
Why do you keep playing dumb?

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,756
You obviously saw my songbook. When…

112
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,723
No way. On our retreat?

113
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm off to the van.

114
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,156
- Are you having fun?
- Yes.

115
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,866
Why aren't you joining us out there?

116
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,750
It was then. I'm sure of it.

117
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,587
You looked through my songbook
that was in my backpack.

118
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,589
That's when the keychain fell off.

119
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,174
Ms. Kim,

120
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,010
don't you think you're being
a little delusional?

121
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,596
I don't even want to know
what song you're referring to,

122
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,264
but how are you so sure that you're

123
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,516
the only one
who can write a song like that?

124
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,269
There's no song that only you can write.

125
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,813
You're not exactly extraordinary.

126
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,441
How can you prove you wrote this song?

127
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,693
Show me if you can.

128
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,944
Why should I?

129
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,030
Because I know you stole it.

130
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,074
I can prove that it's my song.

131
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,371
Right here. It's all here in my songbook.

132
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,501
All the revisions I've made
over the years are all here.

133
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,127
Also…

134
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,797
This necklace is the proof of all that.

135
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,804
I'll request the song to be taken down.

136
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,225
And you'll have to give it your all

137
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,476
proving

138
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,520
you didn't steal my song.

139
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,442
See for yourself.

140
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,904
I also have a songbook.

141
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,533
Like you, I also spent years
revising my work.

142
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,452
The entire process is in there.

143
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,455
You're lying.

144
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,041
This can't be.

145
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,835
Bring me evidence that's irrefutable,

146
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,338
not just circumstantial.

147
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,257
Because an unbacked claim
is simply a delusion.

148
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,636
I answered your question,
so please leave now.

149
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,931
I've got better things to do
than handling losers' tantrums.

150
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,599
Can you see my visitor out?

151
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,476
Call security if you need to.

152
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,022
I'll sue you.

153
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,609
No lie can go unexposed,
and the law will hold you accountable.

154
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,989
I won't stop you
from getting into a dogfight.

155
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,448
However,

156
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,953
keep in mind that I already hold
the copyright to the song.

157
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,624
You're…

158
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,419
pure evil.

159
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,801
Let go of me. Let go!

160
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,564
Let go. Let go of me.

161
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,191
- This is unfair.
- Bom!

162
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,693
I didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,904
She's the one who stole my song.

164
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,920
I couldn't help but call the police.

165
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,882
The last thing we need is a scandal
on the day the song drops.

166
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,800
An explanation seems to be in order.

167
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,304
Was the song written by Kim Bom?

168
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,723
I wanted to dig us out
of the hole we were in.

169
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,060
I couldn't let my mistake
delay the release of the new song.

170
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,437
You call this digging us out of a hole?

171
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,231
Why'd you steal
from Kim Bom of all people?

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,109
Neither Kim Bom nor Sa Gye
will let this slide!

173
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,529
Why did you let us get involved
with those two again?

174
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,366
You should've discussed this with me.

175
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,826
Then things wouldn't have gotten this far!

176
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,496
I wanted your acknowledgement.

177
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,207
And I wanted that song for myself.

178
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,878
Things happened so fast,

179
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,964
and I was too afraid to confess.

180
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,220
Father, please help me this one time.

181
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,223
I'll do anything.

182
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,184
I can't go down like this.

183
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,395
If people find out I stole the song--

184
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,479
Shut up!

185
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,362
Listen to me.

186
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,240
From this moment on,
forget that you ever stole the song.

187
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,368
Don't ever mention it, even in your dream.

188
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,619
Do you hear me?

189
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,669
Ji-na, that song is yours. Okay?

190
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,921
You wrote it.

191
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,882
So defend it with your life.

192
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,927
If this gets out, you, me,

193
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,847
and Jo & Jo will all go down.

194
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,519
Bom, hey.

195
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,354
Are you all right?

196
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
Why are you here?

197
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,525
I was obviously worried.
Do you think I came here for fun?

198
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,735
Mind your own business and leave.

199
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,571
Do you and Sa Gye know each other?

200
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,157
Yes, I'm here as her guardian.

201
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,617
Guardian, my ass.

202
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,952
I don't know him at all.

203
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,704
I don't care about any of that.

204
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,331
Trespassing on private property
and vandalism.

205
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,125
It might not end with just a fine.

206
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,253
I'll make sure to give her an earful.

207
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,965
She hasn't been in her right mind
after a serious breakup.

208
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,385
- The jerk must work at Jo & Jo.
- Hey.

209
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,636
What is this crap?

210
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,057
I don't have the energy to deal with you,
so don't piss me off and leave.

211
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,851
- Go!
- But…

212
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,812
Will you just stay put?

213
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,357
It's actually time for her meds.

214
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,027
She's not usually this violent.
I'll make sure

215
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,865
she apologizes to those at Jo & Jo,
so could you give her a pass?

216
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,619
Are you insane? Why should I apologize?

217
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,955
I'll sue them
and request the song to be taken down.

218
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,457
Be quiet.

219
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,335
I'll make the guy who broke your heart
kneel before you.

220
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,461
Sounds good?

221
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,593
Did Jo & Jo put you up to this?

222
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,595
Did they threaten you to silence me?

223
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,723
- Don't get worked up.
- How can I not?

224
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,683
They stole my song.

225
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,353
Because you won't win
unless you stay cool-headed.

226
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,231
If you go after them without a plan,

227
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,358
they might…

228
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,569
bury you.

229
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
How could they bury me

230
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,574
when I'm not famous
and have nothing to lose?

231
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,451
It'll be their reputation
that takes the hit.

232
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,037
I'll continue to fight.
I won't let them have it.

233
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,457
- That's the song I wrote for my mom.
- That's why

234
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,334
you need to calm down.

235
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,836
Would you rather lose it in vain,
just like your mom?

236
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,300
What do you mean?

237
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,636
Well, I…

238
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,560
I mean, that's how important the song is.

239
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,770
Save the advice.

240
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,815
We mean nothing to each other now.

241
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,026
We could at least…

242
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,864
be friends.

243
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,325
I never considered you a friend.

244
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,625
I'm not saying you shouldn't fight.

245
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,462
I'm saying you should be smart.
I can't tell you about it just yet…

246
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,884
but there's a missing piece.

247
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,845
Just give me the benefit
of the doubt and trust me.

248
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,763
What is it that I don't know?

249
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,436
That your enemy

250
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,689
is more afraid of you
than you can imagine.

251
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,109
They're panicking,
desperate to hide something even worse.

252
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,368
I'll help you.

253
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,996
As long as you keep up the fight,

254
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,206
I'll be there by your side.

255
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,501
First, let's think about what we can do.

256
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,762
The members are still unaware
that you're joining the band.

257
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,931
For now, you'll use this locker.

258
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,308
You can use SAGYE's practice studio.

259
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,645
Just make sure no one sees you.

260
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,481
Sure. I got it.

261
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,029
SAGYE

262
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,744
THE CROWN FOREVER!
SAGYE, INO, KADI

263
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,897
<i>Why do I feel like I'm being chased?</i>

264
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,150
<i>Why?</i>

265
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,485
<i>You told me</i>

266
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,487
you liked Bom first.

267
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,407
But liking her first
doesn't mean she's yours.

268
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,159
<i>Love isn't first come, first served.</i>

269
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,744
You're wrong.

270
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,164
Time never betrays you.

271
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,400
<i>I don't want to know why you did this.</i>

272
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,526
<i>What matters</i>

273
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,821
<i>is that I lost someone I cared about.</i>

274
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,656
<i>You're just like CEO Jo.</i>

275
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,076
<i>Shameless and evil.</i>

276
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,085

DELETED POST

284
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,618
<i>I can't post any negative post</i>
<i>about Jo & Jo.</i>

285
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,622
<i>So this is how far they'll go?</i>

286
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,840
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

287
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,677
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

288
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,011
<i>Say "I'll see you later"</i>

289
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,058
See? The melody is identical.

290
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,393
It was plagiarized.

291
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,771
Well, I can't say for sure.
Is there proof?

292
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,398
This is my songbook.

293
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,692
You can see that the pages are worn out.

294
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,736
You can even see the date I noted.

295
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,823
Isn't this enough to file a lawsuit?
It is, right?

296
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,325
I guess you could file a lawsuit.

297
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,579
That's not what I want to hear!
You should say I can win this case.

298
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,707
I haven't won any cases yet, you see.

299
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,836
Anyway, the process
of proving song plagiarism

300
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,463
is time-consuming and tiring.

301
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,090
It's not worth the effort.

302
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,051
On top of that, the other party
has already copyrighted the song.

303
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,970
They fast-tracked it,
expecting this to happen.

304
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,431
Experts will recognize
that the song was plagiarized.

305
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,142
Please help me, sir.

306
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,394
First, please calm down.

307
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:52,024
Why don't we talk about
an irrefutable piece of evidence?

308
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,150
What can you present?

309
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,236
Why do I need to prove anything
when it's clearly mine?

310
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,239
One is soft and lyrical
while the other is hard rock.

311
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,618
How can it be plagiarism
when they have different styles?

312
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,662
They took my song
and arranged it with an intense rock beat.

313
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,165
The melody is identical.
How can you not see that?

314
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,792
You see…

315
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,711
I know music.

316
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,088
I was a musician myself.

317
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,757
What do you take me for?

318
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,009
Look. Lee Hong…

319
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,178
You know, the band that starts with an F.

320
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,930
Darn it.

321
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,433
Anyway, it'll be hard to win this case.

322
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:32,231
Jo & Jo will hire the best lawyer possible
and come at you.

323
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,899
How do you expect to win?

324
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,068
To be honest, I don't think

325
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,737
I could win.

326
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,575
Look how tiny my office is.

327
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,287
Take it and leave.

328
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,749
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>

329
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,803
Reporter Han, why couldn't I reach you?
I've been calling nonstop.

330
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,430
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

331
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,765
You don’t know why I’m here.

332
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,145
Look, Jo & Jo has already spread the word.

333
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,982
That you'll come
at The Crown's new album, out of spite.

334
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,777
Leave it be. This won't change anything.
You'll only embarrass yourself.

335
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,988
You have it all wrong.

336
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,408
Don't believe what Mr. Jo says.
It's all lies.

337
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,244
Please. Please help me out.

338
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,706
- What's happening is unfair.
- Get a grip on yourself.

339
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
No reporter will help you.

340
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,211
All entertainment news outlets
are connected to Jo & Jo.

341
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,588
Jo & Jo owns half of their shares.

342
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,842
You won't get this advice anywhere else.

343
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,261
Take care of yourself.

344
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,560
Mr. Han, I'll wait for your call!

345
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,647
I trust you. You're the only remaining
reliable reporter!

346
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,108
Please call me!

347
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,713
Have you moved out of Kim Bom's house?

348
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,134
I have nothing to say to you.

349
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,263
Unless you're here to admit to the theft,
just keep moving.

350
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,516
Why are you doing this to me?

351
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,852
What do you mean I stole?

352
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,438
How can you accuse me
after only hearing Kim Bom's side?

353
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,732
It's a song I could've easily written.

354
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,734
So why do you think I couldn't have?

355
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,070
You couldn't have written it.

356
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,530
You can fool others, but not me.

357
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,824
Shouldn't you at least

358
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,661
give me the benefit of the doubt?

359
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,538
When you got into trouble
and got kicked out,

360
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,249
I begged my father on my knees.

361
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,086
So why won't you do anything for me?

362
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,253
You can kneel again…

363
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,090
in front of Bom.

364
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,925
It's not too late to ask for forgiveness.

365
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,802
Is that all you can say to me?

366
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,428
Do I…

367
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,723
Do I mean nothing to you?

368
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,811
I worked every day for six years
just to help you become a star.

369
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,064
I followed you everywhere,
from Europe to the US,

370
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,733
pouring my life into designing
your wardrobe and performances

371
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,818
at the expense of my own.

372
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,238
And this is how you repay me?

373
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,032
For Kim Bom, whom you only recently met,

374
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,619
you'll throw away our relationship?

375
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,247
You and Mr. Jo may have opened doors,

376
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,125
but I climbed to the top by myself.

377
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,002
I took every step alone.

378
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,337
What?

379
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,047
So why can't you do the same?

380
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,300
Does success have to come
at the cost of others?

381
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,345
Is that how you made it so far?

382
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,474
It's pathetic.

383
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,620
<i>Tae-yang, are you aware</i>
<i>that you're addicted to caffeine?</i>

384
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,082
<i>Do you want to die while studying</i>
<i>all night? Please stop drinking those.</i>

385
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,168
<i>You need quality sleep.</i>

386
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,715
Jeez, it looks tasty.

387
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,107
What's wrong with me today?

388
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,527
Breakfast is ready!

389
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,447
In five seconds, I'm clearing the table.

390
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,449
Goodness.

391
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,369
Seaweed soup. Just what I wanted.

392
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,706
Again, there isn't any meat.

393
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,167
Meat? In this weather, mussels are better.

394
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,754
I like my eggs over easy,
but you always fully cook the yolk.

395
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,756
Please keep that in mind.

396
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,675
Being picky, are we?

397
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,011
I cooked them thoroughly
since they had expired.

398
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,055
I was being considerate, okay?

399
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,514
Anyway, where is everyone else?

400
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,309
Beats me. What's taking Bom so long?

401
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,105
Ms. Kim, can I also have a perilla leaf?

402
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,982
Bom left ages ago.

403
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,735
Even though she makes very little,
she's incredibly busy.

404
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,654
It's not like her jobs pay well.

405
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,197
It's nicely seasoned, right?

406
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,241
- Totally.
- I know.

407
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,076
Did Bom get some sleep?

408
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,536
I'm not a watchdog. How would I know that?

409
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,373
The soup will get cold. Hurry downstairs!

410
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,708
Bae Gyu-ri!

411
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,296
Look at you dragging your feet.

412
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,839
Mom, were you in a heavy metal band?

413
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,175
A fangirl of Jeon In-kwon
and not Shin Seung-hun, right?

414
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,261
Would it kill you to speak more softly?

415
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,388
SAGYE!

416
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,141
What the heck? Why are you screaming?

417
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,559
When did you get back?

418
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,479
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

419
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,316
I thought you had dropped out of school
and left for good.

420
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,946
Goodness.

421
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,031
Don't you ever leave me again.

422
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,869
I was worried sick.

423
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,289
I couldn't sleep
and completely bombed my exams.

424
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,546
That isn't my fault.

425
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,007
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

426
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,968
How embarrassing.

427
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,015
Here for your stuff?

428
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,725
What do you mean?

429
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,814
What is this brat doing here?
When did you get here?

430
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,065
A while ago.

431
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,902
You brat. How dare you come back
like nothing ever happened?

432
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,157
This isn't a coin karaoke
that you can come and go as you please.

433
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,534
Get over here, you brat.

434
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,369
You…

435
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,956
You dodged that?

436
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,624
Like that'd stop me.

437
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,086
Why you… Get back here, you brat.

438
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,472
What's going on?

439
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,475
Why are you staying here?
Where's Tae-yang?

440
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,187
Unbelievable.

441
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,564
I'm gone for a few days,
and I come back to a new roommate?

442
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,066
You're one to talk!

443
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,319
You prick.

444
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,571
You quit the band
without so much as an explanation.

445
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,947
You have some nerve coming back.

446
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,034
The band broke up because of you.

447
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,203
Do you have any idea
the heartache you've caused?

448
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,537
You irresponsible jerk.

449
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,622
Just get lost!

450
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,712
Jin-gu, I know you're upset,
but at least give me a heads-up.

451
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,298
That was cowardly.

452
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,759
I see that punch wasn't enough.

453
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,435
Jin-gu, a punch from a trained drummer
could be deadly.

454
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,688
Are you kidding me?
I should beat the crap out of you.

455
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,025
Hello, Reporter Han.

456
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,236
Really?

457
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,697
Thank you so much.
I'll seriously owe you one.

458
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,117
I'll be on my way now.

459
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,790
Did you just smile?

460
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,375
Get back here!

461
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,629
SAGYE, run.

462
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,135
Stop, my ass!

463
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,053
I'm teaching him a lesson today.

464
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,431
Who are you to say that?
Don't you know who he is?

465
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,267
Take it out on me instead!

466
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,531
Hey.

467
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,493
You… Let go of me.

468
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,954
Let go while I'm asking nicely.

469
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,877
It's your fault!

470
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,796
Why won't you let SAGYE alone?

471
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,140
<i>So why can't you do the same?</i>

472
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,977
<i>Does success have to come</i>
<i>at the cost of others?</i>

473
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,062
<i>Is that how you made it so far?</i>

474
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,321
Why did you ask to see me?

475
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,573
Don't even think
about trying to pay me off.

476
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,577
No way I'm backing down
after that visit to the police station.

477
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,871
Of course. I didn't think you would.

478
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,249
I guess I can throw courtesy
out the window.

479
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,046
I came across an interesting video
in my dad's office this morning.

480
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,467
My dad must be deeply upset by all this.

481
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,636
It's understandable,

482
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,807
given that a mere 20-year-old
is making baseless accusations.

483
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,350
In two hours,

484
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,437
he will release this video to the press.

485
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,189
You probably know this,

486
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,942
but my dad is a man of his word.

487
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,944
Tell him to go ahead.

488
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,738
I'm not guilty of anything.

489
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,659
Did he catch me on video stealing,
like a certain someone?

490
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,286
Let's check it out together.

491
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,256
Only you can stop this video
from being released.

492
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,383
You're smart,
so I'll let you think it over.

493
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,717
Ms. Jo Ji-na,

494
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,513
is this who you are?

495
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,099
I can't just sit back
and let you come at me.

496
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,602
I have to do what it takes
to defend myself.

497
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
Don't you agree?

498
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,652
SA GYE

499
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,953
Promise me you won't
take issue with this song.

500
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,789
Just sign right here.

501
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,000
What if I won't?

502
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,003
Then, SAGYE will lose any chance
of making a comeback.

503
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,088
But if you sign this document,

504
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,632
I'll make sure this video stays buried.

505
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,758
You have my word.

506
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,598
My answer…

507
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,517
is no.

508
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,937
Don't you care about
what'll happen to Gye?

509
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,981
I thought you were close friends.

510
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,733
I'm disappointed.

511
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,153
The Sa Gye I know

512
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,655
would never resort to violence.

513
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,490
You should know that too.

514
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,827
If he went as far
as to destroy Mr. Jo's car,

515
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,704
Mr. Jo must have done

516
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,081
something terribly wrong.

517
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,208
Go ask your father

518
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,002
how he wronged Gye.

519
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,421
<i>How's that for an answer?</i>

520
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,559
We're good, Bom. I got the approval.
Reporter Han agreed to help us.

521
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,645
How?

522
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:23,107
Sometime this week,
he'll gather some reporters for us.

523
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,192
Isn't it great?

524
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,445
Mr. Han may seem cold,
but he's quite loyal.

525
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,948
He was more pissed off
about what they did to you.

526
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,284
You have your necklace and your songbook.

527
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,535
You also have me.

528
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,331
With the right counterattack,
you'll win your case.

529
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,500
- I'm hungry.
- What?

530
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,586
Sure. We should eat to fight properly.

531
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,837
What would you like to have?

532
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,931
They're all yours, so slow down.

533
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,183
I'm happy to treat you to all this,

534
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,061
but who runs up the bill at a cafe?

535
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,773
Now I feel better.

536
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,149
I'm good now. Bye.

537
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,655
Hey, where are you going?
We have to meet with Mr. Han.

538
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,074
I've let go of that song.
I won't sue them.

539
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,202
What are you talking about?
Why won't you sue?

540
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,496
I can write

541
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,707
other songs.

542
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,794
Jo Ji-na won't be able
to write any more good songs,

543
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,587
but I can.

544
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,757
- That's true, but--
- That's why I won't sue them.

545
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,051
I've had it with their dirty tricks.
And you…

546
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,888
Stay out of my sight.

547
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,268
How is that possible
when I'm back as your housemate?

548
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,394
Don't you get it?

549
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,479
I don't want to see you again.

550
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,566
I called you here because
our last memory together was the worst.

551
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,860
Remembering how you were that day

552
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,738
was enough to make me feel sick forever.

553
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,532
I thought this sweetness
would mask that bitterness.

554
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,542
Don't even come near my house.
Don't follow me out.

555
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,836
I can pack a mean punch.

556
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,173
Hey, Bom.

557
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,966
Bom!

558
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,054
Why won't you sue them?
I don't understand.

559
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,556
I don't want to. Why the fuss?

560
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,476
Are you stupid?

561
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,269
You wrote the song for your mom.

562
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,354
You kept it because it meant a lot.

563
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,440
So you should sing it.
Why let someone else do it?

564
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,026
That's right.

565
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,155
I wanted to sing that song. With you.

566
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,824
But who broke the promise?

567
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,827
It'll be sung by you and me.

568
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,746
You have to be the one to sing this.

569
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,372
<i>Who else could sing it but me?</i>

570
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,334
You abandoned me first.

571
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,212
And I don't think

572
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,380
I can sing this song anymore.

573
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,885
We're done.

574
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:16,072
<i>Keep your promise</i>
<i>to erase that video of Gye.</i>

575
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,156
<i>From Kim Bom.</i>

576
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,493
Ms. Jo.

577
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,497
It's been handled.

578
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,833
I think that dash cam video you gave me

579
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,168
scared her.

580
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,217
All right!

581
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,303
Here are the records
that The Crown has set.

582
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,722
The fastest single to break
into the World Chart's top ten,

583
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,642
the most-viewed
and highest-trending music video.

584
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,726
You did it all!

585
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,023
It's the most covered song as well.

586
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,152
Good job, Producer Jo.

587
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,361
Good work, everyone.

588
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,113
Raise your glasses.

589
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,915
Mr. Kang, join us.
We should celebrate together.

590
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,333
I can't hold my liquor, sir.

591
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,919
But I'll drink.

592
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:23,181
With our new single being a huge hit,
it's time I step up as the leader, Mr. Jo.

593
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,269
- You'll do what?
- I'll take over as the leader.

594
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,812
Are you already a bit tipsy?

595
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,690
SUNDER.

596
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,068
Do you think you're a big shot?

597
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,946
You think you can demand
the leader position from me?

598
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,741
That's not what I meant.

599
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,786
I'm sorry, sir.

600
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,916
I was going to save it for later,
but since we're on the topic,

601
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,000
I'll do it now.

602
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,084
Soon,

603
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,712
The Crown will get a new member.

604
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,716
And who's that?

605
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,427
I can't reveal that just yet
due to security reasons.

606
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,097
Just know that there's no one
more fitting for The Crown.

607
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,893
He will be the team's new leader.

608
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,403
Who could he be keeping under wraps?

609
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,200
- Are you off to smoke?
- Yes.

610
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,661
Isn't that Mr. Kang's wife?

611
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,537
Yes, I think that's her.

612
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,456
She must be here to pick him up.

613
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,792
Check out that fancy car.
It looks expensive.

614
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,461
Did he win the lottery?

615
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,173
Actually, I asked him
the same thing and he said

616
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,841
that CEO Jo gave it to him.

617
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,137
Did Mr. Jo own an SUV?
I thought he only drove sedans.

618
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,764
It wasn't exactly his.

619
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,600
I think it belonged
to either a friend or a relative.

620
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,936
It was set to be scrapped
due to water damage,

621
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,854
but Mr. Kang gave it to his wife instead.

622
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,523
- Water damage?
- Yes.

623
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,109
- It's chilly. Let's head inside.
- Sure.

624
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,736
Water damage?

625
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,123
Why aren't you picking up?

626
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,710
<i>Gye, I just saw an SUV.</i>

627
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,379
<i>Apparently, CEO Jo gave it to Mr. Kang--</i>

628
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,733
Did Auntie swing by?

629
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,005
THE LATE YU JEONG-AE

630
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,089
Mom.

631
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:04,967
It's me.

632
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,553
Your daughter, Bom-bom.

633
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,931
Mom,

634
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,684
you're still young and beautiful.

635
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,398
I'm glad.

636
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,867
Mom, did you miss me?

637
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,458
I missed you so much, Mom.

638
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,798
I wanted to come here every single day.

639
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,393
But I couldn't bring myself to.

640
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,148
It's still too painful…

641
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,860
to see your face.

642
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,532
Also, I'm sorry.

643
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,200
I…

644
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,455
I even lost the song I wrote for you.

645
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,419
I'm so pathetic, aren't I?

646
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,079
What's this?

647
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,842
- Auntie.
- Yes?

648
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,552
Did you go see Mom yesterday?

649
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,388
Me? No. Her birthday is still months away.

650
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,515
I'm so cold.
Am I coming down with something?

651
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,268
Someone went to see Mom yesterday.
Who could it have been?

652
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,854
Probably her friend.
I hear they do reunions there.

653
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,189
She was popular, you know.

654
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,399
- And those flowers?
- Didn't you bring them?

655
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,818
Goodness. Then it must have been
that brat Jin-gu.

656
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,529
He likely feels bad for freeloading.

657
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,699
But slabs of pork would've been better
than those flowers.

658
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,119
There's nothing to like about him.
Can you hang these to dry?

659
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,932
Bom-bom.

660
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,768
Mom?

661
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,446
What are you doing?

662
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,198
Isn't it obvious?

663
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,951
I've been cleaning. The house is a mess.

664
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,120
Also, shouldn't you keep the piano clean?
It was a gift.

665
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,956
You can't practice like this.

666
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,874
We're doing what here?

667
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,002
Heave-ho!

668
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,588
- Heave-ho!
- Hang those later and get the equipment.

669
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,799
SAGYE, Gyu-ri's here.

670
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,510
What took you so long?
You should've set everything up already.

671
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,054
Cut the chatter and give me a hand.

672
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,138
It's heavy.

673
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,307
- Hey, that's expensive.
- It just dropped.

674
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,517
What are you all doing?

675
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,977
Obviously, practice.

676
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,729
TWO SAGYE is back. Didn't SAGYE tell you?

677
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,357
The studio ban’s ending soon,
so we’ll practice here for now.

678
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,568
All right. Here's the sheet music.

679
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,486
Thanks.

680
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,494
What's your deal?
Why's it all so easy for you?

681
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,706
Who are you to reassemble the band
when you broke it up?

682
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,082
You said you're done with TWO SAGYE.

683
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,087
So what is all this?
Am I a joke to you? Is this all a game?

684
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,257
Why do you keep changing your mind
and irritating the hell out of me?

685
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,261
Put the instruments away.

686
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,221
I will never be in a band with you.

687
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,857
All right.
Don't join us if you're not up for it.

688
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,735
But can we at least perform this cover?

689
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,904
I found a song I like
for the first time in a while.

690
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,531
You can at least do that much.

691
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,451
Perform it yourselves
if you're that eager.

692
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,091
EXAM REGISTRATION SLIP

693
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:02,056
EXAM REGISTRATION SLIP
SEO TAE-YANG

694
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,229
Ta-da! I bet you didn't pack lunch.

695
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,899
I packed shrimp fried rice, your favorite,
and egg soup.

696
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,402
They'll stay warm until lunchtime,
so make sure to eat everything.

697
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,157
You shouldn't have bothered.
I was going to pick up some porridge.

698
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,034
You can't have that before an exam.

699
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,828
I made sure the eggs aren't lumpy,

700
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,580
so tackle all of those questions.

701
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,667
Our Hanju University High School
should produce the top-ranking student.

702
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,544
That reminds me. The exam slip.

703
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,921
Do you have it?

704
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,297
You don't?

705
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,091
Of course, I have it.

706
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,176
Just a second.

707
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,520
Here. I prayed for you.

708
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,981
SEO TAE-YANG, DON'T FRET!
KIM BOM IS PRAYING FOR YOU HARD!

709
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,986
Victory! I wish you good luck
on your CSAT!

710
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:01,698
I'll get going.

711
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,368
Tae-yang, good luck on your exam.

712
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,037
Get the correct answer,
whether you know it or not.

713
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,039
Let's get you to Hanju Med School!

714
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,209
<i>Go, Seo Tae-yang!</i>

715
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,351
KIM BOM

716
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,187
<i>Bom, are you doing well?</i>

717
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,648
<i>Could we perhaps meet up?</i>

718
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,818
<i>There's something I should tell you.</i>

719
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,759
TWO SAGYE BANNED
FROM USING THEIR STUDIO

720
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,966
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

721
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,595
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

722
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,986
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

723
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,241
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

724
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,997
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

725
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,749
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

726
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,417
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

727
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,711
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

728
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,797
<i>I find new things to do</i>

729
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,507
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

730
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,342
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

731
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,469
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

732
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,932
I added a rap section
to your original song.

733
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,685
Let's upload this as a cover song.

734
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,521
That darn song is being played
everywhere you go.

735
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,940
Will you keep avoiding it?
It's your song, isn't it?

736
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,818
You said only losers backed out
without a fight.

737
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,573
This is the hottest song right now,
so our cover will get a lot of views.

738
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,700
Even Jo & Jo will promote it.

739
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,244
That won't make it mine again.

740
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,498
- It'll be just one of many cover songs.
- Yours will be different.

741
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,253
Let's prove together that the original
stands in a league of its own.

742
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,799
You have me. What is there to fear?

743
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,467
What if…

744
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,763
you change your mind again?

745
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,267
What if you give up and run again?

746
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,935
That…

747
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:19,938
will never happen.

748
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,650
<i>I'll never run away again.</i>

749
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,779
<i>I swear on these very eyes.</i>

750
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,409
<i>Were your eyes always this beautiful?</i>

751
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,121
<i>Both eyes shining like the stars.</i>

752
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,585
Hey. You made me rush the cover,

753
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,920
so I recorded it only with a guitar.

754
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,964
I bet the audio quality was lousy.

755
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,884
No.

756
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,053
It's good.

757
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,971
Really?

758
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,186
Nice! Does that mean you approve?

759
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,146
That was my audition.

760
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,649
You acknowledge my talent, right?

761
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,109
When did you write the rap?

762
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,946
Writing the rap was a breeze,
thanks to the inspiring original song.

763
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,497
Come on. Let's go practice.

764
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,790
The others are waiting.

765
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,717
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

766
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,596
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

767
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,901
Mr. Kwon Hyeok-gi is here?

768
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,695
Yes, it's an emergency, sir.

769
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,155
He is asking you to perform the surgery.

770
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,741
Right. I just received a call
from the president's office.

771
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,538
Performing surgery on the floor leader
of the ruling party should be my priority.

772
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,706
Prep the OR immediately.

773
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,042
Kim Bok-rye's surgery is scheduled
for 3 p.m. today.

774
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,419
She's elderly and lives alone,

775
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,880
so the social welfare division
has specifically asked you to operate.

776
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,384
Push it to tomorrow.

777
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,636
You can't, sir.

778
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,806
Considering her age, her deteriorating
liver condition is a serious concern.

779
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,057
Time is of the essence.

780
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,184
Life and death is up
to the patient's will.

781
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,854
If her time has come,
we won't be able to change it.

782
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,023
- I'll operate on Mr. Kwon.
- But--

783
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,860
Make sure to schedule
the post-op briefing.

784
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,487
I'll be handling that myself too.
Get on it.

785
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,077
What in the world?

786
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,205
Is this a dumpster or what?

787
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,207
Are you kidding me?

788
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,419
Would it kill them
to clean up after eating?

789
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,630
This won't do the job. My gosh.

790
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,717
So much for washing these for him.

791
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,802
Why are they like this
when they haven't been worn?

792
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:00,056
I can already see
how this place will be without me.

793
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,808
It's basically a pigpen.

794
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,269
Goodness.

795
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:08,023
If it weren't for this, Sa Gye,
you'd only be getting the bare minimum.

796
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,191
My gosh.

797
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:12,944
I don't know why this makes my heart
skip a beat every time I see it.

798
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,907
In my early days,
my heart fluttered for Shin Seung-hun.

799
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,534
But now, it skips a beat
for a suitcase full of cash.

800
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,786
Goodness me.

801
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,706
Aren't these Jin-gu's?

802
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,458
Unbelievable.

803
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,629
I told him to put dirty clothes
in the laundry basket!

804
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,089
He's a freeloader, and yet
he's the most high-maintenance.

805
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,758
Goodness.

806
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,677
It's so worn out it's got holes.

807
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,596
This is basically a rag.

808
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,098
He's nothing but a homeless bum.

809
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,809
Just my luck.

810
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,102
Unbelievable.

811
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,397
All that stress has turned my hair gray.

812
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,775
How upsetting.

813
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,445
Ms. Kim, are there any snacks?
We're rehearsing on the rooftop.

814
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,864
Can't you see I'm busy dyeing my hair?

815
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,449
Drink tap water.

816
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,912
- Why are you dyeing it at home?
- To save money.

817
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:08,416
I'm low on cash because of a freeloader
who doesn't pay rent.

818
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,461
Ask Gye to help you out.
I heard his mom was a hairdresser,

819
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,588
so a dye job will be a piece of cake.

820
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,507
I'm not like you, you know.

821
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,969
Of course, the freeloader knows
exactly what to take advantage of.

822
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,262
Unbelievable.

823
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,849
Wait. What's that around your neck?

824
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,517
A rag, of course.

825
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,061
It looks familiar.

826
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,357
Jin-gu, Bom's back! Hurry on up!

827
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,234
Sure, I'll be right there!

828
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,318
I know I recognize it.

829
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,780
Oh, right! I've set aside clothes
for dry cleaning, so don't touch them.

830
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,407
They can't be washed with water.

831
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,576
Who gets clothes with holes dry cleaned?

832
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,828
That's why you're so poor!

833
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,291
Bom! I've landed a role in the band.

834
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,167
Ta-da. Clever, right?

835
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,544
SAGYE recommended it.

836
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,841
Gyu-ri, could you be a maracas prodigy?

837
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:01,303
The way you play with the beat
is ingenious!

838
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,264
All right. Let's give it a shot.

839
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,850
Hold on. What about Tae-yang?

840
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,227
TWO SAGYE is missing a SAGYE.

841
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,353
Exactly. What's he up to?

842
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,233
<i>That's why I'm telling you to let him go.</i>

843
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,235
<i>Let him swim in a larger pond.</i>

844
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,195
We'll perform…

845
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,573
without Tae-yang.

846
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,033
It'll be just us.

847
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:26,286
Why? He doesn't want to?
He thinks he's better than everyone.

848
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,370
Focus, guys.

849
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,247
Shall we?

850
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,333
Let's go!

851
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,417
<i>TWO SAGYE…</i>

852
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,336
doesn't have a future.

853
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,629
<i>It ends here.</i>

854
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,548
I hope you get to do what you want.

855
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,800
<i>Don't waste your time with me.</i>

856
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,406
Tae-yang.

857
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,666
Is this your answer?

858
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,835
Was it so wrong of me
to tell you I like you?

859
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,088
Was it too much for you to deal with?

860
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,591
Was disbanding TWO SAGYE all a show
to drive me out of the band?

861
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,969
It's a misunderstanding.
It's not what you think.

862
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,012
You should've just been honest with me

863
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,015
and told me to leave the band.

864
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,310
If you had,
it wouldn't have been this miserable.

865
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,728
Please hear me out.

866
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,523
I meant to break up the band.

867
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,567
- But--
- I don't get you at all.

868
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,113
How can you welcome Gye with a smile
after what he did?

869
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,198
Do you have no self-respect?

870
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,326
You must be so into him
to be this understanding.

871
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,370
I can't seem to catch a break with you,

872
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,998
but he gets away with everything.

873
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,213
I'm sorry…

874
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,092
I couldn't reciprocate your feelings.

875
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,636
That's why…

876
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,434
I couldn't hold onto you.

877
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,979
Don't apologize.

878
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,607
It's actually for the best.

879
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,485
I won't have to feel bad either.

880
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,404
Regardless of how I start my career…

881
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,658
You won't care, right?

882
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,665
If it's your choice,

883
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,625
it must be the right choice.

884
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,514
TWO SAGYE and I were never a good fit.

885
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,892
If I could,

886
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,020
I'd wipe it from my memory.

887
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,473
You didn't tell Gye anything, did you?

888
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,059
I didn't. You told me not to, sir.

889
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,356
But why can't I tell him?

890
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,440
What?

891
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:47,779
You know how suspicious he can be.
There's no point in giving him ammunition.

892
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,531
Which SUV is Gye looking for?

893
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,909
It wasn't even yours,
so who wanted it scrapped?

894
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,410
How long have you worked for me?

895
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,831
Six years, sir.

896
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,917
In those six years,
you would've learned how the world works.

897
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,591
Gye and I are like brothers.

898
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,344
We grew up in the same neighborhood,

899
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,804
our mothers are close,

900
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,556
and we don't keep secrets from each other.

901
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,182
Is that so?

902
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,896
I envy that friendship.

903
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,066
I'll keep it short, then.

904
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,278
Which mountain will it be?
Pick one to hike up.

905
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,072
The day is short,
so don't get stranded halfway up

906
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,491
and end up torn apart by a wild animal.

907
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:39,914
I'll now start the presentation
introducing The Crown's new member.

908
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,011
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

909
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,679
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

910
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,098
<i>The time that we had</i>
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

911
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,017
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

912
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,852
<i>I find new things to do</i>

913
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,854
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

914
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,564
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

915
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,441
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

916
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,694
<i>I think about you every day</i>

917
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,823
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

918
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,955
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

919
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:28,254
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

920
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,841
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

921
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,801
We're going to film it now.

922
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,262
The video will go up at midnight.

923
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,640
That's too sudden.
You never said we'd be filming it today.

924
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,267
Hanju University High School's finals
start tomorrow.

925
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,644
If we're too loud at night,
the mothers will murder us.

926
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,105
I'll need 11 mm falsies to be
camera-ready.

927
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,567
These are only 9 mm.
We absolutely can't do this.

928
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,529
I'm in. Cover videos should look
as natural as possible.

929
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,114
I'm in too.

930
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,448
My wardrobe today…

931
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,285
couldn't be more natural.

932
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,370
I honestly can't agree.

933
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,875
All my clothes were ruined,
so Ms. Kim lent me some of hers to wear.

934
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,795
They suit you nicely.
How generous of my mom.

935
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,213
Hang in there, Jin-gu.

936
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,381
Right.

937
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,174
Put these on.

938
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,803
We'll rock it
in these matching bucket hats.

939
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,265
What the hell?

940
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,183
This covers my face completely.
Why wear this?

941
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,228
I don't want to either.
As the face of this team, I refuse.

942
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,188
My hair is my best feature!

943
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:15,111
We'll reveal our faces when our video gets
over three million views.

944
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,112
Three million?

945
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,905
- Are you kidding me?
- That'll never happen.

946
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,034
Who'll listen to our song
if we show Gye's face?

947
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,661
The entire nation will be
too busy hating us.

948
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:24,746
Are you good with that?

949
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,248
Hear me out.

950
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,628
We'll blow people's minds
with our cover song,

951
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,962
then reveal that it's Gye.

952
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:36,466
It'd be annoying to get chewed out
before a fair assessment.

953
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,928
My fans will still recognize my voice,
even if my face is covered.

954
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,930
You need to fool them.

955
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,099
Switch up your singing style.

956
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,061
Forget what you learned at Jo & Jo
and sing however you want.

957
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,355
Belt out notes if you want
and even try growling.

958
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,606
Can't you do it?

959
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,361
Okay. Sure!

960
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,991
It'll be done in a single take.
You can't mess up, so focus.

961
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,785
- Got it.
- We'll nail it at first attempt!

962
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,161
- Yes!
- Let's do it!

963
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,246
<i>Roopretelcham.</i>

964
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,381
<i>Girl, you shake up my world</i>

965
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,091
<i>Even without words, you know how I feel</i>

966
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,176
<i>The time that we had</i>
<i>You appear before my eyes</i>

967
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,512
<i>Without you, my nights will be lonely</i>

968
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,305
<i>I find new things to do</i>

969
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,807
<i>Meet friends at every chance</i>

970
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,017
<i>Talk about meaningless things</i>

971
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,769
<i>But why is it still this hard?</i>

972
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,189
<i>I think about you every day</i>

973
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,193
<i>I hold back as much as I can</i>

974
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,866
<i>If we're meant to be, we'll meet again</i>

975
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:51,833
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

976
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:55,670
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

977
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,928
<i>I hear time will do the work</i>

978
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,598
<i>It'll help me forget about you</i>

979
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:22,071
<i>Only until then will I give it my all</i>

980
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,992
<i>I'll hold out, even if it's just for a day</i>

981
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,845
At exactly 10 a.m., public TV channels,

982
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,098
general TV stations, cable networks,
and other media outlets

983
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,892
will introduce you as breaking news.

984
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,894
The members will find out simultaneously.

985
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,606
The CS department is paralyzed
from the rumor about a new member.

986
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,566
Global fans must be stirred up too.

987
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,943
The timing couldn't be better.

988
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,446
The Crown's new song
just topped the charts.

989
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:06,491
We'll be the center of attention
and have the most viral videos.

990
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,659
It's almost 10 a.m.
Let's head to the conference room.

991
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,369
Right. Let's go.

992
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,457
Guys, come quick!
The Crown is announcing its new member.

993
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,085
- What?
- Who is it?

994
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,796
Let me see his face. Who is it?

995
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,048
THE CROWN NEW MEMBER REVEAL
COUNTDOWN

996
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,724
THE CROWN'S NEW LEADER REVEALED
ON DECEMBER 1ST, 10 A.M.

997
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,615
<i>I'll hold back my feelings to let you go</i>

998
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:51,369
<i>But if that doesn't work</i>
<i>On the off chance</i>

999
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,536
<i>If you don't want to get hurt,</i>
<i>leave the agency on your own terms.</i>

1000
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,788
<i>I'm always down for a fight with you.</i>

1001
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,458
- <i>Bom, did you know about this?</i>
- <i>It's not our place to meddle.</i>

1002
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,837
<i>Make me a more successful artist</i>
<i>than Sa Gye.</i>

1003
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,882
<i>TWO SAGYE is finally making its debut.</i>

1004
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,676
<i>I have something to say to you.</i>

1005
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,261
<i>This is cheating.</i>

1006
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,888
<i>You have no fear, do you?</i>

1007
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,390
<i>You let Sa Gye get the better of you.</i>

1008
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,267
I can't let him sink and drown.

1009
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,103
<i>I'm set on taking down</i>
<i>the shady Jo & Jo Entertainment.</i>

1010
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,229
<i>I'll get it done.</i>

1011
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,440
Don't. This is Tae-yang's choice.

1012
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,192
She's letting it slide for your sake.
Because she's kind to a fault!

1013
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,277
Do you know Bom that well?
More than I do?

1014
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:11,365
