1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,548
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,678
THE DAY OF THE FESTIVAL

4
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,438
Should I sound the alarm?

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,776
You haven't been back home for ten days.

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,528
What are you stealing from me?

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,617
My clothes, the ones I'll be wearing
for today's show.

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,701
Your show?

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,289
You're actually doing that damned thing?

10
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,374
I believe I warned you to quit.

11
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,709
Our deal is off.

12
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,878
I'm going to quit med school.

13
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,339
No. It's more like I can't do it.

14
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,216
Every time I'm in an operating room,

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,635
I'm reminded of Mom.

16
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,054
Why is she even on your mind?

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:40,266
Patients in the OR fighting for
their lives are nothing like your mother!

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,727
Patients entrust us with their lives.

19
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,856
Doctors exist solely
for those who value life!

20
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,483
That's why I won't become one.

21
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,609
What?

22
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,444
Mom was happiest

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,781
when she did music,
before she ever met you, a doctor.

24
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,783
I won't just hold it in like she did.

25
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,622
You can't leave!

26
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,209
Tae-yang,

27
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,045
what can I do
to make you come to your senses?

28
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,672
I have clarity.

29
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,882
That's why I'm off to do what I love.

30
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,760
You brat.

31
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,690
Hey, it's me.

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,318
Did you know Sa Gye and his gang
are performing today?

33
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>Shouldn't the head of an agency</i>
<i>be on top of things?</i>

34
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,199
Sa Gye and Kim Bom are corrupting my boy!

35
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,284
<i>No need to get worked up.</i>

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,994
Their performance will be canceled.

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,328
Are you sure?

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,746
I'll make sure of it.

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,456
<i>Let me know if there's anything I can do.</i>

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,791
HANJU BAND - TWO SAGYE

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,920
Hey, what should I do with this?

42
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,838
- It looks good.
- Does it?

43
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,132
- Where's your gingham piece?
- Gyu-ri, help me too.

44
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,175
You too? Let's see.

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,262
Why you…

46
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,390
All right.
Are you ready to bring the house down?

47
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,392
It's TWO SAGYE's debut stage.

48
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,519
Let's go over it one last time.

49
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,646
What for? It'll just be a waste of time.

50
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,316
- We'll be tonight's highlight anyway.
- Right.

51
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,152
SAGYE, actually…

52
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,905
Crowners are on their way here.

53
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,114
- What?
- What?

54
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,284
My fans will be here?
I haven't heard anything about it.

55
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,953
I wanted to surprise you,
so I didn't say anything.

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,789
I have gathered the precious fans

57
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,959
who still support you
to see you perform.

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,715
- They're almost here!
- Already?

59
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,633
Really?

60
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,343
Hold on a second.

61
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,595
Guys, check me out. How do I look?

62
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,013
Do I look okay?

63
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,848
As if you need to even ask.

64
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,767
Your beauty is visible from the sky

65
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,977
and beyond!

66
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,813
You'll be meeting them before the show.

67
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,274
Really? Maybe I should go and say hi.

68
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,698
What's that noise?

69
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,075
Is that SAGYE's fans?

70
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,494
Just how many are here?

71
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,412
That sounds like a lot of people.

72
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,545
What the hell?

73
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,507
- How many are here?
- What's going on?

74
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:19,926
SAGYE!

75
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,303
- SAGYE!
- SAGYE!

76
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,805
- TWO SAGYE!
- SAGYE!

77
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,311
Are they really here for us?
Why did they climb up there?

78
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,396
Beats me.

79
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,898
I told them to gather
under the tarp over there.

80
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:38,069
Also, I only called the OG Crowners
to avoid any unnecessary trouble.

81
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,864
Hold on.

82
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,076
- The light sticks look different.
- What?

83
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,953
- SAGYE!
- SAGYE!

84
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,496
Good catch. They don't look right.

85
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,416
Those are knock-offs!

86
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,834
They're not the ones I called.

87
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,128
We, Crowners, are known
to be mature and well-behaved.

88
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,587
We wouldn't do anything like this.

89
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,931
Oh, no.

90
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,866
No pushing!

91
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,370
Today's festival music event
has been canceled.

92
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,373
The announcement was just made
by the university.

93
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,168
For safety reasons,
we ask that you head home.

94
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,169
I say this once again.

95
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,464
Today's music event has been canceled,
so we kindly ask that you leave the venue.

96
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,888
Please don't run.

97
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,431
- No running.
- Don't run.

98
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,685
What the hell?

99
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,063
Let go!

100
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,566
- Tae-yang? Tae-yang!
- Let go!

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,302
- Did anyone get injured?
- No.

102
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,888
It's odd how quickly the police
and the EMTs arrived.

103
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,849
Exactly. How did they know to be there?

104
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,478
It's odd that they immediately canceled
the event as well.

105
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,148
SAGYE, the ones on the metal frames
weren't Crowners.

106
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,149
Look.

107
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,568
This is the light stick Crowners made,

108
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,153
and this is a knock-off.

109
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
I didn't recognize anyone
in the crowd, either.

110
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,367
Random people came to the event
pretending to be SAGYE's fans?

111
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,038
Where are Bom and Tae-yang?

112
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,289
They aren't here?

113
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,000
They were with us a minute ago.

114
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,421
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>

115
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,840
She's not picking up?

116
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,808
- Gye, don't go!
- No…

117
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,311
Damn it.

118
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,860
183J 1010

119
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,156
<i>Don't socialize with Kim Bom.</i>
<i>Don't do anything.</i>

120
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,908
<i>Give up</i>
<i>if you're trying to go against Mr. Jo.</i>

121
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,202
<i>Kim Bom will be in danger.</i>

122
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,979
Gye?

123
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,483
What is this?

124
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,318
Why the hell are you here?

125
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR SEO MIN-CHEOL

126
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,657
What do you think you're doing?

127
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,742
Where's Bom?

128
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,077
Where is she?

129
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,787
What are you going on about?

130
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,749
Why ask me about her whereabouts?

131
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,417
You are the only one

132
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,295
who would go after Bom, am I wrong?

133
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,758
What's wrong with you? Come on, let's go.

134
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,218
Come on out.

135
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,471
Gye, that's enough.
Get a grip on yourself.

136
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,931
What do you think you're doing?

137
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,057
Ji-na.

138
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,267
Tell me.

139
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,394
Why is Mr. Jo doing this to me?

140
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,272
Why does he hate Bom too
when she has nothing to do with this?

141
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,327
Anyway, it's a relief
that no one was seriously hurt.

142
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,828
You are truly remarkable.

143
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,498
How did you manage
to pull the plug on the event so fast?

144
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,792
I'm guessing the police
were already on campus.

145
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,461
Well, you know my hunches
are usually right.

146
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,214
Anyway, as the university president,

147
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,091
I can't let this slide.

148
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,927
Why did Sa Gye, that menace,
have to come to our school?

149
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,849
TWO SAGYE

150
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,981
SAGYE WILL GO ON

151
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:42,373
<i>- We love you, SAGYE.</i>
<i>- We love you, SAGYE.</i>

152
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,878
Bom!

153
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,141
Are you okay? Nothing happened, right?

154
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,434
Are you sure you're okay?

155
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,644
Promise me this.

156
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,521
You won't ever leave my sight again.

157
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,441
I was scared something terrible
might happen to you.

158
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,192
I almost lost my mind.

159
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,819
Gye.

160
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,990
Tae-yang's disappeared.

161
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,242
Some men took him away.

162
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,704
Tae-yang's father came to see me recently

163
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,706
and told me to stay away from him.

164
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,166
But I didn't follow through.

165
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,085
He had to quit the band too.

166
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,463
What do we do?

167
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,465
Because of me, Tae-yang…

168
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,968
Hey, nothing will happen. Don't worry.

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,803
Tae-yang's not a kid.

170
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,221
He can take a punch.

171
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,349
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

172
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,814
Someone set this up
to stop us from performing.

173
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,108
I know. Who could've done this?

174
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,154
Just wait till I catch them.
I'll crack their skull in half!

175
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,364
It was either Jo Sang-heon…

176
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,657
Or Director Seo.

177
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,075
They could've teamed up.

178
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,910
They're best friends.

179
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,787
I don't get it.

180
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,498
I get that Director Seo
was never a fan of the band,

181
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
but why did Mr. Jo do that?

182
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,794
The head of a major entertainment agency
sabotages a university event,

183
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,504
out of his hatred for SAGYE?

184
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,172
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

185
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,050
You're right. Mr. Jo's recent passion

186
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,553
is chasing me around, trying to ruin me.

187
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,931
Can he be any pettier?

188
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,641
And he calls himself a grown-up?

189
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,434
This is unforgivable.

190
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,728
Not after the work we put into this event.

191
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,445
I found him!

192
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,905
- It's Tae-yang.
- What?

193
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,867
NO VISITORS ALLOWED

194
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,244
Was it your doing, Father?

195
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,704
Those people at the event.

196
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,709
I guess you're the only person
who would pull something like this.

197
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,295
Am I wrong?

198
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,798
If you had kept your promise,

199
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,551
the others wouldn't have had to suffer.

200
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,637
This is what you get
for acting out of character.

201
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,972
I'm going home.

202
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,640
You're not.

203
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,437
You're suffering
from Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

204
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,772
You grew up
having everything you ever needed,

205
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,524
so without compliments
or people's attention,

206
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,234
you find yourself worthless.

207
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,529
And your anxiety makes you rebel
against authority figures for no reason.

208
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,408
It's all because your mother
didn't raise you right.

209
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,415
Sure. I guess you're right.

210
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,208
You're always right, Father.

211
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,004
So please don't hurt my bandmates.

212
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,346
The drug will make you drowsy, son.

213
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,932
I know med school has been exhausting.

214
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,476
Take this time to relax.

215
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,525
There are guards outside that door,
so don't do anything stupid.

216
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,740
It's me.

217
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,034
I had him admitted.

218
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,664
Tae-yang's in the hospital?

219
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,416
Yes, he was just admitted to the VIP ward.

220
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,126
I donated a billion won for a reason.

221
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,378
I used my connections to look into it.

222
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,173
- What did he suddenly come down with?
- It's his father who's sick.

223
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,925
We just need to free the fake patient.

224
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,385
But how?
His father's the hospital director.

225
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,804
Also, if anger fueled him
to mess up our event,

226
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,640
he wouldn't let us see Tae-yang.

227
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,226
Please tell the doctors to help me, son!

228
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,938
Excuse me. Isn't there a bed for him?

229
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm afraid we don't have any beds left
in six-bedded rooms.

230
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,444
Demanding a bed from us
won't help your case.

231
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,571
What are you people even doing?

232
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,950
Sir, if you first pay for the surgery,

233
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,411
we'll make sure
to find a hospital to take him.

234
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,496
Hold on.

235
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,664
- You can't…
- Let's go.

236
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,172
You're not allowed here.

237
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,552
No visitors are allowed.
You may not enter.

238
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,011
What do you think you're doing?

239
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,013
This is the VIP ward.

240
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,348
Is that so?

241
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,767
We happen to be
Seo Tae-yang's college friends.

242
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,020
Didn't Director Seo tell you?

243
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,855
Tae-yang's being discharged.

244
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,233
He's being discharged? What do you--

245
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,236
You see, Director Seo requested
the room be vacated

246
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,780
to accommodate this emergency patient.

247
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,826
He felt ashamed that his son
was occupying one for no reason.

248
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,287
It's hard to get a bed
in university hospitals these days.

249
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,706
What's with the commotion?

250
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,291
Jeez, Director Seo.

251
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,584
It's us.

252
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,670
You truly are
a real-life Hippocrates, sir.

253
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,132
You deserve your reputation
and our respect.

254
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,592
What's wrong with you?

255
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,718
Everyone,

256
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,679
for this patient
who is struggling financially,

257
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,556
Director Seo will cover all expenses,

258
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,183
including the surgery
and the cost the bed.

259
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,144
- No way.
- That's absurd.

260
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,146
Give it up for Director Seo!

261
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,528
But…

262
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,197
Director, thank you so much.

263
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,075
- Director, we're grateful.
- Sure.

264
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,493
- I didn't…
- Thank you.

265
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,163
Hey, stop right there.

266
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,123
- Hurry.
- I never said you could leave!

267
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,461
- What does Tae-yang have again?
- I believe he's constipated.

268
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,964
Doctor, I doubt being constipated
is life-threatening.

269
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,591
- But--
- Come on.

270
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,427
We'll get him some yogurt
on our way. Let's go.

271
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,096
Then, we'll get going with our friend.

272
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,640
- Come on.
- You brats.

273
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,394
- Is this true?
- Doctor.

274
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,481
- Father, you'll be fine now.
- Yes, of course.

275
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,232
- Come on.
- Here we go.

276
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,567
One, two, three.

277
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,696
That was sick!

278
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,573
How was my plan, guys?

279
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,492
- It was so cool.
- It was incredible!

280
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,245
Thanks, guys.

281
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,458
I'll make sure to pay you back for this.

282
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,128
I'm quitting TWO SAGYE
as of today, though.

283
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,090
My father won't give up.

284
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,885
And I don't want to cause you
any more trouble.

285
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,097
Thank you for everything.

286
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,223
I'll get going.

287
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,309
Do you have a place to stay?

288
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,772
I'll figure it out.
I'm moving out for good this time around.

289
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:33,075
You know, you should stop trying
to act all cool.

290
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,452
Of all your bad qualities,
that's the worst.

291
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,954
Don't you agree, Bom?

292
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,791
That's how Tae-yang is.

293
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,418
He's too serious all the time.

294
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,963
Look how serious he seems.
He'd be a shoo-in for student president.

295
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,300
I bet he's never played hooky
and got told off by the teacher in school.

296
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,803
I bet even his heart rate

297
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,305
stays at a constant 75,
from morning to night.

298
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,892
He's the upgraded
and more handsome version of Director Seo.

299
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,144
I'm not like my dad.

300
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,895
As if you're any different.

301
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,523
What's the point of having a pretty face?

302
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,983
You're mind-numbingly boring.

303
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,987
Don't tell me you'll sulk
because of what I said.

304
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,741
Oh, look. Tae-yang's sulking again.

305
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,367
What, then?

306
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,411
Should I risk my life for this band?

307
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,579
Of course, you should.

308
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,123
But for the sake of your life
and not this band.

309
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,002
Did Director Seo go to such lengths
just to keep his son

310
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,211
from playing in a band?

311
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,256
I think there's more to it.

312
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,215
What do you mean?

313
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,926
I'll let you know once I'm more certain.

314
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,762
Either way,

315
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,556
we'll lose out big time
if we give in right now.

316
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,768
So as of this moment,
don't ever say you're quitting the band.

317
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,103
Even if we were to disband,
it should be our choice.

318
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,189
It'd be humiliating if others ruined it.

319
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,941
Exactly. They chose the wrong people
to mess with.

320
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,195
Bring it on. We're no pushovers.

321
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,698
Bom, that being said,
we should make our debut today.

322
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,325
- Well? Are you with me?
- Here?

323
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,785
- Yes.
- What about the instruments?

324
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,245
Since when did we let
obstacles like that stop us?

325
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,622
TWO SAGYE, what are we?

326
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,623
Rebels!

327
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,625
TWO SAGYE, what is our motto?

328
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,212
- Persevere and prevail!
- Persevere and prevail!

329
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,005
Yes!

330
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,215
Hey.

331
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,424
We're sorry.

332
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,551
Who cares?

333
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,136
Let's go!

334
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,431
Come on!

335
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,816
Let's do this.

336
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,988
<i>From the moment I saw you</i>
<i>Fire burned within me, fever</i>

337
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,573
<i>It's a fever</i>

338
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,451
<i>You set the world ablaze</i>

339
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,870
<i>Burn, burn, burn</i>

340
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,665
<i>In my head and even in my heart</i>

341
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,333
<i>Digging deeper inside every day</i>

342
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,919
<i>I feel like I'm on fire</i>

343
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,506
<i>I must be falling for you</i>

344
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,841
<i>I'm burning up</i>
<i>Oh, fever</i>

345
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,092
Sa Gye.

346
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,094
<i>Yeah, one sight</i>

347
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,720
<i>A glimpse of your face</i>

348
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
<i>It landed in my two eyes</i>

349
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,474
<i>Yeah, tonight</i>

350
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,101
<i>I'm reminded of it</i>

351
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,436
- <i>I'm reminded of it</i>
- Yes, Gyu-ri. Show them!

352
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>One touch, I get crazy butterflies</i>

353
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,858
<i>Cold sweat runs down</i>

354
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,485
<i>- I can't take it anymore</i>
<i>- I can't take it anymore</i>

355
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,947
<i>My head is feverish, burn, burn</i>

356
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>Thinking 'bout you</i>

357
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,202
<i>I keep fantasizing, love story</i>

358
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,413
<i>Me and you</i>

359
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>Now, I can say for sure</i>

360
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,584
Say what?

361
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,671
<i>From the moment I saw you</i>
<i>Fire burned within me, fever</i>

362
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>It's a fever</i>

363
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,925
<i>You set the world ablaze</i>

364
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,011
<i>Burn, burn, burn</i>

365
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,637
<i>On the night</i>

366
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,682
<i>of the festival,</i>
<i>our single act was a huge success.</i>

367
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,685
<i>We'll keep refusing</i>
<i>to let anything discourage us.</i>

368
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,062
<i>- No one can stop us.</i>
<i>- I must be falling for you</i>

369
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,232
<i>- As TWO SAGYE, we will stand strong.</i>
<i>- I'm burning up, oh, fever</i>

370
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>After all, those who persevere</i>
<i>win in the end.</i>

371
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,112
TWO SAGYE!

372
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,917
SAGYE BOUGHT FAKE FANS
TO SHOW OFF AT THE FESTIVAL

373
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,173
SUCCESSFULLY POSTED

374
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,051
EXPOSING WHO SAGYE REALLY IS

375
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,643
What's all that noise?

376
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,603
What's with all this chatter?

377
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,189
Hold on. What are they doing
outside our house?

378
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,315
- Insane.
- It's a joke.

379
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,567
- What…
- You have no idea.

380
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,652
I read it.

381
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,778
Oh, gosh.

382
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,241
My gosh. No way!

383
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,659
I'm trembling all over.

384
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,203
I wasn't prepared
even though I knew this day would come.

385
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,413
I can't believe it. They're actually here!

386
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,623
Hold on.

387
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,084
What should I sell first?

388
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,711
Well… Wait, Gye can't know just yet.

389
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,338
I can't share my profit with him.

390
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,216
Hang on.
I can't just sit around like this.

391
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,429
Get in line!

392
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,598
Everyone, form a line.

393
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,017
I see that word has only just spread,

394
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,812
but this is the current residence
of international top star…

395
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,523
SAGYE. You came to the right place.

396
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,108
- Ma'am.
- Is SAGYE inside?

397
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,401
- Where is he?
- Is he inside?

398
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,694
- Where is he?
- Stop.

399
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,280
Hold onto your dignity as his lucky fans.

400
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,948
It pains me to inform you

401
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:27,077
that SAGYE went to school early today
and isn't home.

402
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,913
- What do you mean? Where is he?
- You're lying!

403
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,956
Quiet!

404
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,416
I'm not lying. He isn't here.

405
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,669
However, so you don't leave
feeling like the day was a waste,

406
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,795
I…

407
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,841
I'm here with SAGYE's personal items!

408
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,051
Let these make your time worthwhile.

409
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,637
I'm a woman with a conscience.

410
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,890
I wouldn't dare to sell these
at a premium.

411
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,185
Each item is available for 70,000 won
on a first-come, first-served basis.

412
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,603
- Did she say 70,000 won?
- Ta-da.

413
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,896
That stinks.

414
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,691
It's the towel SAGYE used this morning.

415
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,069
- It's still quite damp. This towel!
- Seriously?

416
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,156
- What?
- The teddy bear pajamas SAGYE slept in.

417
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,410
This is the pillow
he held tightly at night.

418
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,203
The one that absorbed his breath.

419
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,753
So annoying. Why isn't anyone biting?
This couldn't be more humiliating.

420
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,385
I must apologize.
You see, I haven't done this before.

421
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,597
I wasn't considerate of the fans
who are here to see SAGYE.

422
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm sorry.

423
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,850
I was saving this for another day,

424
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,393
but as a special event,

425
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,480
I will give you a grand tour

426
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,900
of the house SAGYE's staying at!

427
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,570
Pricing from living room

428
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,739
to kitchen will start at 100,000 won.

429
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,741
Raise your hand if you're interested!

430
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,411
- Is she out of her mind?
- What?

431
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,580
You're crossing the line yet again.

432
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,956
- I'm out of my mind?
- Lady.

433
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,250
After everything
we've already spent on SAGYE,

434
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,502
you want us to spend more?

435
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,295
That's not it.

436
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,130
- Did SAGYE put you up to this?
- Of course not.

437
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,550
I heard SAGYE called all of those people
to pretend to be his fans.

438
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,385
- What?
- To boost the numbers.

439
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,013
What was that? What do you mean?

440
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,766
His former manager posted
an exposé on the fan site.

441
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:16,061
SAGYE, that jerk,
thinks his fans are gullible suckers.

442
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,146
- Hold on.
- My money and time.

443
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,607
Make up for everything, you prick!

444
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,609
- Prick!
- You've got it all wrong.

445
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,611
- Charge!
- Hold on!

446
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,779
- What are you doing?
- Move!

447
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,239
Move, lady!

448
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,157
You can't do this!

449
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,367
Oh, no!

450
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,288
No, that's not for sale.

451
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,873
- You can't.
- Let go of me!

452
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,462
SAGYE, wake up. It's an emergency!

453
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,382
Get up and get out of here.
Your fans have barged in!

454
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,176
Who did what?

455
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,427
There's a fire?

456
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,221
No, not that.

457
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,682
You need to run like there is one!

458
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,600
Why? You're not making sense.

459
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,354
- I think he's here.
- Over here.

460
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,522
What the hell?

461
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
SAGYE!

462
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,824
Oh, no…

463
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,908
He's up there.

464
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,034
The jerk's on the rooftop.

465
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,412
She even lied about you not being home.

466
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,789
Get down here. Stay right there!

467
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,835
Bom sure got lucky today
with an early morning shift

468
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
- at her part-time job.
- Tae-yang.

469
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,130
Remember how you said you owed me?

470
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,299
Well, I'm cashing that in right now.

471
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,592
What?

472
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,095
Hey, what the…

473
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,265
He's over here.

474
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,975
- Hey, over here. This way.
- Where?

475
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,393
Hurry!

476
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,561
Guys, up here.

477
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,022
- Run faster.
- SAGYE, you're dead meat.

478
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,607
- This way.
- Tae-yang.

479
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,567
Get down!

480
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,128
Wow, that worked.

481
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,504
Wow.

482
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,381
- Hey!
- You!

483
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,633
- Get back here!
- You prick!

484
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,135
- Get back here.
- Stop right there.

485
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,179
- Get back here!
- Move it.

486
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
- You can't.
- Move!

487
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,436
Who do you think you are?

488
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,065
Help!

489
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,822
Are you okay?

490
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,037
SAGYE?

491
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,582
What just happened?

492
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,462
Did my dream finally come true?

493
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,299
I can't wait any longer, Gyu-ri.

494
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,425
Marry me!

495
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,512
Did you come back to save me?

496
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,058
No, I came for my bag.
I left it here yesterday.

497
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,484
Holy mother-forking

498
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,736
sleazeballs!

499
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,284
The rest of his fans
seem to have lost faith in him, too.

500
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,702
Now that they know where he lives,

501
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,329
Sa Gye won't be able
to stay there any longer.

502
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,789
Do whatever it takes.

503
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,792
Do not stop and keep squeezing hard.

504
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,002
Yes, sir.

505
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,262
Why is Mr. Jo doing this to me?

506
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,056
Why does he hate Bom too
when she has nothing to do with this?

507
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,022
Were you looking for me?

508
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,940
How's my dad feeling today?

509
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,944
He's pretty much the same.
Only Mr. Kang is allowed in his office.

510
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,655
Something obviously happened
between my dad and Gye.

511
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,157
Something I don't know.

512
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,325
I'm just as clueless.

513
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,035
They're on the worst terms ever,

514
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,412
and I have no idea
how things got this bad.

515
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,164
Before, they were each other's world.

516
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,707
Hasn't Gye told you anything?

517
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,460
I was going to meet up with him to ask.

518
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,840
Ms. Jo, it's bad.

519
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,966
What is it?

520
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,353
There's an issue with The Crown's new song
scheduled for release next week.

521
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,729
What kind of issue?

522
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,565
The chorus of the title track
matches that of a song released

523
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,067
by a Spanish artist in 1998.

524
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,109
What?

525
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,867
Things are a mess at home
and even at school.

526
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,703
Where does all this hatred
even come from?

527
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,748
Being malicious takes effort.

528
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm not surprised at all.

529
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,169
Who was it this time? Hanju Band?

530
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,505
A good spring cleaning
was well overdue anyway.

531
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,589
We'll get right on it.

532
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,425
Where's Gye?

533
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:58,885
President summons.

534
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,179
TWO SAGYE, GET LOST!

535
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,101
Bom.

536
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,895
You might have a heart attack

537
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,315
when you hear
what happened to us this morning.

538
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,485
You're lucky your part-time job
was in the morning.

539
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,825
What did he want?

540
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,035
We've been suspended.

541
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,705
TWO SAGYE won't be allowed to perform
at any school events.

542
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,165
This space will also close for a month.

543
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,001
Apparently, Hanju Band
strongly complained.

544
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,771
I hear you were suspended.

545
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,482
Damn, we won't be seeing
your disgusting faces for a while.

546
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,151
That's music to my ears.

547
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,405
Who's pulling the strings behind you?

548
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,992
Someone obviously ordered you
to make our lives a living hell,

549
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,951
so tell me!

550
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,163
This thug must be itching
to punch someone again.

551
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,372
Here.

552
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,291
Have at it.

553
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:14,169
This time around,
I'll make sure you stay in a cell.

554
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,296
You bastard!

555
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,553
Gye, stay out of it.
Don't make this worse.

556
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,564
How much were you paid this time?

557
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,901
I'll match the price,
so tell me who put you up to this.

558
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,153
Tae-yang!

559
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,572
Knowing the truth
will only wreck you, you morons.

560
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,574
Guys! Knock them around.
Just watch their faces.

561
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,371
Help us!

562
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,706
It's a brawl.

563
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,194
Are you thugs?

564
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:25,657
How could you beat others
to a pulp on campus?

565
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,868
I shut down your practice studio
so you could learn your lesson.

566
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,955
But during your suspension,
you got into another fight?

567
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,457
They beat us up just as much.

568
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,543
You threw the first punch!

569
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,670
Also, does this look

570
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,173
like the face of someone who was pummeled?

571
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,926
There isn't even a scratch on you!

572
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,053
Meanwhile, the others
are covered in blood.

573
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,515
If this is how things are going to be,
shut the band down for good!

574
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,894
Did you just scoff?

575
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,564
Do I seem like a joke to you?
I'm not one to mess with.

576
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,526
I'm one of the most serious people
you could ever imagine!

577
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,779
WE APOLOGIZE FOR CAUSING TROUBLE
BY INVITING FANS TO THE FESTIVAL

578
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,906
WE APOLOGIZE TO THE OTHER MUSIC
CLUBS, ESPECIALLY TO HANJU BAND

579
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,283
That should do it, right?

580
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,284
Yes.

581
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,370
Did you upload an apology
on your social media?

582
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,621
Of course.

583
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,124
Lately, my social media page
has more apologies

584
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,834
than daily photos.

585
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,503
They've dubbed me the pro apologizer.

586
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,298
It's far better than not apologizing.

587
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,467
The world has its fair share
of shameless people who never do.

588
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,345
Could this mean you've now lost

589
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,472
even the few loyal fans
who stood by you, SAGYE?

590
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,391
I'm crushed.

591
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,519
My fans?

592
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,688
I'm good with just the four of you.

593
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,024
Let's get something straight.
I'm not your fan.

594
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,443
Jin-gu, seriously?

595
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,403
What?

596
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:49,198
We can't perform at school festivals,
and our studio is closed for a month.

597
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,326
Where do we practice?

598
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,120
Come on, guys.

599
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,788
Don't worry.

600
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,583
My mom said
I was blessed with God's grace.

601
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,668
Don't you know the power
of staying positive?

602
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,171
You know my unique optimism, right?

603
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,380
Stay optimistic like SAGYE!

604
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:09,010
It may seem like we've hit a rough patch,
but it's nothing we can't handle.

605
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,596
Why you…

606
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,816
I told you to stay away from her,
so do as I say.

607
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,443
I dare you to stay in her life.

608
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,695
Then, we'll both see
how far I'm willing to go.

609
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,918
Are you back home?

610
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,504
As if. I only stopped by to say goodbye.

611
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,590
I'd keep feeling bad if I didn't.

612
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,593
Anyway, it's time
you finally gave up on me.

613
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,137
I notified the school
that I'm taking a break.

614
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,683
- A break?
- I didn't drop out, though.

615
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,477
As far as I'm concerned,
I did my due diligence as a son.

616
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,067
I hope you'll

617
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,444
act like a father for once.

618
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,656
You ungrateful brat.
Who are you patronizing?

619
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,367
Being a real-life Hippocrates
is a full-time job.

620
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,327
You don't need to add harassing others

621
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,829
to your plate.

622
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,425
I'm only asking just to be sure.

623
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,262
Is there another reason
you don't want me around Bom?

624
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,896
What do you mean by that?

625
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,400
If you're just being
an overzealous parent,

626
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,360
forget I asked.

627
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,671
Gye, get down here this instant!

628
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,092
Sure. I'm coming!

629
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,518
Jeez, my back.

630
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,645
Something feels out of place.

631
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,522
I seem to have dislocated
my eighth vertebra.

632
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,358
Drop the act and get up.
You're not pitiful at all.

633
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,402
Did you think that would work on me?

634
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,031
Serve the soup already.

635
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,285
With so many living here,

636
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,621
I shouldn't be fixing up
breakfast by myself.

637
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,164
Bom left for her part-time job.

638
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,624
Am I the designated cook?

639
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,376
Isn't that just part
of running a boarding house?

640
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,463
How dare you talk back to me?

641
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,967
Get the side dishes out of the fridge
and set the cutlery. Move it!

642
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,564
This might not be the best time
to say this,

643
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,817
but you did a total 180 on me overnight.

644
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,194
Why are you bossing me around
and not Tae-yang?

645
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,365
You've got some nerve!

646
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,325
After all that was taken from us?

647
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,326
YOU BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT

648
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,162
I can't even get an estimate
of what you owe me

649
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,831
because the number is so high.

650
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,334
Do you know
how much of the tableware your fans took

651
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,546
was bought by Bom's mom
while she was abroad?

652
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,297
Those…

653
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,341
I've been cherishing them

654
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,136
to give to Gyu-ri when she gets married.

655
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,556
Why would Gyu-ri get
what Bom's mom bought?

656
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,558
- Shut it and serve the soup.
- Sure.

657
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,642
Of course.

658
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,686
You brat.

659
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,604
No classes today, right?

660
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,439
Me? Of course, I do.

661
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,192
I know you don't,
but skip them even if you do.

662
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,902
Clean up after everyone's done eating.

663
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,571
Then, clean up the house.

664
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,739
Those brats trampled around the house
in their shoes,

665
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,616
and now it's sandier than the beach!

666
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,665
I can't believe
I've been chasing a wild dream.

667
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,586
I took in a washed-up star,
hoping he'd shine like a diamond.

668
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,479
Gye, where do you think you're going?

669
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,024
I think you have a package.

670
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,320
Sa Gye!

671
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,488
You!

672
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,216
<i>My dearest son, Gye.</i>

673
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,344
<i>This is my last night in Prague.</i>

674
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,847
<i>The night scenery at Charles Bridge</i>
<i>was truly stunning.</i>

675
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,142
<i>You were right.</i>
<i>I would've regretted never seeing this.</i>

676
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,145
<i>I'll return</i>
<i>after savoring all the beautiful sights.</i>

677
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,397
<i>My son,</i>

678
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,066
<i>don't worry.</i>

679
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,359
<i>And don't be scared.</i>

680
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,362
<i>With love, your mom</i>
<i>from the other side of the world.</i>

681
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,288
A plagiarism accusation
two weeks before the release?

682
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,415
What sort of nonsense is this?

683
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,833
And the title track, of all things?

684
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,710
Why weren't you aware of this?

685
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,546
Don't you know how damaging
a plagiarism scandal can be for an artist?

686
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,467
Everything will have to be canceled!
And what about their tarnished reputation?

687
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,510
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,388
We should consider ourselves lucky
that we're aware of it now

689
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,139
and postpone the release of the new song.

690
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,057
That's not an option.

691
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,892
There's a full calendar
set to the release,

692
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,311
with performances
and an overseas tour lined up.

693
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,730
- The release date must be met.
- Yes, sir.

694
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,858
We'll have to pay a fortune
if their overseas tour is canceled.

695
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,861
Find them a new song
within the two weeks we have.

696
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,196
That's impossible. Two weeks--

697
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,324
If not, then revise
the entire chorus in question!

698
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,161
This is the first album release
since SAGYE's departure.

699
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,746
We won't go down like this.

700
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,416
Not after what we did
to establish Jo & Jo.

701
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,711
I'll sort out this mess
as soon as possible.

702
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,673
Nothing's getting done properly
around here!

703
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,567
Welcome.

704
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,884
That wasn't a part of it.

705
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,971
Take it easy, superstar.
You don't look cool at all.

706
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,931
I wasn't trying to look cool.

707
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,850
It was meant to make you laugh,

708
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,101
and I got the job done.

709
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,686
You work every day?

710
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,524
I cut back on my hours
to practice for our show.

711
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,568
My bank account was screaming for help.

712
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,153
I'll be working until I drop for a while.

713
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,490
Being broke

714
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,700
makes me downright mean.

715
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,412
I'm kind of disappointed.

716
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,498
I thought buying you that piano
would earn me more time.

717
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,000
I have to work hard
to afford your signing bonus.

718
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,294
Bom. You don't have classes today, do you?

719
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,046
Skip work and hang out with me.

720
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,840
Your aunt’s making it impossible
to stay at home.

721
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,675
She's been hounding me nonstop.

722
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,095
That will last for a while,
so brace yourself.

723
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,764
Don't be like that
and go on a date with me.

724
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,517
We haven't been on one yet.

725
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,603
A… A date?

726
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,398
I never said I'd go out with you.

727
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,774
What's this between us, then?

728
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,578
Don't make it obvious
in front of the others.

729
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,580
You promised.

730
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,916
How am I supposed to hide our relationship

731
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,252
when I'm living
with a girlfriend this pretty?

732
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,048
How can we tell others
when things are a mess?

733
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,716
We should consider
Tae-yang's feelings too.

734
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,556
I don't see how that's relevant right now.

735
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,725
So when will we go on our date?

736
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,103
Are you going to keep this up?

737
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,938
Stop following me around.

738
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:41,981
Please!

739
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,732
- Please!
- Stop. You're making a scene.

740
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,775
Welcome.

741
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,195
Kim Bom?

742
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,322
It's really you.

743
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,242
Yu-ra said she had seen you here.
I guess she was right.

744
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,871
It's been a while. How have you been?

745
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,664
Have you always lived around here?

746
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,207
I'm surprised this is still Seoul.

747
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,959
We're back in Korea for a short visit.

748
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,170
You know that we got accepted
into Ivy League schools.

749
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,381
Congratulations.

750
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,385
I see you cut down on partying
and finally picked up a book.

751
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,053
What are you talking about?

752
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,306
I've always been more talented than you.

753
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,099
Your mom died,

754
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,351
and we lost touch
after you moved back to Korea.

755
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,145
We've been dying to hear from you.

756
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,688
Is this where you work?

757
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,940
Didn't you get the memo?

758
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,067
My family went broke.

759
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,278
It looks like you haven't changed at all,

760
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,156
considering you came all this way
just to humiliate me.

761
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,284
But since you're here,
help us boost our sales.

762
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,287
- You guys are loaded.
- Bom, there's no need to be mean.

763
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,581
We came by because we missed you.

764
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,916
Exactly.

765
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,336
I appreciate the sentiment.

766
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,795
Accept this, will you?

767
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,340
Since we couldn't make it
to your mom's funeral,

768
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,592
we put together some condolence money.

769
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,976
Now you've crossed the line.

770
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,689
It's been over six years
since my mom passed away.

771
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,608
Just because you haven't been around

772
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,568
doesn't mean you can pour salt
over the wound.

773
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,657
Consider it condolence money
for when your mother passes.

774
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,243
I doubt Bom will see you ever again.

775
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,622
Who's he?

776
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,541
Isn't he a singer?

777
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,209
I think I've seen him somewhere.

778
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,878
You don't need to know,
so take your money and leave.

779
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,297
You insulted her enough,

780
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,382
so get lost!

781
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,015
Talk about crappy English.
Did she even study abroad?

782
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,322
- Gye.
- Yes?

783
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,366
How about we go on that date?

784
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,126
Why did you bring me here?

785
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,044
You didn't know better, did you?

786
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,548
I know all about this place.
It's the hottest bagel shop in town.

787
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,467
Exactly. So why would we come here
for a date?

788
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,221
We'll be standing in line all day.

789
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,265
Taking photos at popular spots

790
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,350
and enjoying delicious food is Dating 101.

791
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,854
The bagels here are incredible.
I had them once while filming.

792
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,481
Although, I never had to wait in line.

793
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,445
What if the last bagels
go to the people ahead of us?

794
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,364
Bom-bom, come on.
I'm the lucky SAGYE, remember?

795
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,326
Don't you worry. I'll make sure
you get the world's finest…

796
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,869
bagels.

797
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,579
BAGELS ARE ALL SOLD OUT
THANK YOU FOR COMING

798
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,751
I guess your luck comes and goes.

799
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,380
It might be for the best,

800
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,090
since they got their bagels.

801
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,594
For teenage students,
time and baked goods are everything.

802
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:00,888
Whatever.

803
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,140
Still. Wasn't it fun in a way?

804
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,808
We got to chat,

805
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,435
watch the people around us…

806
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,230
smell baked goods…

807
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,151
and hold hands.

808
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,279
Sure.

809
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,287
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

810
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,690
- Hello.
- Welcome.

811
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,610
Hey, you.

812
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,737
- You didn't tap your card.
- My card?

813
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,323
I don't have one.

814
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,242
- Two adults, please.
- Just a second.

815
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,494
You're that singer, right?

816
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,121
Hang in there.

817
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,424
You should've paid my fare too.
I don't even know how much it costs.

818
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,426
Just handle what's thrown at you.

819
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,469
It's not like you were born into money.

820
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,013
So what if you're a celebrity?

821
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,349
Are you too noble to take the bus?

822
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,477
I won't give you anything
except tough love.

823
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,728
What?

824
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,189
At this rate,
I might not sign with you.

825
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,859
Why did you even get on a bus?

826
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,694
To show off

827
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,029
that I'm your girlfriend.

828
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,414
Would you like these?

829
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,708
I noticed that you weren't able
to buy bagels earlier.

830
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,209
I got the last ones.

831
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,502
Is that so?

832
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,005
Thanks. Can I give these to my girlfriend?

833
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,216
That's all right.
You waited in line for those.

834
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,429
I thought baked goods
were their whole world?

835
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,181
I listened to your songs a lot
in ninth grade.

836
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,974
I wanted to say thanks.

837
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,769
I stopped listening to The Crown
after you left the group.

838
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,989
You must have once been her whole world.

839
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,501
What now?

840
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,505
You can't eat or drink anything
on public transportation.

841
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,007
All you're allowed
are beverages in capped bottles.

842
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,593
Mind your manners
when on buses and subway trains.

843
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,594
I'm taking these away.

844
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,640
You're high-maintenance, aren't you?

845
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,851
I was going to not date because I'm busy,

846
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,312
but I need to take the time
to show you the ropes.

847
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,689
Make sure you're free this weekend.

848
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,625
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JO JI-NA

849
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,213
The chords match perfectly.

850
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,887
If I add a chord to this melody,
an arrangement won't even be necessary.

851
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:27,821
That's freezing!

852
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,242
Jeez, you startled me.

853
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,787
That sounded great.
That's the song I know, right?

854
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,165
Yes. Once we're allowed back
into our studio,

855
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,916
we'll practice this song first.

856
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,210
- I've even finished writing the lyrics.
- Really?

857
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,046
It'll be sung

858
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,505
by you and me.

859
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,550
You have to be the one to sing this.

860
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,178
Who else could sing it but me?

861
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,265
Seo Tae-yang doesn't have the ability
to understand a song this sophisticated.

862
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,144
Besides, it's so good that I memorized it
after listening to it in my dreams.

863
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,607
Is that true, though?
Did you really hear it in your dream?

864
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,858
Of course, it's true.

865
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,902
In my dream, a cute little girl

866
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,029
played this white piano.

867
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,906
The melody stayed with me after I woke up.

868
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,115
And the real kicker?

869
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,659
The piano from my dream

870
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,536
also had a bunny sticker
right in this spot.

871
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,122
No way. How does that make sense?

872
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:20,957
It's peculiar for sure.

873
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,960
But this must mean we were meant to meet.

874
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,797
My dream must have been prophetic.

875
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,549
You were the little girl from my dream.

876
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:36,556
Anyway, if weren't for you,
I wouldn't have gotten this piano back.

877
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:38,975
I truly appreciate it.

878
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,355
This is hardly something
that should blow you away.

879
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,523
I'm all about grand gestures.

880
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,277
Can't you be serious for once?
Why are you always so jokey?

881
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,487
What if I'm dead serious?

882
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,162
Are you insane?

883
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,997
What if someone comes up here?

884
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,335
This is frustrating, to say the least.

885
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,088
Because of Tae-yang,
it's so hard to be alone with you.

886
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,757
We can't even tell anyone about us.
It's a torture.

887
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,306
It doesn't feel right
that only we get to be happy.

888
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,476
Let's keep this on the down-low
for a bit longer.

889
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,440
Drinking beer under the moonlight
isn't too bad.

890
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,067
On your first day here,

891
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:33,780
the moon was also just as big
and high in the sky.

892
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,699
Was it?

893
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,327
This is the happiest I've felt

894
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,456
ever since my mom passed away.

895
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,293
Am I allowed

896
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,378
to be this happy?

897
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,465
If we ever break up,

898
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,508
I hope it's not in the fall.

899
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,219
It'd be cruel to break up

900
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,972
in such a beautiful season, wouldn't it?

901
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,434
Why would you even say that?

902
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,982
Come on. Aren't you having any?

903
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,193
Cheers.

904
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,070
I cannot just kiss this beer.

905
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,685
<i>This is the happiest I've felt</i>

906
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,854
<i>ever since my mom passed away.</i>

907
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,612
What are you doing after class tomorrow?

908
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,948
Why do you ask?
To ask me out on a date again?

909
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,158
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

910
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,076
Okay.

911
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,829
Write down all the places you want to go.

912
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,081
I'll take you there before fall ends.

913
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,332
Actually,

914
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,501
I'm going to visit my mom tomorrow.

915
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,045
Would you come with me?

916
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,339
- Your mom?
- Yes.

917
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,677
Sure. Of course.

918
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,637
I thought you didn't like
talking about her.

919
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,765
I've never taken a friend
to visit my mom before.

920
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,017
I could never find the courage.

921
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,018
Why not?

922
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,521
When my mom was declared brain-dead,

923
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,275
the doctor asked me
to donate her organs.

924
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,696
And I gave him my consent.

925
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,656
But then I got scared.

926
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,158
I was worried she might resent me and say…

927
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,162
"Why didn't you wait longer?"

928
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,708
"I could've woken up the next day."

929
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,336
"Why did you make a hasty decision?"

930
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,215
Did she become an organ donor?

931
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,847
I'm sorry.

932
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,976
I get this way
whenever I decide to visit my mom.

933
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,313
Let's meet at the flower shop
near campus after class.

934
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,481
My mom loves hydrangeas.

935
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,233
Will you help me pick some out?

936
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,831
TO MY ONE AND ONLY SON, SA GYE

937
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,124
FROM PARIS, WITH LOVE, MOM

938
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,508
<i>Mom.</i>

939
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,301
<i>Why are the lights off?</i>

940
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,595
Is it nighttime?

941
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,936
Unfortunately,

942
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,981
his only hope right now
is a corneal transplant.

943
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,739
Bom-bom.

944
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,616
No doodling on the walls.

945
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,331
- Mom, catch me if you can.
- <i>What?</i>

946
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,792
<i>Ready or not, here I come.</i>

947
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,503
Bom-bom!

948
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,340
Bom?

949
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,633
Bom!

950
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,668
Bom-bom.

951
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,549
<i>What's going on?</i>

952
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,426
<i>Why am I seeing this?</i>

953
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,724
<i>I'm a loner</i>

954
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,019
<i>I'm a loner</i>

955
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,940
What is it? Would you rather be sweeping?

956
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,568
Did cleaning for a few days make you see
that this is your thing?

957
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,821
- I have a question.
- Sure.

958
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,324
Did Bom grow up in this house
with her mom?

959
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,871
Why do you ask?
To lower the rent since the house is old?

960
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,747
No, I was just curious.

961
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,041
Just be satisfied with the deal you have.

962
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,085
You won't find a better place around here.

963
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,464
Bom's father was a contractor,
so this place was built to last.

964
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,632
If an earthquake hits,
this house will still be standing.

965
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,510
On top of that,
Bom's mom cared for it dearly.

966
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,054
How did Bom's mother die?

967
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,807
Didn't Bom tell you?

968
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,226
I doubt she'd want to.
Her mom was hit by a car.

969
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,937
If only there wasn't a typhoon.

970
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,649
<i>Still, she saved many lives that day.</i>

971
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,235
<i>Someone got her heart, her kidneys…</i>

972
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,654
<i>What else was there? Her eyes, was it?</i>

973
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,492
<i>But what's the point of</i>
<i>remembering it all? It breaks my heart.</i>

974
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,785
When Bom's mother was alive,

975
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,371
she cherished Bom
the way a royal family would.

976
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,623
<i>I feel bad for her.</i>

977
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,043
<i>That poor thing.</i>
<i>This world can be so cruel.</i>

978
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,296
<i>The aftermath of Typhoon Lucy</i>

979
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,965
<i>has left Seoul in despair,</i>
<i>engulfed in darkness.</i>

980
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,801
<i>Trees lining the streets</i>
<i>have fallen onto sidewalks,</i>

981
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,929
<i>and citywide traffic signals</i>

982
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,972
<i>have yet to be fully restored.</i>

983
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,475
<i>Meanwhile, the city urgently deployed</i>
<i>military and police units</i>

984
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,143
<i>to respond to traffic accidents</i>
<i>from last night…</i>

985
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,436
<i>- I'm sorry to ask…</i>
<i>- …to assist</i>

986
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,147
<i>- and manage the fallout.</i>
<i>- …but can I see a photo of Bom's mom?</i>

987
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,316
Let me see.

988
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,359
Here it is.

989
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,986
Here. So beautiful, right?

990
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,072
Don't tell Bom you saw this.

991
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,329
<i>You said her mom died</i>

992
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,207
<i>- six years ago.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

993
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,168
<i>Do you know at which hospital?</i>

994
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,254
<i>Of course.</i>

995
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,630
<i>Wonjung Hospital.</i>

996
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,549
<i>It was near the site of her accident.</i>

997
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,301
Wonjung Hospital?

998
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:18,930
Six years ago.

999
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,686
Wonjung Hospital.

1000
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,191
Six years ago?

1001
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,618
So much for him saying
he'd be here on time.

1002
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,251
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>

1003
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:51,713
<i>You will be redirected to voicemail.</i>
<i>After the tone--</i>

1004
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,060
<i>Bom-bom!</i>

1005
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,236
If I win, you'll answer all my questions.

1006
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,405
About whatever you're hiding

1007
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,282
and what happened six years ago.

1008
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,004
WONJUNG

1009
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,510
Murderer.

1010
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,803
You shameless bastard.

1011
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,097
You killed her.

1012
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,224
The hit-and-run in Mahyeong-dong!

1013
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,811
I know what you did six years ago.

1014
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,980
I remember what I saw.

1015
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:52,899
I…

1016
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,485
I was there!

1017
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,927
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>
<i>You will be redirected to voicemail…</i>

1018
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,616
Mom?

1019
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,326
Mom, what's going on?

1020
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,162
Mom, answer me!

1021
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,331
<i>Mom, can you hear me?</i>

1022
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:01,884
Gye…

1023
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,979
TAE-YANG

1024
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,607
Tae-yang.

1025
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,110
Do you know where Gye is?

1026
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,033
Gyu-ri, have you seen Gye?

1027
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,336
Jin-gu, do you know where Gye is?

1028
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,440
No way.

1029
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,486
It can't be.

1030
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,543
Are you kidding me?

1031
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,253
Have you been here this whole time?

1032
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,839
How stupid are you?

1033
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,801
Tae-yang.

1034
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,930
I can't reach Gye.

1035
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,351
He wouldn't stand me up.

1036
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,480
What if he got into an accident?

1037
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,192
I'm afraid…

1038
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,237
he might disappear,

1039
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,281
just like Mom did.

1040
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,745
<i>What if you were the reason</i>
<i>someone's life was miserable?</i>

1041
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,038
<i>What would you do?</i>

1042
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,418
A witness?
How can a witness show up after six years?

1043
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,378
<i>What is this?</i>

1044
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,171
He might bring us down
if we don't do something.

1045
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,842
<i>Why don't we have a proper conversation?</i>
