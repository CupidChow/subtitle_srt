1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,967
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,436
My Bom-bom.

4
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,825
Mom?

5
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,959
What the hell are you doing?

6
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,048
Don't be a drunk piece of trash.

7
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,966
Pull yourself together.

8
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,386
What the hell?

9
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,724
Stop pretending to be asleep. Wake up.

10
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
Bom, are you all right?

11
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,814
What?

12
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,651
- What do you mean?
- Why didn't you push him off?

13
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,113
He was all over you.

14
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,031
Weren't you bothered?

15
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,492
He's drunk.

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,702
And that gives him a pass?

17
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,678
And this prick has to be heavy too.

18
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,939
Are you even asleep?

19
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,024
You're faking it, right?

20
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,154
You still won't wake up?

21
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,322
Hey!

22
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>Bom-bom.</i>

23
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,836
Why are you so late?

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,546
I've been waiting for ages.

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,756
He sounded like Mom.

26
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,508
"Bom-bom."

27
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,220
"Bom-bom…"

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,361
What the hell?

29
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,157
Thirty-seven. Thirty-eight. Thirty-nine.

30
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,786
Forty!

31
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,085
You were grinding your teeth
badly last night.

32
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,921
Don't you know manners make the man?

33
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,343
Start sleeping with tape
over your lips tonight.

34
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,594
Are you kidding me?

35
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,013
The alcohol on your breath
is giving me a headache.

36
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,182
Did you wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

37
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,934
Come down for breakfast.

38
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,102
No food after 7 a.m.

39
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,072
SAGYE, good morning.

40
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,198
Good morning.

41
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:04,077
What? Bean sprouts soup?
I wanted seaweed soup.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,079
Who's hungover? Is it you, Bom?

43
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,331
It's not me.

44
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,667
Why did you drink so much?

45
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,085
It's a miracle you got home.

46
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,087
SAGYE, did you drink last night?

47
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,756
With whom? You should've called me.
I can hang.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,216
Did you drink enough to get wasted?

49
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,927
- What's your drinking habit?
- Latching on to people, right?

50
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,846
Me? I doubt it.

51
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,057
I had a few shots
and came home to sleep it off.

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,433
Well done.

53
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,650
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

54
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,528
Just so you know,
bean sprouts soup won't do it for me.

55
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,654
For future reference,

56
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,241
please blend organic tomatoes
with two and a half spoons of allulose.

57
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,325
Okay.

58
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,160
Pay for it, and all shall be yours.

59
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,914
Just so you know, bean sprouts soup
will cost an extra 10,000 won.

60
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,417
That's brutal.

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,960
Ten thousand for a meatless soup?

62
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,336
It'll be 20,000 won with meat.

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,046
With tofu, it'll be 15,000 won.

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm not being stingy.
That's inflation for you.

65
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,093
Bom, you made the soup,
so make sure to collect the money.

66
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,845
- Did Bom cook?
- Yes.

67
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,805
That's new.
Breakfast is usually Mom's thing.

68
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,974
No wonder it was seasoned perfectly.

69
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,993
Thanks, Bom.

70
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,537
<i>Why am I getting chills?</i>

71
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,669
You remember everything, don't you?

72
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,677
My Bom-bom.

73
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,477
Stop thinking about it, Bom.

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,020
You don't have time for this.

75
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,110
Stop following me around, will you?

76
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,862
All this because I got drunk?

77
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,864
Don't take advantage of Bom again.

78
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,909
She may be one of the many women
you can fool around with,

79
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,118
but to me,

80
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,871
she's more than that.

81
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,248
I won't let this slide again.

82
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,377
I was never fooling around.

83
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,965
You told me you liked Bom first.

84
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,593
But liking her first
doesn't mean she's yours.

85
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,470
Love isn't first come, first served.

86
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,017
Lose the glare, will you?

87
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,019
You could burn things with that glare.

88
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,481
I have important business to tend to.

89
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,358
See you.

90
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,751
My first band ever, I hope we do wonders.

91
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,170
We may be starting out as a school band,

92
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,589
but may our future be magnificent.

93
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,970
Where's SAGYE?

94
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,680
Who knows? As if I care.

95
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,978
- He left earlier.
- Could something be up?

96
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,438
Didn't he say anything?

97
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,233
Why worry about a grown man? Let's go.

98
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,111
Okay.

99
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,655
How can you be so cold?

100
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,993
How can you be so brutally heartless?

101
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,744
You know,

102
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,622
every time I think of him,
my heart shatters into pieces.

103
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,418
He's probably never even opened
a car door by himself before.

104
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,170
He no longer has a manager,

105
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,006
a car, or a stylist.

106
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,884
He has to walk everywhere.

107
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:53,181
No one crashes this hard
and hits rock bottom overnight.

108
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,562
Are you kidding me?

109
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,813
How was that?

110
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,024
Not bad, right?

111
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,777
I'm being tested on my acting today,
but I can't channel the right emotions.

112
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,696
What if I can't cry later on?

113
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,325
Method acting happens to be my forte.

114
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,285
I'll have to try, I guess.

115
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,181
I don't think I have to explain

116
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,933
why I came to see you.

117
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,145
So give it to me straight.

118
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,980
Why have you been lingering around me?

119
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,905
It was to protect you
from your haters, of course.

120
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,574
Are you saying that's why you're
following Kim Bom around?

121
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,037
Why does it seem like
you're tailing her, not me?

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,081
Why have you been taking photos of her?

123
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,085
Did Mr. Jo order you
to report back on her every move?

124
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,921
Why are you this interested in her?

125
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,594
Move out of that house this instant.

126
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,930
Drop out of school and quit the band.

127
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,224
Don't socialize with Kim Bom.
Don't do anything.

128
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,309
I don't know what game you're playing,

129
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,937
but give up
if you're trying to go against Mr. Jo.

130
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,313
Kim Bom will be in danger.

131
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,566
Because of you.

132
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,317
I'm telling you for old times' sake.

133
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,447
<i>I could put her in danger?</i>

134
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,032
<i>Bom?</i>

135
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>Why? For what reason?</i>

136
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,581
SAGYE

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,459
<i>Let me make this clear.</i>

138
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,670
<i>Lay a finger on Kim Bom,</i>

139
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,922
<i>and I won't sit back and watch.</i>

140
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,604
We'll first study the structures
of the major and minor chords.

141
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,148
There are three common elements.

142
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,317
Who'd like to tell the class
what they are?

143
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,112
I see a face I don't recognize.

144
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,617
What's he doing here?

145
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,245
When did you get here?

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,627
Hello, Professor! I'm Sa Gye,
a first-year theater and film major.

147
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,003
You see,

148
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,340
I was dying to take your course,
which is why I'm here to sit in.

149
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,091
- You?
- Yes.

150
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,137
My best friend recommended
this course to me, you see.

151
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,056
It's her, Kim Bom.

152
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
Hey!

153
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,603
When did I ever say that?

154
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,438
You said sharing is caring.

155
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,069
As one of the artists
leading the K-pop industry,

156
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,237
I believe it's essential
to grasp applied music

157
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,115
and deeply reflect on its importance.

158
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,159
That's why I came to this lecture.

159
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,995
You can say
all chords begin with root notes.

160
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,580
In the example of C major,

161
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,791
we can see they are C, E, and G.

162
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,336
The three notes all have what is known
as unique frequencies.

163
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,547
A frequency refers to a rate

164
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,551
at which a vibration occurs
in a given time.

165
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,597
For instance,
1 Hz represents a vibration rate

166
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,932
of one per second.

167
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,601
WHAT HAPPENED 6 YEARS AGO?
BOM, BOM-BOM, KIM BOM

168
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,580
Don't ever come to my class again.
That was humiliating.

169
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,082
I didn't fall asleep.

170
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,626
I was deeply lost in thought.

171
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,628
Whatever.

172
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,089
Don't tell me you'll follow me
in there as well.

173
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,549
Where are you off to?

174
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,595
Go ahead.

175
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,721
I'll be waiting.

176
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,935
Don't you…

177
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,604
Don't you have any classes today?

178
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,189
You have nothing better to do?

179
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,027
See? There are so many people
looking for me.

180
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,446
I'm busier than you think.

181
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,741
Hey, Hyeon-u. This is Gye.

182
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,870
Right now?

183
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,581
I'm afraid this isn't a good time.

184
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,417
Wait. Where did she go?

185
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,601
He shows up whenever he wants,

186
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,852
invading my space.

187
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,438
He's so annoying.

188
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,140
Tae-yang!

189
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,605
<i>It's been six years</i>

190
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,316
<i>since I last saw</i>
<i>that bright smile of Bom's.</i>

191
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,452
<i>The person you called is unavailable…</i>

192
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,664
How dare he move out of the house?

193
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,084
He's even been skipping classes.
What the hell is he up to?

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,669
He's lost his mind.

195
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,420
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR SEO MIN-CHEOL

196
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,922
Come in.

197
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,883
Hey. What brings you by, Mr. Jo?

198
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,343
I thought you were in the US.

199
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,970
I was feeling lazy, so I stayed.

200
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,555
You're busy, right?

201
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,349
No, I have about an hour to spare.

202
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,517
Have a seat.

203
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,854
I didn't know a workaholic like you
could feel lazy too.

204
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,440
I came to talk about something.

205
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,192
Sure. Go ahead.

206
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,694
What tea would you like?

207
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,656
What's going on?

208
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,241
Tell me.

209
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,289
The car accident from six years ago.

210
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm sure you remember it.

211
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,835
Please help me.

212
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,921
Help me.

213
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,442
Help.

214
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,989
Please help me.

215
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,291
Can she make it?

216
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,045
This is going to be a nuisance.

217
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,798
We're both under the influence.

218
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,759
Why are you bringing that up?

219
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,386
There's a witness.

220
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,346
A witness?

221
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,807
My fellow bandmates!

222
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,017
Attention, please.

223
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,687
TWO SAGYE has booked its first gig.

224
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,856
We're officially set to perform
at the university festival.

225
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,734
We'll be taking the stage
as equals to Hanju Band.

226
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,569
I went to draw our order,

227
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,280
and we'll be the first to perform.

228
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,617
I'm sure you know the opening act
is the highlight of any concert!

229
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,917
I'll plan the whole thing.

230
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,502
- Are you good with that?
- Of course.

231
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,837
I'll operate the sound system.

232
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,840
- Good.
- No one handles equipment as well as I do.

233
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,218
My keen sense of sound
will give Beethoven a run for his money.

234
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,887
- Beethoven was deaf.
- Jin-gu!

235
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,015
Can you lay off on correcting me?

236
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,934
- I never criticize your outfit.
- What's wrong with it?

237
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,812
So? Aren't I the bomb?

238
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,731
Luck is always on my side.

239
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,442
Isn't that how a leader should be?

240
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,901
Gosh, SAGYE.

241
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,070
Is there anything you can't do?

242
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,197
Finding something I'm bad at.

243
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,323
That's what I'm bad at.

244
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,326
<i>Roopretelcham</i>!

245
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,497
We should decide on our set list first.
What should it be? What's our concept?

246
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,957
Hip-hop-rock, of course.

247
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,919
We'll kick off the concert
with a taste of metal!

248
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,880
Who says we're doing hip-hop-rock?

249
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,927
This is a university festival,
not your concert.

250
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,804
That's why I'm suggesting hip-hop-rock.

251
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,765
That will set us apart from Hanju Band.

252
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,641
It's also the music style I want to try.

253
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,894
Why do you need us
if you'll only do what you want?

254
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,022
- The leader decides what to perform.
- How are you the leader?

255
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,608
Who here agreed to that?

256
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,363
As if I need anyone's approval.

257
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,366
TWO SAGYE is the band I put together.

258
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,828
I was the leader of Hanju Band.

259
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
I've always been a leader,

260
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,999
and the lead guitarist spot
will also be mine.

261
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,251
Lead guitarist is something
I can't give up.

262
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,796
I'm a world-class guitarist.

263
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,297
I guess you forgot

264
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,549
that I beat you at your game.

265
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,344
I only gave in
because my guitar string snapped.

266
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,514
I played by the rules.
That doesn't mean you're better.

267
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,351
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

268
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,894
You're a knockoff SAGYE.

269
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,731
- What the…
- Hey, stop that!

270
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,615
- Stop!
- Damn you!

271
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,702
- Get back here.
- You!

272
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,287
What?

273
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,956
Let go!

274
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,920
That's enough!

275
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,632
Why you… Get back here.

276
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,178
I said that was enough!

277
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,725
How are we supposed to perform like this?

278
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,645
We'll fill in the positions
after a discussion and--

279
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,897
- You!
- Hey, stop it.

280
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,983
- You're strangling me.
- Stop.

281
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,944
- Let go!
- Stop!

282
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,864
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

283
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,825
I didn't want you to live a nightmare too.

284
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,535
Are you sure about this?

285
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,746
Are you sure Sa Gye
witnessed the accident?

286
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,041
How else could he have recounted
the scene like he was there?

287
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,501
That's not all.

288
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,879
He's living
with the dead woman's daughter.

289
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,338
The dead woman's daughter?

290
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,842
Did she have a daughter?

291
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,428
You never said she had a family.

292
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,097
I didn't want you
to have to carry that weight.

293
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,974
What good would it have done?

294
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,060
Shit.

295
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,147
Why was I left in the dark
about so many things?

296
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,566
Brace yourself, it gets weirder.

297
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,445
Even Tae-yang is now living
with that woman's daughter.

298
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,822
What are you talking about?

299
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,033
Who is Tae-yang living with?

300
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,328
He moved into where Sa Gye's staying.

301
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,622
My assistant confirmed it.

302
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,089
Kim Bom?

303
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,302
That woman who died was Kim Bom's mother?

304
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,095
Do you know Kim Bom?

305
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,730
Tae-yang has known her
for quite some time,

306
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,857
since middle school.

307
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,905
Things are taking a bad turn.

308
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,243
Surely, it's no coincidence that
they're all living together.

309
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,247
Even fate wouldn't be enough
to explain what's happening.

310
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,918
The case has already been closed.

311
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,004
She was hit by a car
that lost control in the rain.

312
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,298
Not if there was a witness.

313
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,342
Do you want there to be one?

314
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,135
Kim Bom might already know the truth.

315
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,305
The real reason why her mom died.

316
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,768
She would've done something
if she'd known.

317
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,187
I'll meet with Kim Bom.

318
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,691
Why are you shirtless?

319
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,401
It's not like there's
anything worth seeing.

320
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,528
Don't you care about others at all?

321
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,488
Seriously. Are you jealous?

322
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,156
Bulk up too if you want.

323
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,034
Hey! Why did you turn off the lights?
I'm studying.

324
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,412
- Turn them back on.
- Turn them on yourself.

325
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,834
- You stepped on me on purpose, didn't you?
- Me? Well, I can't see a thing.

326
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,044
Hey! Stop stepping on me.

327
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,755
Shut up, damn it! Or take it outside!

328
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,049
Those childish pricks.

329
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,263
No.

330
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
I can't let us fail like this.

331
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,561
We should at least get to perform
at a rock festival.

332
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,867
<i>Announcement.</i>

333
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,036
<i>TWO SAGYE will go on a retreat.</i>

334
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,164
<i>When and where to gather.</i>
<i>Today at 9 a.m. Outside the school gate.</i>

335
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,041
<i>Don't show up,</i>
<i>and you must pay a million won.</i>

336
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,250
A retreat?

337
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,546
Why a retreat all of a sudden?

338
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,757
It's not like we're
on good terms right now.

339
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,551
That's exactly why we're going.

340
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,928
We'll be burying one of them.

341
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,348
Over here!

342
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,267
Seriously? No way!

343
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,810
We'll be going in this van?

344
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,271
Isn't it a van that celebrities ride in?

345
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,856
That's so thoughtful of you!

346
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,071
- Good morning. I hope I'm not late.
- Hey.

347
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,405
Producer Jo.

348
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,616
Ms. Kim, how have you been?

349
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,826
- I heard you two were in the same band.
- Right.

350
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,953
I am. Have you been well?

351
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,873
Thank you so much for lending us your van.

352
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,666
Thanks.

353
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,418
You really helped me out here.

354
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,464
Still, don't tell Mr. Jo about this.

355
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,549
Don't worry.

356
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,594
I can do this much
without my dad's approval.

357
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,514
Ms. Jo, can't you come with us?

358
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,141
We're off to bury these two airheads

359
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,852
and could use an extra set of hands.

360
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,730
I don't have the time.

361
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,107
Ms. Richie Rich.

362
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,900
Please come with us today.

363
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,985
I'm a real sport at these retreats.

364
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,946
I'll do everything I can

365
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,116
to keep you entertained. Sweet, isn't it?

366
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,492
She's right, Ms. Richie Rich.

367
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,037
You can always find the time. Just do it!

368
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,498
- Let's go.
- But…

369
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,791
- I can't.
- Of course, you can.

370
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,709
Guys, you can't do that!

371
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,044
Ji-na's super busy!

372
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,552
Bom, aren't you cold?

373
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,263
Here.

374
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,774
Seriously? You did that on purpose.

375
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,404
- Here are some napkins.
- Sorry.

376
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,573
Sorry about that. I picked the wrong song.

377
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,325
This is what he's like.

378
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,119
Whenever he listens to a song he likes,

379
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,830
he gets worked up
and drives like a madman.

380
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,207
He even forgets he has other passengers.

381
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,628
- It's all right, SAGYE. Keep it up.
- I didn't mind it.

382
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,390
SAGYE, what's wrong?
Is there an issue with the van?

383
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,434
Did you hit the brakes,
or did the engine die?

384
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,353
This isn't a stroller. Step on it.

385
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,272
Don't speak like that to SAGYE.

386
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,441
Hey, stop at the next rest area.

387
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,525
I need the restroom.

388
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,361
Sure, okay. Don't worry.

389
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,531
I'll have fish cakes.

390
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,782
- Go ahead.
- Nice.

391
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,326
Hey, right here.

392
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,745
I told you to stop at the rest area.

393
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,246
Geez, it slipped my mind.

394
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,874
The next rest area is 100 km away.

395
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,959
Hold it in.

396
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,170
- Hold it.
- Hold it in!

397
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,338
Have this instead.

398
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,173
- Tae-yang, you can do it.
- Hold it.

399
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,008
- That's the spirit.
- Rise above it.

400
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,553
- Here.
- Eat!

401
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,897
Hey, Bom.

402
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,107
- Here. Let me take that.
- But…

403
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,239
Hey, Seo Tae-yang.

404
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,283
Get to work.

405
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,294
This? I'm actually an expert at this.

406
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,713
Roll it up like so and--

407
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,881
Sure, get on it.

408
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,301
Bom, wait for me!

409
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,942
Tae-yang, can you do this?

410
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,777
- What?
- This.

411
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,470
One, two…

412
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,768
Seo Tae-yang. Stop right there!

413
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,898
Why do you keep picking a fight with me?

414
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,316
You started it.

415
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,151
I've had it with your childish tricks.

416
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,528
You'll address me
as your senior from now on.

417
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:41,159
That's too bad. I can't respect those
I don't have anything to learn from.

418
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,703
But if that's important to you,

419
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,663
let me be the lead guitarist.

420
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,040
That's a matter of my pride.

421
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,126
If I get that taken away,
there's no reason for me to be in a band.

422
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,046
Then, this talk is over.

423
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,589
I say this as the front man.

424
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,549
Immediately quit the band.

425
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,886
You've been irritating as hell.

426
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,513
That's rich coming from you.

427
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,181
Why are you chasing Bom around?

428
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,267
Don't change the subject
and just admit it.

429
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
That I represent TWO SAGYE.

430
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:16,152
Enough with it already!

431
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,411
Damn it.

432
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,755
Stop that. Please don't.

433
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,429
- Bom!
- Bom!

434
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,400
Darn.

435
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,796
Move. Emergency patient!

436
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,174
- Out of the way.
- Emergency patient coming through.

437
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,139
Gye!

438
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,730
Bom?

439
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,649
Bom!

440
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,408
No!

441
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,327
Don't you dare!

442
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,560
Bom, have some of this.

443
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,359
Shouldn't she see a doctor?

444
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,654
I don't think that's necessary.

445
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,406
I'll be okay soon.

446
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,162
Hang in there. Gyu-ri's gone to buy
some medicine. She'll be back soon.

447
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,169
I'm sorry, Bom. We won't argue anymore.

448
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,588
I'll do as you say.

449
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,632
You'll decide on the positions
and the song we'll play.

450
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,928
Just don't get sick.
I'll do as you wish as well.

451
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,763
Liars. I don't believe you.

452
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,558
- We're not lying. See?
- It's true.

453
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,310
This is how guys bond.

454
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,728
We're now besties.

455
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,229
Starting today.

456
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,359
Do you mean it?

457
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,236
You could be
at each other's throats again.

458
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,906
No way.

459
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,990
I swear to God.

460
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,997
Then, I'll decide.

461
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,000
- You can't complain.
- Sure.

462
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,962
The lead guitarist will be…

463
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,715
Sa Gye.

464
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,093
Really? Are you sure?

465
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,097
It's not like I have to be
the lead guitarist.

466
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,475
Instead, Tae-yang will choose the song.

467
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,893
Whatever song you want.

468
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,733
Sure. Then who's the leader of this band?

469
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,194
Don't speak if it hurts.

470
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,362
I'm fine either way.

471
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,197
I don't have to be the damn leader.

472
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,742
The leader?

473
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,411
That will be me.

474
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,163
- What?
- What? You?

475
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,499
Yes, I'll lead the band.

476
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,917
I don't trust you two.

477
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,378
I'll have to be the one
to carry TWO SAGYE.

478
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,130
- I'm in charge of planning anyway.
- Bom!

479
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,341
Bom.

480
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,843
Bom, are you all right?
I got you some medicine.

481
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,053
How's the coughing?

482
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,098
It's getting worse. Would these even work?

483
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,182
Really?

484
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,102
How did you end up in the water?

485
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,437
You're supposed to be a good swimmer.

486
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,025
Actually, Gyu-ri…

487
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,403
Bom can swim?

488
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,155
Yes, she's like a fish in the water.

489
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,616
She competed
in a nationwide junior tournament

490
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,244
and even became
a certified lifeguard in the US.

491
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,620
I told you to stop.

492
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,247
A certified lifeguard?

493
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,291
Bom, so you…

494
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,254
Did you fake it?
You pretended to be drowning?

495
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,798
Were you also lying
about the coughs and shivers?

496
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,429
That's right. I lied, okay?

497
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,556
That's on you two
for butting heads out here.

498
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,143
I almost died
trying to get you two to make up.

499
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,650
- Kim Bom.
- Kim Bom!

500
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,610
Hey, Kim Bom!

501
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,446
Hey, stop right there!

502
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,181
TAE-YANG

503
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,481
<i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>
<i>You will be redirected to voicemail…</i>

504
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,662
<i>If Kim Bom also knows the truth,</i>

505
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,248
<i>the police will soon look into it.</i>

506
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,634
- <i>I-Am-Ground, the game begins.</i>
- <i>Ground. Begins.</i>

507
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,886
- You're out.
- What?

508
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,554
- What do you mean?
- Come here.

509
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,431
- Hang on!
- What could be so fun?

510
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,893
It's not fun at all.

511
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,145
- One, two, three. <i>Loser slap</i>!
- <i>Loser slap</i>!

512
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,068
- Again.
- Let's go once more.

513
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,738
- Sure.
- <i>I-Am-Ground, the game begins.</i>

514
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,823
Tae-yang, eight.

515
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,616
What? Shouldn't you state your name first?

516
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,535
Really? Hey, you're right!

517
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,267
<i>This is a new song.</i>
<i>Why didn't she sell this too?</i>

518
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,601
It's your turn.

519
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,894
I'm off to the van.

520
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,563
I'll only be ten seconds.

521
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,106
That's cheating. Get back here.

522
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm not going anywhere.

523
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,081
Are you having fun?

524
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,804
It's here!

525
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,557
My heart's pounding.

526
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,101
There's no need to be nervous.
I'm not committing a crime.

527
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,479
I just want to know how much he has.

528
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,399
If he's loaded,
I'll be generously nicer to him.

529
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,865
Who is it?

530
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,034
I said, who is it?

531
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,661
Why is no one answering me?

532
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,456
Is this a prank?

533
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,417
You'll be sorry if I ever catch you!

534
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,127
Unbelievable.

535
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,420
- My gosh!
- Goodness.

536
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,130
- Who are you?
- Well,

537
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,090
I'm Tae-yang's father.

538
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,092
I should've come by sooner
to introduce myself.

539
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,677
Right, Tae-yang's father.

540
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,514
Tae-yang's father?

541
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,558
Director Seo!

542
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,727
- Director Seo, of course.
- What…

543
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,020
I know you so well.

544
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,606
You're on TV a lot.

545
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,276
I saw you on <i>Great Doctors </i>as well.

546
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,237
Tae-yang's not here right now, is he?

547
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,738
Of course, he isn't.

548
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,323
He's left for a band retreat yesterday.

549
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,409
He'll spend the night in Pyeongchang
and head to school from there.

550
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,577
Goodness.

551
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,663
I see he didn't tell you.

552
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,498
Kids are like that these days.

553
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,959
They simply don't care
about their parents.

554
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,670
May I take a look at Tae-yang's room?

555
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,172
- Of course.
- I need to pick up his things.

556
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,093
Wait, whatever for?
He didn't say he was moving out.

557
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,429
I only need his books.
May I head inside for a moment?

558
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,556
Yes, of course.

559
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,892
You have a sweet and cozy home.

560
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,270
That's too kind.

561
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,439
When Bom's mother was alive,
this was the best house on the block.

562
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,900
There were a lot of flowers
in the garden as well.

563
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,944
Please drink your coffee.

564
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,407
How did Bom's mother pass away?

565
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,288
It was a car accident.
A car lost control in the rain.

566
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,373
Honestly, it was the weirdest day.

567
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,375
I had never experienced
a day like that before.

568
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,795
So it was an accident. How unfortunate.

569
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,547
Don't you remember that day?

570
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,049
It was six years ago.

571
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,802
The news went on and on
about the unusual weather.

572
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,097
I'm not sure. It's not ringing a bell.

573
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,225
Of course. Others would've forgotten.

574
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,145
We should also move on, but…

575
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,566
- So that's why she lives with her aunt.
- That's right.

576
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,819
Tae-yang first met Bom
when he went to the US

577
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,279
to study English.

578
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,613
Yes, apparently so.

579
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,992
Bom went to the US at an early age
to study music.

580
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,329
However, she had to give up her studies
after her mother passed away.

581
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,831
If she hadn't, she would've already made
a name for herself.

582
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,418
Members of the Gwangsan Kim family
are known to be clever.

583
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,502
Right.

584
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,712
Goodness.

585
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,548
I'd love to meet Bom sometime.

586
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,384
Could I perhaps get her number?

587
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,764
Did you say 50 billion won?

588
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,809
Mr. Jo, are you absolutely sure?

589
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,270
I can't believe
you're sponsoring such a fortune.

590
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,273
I'm so touched

591
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,484
that I might cry.

592
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,277
You can rebuild

593
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,322
the Science Hall, which has been
a longtime dream of yours.

594
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,950
Absolutely.

595
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,704
And that building
will be named after you, Mr. Jo.

596
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,499
I'll call it the Jo Sang-heon Hall.

597
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,583
Actually,

598
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,754
I have a favor to ask of you.

599
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,881
Feel free to ask me for anything.

600
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:48,219
This time around, I will get it done,
no matter what.

601
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:55,559
There's a first-year student named Kim Bom
studying applied music.

602
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,646
I'd like to grant her
a full scholarship to study abroad.

603
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,398
A scholarship?

604
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,527
As if that even counts as a favor.

605
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,532
I want Kim Bom
to fly out as soon as possible.

606
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,243
The sooner, the better.

607
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,170
Hello, Dr. Seo.

608
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,257
- It's been a while. How have you been?
- Please sit.

609
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,890
I've seen you from time to time on campus

610
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,643
but never gotten around
to buying you a meal.

611
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,645
Don't say that.

612
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,647
Please address me casually.

613
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,360
Why should I speak casually
to someone I don't know very well?

614
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,905
I'm not one to be friendly
with just about anyone.

615
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,076
I see.

616
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,621
I hear Tae-yang's been staying
at your place.

617
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,248
Your aunt probably told you this,

618
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,417
but I brought most of his things
back home.

619
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,463
I had no idea he moved out
without your permission.

620
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,591
Had I known, I wouldn't have let him stay.

621
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,470
- I'm sorry, sir.
- There's no need to apologize.

622
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,097
But now that you know,

623
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,808
I suggest you act more wisely.

624
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,939
May I ask why you wanted to see me?

625
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,608
Recently,

626
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,694
Tae-yang is rebelling
as if he's a teenager all over again.

627
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,115
I didn't mind him being in a band
as a premed,

628
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,910
but he's past that and should study.

629
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,579
When I told him to cut back
on his extracurriculars,

630
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,456
he moved out of the house.

631
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,000
He's also been skipping his classes.

632
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,002
Were you aware?

633
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,545
No, sir. I wasn't.

634
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,797
That being said,

635
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,760
I'd like you to send him back home
in any way you can.

636
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,305
Also, stay away from him.

637
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,060
- Sorry?
- Don't take any of his calls

638
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,145
and never let him into your house again.

639
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,648
He needs to focus on his studies
right now.

640
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,983
He worked hard to get into med school.

641
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,236
And he has what it takes
to be a great doctor.

642
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,155
That is why I don't want him
getting sidetracked

643
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,782
with meaningless distractions.

644
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,244
I'm sure you understand what I'm saying.

645
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,918
It is my dream to save lives

646
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,463
at the hospital with my son by my side.

647
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,175
I'd rather not see you
get in the way of that.

648
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,180
Enjoy your meal.

649
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,598
It's on me.

650
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,271
Your meal will be served.

651
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,950
What's your problem?

652
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,414
Fine, I won't eat it.

653
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,166
I know he did nothing but sleep,

654
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,794
but the group feels incomplete
without him.

655
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,298
Could they have gone on a date together?

656
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,925
I wouldn't be surprised.
They've been joined at the hip these days.

657
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,428
Actually, Sa Gye's the one
chasing her around.

658
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,096
- SAGYE?
- Yes.

659
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,640
- And Bom?
- Yes.

660
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:24,977
He's chasing her around?

661
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,813
<i>I'd like to talk to you in private.</i>
<i>Can we meet up?</i>

662
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,815
<i>I'll wait at the bus stop.</i>

663
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,320
Guys, I forgot I had plans.
I'll see you around.

664
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,404
- What?
- Where are you going?

665
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,072
Tae-yang, you're leaving too?

666
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,451
Hold on. Did he leave
so that we could be alone?

667
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,077
Jin-gu, behave yourself!

668
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,122
Sorry, guys.

669
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,169
HANJU UNIVERSITY MAIN ENTRANCE

670
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,756
Did you have to wait long?

671
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,760
Why were you waiting out here?
You should've gone to a café.

672
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,762
Actually, shall we grab food first?

673
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,517
I'm good. Your dad bought me dinner.

674
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,645
He bought me filet mignon.

675
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,940
You met with my dad?

676
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,485
What's your problem?

677
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,113
Aren't you too old for puberty blues?

678
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,870
Stop making life hard for everyone
and go back home, Young Master Tae-yang.

679
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,916
If I were just going to go back,

680
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,250
I would have never left.

681
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,842
Your dad

682
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,887
already cleared out your things.

683
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,971
What?

684
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,766
- How could you let him?
- Do as he says.

685
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,143
Whatever you're fighting with him about,
fight him at home.

686
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,480
Get his permission before you move out.
I heard you've been skipping classes too.

687
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,650
Others would kill to go to med school,
so why quit it?

688
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,028
Because it isn't for me.

689
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,613
What's your thing, then?

690
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,282
We can't all do what we want in life.

691
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,330
After my mom died…

692
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,209
even her business flopped.

693
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,338
Do you know what I thought?

694
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,965
That I had been selfish.

695
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,217
I selfishly only chased
after my own dreams…

696
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,180
when my mom had given up
everything because of me.

697
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,016
That's why I promised myself

698
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,728
to do 99 things I hated

699
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,273
so I could make room
for the one thing I love.

700
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,568
That's why I've been working my ass off,
working part-time jobs!

701
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,446
Do you think…

702
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,283
I've only been doing what I want to do?

703
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,952
Yes. It also seems like
you're going out of your way

704
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,706
to make trouble for yourself
for the fun of it.

705
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,790
- Kim Bom!
- I don't

706
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,002
want your dad coming to see me again.

707
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,753
Why?

708
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,217
It got me jealous.

709
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,430
You're lucky to have a dad who nags.

710
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,892
Take care.

711
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,074
Bom…

712
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,759
That was cold, Bom.

713
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,691
You're staying out way too late.

714
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,859
Have you had dinner?

715
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,737
Of course. It's late.

716
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,989
With whom? What did you eat?
When and where?

717
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,159
Enough is enough.

718
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,494
Is this an interrogation?

719
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,207
Why won't you listen to me?
There's no harm in being cautious.

720
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,458
It's a scary world out there.

721
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,169
I've lived in this neighborhood
for 20 years.

722
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,256
I'm also a black belt in taekwondo, so…

723
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:24,800
Okay.

724
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,886
Take your own advice.

725
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,014
Where's Tae-yang?

726
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,225
What happened?

727
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,935
All his things are gone.

728
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,020
Did his dad drag him back home
like your aunt said?

729
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,731
Isn't he old enough
to make decisions for himself?

730
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,024
Is he his dad's puppet?

731
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,362
Thrilled to have the room to yourself?

732
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,447
Relieved like you got rid
of the thorn in your side?

733
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,701
You should've been nicer to him
when he was around.

734
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,912
But…

735
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,376
SAGYE

736
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,845
How does it feel to be back home?

737
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,725
Keep your word
about not skipping any more classes.

738
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,482
You must keep your word too.

739
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,235
Don't go see Bom again.

740
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,989
As long as you keep your word,
I won't have any reason to see her.

741
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,241
You'll also quit that band.

742
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,868
Stay away from people like her.

743
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:38,165
Why on earth do you hate her so much?

744
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,000
She gives me a bad feeling.

745
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,336
I also don't like the fact
that she's an orphan.

746
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,920
That's not her fault!

747
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,756
If that's the case,

748
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,051
don't I give off the worst feeling?

749
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,597
I told you to stay away from her,
so do as I say.

750
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,391
You will never get to be with her.

751
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,518
I dare you to stay in her life.

752
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,979
Then we'll both see
how far I'm willing to go.

753
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,613
Don't forget
you're observing my surgery today.

754
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,031
It's at 2 p.m.

755
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,201
The liver, heart, and kidney
will be harvested

756
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,703
from a patient
who's in a brain death state.

757
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,623
You don't get to observe
such a surgery often.

758
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,501
Consider it a privilege
for having a doctor for a father.

759
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,212
Be grateful.

760
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,263
There can't possibly
be a better opportunity.

761
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,308
Only one of our students
gets this chance to study abroad.

762
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,477
You have good grades

763
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,939
and are well-regarded by the professors,
which is why we've chosen you.

764
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,983
But I don't have good grades.
My GPA's under 3.0.

765
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,485
Is that so?

766
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,446
It's not like your grades matter.

767
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,825
You were chosen because you're
promising in more ways than one.

768
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,494
Don't feel burdened
or think much of it and go.

769
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,914
Your tuition will be covered,
as well as your dorm and living expenses.

770
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,499
This is a full package.

771
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,043
Something even your parents
couldn't provide.

772
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,338
I get that, but this is out of the blue.

773
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,340
That's how opportunities
present themselves.

774
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,509
I hear you've had it rough
since losing your parents young.

775
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,220
The heavens are trying
to make it up to you.

776
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,055
So why are you fighting it?

777
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,850
Go ahead and sign it already.

778
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,561
Please sign it, Ms. Bom.

779
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,521
Go ahead. That's it.

780
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,858
- I'm not going.
- You won't? Why not?

781
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,568
I appreciate the offer.

782
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,195
But I'm not that pathetic
as you make me out to be.

783
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,656
Besides, I'm not thrilled
about being selected

784
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,324
for a program I didn't sign up for.

785
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,953
But most of all,
I have many things going on here.

786
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,580
Like the upcoming performance.

787
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,040
I'm sure others would jump at this chance.

788
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,125
Then…

789
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,669
I'll get going.

790
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,464
Ms. Bom, wait!

791
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,923
Hey, Kim Bom!

792
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,009
You!

793
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,678
Number 128, please.

794
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,597
QUEUE NUMBER 128

795
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,106
Let me check again.

796
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,151
I'll now begin the surgery.

797
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,360
Scalpel.

798
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,871
Mom.

799
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,665
Mom, I'm home.

800
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,593
Seo Tae-yang,

801
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,053
pull yourself together.

802
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,544
Father.

803
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,920
You wimp.

804
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,089
You're not just a wimp
but a moron as well.

805
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,177
You're just as pathetic
as your damn mother.

806
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,638
What could you possibly do
with that mentality?

807
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,807
Don't talk to me about Mom.

808
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,684
We both know who drove her off a cliff.

809
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,854
The weak and pitiful
are always the ones making excuses.

810
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,355
Is that how I raised you?

811
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,316
It's humiliating to even call you my son.
You know that?

812
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,945
I'm not exactly proud of you either.

813
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,948
Kick and hit me all you want.
I'll take all of it.

814
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,408
But after that,

815
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,910
you won't force me to be a doctor.

816
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,871
Here you go again with that glare!

817
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,918
I don't know how much longer
I should put up with you.

818
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,128
I just don't.

819
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,046
Exactly.

820
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,550
What can I do to make you give up on me?

821
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,264
Will you stop forcing me to be a doctor

822
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,016
if I can't become one at all?

823
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,269
What? What do you think you're doing?

824
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:14,107
If being a doctor is my only option,
I'll take it off the table.

825
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,651
Seo Tae-yang, have you lost it?

826
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,904
How stupid are you?

827
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,531
Why would you hurt your own hand?

828
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,783
Where's the guy
who challenged me to a showdown?

829
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,161
Do you have no clue
how to fight your battles?

830
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,330
Yet you talked big?

831
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,166
Will you play the guitar
with your teeth or toes?

832
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,584
Let go of me.

833
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,300
If you have the strength,
stand up for yourself.

834
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,135
Mind your own business.

835
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,306
I doubt this matter concerns you.

836
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,476
Is that so, Dr. Seo?

837
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,646
Since you've already met with Bom
and are well-connected,

838
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,190
I figured you enjoyed meddling.

839
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,235
I'd rather not see you
get in the way of that.

840
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,322
Enjoy your meal.

841
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,740
It's on me.

842
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,704
Your meal will be served.

843
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,003
Dr. Seo, we need you!

844
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,924
No aspiring doctor
would dare damage his hands.

845
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,646
If you let him have his way

846
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,815
because you were worried
he might hurt Bom,

847
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,775
you don't need to worry.

848
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,654
Your dad won't ever be able to harm her.

849
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,116
You could even call me her stalker.
I'm always on her tail recently.

850
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,453
You should go.

851
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,748
I will even if you try to stop me.

852
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,132
It'll only be your loss
if you don't live the way you want.

853
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,342
Keep that in mind, Tae-yang.

854
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,224
Shouldn't Tae-yang be here?

855
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,226
Did he forget it's practice time?

856
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,104
Tell me about it.

857
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,481
He chose the hardest song for you to play,

858
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,400
but he's late by hours.

859
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,111
Let's wait a bit more.
You know he always keeps his word.

860
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,404
Just tell him to quit!

861
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,198
Even my darling SAGYE
is waiting for him too.

862
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,452
He should do what I do
and not go home at all.

863
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,079
Jin-gu, you didn't go home yesterday too?

864
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,665
How can you eat and sleep here?
Don't you have a home?

865
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,501
No, I don't.
Do I look like I have a place to live?

866
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,753
Not at all.

867
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,682
Are you nuts?

868
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,768
What happened
to your conscience and shame?

869
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,772
You're late by a whopping two hours.
Shouldn't you apologize first?

870
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,440
That's enough.

871
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,651
Were you held back by class?
Why didn't you pick up our calls?

872
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,236
He's here, so who cares?

873
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,030
- Don't make a fuss about it.
- Sure.

874
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,537
Let's begin, then.

875
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,582
Jin-gu?

876
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,021
FESTIVAL D-10

877
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,066
How do we hang it up?

878
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,119
HITTING "ROCK" BOTTOM
ENJOY AND EMBRACE WITH TWO SAGYE

879
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,286
FESTIVAL D-9

880
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,165
What the hell?
Why is everything off-balance?

881
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,002
I can't hear us properly.

882
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,255
- Do we need to recheck the volume?
- Of course not.

883
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,007
How can we perform sounding like amateurs?

884
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,468
We can't beat Hanju Band like this.

885
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,262
Again.

886
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,863
FESTIVAL D-7

887
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,157
Who keeps joining in off-beat?

888
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,951
Don't join on the beat.
Come in half a beat early!

889
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,494
I joined in at a syncopated rhythm.

890
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,746
I was on point as well.

891
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,166
It's never you two, is it? We'll go again!

892
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,417
Stop blaming others.

893
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,920
That section where we join
at a syncopated rhythm.

894
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,673
We'll sound messy
if even one of us is off beat.

895
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,050
Signal with your eyes and play as a group.

896
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,094
- Chemistry is key to a band.
- Chemistry is key!

897
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,388
Chemistry!

898
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,408
FESTIVAL D-4

899
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,868
TWO SAGYE, HITTING "ROCK" BOTTOM

900
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,453
NOVEMBER 5, 2025,
OPEN-AIR THEATER

901
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,413
HANJU BAND
2025 UNIVERSITY FESTIVAL

902
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,710
- This way.
- Sure.

903
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,345
Over here? Okay.

904
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,310
I saw what you did, TWO SAGYE.

905
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,770
Stay right there.

906
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,605
- Run.
- Hey!

907
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,280
Not again.

908
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,700
Let's please be on point, guys.

909
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,910
Here we go.

910
00:58:58,993 --> 00:58:59,994
FESTIVAL D-3

911
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,580
One, two, three, four.

912
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,319
Who ordered Chinese?

913
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,117
- Who was it?
- What the hell?

914
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,870
I was

915
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,789
starving.

916
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,791
FESTIVAL D-2

917
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,710
Ro-ha! Did you know
SAGYE's going to perform?

918
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,004
You should be there. Am I right?

919
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,964
It's in two days. Sure thing!

920
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,340
Da-won!

921
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,135
Hye-yun!

922
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,636
Ju-yeon!

923
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,446
- Are you up?
- What time is it?

924
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,572
It's 3 a.m.

925
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,993
3 a.m.? I can't believe you.
Why didn't you wake me up?

926
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:24,495
How could I? You were sound asleep.

927
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,582
We need to go. Auntie will kill us
if we stay out all night.

928
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,334
Hold your horses.

929
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,211
The doors are locked,
so there's no way of leaving.

930
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,546
What?

931
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,007
What, then? We should sleep here?

932
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,343
You should've woken me up.

933
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,471
Why are you yelling at me
when you're the one who fell asleep?

934
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,849
Because of you, I was stuck here
making sure you were okay.

935
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,145
Don't you feel guilty at all?

936
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,106
It's not like

937
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,734
you apologized to me either.

938
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,819
Why do I need to apologize to you?

939
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,574
That… You know why.

940
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,950
No, I don't.

941
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,328
Are you going to keep playing dumb?

942
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,664
The other day, you pretended to be drunk

943
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,791
and hugged me! I know you remember that.

944
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,751
But why act like you don't?

945
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,961
Why do I need to apologize for that?

946
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,963
I didn't hug you because I was drunk.

947
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,423
I hugged you because I like you.

948
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,178
You didn't push me away
because you like me too, no?

949
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,890
That's ridiculous.

950
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:27,725
Well, I…

951
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,436
I was reminded of my mom, that's all.

952
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,730
My gosh!

953
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,857
They must've turned the lights off.
It's terrifying.

954
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,694
See?

955
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,529
You like being in my arms.

956
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,452
It suddenly went dark. I was just scared.

957
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,464
There. That's better, right?

958
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,053
The moon's so bright tonight.

959
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,476
Can I ask why you always try so hard?

960
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,896
I honestly thought I was the only one.

961
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,990
Because I have two lives to live for.

962
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,616
Mine and

963
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,493
my mom's.

964
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,040
There's another reason.

965
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,586
You.

966
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:38,796
Me?

967
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,549
I want you to be

968
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,469
the first artist I produce.

969
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,678
I bet you didn't know.

970
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,098
That's why this performance
is important to me.

971
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,395
Gye.

972
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,774
Why don't we

973
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,859
get back up?

974
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,029
You should show them

975
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,948
that SAGYE is still the star he is
despite the setbacks.

976
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,330
You'll be my producer?

977
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,998
You?

978
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,583
Can you afford to sign me?

979
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,084
Why?

980
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,005
- Would that cost a lot?
- Yes, of course.

981
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,715
You said I'm still a superstar.

982
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,176
Don't be a jerk.

983
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,054
You're loaded. So offer me a discount.

984
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,681
I'll pay more once I earn a lot of money.

985
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,391
I can make you soar.

986
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,851
I'll need a signing bonus

987
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,480
if I'm to soar like a rocket or whatnot.

988
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,233
How about this, then?

989
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,236
Sign the contract first. Then, I'll pay.

990
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,404
Is that so?

991
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,324
I'll sign the contract, then.

992
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,369
Right now?

993
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:54,038
You know one shouldn't move
when sealing the deal, don't you?

994
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:11,764
<i>Bom,</i>

995
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,934
<i>I'm excited to know</i>
<i>that I'm a part of your dreams.</i>

996
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,347
<i>Gye. How about we go on that date?</i>

997
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,058
<i>But this must mean we were meant to meet.</i>

998
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,852
<i>This is the happiest I've felt.</i>

999
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,980
<i>My dream must have been prophetic.</i>

1000
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,233
<i>Are you ready to bring the house down?</i>

1001
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,530
<i>Random people came to the event</i>
<i>pretending to be SAGYE's fans?</i>

1002
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,741
<i>Was it your doing, Father?</i>

1003
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,910
What do you think you're doing?

1004
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,494
<i>Where's Bom?</i>

1005
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,288
Where is she?

1006
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:21,584
