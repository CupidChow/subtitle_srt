1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will never reach the end

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will be a gardener

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You said you were not afraid

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will be by your side

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I will be brave

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No matter how far I go

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have a person to protect

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will never be afraid

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will be a gardener

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will be a gardener

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will be a gardener

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will never be a gardener

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I will never be a gardener

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Apversion

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Eternal Love

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
China sends us back money

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,560
to take our information.

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,920
As a warrior,

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,840
there's no way that the Iron Valley

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
would be so simple.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,960
I found the true power of the success.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
Please take me in.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
I really want to join the Hanxiao Army.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
There's a place for the army.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
Can you join us?

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,160
I can feel it.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
What's this place?

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,480
The Five Flowers Town.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,680
According to the doctor,

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
there are 10,000 tasks.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
But he found the true power of success.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,960
It's not worth it.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Let's find the doctor.

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
I have to go to the data center in Yujing City

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
for a big deal.

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,200
This is a medical system.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
It's just a metal device.

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Don't you think so?

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Doctor,

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
when will he wake up?

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
It's hard to say.

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
Don't call me doctor.

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,440
My name is Tang Xiao Kui.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
You can call me Xiao Kui.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,600
Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
My name is Ye Yu.

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,560
May I ask you...

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Ailee.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
The child's condition is not good.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I thought he couldn't hold on for too long.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Can he take the medicine?

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
No.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
He's not very good at it.

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,560
It's a miracle that he can survive.

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
The most important thing now is to take the medicine.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
It's possible that the virus will be active.

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Why did the medicine only offer one medicine?

59
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
What?

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,080
I can't take the medicine more quickly.

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
I can't take the medicine anymore.

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Why did I forget to check it?

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
Use this one.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,440
I'll get a new one.

65
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
But you're more important.

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
It's already the seventh day.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Hurry up.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I can do it.

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I'll help you.

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
It says the horse's hair.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Are you having a holiday today?

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Looks like there are many delicious things.

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
What's this?

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Isn't it that one?

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Why are they looking at us so strangely?

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Hasn't Zi Hua Village ever been invited by a stranger?

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
It's my fault.

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Hit him.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Do it.

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
It's my fault.

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Hit me.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I'll kill you.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Stop.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
A little bastard.

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Hong Ling.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I've found Hong Ling's weapon.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
If I don't take it away,

88
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
he'll destroy the village.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Where?

90
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
In the village.

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Right in the village.

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Aili.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Wait for me.

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
It's none of your business.

95
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
You saved me.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
As a repayment, I should...

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Whatever.

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
The depth of the formation and the depth of the horse

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
are at least two tons.

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
The horse is only round and round.

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
It's very serious.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
It's also very sharp.

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
This is called the Red Eye.

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
It must have been sold for a long time.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't think you know much about it.

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Please leave it to me.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You can go back.

108
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Xiao Kui said Hong Ling is very scary.

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm afraid you'll...

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Even the ghost can make you dizzy.

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Hong Ling is not the one you can deal with.

112
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Don't make me feel confused.

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll carry you back if I'm free.

114
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I... I wasn't dizzy.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I was...

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
How should I explain this?

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
The blood sugar is falling.

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Xiao Kui told me.

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
You're still running around

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
when you're so weak.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I don't know how you survived.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm not weak either.

123
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm not weak either.

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm not weak either.

125
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm not weak either.

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm not weak either.

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm not weak either.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm not weak either.

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm not weak either.

130
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm not weak either.

131
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm not weak either.

132
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm not weak either.

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm not weak either.

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm not weak either.

135
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I'm not weak either.

136
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm not weak either.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm not weak either.

138
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
This guy has a lot of power.

139
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
He can even attack two heavy reds.

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I can't lose either.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I've said this many times.

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
You shouldn't be so easy to fight.

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
You still have a lot of trouble.

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll get the law of the Wei family.

145
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Why is there an outsider?

146
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
He's injured.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
He's already paid for this.

148
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
It's a big deal.

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
As long as you have money,

150
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
outsiders can go to the Zihua Fortress at any time.

151
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
No, we can't go to the Wei family to save people.

152
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
The law of the Zihua Fortress is a property of Zihua Fortress.

153
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I can't give it to an outsider.

154
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm going to leave the Zihua Fortress.

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm going to take care of Tang Xiao Kui.

156
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you want to fight for my life?

157
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
When will this happen?

158
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
It's already so late.

159
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Why aren't they coming back?

160
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I can't hold on to them anymore.

161
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Leia...

162
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
When 92 days of his念 were left,

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
why is he so четыrated,

164
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
that he even spent so much time

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
on the Li government?

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Why don't you go and buy him some stuff!

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,140
is

168
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,660
to

169
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,560
take

170
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,640
these

171
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,560
And

172
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,080
ines

173
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Come.

174
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
Speaking of which,

175
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,280
my grandson has a speech like that.

176
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Ah Li, what's wrong with you?

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Kill me!

178
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Kill me!

179
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Fire!

180
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
No!

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Fire!

182
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,080
The End

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Episode 1

185
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
What's wrong with Ah Li?

186
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Ah Li and that kid

187
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
were infected by the red face a few years ago by the White King.

188
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Before they were sick,

189
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,080
they were stimulated by light and sound.

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
They became as aggressive as the red face.

191
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
They lost everything they had in mind,

192
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
even their lives.

193
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
At today's celebration,

194
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
whether it's the light and temperature of the fire

195
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
or the sound of the rain,

196
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,080
they all went through the pain and pain of Ah Li.

197
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
No wonder people in the village are so afraid of her.

198
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,080
The micro-conditioner can keep the virus in the initial stage.

199
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
As long as Ah Li lives once every seven days,

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
there won't be any problem.

201
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,080
I think I've heard that the micro-conditioner is useful.

202
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
The micro-conditioner's concentration

203
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
will be directly affected by the virus

204
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
after it reaches the index of the virus.

205
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
It will become a weak and weak secret.

206
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Ah, then isn't Ah Li...

207
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
The micro-conditioner in Ah Li

208
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
is basically connected to the White King's virus.

209
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
So there's no danger.

210
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Since you can control it,

211
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
why do you still have to treat it?

212
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
You also saw her illness.

213
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
She was in a very bad state.

214
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Moreover,

215
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
the market will delay the stock market

216
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
because of some trouble.

217
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Just like today,

218
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
she only has three years left.

219
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
This is the ending of the White King's virus.

220
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Xiao Kui, don't talk.

221
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Since Ah Li is fine,

222
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
I'll go out first.

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Ah Li,

224
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
I think you should explain to everyone

225
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
why you're going to join the Han Xiao Lie army.

226
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I know that

227
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Han Xiao Lie army is rich in supplies.

228
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
You want to repay the favor of the village

229
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
with the revenge of the mission.

230
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
But

231
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
everyone thought that

232
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
you wanted to abandon the Zihua Fortress

233
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
to go there.

234
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Everyone said that you were a good man

235
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
in the background.

236
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
You are the traitor of the Zihua Fortress.

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Traitor?

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Then what?

239
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
It's the same as dying.

240
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
You're just a bad temper.

241
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
You don't want to explain anything.

242
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
There are only four of you left.

243
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
You must come back in a month.

244
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I'm a little tired.

245
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I'll stay here with you tonight.

246
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
I'll study the data card next to you.

247
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
How is he, Xiao Kui?

248
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
He's very stable.

249
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
That's great.

250
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
By the way,

251
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
what's the festival today?

252
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Everyone is so happy.

253
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Ah Li has left.

254
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
He went to join the Han Xiao Lie army.

255
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
So the spirit that everyone is talking about is...

256
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Why is Ah Li like this?

257
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Xiao Kui,

258
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
this child is in trouble.

259
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
I'll set out now.

260
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Maybe I can catch up with him.

261
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Ye Yu,

262
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
I want to ask you...

263
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
I'll help Ah Li.

264
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
This is the hunting ground.

265
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Ah Li.

266
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Ah Li.

267
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Ah Li.

268
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Ah Li.

269
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Ah Li.

270
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Ah Li.

271
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Ah Li.

272
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Ah Li.

273
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Ah Li.

274
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Ah Li.

275
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
You're so lucky.

276
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
You even dare to wait for me.

277
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Master.

278
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
I didn't even look for you.

279
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm here.

280
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
You're so lucky.

281
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
You're a good example.

282
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Master.

283
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Otherwise,

284
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
you'll be dead.

285
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Kid, what are you laughing at?

286
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Why are you still hiding?

287
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Stop.

288
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Stop.

289
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Are you all right?

290
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Watch out for my bulletproof eyes.

291
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Stop.

292
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Go.

293
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Brother.

294
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Brother.

295
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
You were so handsome just now.

296
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
I saw your rabbit's eyes long ago.

297
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Brother.

298
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
You're still looking for a place to hide?

299
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Look at me.

300
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm so fat.

301
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
I can definitely give you a good shot.

302
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
You can call me fat.

303
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Look.

304
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
What are you doing over there?

305
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
This is more than what we've seen before.

306
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
I know that guy.

307
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Why is he so bad?

308
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
These guys are too bad.

309
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Hurry up.

310
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Damn it.

311
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Every year, they're going to serve this fish.

312
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
It's so expensive.

313
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Luckily, they gave me a lot of gold.

314
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Yes.

315
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
Let's go for a drink.

316
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Master.

317
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
How should I do this

318
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
to get the poison you gave me?

319
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Since we're here at the camp,

320
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
I think you've already decided.

321
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
The next days,

322
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
no matter what you're in,

323
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
you'll be in the same team.

324
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
All the training is in one go.

325
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Next,

326
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
we'll ask the examiner

327
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
to explain the test results for you.

328
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Welcome to the camp.

329
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm your main examiner,

330
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Cao Cao.

331
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
You're better than me.

332
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Of course, I know.

333
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
You guys should have some

334
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
innocent goals.

335
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
You can't just come here

336
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
to join the camp.

337
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
You should get rid of this idea.

338
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Do you understand?

339
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
Do you understand?

340
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Next,

341
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
we'll do the basic test.

342
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
The test is complete.

343
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
You can safely recover.

344
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
The person who has the final result

345
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
has arrived at the test area of the brain.

346
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
This is the brain pressure test

347
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
developed by the Huo'er lab.

348
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I've heard that

349
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
the brain of the hunter

350
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
will make people lose their minds

351
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
and think how many lives they'll have to pay.

352
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Teacher!

353
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Ye Yu, save me!

354
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Ye Yu!

355
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
What's the attack?

356
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
You're using your own power!

357
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Hurry up!

358
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

359
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

360
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

361
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

362
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

363
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

364
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

365
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

366
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

367
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

368
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

369
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

370
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

371
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

372
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,080
How long do I have to go?

373
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,080
I can only keep the real sky.

374
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I'm too excited.

375
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
I want to move forward.

376
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,080
The wind that passes through the branches.

377
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,080
The long and hard journey.

378
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm so excited.

379
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
I'm so excited.

380
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

381
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
How long do I have to go?

382
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I can only keep the real sky.

383
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
The long and hard journey.

384
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm too excited.

385
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
I want to move forward.

386
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,080
The wind that passes through the branches.

387
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,080
The long and hard journey.

388
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
I'm so excited.

389
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm so excited.

390
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,080
The fire that burned.

391
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
I was crushed by the spring.

392
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
I was knocked out.

393
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
It's always me.

394
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm still holding on to these feelings.

395
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,080
I'm still holding on to these feelings.
