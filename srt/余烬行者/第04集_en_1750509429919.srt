I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,440
toughest

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,700
Welcome to Lievin answers,

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,500
Let's test the base?

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,080
Roaring in armor is Ã  prioru.

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,520
Abandon the remaining of the incredibly short structures.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
The enemy is coming!

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
The enemy is coming!

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
The enemy is coming!

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
The enemy is coming!

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
The enemy is coming!

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
The enemy is coming!

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
The one who has a good score

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
will come to the check area of the brain.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
This is the first brain pressure test

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
developed by Huo'er.

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Once you lie down,

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
it will analyze your pain and pain.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
It will be determined by the determination.

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
It will be sensitive to the skin.

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,520
And it will be secretive.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
You are so good.

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Hey, little ghost.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
I'm waiting for you.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm coming.

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Hey, this device is really powerful.

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
I caught a thief who wants to get in and kill the hunter.

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I caught a thief who wants to get in and kill the hunter.

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm not a coward.

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
I'll give him some memory.

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Don't worry. I'll put pressure on him.

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
This guy can't hold on for long.

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
It's this guy.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
He has such a strong power,

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
his brain will turn into a white stone.

77
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
I cant hear it.

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
They clean up with a gentle gun.

79
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Brother hardires.

80
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
R Mizu Tzu lies.

81
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I will interrogate you.

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,500
Okay.

83
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Return to the jail.

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

85
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,520
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,520
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,520
No leak.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
About 15 seconds.

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,520
I overwhelmed the whole 3 minutes and I almostï¿½ Jacquine failed.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,520
You plan to use this technique to come up with a murder attack?

93
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,520
It will be an Ji Shou attack.

94
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,920
The second bullet is worth more than 100.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,520
Is it worth it?

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
And...

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
The black stick?

98
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,520
There are always some that can't be shot.

99
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
It's really big.

100
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
It smells like a test.

101
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
That's it.

102
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
This guy won't come back alive.

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Anything else?

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Nothing.

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,520
That guy said so much about Fei Ming.

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Fei Ming has a wish.

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Shouldn't he?

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,520
We're following Suo Qisi to establish Han Xiao Liebin

109
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
to complete the Qingluan Project.

110
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,520
To make the whole human race to suffer from the evil.

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
To make the whole human race to suffer from the evil.

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
To get the real freedom.

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
And not to be trapped in a group.

114
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,520
But after Suo Qisi sacrificed herself to face the consequences,

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
she sold all the information about the Qingluan Project

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
to Yu Jincheng's son.

117
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
She got the treatment for Yu Jincheng.

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
But is this Han Xiao Liebin?

119
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Maybe the hunter has his own pain.

120
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,520
If it wasn't for his persuasion,

121
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Han Xiao Liebin would have been separated long ago.

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
I don't think so.

123
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
As long as he's still alive,

124
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
there's always a chance to regain hope.

125
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Reconvince?

126
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
What are you waiting for?

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Fei Ming has been given the word of revenge.

128
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
That's why he's forced Han Xiao Liebin to do it alone.

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
I think Fei Ming is the real Han Xiao Liebin.

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
What do you mean?

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,520
To find the real life experiment of the Qingluan Project.

132
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
Fei Ming went to find Suo Qisi's

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,520
and his friends' real life experiment.

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Where is the talisman?

135
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Otherwise, how can he be able to get the final result

136
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
with Fei Ming's body?

137
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,520
And I believe that he must have received it.

138
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Why do you say that?

139
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,520
That Ye Yu is Fei Ming's student.

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Teacher, you always say that the talisman has changed.

141
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Why did you let me go back and join the talisman?

142
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,520
When the ship has lost its lighthouse,

143
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
it's hard to find it even if it's taken away.

144
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Ye Yu, your strength will be the lighthouse

145
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,520
that will even be in the entire Yu Jin River.

146
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,520
You mean my strength...

147
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Teacher, I admire you and admire you.

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,520
So I want to become Han Xiao Liebin just like you.

149
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
But what do you mean by lighthouse?

150
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Teacher, I'm not interested in anything.

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Since you have this power,

152
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,520
you have the responsibility to get rid of it and re-tunnel the talisman.

153
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Even if this responsibility is a bit harsh,

154
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,520
if you keep avoiding your responsibility,

155
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
you will be a coward.

156
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,520
My student is not cowardly.

157
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
Do you remember, Ye Yu?

158
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
It's so delicious.

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
I remember.

160
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Teacher, who is this person?

161
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Chong Su Liebin?

162
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
He's so arrogant.

163
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,520
I want to see what secrets you have.

164
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
Be careful.

165
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Teacher!

166
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Ye Yu, save me!

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Ye Yu?

168
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
What's the matter?

169
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
You have the power to get rid of it?

170
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Hurry up!

171
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Once the people who were assigned to the other side

172
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
find out, the consequences will be dire.

173
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Do you remember, Ye Yu?

174
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,520
No, you're not a teacher.

175
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Teacher, you can't use that power.

176
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
He won't even use it.

177
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm not a teacher.

178
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Ye Yu, he won't even let me throw away my bow.

179
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,520
What are you talking about? Hurry up!

180
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Isn't it in the brain test? Right?

181
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Get up.

182
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Someone is waiting for you outside.

183
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Ye Yu!

184
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
You didn't let me down.

185
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Mr. Luo.

186
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Not bad.

187
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Let's go.

188
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Those old people are so poor.

189
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Wait for me.

190
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Right?

191
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
They are all old friends of Fei Ming.

192
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
I really want to see you.

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Teacher, why do you have so many friends?

194
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
What's wrong?

195
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Mr. Luo, he...

196
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Mr. Luo!

197
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Mr. Luo!

198
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
No!

199
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,520
What's wrong with him?

200
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
No!

201
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,520
So, everyone is fine.

202
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Great.

203
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
So, everyone is fine.

204
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Great.

205
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Po Qu, Fei Ming's student is really as good as you.

206
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I see.

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
The test was a mess.

208
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
It's normal.

209
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
It's okay.

210
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,520
I'll give them a pass on the crime.

211
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Mr. Po Qu.

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Here...

213
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Okay.

214
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm still doing it.

215
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
The test was a mess.

216
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Xiao Dan, see you next time.

217
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Mr. Po Qu, I'm going to finish the test.

218
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm going to finish the test.

219
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm going to finish the test.

220
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm going to finish the test.

221
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
I'm going to finish the test.

222
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Mr. Po Qu, I'm going to finish the test.

223
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm going to finish the test.

224
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Are you blind?

225
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Don't die here.

226
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
I'm doing the test.

227
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Passed.

228
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I'll find a rope to hang myself.

229
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Na Tasha, send this kid to his dorm.

230
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Okay, Po Qu.

231
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Hurry up, Mr. Po Qu.

232
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Na Tasha, are we going the wrong way?

233
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
The dorm is different from the dorm.

234
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Bo Jue is the founder of Hanxiang.

235
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
He's not even a trainee.

236
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
He's not as good as him.

237
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Here we are.

238
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Go in.

239
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Get out.

240
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Hai Li.

241
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
This...

242
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
You're right.

243
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
You're right.

244
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
No. 3 is the dorm.

245
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
You...

246
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Where am I?

247
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
You're amazing.

248
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Who's that?

249
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Brother, Han Xiaolian is a very hard girl.

250
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
You're doing what you want to do.

251
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Just forget about it.

252
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Do you understand?

253
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
I can see that you're already

254
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
so calm.

255
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
It's not like I can't understand the rules.

257
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,520
But we're quite good friends.

258
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Well...

259
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Do you want some?

260
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
You...

261
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Don't be too excited.

262
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Mr. Po Qu.

263
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Mr. Po Qu.

264
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Come out.

265
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
What's wrong?

266
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
There are a few cars in the village.

267
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
There are so many supplies.

268
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Come out and have a look.

269
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Supply?

270
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Where did they get so many supplies?

271
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
We can't just stand here.

272
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
We can't just eat and drink.

273
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
There's a student who broke the record.

274
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
He's been damaged by the supplies.

275
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
He said he'd give it to you to pay for the debt.

276
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Please sign it.

277
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Mr. Po Qu, who gave it to you?

278
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Hai Li.

279
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
What's going on?

280
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Why is he leaving?

281
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Who's there?

282
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Luckily, he didn't change.

283
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
The next 8 hours.

284
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
You'll have to complete the first test here.

285
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Test? When did it start?

286
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Right now.

287
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
After 8 hours,

288
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
our boat will stop at the west bank.

289
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,520
The first boat of the boat is your boat.

290
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
If you want to get a boat,

291
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
you don't have to kill the enemy.

292
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
You killed them.

293
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
You killed them.

294
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
You're so brave.

295
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I wish you good luck in the test.

296
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Be careful.

297
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm not done yet.

298
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm not done yet.

299
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
It's always me.

300
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,520
I'm still looking forward to the test.

301
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
How long do I have to go?

302
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
I can't stop.

303
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
The construction of the town.

304
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
I'm so excited.

305
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
I want to move forward.

306
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,520
The wind of the hot spring passes.

307
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,520
The autumn tea in the snow.

308
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
I'm so happy.

309
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I'm so happy.

310
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
I'm so happy.

311
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm so happy.

312
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I'm so happy.

313
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm so happy.

314
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm so happy.

315
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm so happy.

316
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm so happy.

317
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm so happy.

318
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,520
How long do I have to go?

319
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I can't stop.

320
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,520
The construction of the town.

321
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm so excited.

322
00:22:49,520 --> 00:23:00,140
But I can't hold onto it

323
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,580
you
