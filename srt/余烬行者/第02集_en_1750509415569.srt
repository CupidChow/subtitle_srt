1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,220
Lord Yuzheng, it's been two years.

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,880
The second time in Iron Valley City has been changed to a single-sided agreement.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
You said that Yuzheng will agree to our purchase.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,120
It doesn't matter.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,280
We have already started to move.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,240
Look at the great Iron Valley City that has destroyed us.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,520
Today, we will let you pay for it.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,720
Full of energy.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Hurry.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,920
If we can cultivate a group of thousands of balls to fight in Yuzheng City,

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,080
we can completely get rid of the withdrawal of Iron Valley City.

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Let me go back to see my master.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,920
Qinglan's plan is already in the hands of the city.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,800
It's not as good as it is.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give it to the people who can really live.

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,040
The ghost is dead!

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,680
Doctor, how about taking the task of clearing the Qinglan's plan?

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,200
Doctor, how about taking the task of clearing the Qinglan's plan?

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,760
The task is done.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,000
The gun is destroyed.

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,960
I also received the attack when I escaped.

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,760
The master is concerned about your task.

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,400
Where is the information of the Qinglan's plan?

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
The data of the village's release is lost.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
You're useless.

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,760
You deserve to die for delaying the master's research.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,040
But I found the money for the success.

55
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
I owe you.

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
Hurry. Stop.

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,760
Hurry.

58
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,940
It's ourony time.

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,040
It's a shame for us.

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
There isn't anything to worry about.

61
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Let's explain.

62
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,340
Wait here.

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,080
I'll beat you to death.

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,740
later

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,760
You can't drink this much.

66
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,860
How about朋友 chat?

67
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,440
Well, let's bury the あるの形 ラブは21告訴 me

68
00:04:51,440 --> 00:05:18,760
Hmm, good luck.

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
This time, it's not my fault.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
These two kids are also very good.

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
If not...

72
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
How did they come here?

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
They came from him.

74
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
This person was attacked by the city officials this morning.

75
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
He was responsible for the murder of the so-called Han Xiao Liebin.

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Then he was sent here.

77
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Just now, the information department also found out his identity.

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
He is from Tiegu City.

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
No.

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I heard that Tiegu City is fighting with us in Yujing City.

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
If they do this, will they be...

82
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Are the attack officials from Tiegu City doing something wrong?

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Besides, these two things are not the techniques of Tiegu City.

84
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
What are these two things?

85
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Handle.

86
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,760
They are usually used to take information or to direct the virus.

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
J23 type handle is used to enter the air.

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
It is produced by Kaus.

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
After the entry of the middle section,

90
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
it will be transmitted to the other part of the reception middle section.

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
This thing is a very old product from Kaus.

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
It's older than you.

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,760
So the real purpose of the control box is to use the handle to take our information, right?

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Yes.

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
And I believe that the real owner

96
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
must not have such a simple Tiegu City that only pursues interests.

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Who is the one who wants to take away the information of Qingluan Project?

98
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,760
Say it. Where did you get this thing?

99
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Give it back to me.

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Don't let me use the second one.

101
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,760
This is the one Teacher Wen gave me.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Please give it back to me.

103
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Say it.

104
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
It's not your name.

105
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
It's your name.

106
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
It's not your name.

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
It's your name.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
It's not your name.

109
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
It's your name.

110
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
It's not your name.

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
It's your name.

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
It's not your name.

113
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Say it.

114
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
It's not your name.

115
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
You know Teacher Fei Ming, too?

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't move.

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Where is he now?

118
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Teacher...

119
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
He's gone.

120
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
What?

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
He's dead.

122
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
You little brat, you're fooling me.

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Tell me.

124
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Where is Fei Ming?

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
If you dare to say anything else,

126
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I'll kill you right now.

127
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
I didn't mean it.

128
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Teacher, he's really gone.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Shang Yu.

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Are you called Bo Que?

131
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
You know me?

132
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Teacher said that

133
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
there are only two people

134
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
who care about him in the Hanxiao Liebin.

135
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
One is called Ba Mian and the other is called Bo Que.

136
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
I guess it's Bo Que

137
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,760
because you don't have a Ba in your face.

138
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Say it.

139
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Tell me everything you know.

140
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
These are all Fei Ming's treasures.

141
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
So,

142
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Fei Ming has always been in your hometown.

143
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
It's called Ba...

144
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Ba...

145
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Ba Du.

146
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Okay.

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
That's enough.

148
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I'll go.

149
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
That's enough.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Has Fei Ming told you

151
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
why he left Hanxiao Liebin?

152
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Forget it.

153
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
I know why he didn't tell me.

154
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,760
But he even gave me a disciple.

155
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I didn't expect that.

156
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Please take it.

157
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I really want to join Hanxiao Liebin.

158
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Join?

159
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Why?

160
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
If they ask you

161
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
why you want to join Hanxiao Liebin,

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
you'll say...

163
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
I want to be the citizen of Yu Jin City.

164
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
If you want to become a citizen of Hanxiao Liebin,

165
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
you have to serve for five years.

166
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
This is not an easy thing.

167
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
I can tell you

168
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
the death rate of five years ago

169
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
is 85%.

170
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
If they want to scare you,

171
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
you must show fear of death.

172
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Because they all think

173
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
that even if a person doesn't care about death,

174
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
they won't care about the mission.

175
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Really?

176
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
What should we do?

177
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
This is the fastest way to become a citizen.

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Don't worry.

179
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm always lucky.

180
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
I'll survive.

181
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
It seems that Fei Ming has done a lot of work for you.

182
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Forget it.

183
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
No.

184
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
The nine-legged team has come to the task of the defense.

185
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
We can finally return to our base.

186
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Let's go.

187
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
What are you still doing there?

188
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
You haven't eaten yet?

189
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
You want to serve?

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll go now.

191
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Then, what about me joining Liebin?

192
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
There is a place for Liebin base.

193
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Five days later,

194
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
they will take the same entrance exam there.

195
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
If you can join,

196
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
you can see yourself.

197
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Thank you.

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
You can send her out.

199
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
This person has nothing to do with the fear of death.

200
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Oh, right.

201
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
What's your name?

202
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
My name is Yi.

203
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
The map says that

204
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
passing through Langcheng

205
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
will take 3,000 meters to become a base.

206
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
It's strange.

207
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Where is the exit?

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Is it a maze?

209
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
A ghost?

210
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Let go of that kid!

211
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
I'll kill you!

212
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Something is wrong today.

213
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
There are many missing in this place.

214
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Let's switch places.

215
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
There is no place

216
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
that is easier to meet the maze than here.

217
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
This is Langcheng.

218
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Back then,

219
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
people used nanomobile to treat diseases.

220
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
The excessive treatment of the gang members

221
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
became a kind of zombie.

222
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
So,

223
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
this is the old house of the secret police.

224
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
How many are left?

225
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Almost.

226
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
If we find another secret police,

227
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
it should be enough.

228
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
You can join the hunting test.

229
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I think you should practice

230
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
at least for a month.

231
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
You can practice them.

232
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
That will be enough to cure your illness.

233
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
How is it?

234
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Am I a little girl?

235
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Do you think it's very popular?

236
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
You are smaller than me.

237
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
What's wrong with that?

238
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Age is not a problem.

239
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
You can't mess with your life.

240
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Good girl, you are a little girl.

241
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
What are you doing?

242
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Shouldn't I do something?

243
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
There must be something good

244
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
in that bag.

245
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
So?

246
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Idiot,

247
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
let's go a little later.

248
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Aren't those things

249
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
ours?

250
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Baby.

251
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Why are you talking to Auntie?

252
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
How did your mother say

253
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
that you should listen to Auntie?

254
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
You are so funny.

255
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Little brother,

256
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
we might have to stay here today.

257
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
I thought I could save you.

258
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm really sorry.

259
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Please listen.

260
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
I want to give you

261
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
my life first.

262
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Don't use the power of the light.

263
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Otherwise, you will die.

264
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Don't worry.

265
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Are you all right?

266
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
The power of the light.

267
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Open.

268
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
What?

269
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
What's wrong?

270
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
What?

271
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Are you all right?

272
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
What?

273
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
What?

274
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,760
This girl is really disobedient.

275
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
What's wrong with this girl?

276
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
She is really dead, right?

277
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
She is Han Xiao Liebing.

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Liebing?

279
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Brother Liebing,

280
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
You saw it too.

282
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
We were going to save you.

283
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
But who would have thought

284
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
that such a good guy would come?

285
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Since you are dead,

286
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
you can't waste these things.

287
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
You know

288
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
that the house is in the middle of nowhere.

289
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Why are you...

290
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
What are you doing?

291
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Oh my god!

292
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
What are you doing?

293
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Oh my god!

294
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Good stuff!

295
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
40 years ago,

296
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
the short-term products

297
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
were still new.

298
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
This thing is priceless.

299
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
You saved me.

300
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
What's wrong with her?

301
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
How is she?

302
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
How could this happen?

303
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
That girl is wearing red face powder.

304
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
She is getting big.

305
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Red face?

306
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
What is that?

307
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Are you human?

308
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You don't know red face?

309
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
So,

310
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
what is red face?

311
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
You don't look like a human.

312
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
What do you mean?

313
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Red face

314
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
is a kind of perverted creature

315
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
that is not known in the world.

316
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
It is much more scary than that.

317
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
After being attacked by them,

318
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
it will infect the red face.

319
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
It has become

320
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
a kind of scary disease called white king's witness.

321
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Do you want to know

322
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
what white king's witness is?

323
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
I don't think

324
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
it's a good explanation.

325
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Anyway,

326
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
it's like she is now.

327
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
You must have a way to save her, right?

328
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Please save her.

329
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
She is still so small.

330
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Okay.

331
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
As long as I seal her brain first,

332
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
to prevent the disease from entering the brain,

333
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
she can be safe.

334
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Although this kind of treatment may make

335
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
ordinary people lose their will,

336
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
the fastest treatment for white king's witness.

337
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Thank you.

338
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Don't you think

339
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
you don't need treatment?

340
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
You have to exchange this thing.

341
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
This thing is...

342
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
What?

343
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
This thing is not yours.

344
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Yes, yes, yes.

345
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
I will exchange it with you.

346
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Please cure her.

347
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Who can be sure

348
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
about the treatment?

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
I can only say that I have tried my best.

350
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Okay,

351
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
you can go out first.

352
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
You are lying.

353
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
This kind of treatment

354
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
can only be used for a short time.

355
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
White king's witness

356
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
can't be cured.

357
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
No matter what,

358
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
I have some confidence.

359
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Besides,

360
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
if I don't say so,

361
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
how can I stand

362
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
this kind of baby?

363
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
What is this place?

364
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Purple flower town.

365
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Tell me,

366
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
how is the mission?

367
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
According to the doctor's report,

368
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
the mission was a accident.

369
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Although the data

370
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
of the Blue Wheel Project

371
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
was lost,

372
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
he found the Blue Wheel body

373
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
successfully.

374
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Where is the doctor now?

375
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
The missing person

376
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
was killed by the missing person.

377
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
The doctor and the doctor lost contact.

378
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
It's not worth it.

379
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Find the doctor.

380
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Don't delay my experiment.

381
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
It's already so late.

382
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Why can't they come back?

383
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
If they come back later,

384
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
they can't stand it anymore.

385
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Red face!

386
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
He's gone.

387
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
He's gone.

388
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Brother, what's wrong?

389
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
The baby and the Red face

390
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
were infected by the White King

391
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
a year ago.

392
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Before the disease,

393
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
it was caused by the stimulation of light and sound.

394
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
I heard that

396
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
the baby was not walking.

397
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
He only has three years left.

398
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
This is the end of the White King.

399
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
The fire

400
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
is not a miracle.

401
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
It's not a break.

402
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
It's not a escape.

403
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,760
It's always me.

404
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,520
I'm still

405
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,760
watching the smoke.

406
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,760
How long do I have?

407
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
I can't stop.

408
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
I can't stop.

409
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
I can't stop.

410
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
I'm so excited.

411
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
I want to move forward.

412
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,760
The wind that passes through the heat.

413
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,760
The white smoke is for the rescue.

414
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,760
I'm changing the way I think.

415
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,260
I am I.

416
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,760
I am me.

417
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,760
I am me.

418
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
How long do I have left?

419
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,760
To stay away from here?

420
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Thank you for watching!
