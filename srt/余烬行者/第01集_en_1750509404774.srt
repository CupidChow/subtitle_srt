00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,320
This movie,

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,800
LAUGHTER

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,400
On November 24, 1938,

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,280
Yu Jing City,

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
our strongest army,

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,740
had appeared as

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,620
a biological cause,

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,480
And the youngest army of Red Army

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,020
was killed.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,940
The Hillary Elegant ambition is being granted on theEM Korea â€“ go, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you ...

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,360
His pride still meixo exposure aware yet

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,420
9

13
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,420
I'm not afraid of the world.

14
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,420
I'm afraid of the world.

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,420
I'm afraid of the world.

16
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm afraid of the world.

17
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,420
I'm afraid of the world.

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,420
I'm afraid of the world.

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm afraid of the world.

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm afraid of the world.

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm afraid of the world.

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,420
I'm afraid of the world.

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm afraid of the world.

24
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,420
I'm afraid of the world.

25
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,420
I'm afraid of the world.

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm afraid of the world.

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,420
Please forgive me.

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,140
Because I'm not harmful enough.

29
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,660
Although you're my leader,

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,900
if will be the majority danke I am.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,900
Please forgive me.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm afraid of the world.

33
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,180
I'm afraid of the world.

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,860
I'm afraid of the world.

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
I'm afraid of the world.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,860
I'm afraid of the world.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,860
I am afraid of the world.

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,820
I'm afraid of the world.

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,860
I'm afraid of the world.

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,020
I'm afraid of the world.

41
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Don't move!

42
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Don't move!

43
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,020
Don't move!

44
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,020
Be careful. The car is coming today.

45
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Don't move!

46
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
Thank you.

47
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
If it weren't for you,

48
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I would have burned the food for the chicken.

49
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,020
You're welcome.

50
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
I've been working for two years.

51
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,020
Besides, the teacher has taught me

52
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,020
that every person who needs help is a hero.

53
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
This is the third one.

54
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
My bag?

55
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Little boy, you're a hunter?

56
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm not.

57
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
But I'm going to join them.

58
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,020
The Iron Valley is about to start with the city of Yu.

59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
You're going to be a guard now.

60
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
Forget it.

61
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Night rain.

62
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
The longer the night, the darker the darkness.

63
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
The more the fear of the cold.

64
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
The more shining the light.

65
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,020
Teacher, I will definitely complete your wish.

66
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,020
I will become a great Han Xiaolie soldier.

67
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,020
The Iron Valley is the teacher of Wei Bu Bao.

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,020
They've improved a little bit

69
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,020
in the latest trade talks.

70
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
At the same time, they've increased the content of the three-layered water content

71
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,020
for the raw materials of the Wa Fang.

72
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,020
Lord Yicheng, it's been two years.

73
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,020
The Iron Valley has changed its mind for the second time.

74
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,020
What do you think?

75
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
To be honest,

76
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,020
the Iron Valley is the source of the reputation of Yu's city.

77
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
But what can we do?

78
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,020
The Iron Valley has already taken six of its allies.

79
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
If we don't sign it,

80
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
the heavy-duty He Cheng Shi of the Iron Valley

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,020
will be able to defeat us in the city.

82
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Of course we won't sign it.

83
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
If we don't sign it?

84
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,020
If the army of the Iron Valley

85
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
is defeated,

86
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
what will we fight for?

87
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Are you the Dragon Knight of thousands?

88
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,020
Or are you the guard of the gate?

89
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Maybe we really have no choice.

90
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,020
Do you think Yu Jincheng will agree to our offer?

91
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Your Highness,

92
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,020
maybe they still have some tricks

93
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
to refuse their own agreement.

94
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,020
It's not important, is it?

95
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,020
We've already started to act.

96
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Yes.

97
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,020
According to your instructions,

98
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,020
our warning has been used.

99
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Not only that,

100
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,020
after today,

101
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Yu Jincheng's base will be gone.

102
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,020
Oh, are there any more

103
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,020
secret arrangements in the Lu family?

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Just wait and see.

105
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Now it's Han Xiaoliebin's turn to check.

106
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Han Xiaoliebin?

107
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Is he a teacher?

108
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
Please...

109
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Show me your ID card.

110
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
According to the latest regulations,

111
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
no one in the Iron Valley

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
can enter Yu Jincheng.

113
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
Let me find it.

114
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Where is it?

115
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,020
I'll pick it up.

117
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
Sorry.

118
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
The Iron Valley is about to be defeated.

119
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,020
You, raise your head.

120
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Go.

121
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Where is the water?

122
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Don't move.

123
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Get the car back.

124
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Are you from the Iron Valley?

125
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
No.

126
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Take the car down.

127
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Please run.

128
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
You...

129
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Are you okay?

130
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Let's go.

131
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
I'll make it.

132
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
I'll make it.

133
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
Oh, no.

134
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
My bag.

135
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
How about this?

136
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
Get the crystal.

137
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
How dare you to be my uncle?

138
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Are you tired of me?

139
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Don't.

140
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Don't.

141
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,020
What should I do?

142
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
The teacher's clothes are still in the bag.

143
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
The ID card is the badge of the soldiers.

144
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Ye Yu, take my glory.

145
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Keep walking.

146
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,020
The teacher entrusted me with my glory.

147
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
I can't be damaged.

148
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
You...

149
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
The power of the Qingluan...

150
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
Look.

151
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
The Qingluan body.

152
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
The Qingluan body

153
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,020
is the technology design

154
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,020
that Dr. Suoqi Si from the biological science

155
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
mentioned 30 years ago.

156
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
It was the Qingluan plan

157
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
that shocked the world.

158
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
You all should know that

159
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
all human behavior commands

160
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,020
are caused by the brain.

161
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
However, the development of the brain

162
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
and the use of the operation

163
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
are limited.

164
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
In the design of Professor Suoqi Si,

165
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
he used the help of the human body

166
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,020
to create various judgments

167
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
to help people's brain.

168
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
He also added the star-shaped diamond

169
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
and various speed-up secrets.

170
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
It makes humans

171
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
get the same reaction power

172
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
as superman in a short time.

173
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Power.

174
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
Such a successful experiment

175
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,020
is called the Qingluan body.

176
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
If we can train

177
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
a group of Qingluan body soldiers

178
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
in the city of Yu Jing,

179
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
we can completely

180
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
take the scale of Iron Valley City.

181
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Dr. Suoqi Si,

182
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
the information of the Qingluan plan

183
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,020
is also in your biological research.

184
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Yes.

185
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,020
However, the Qingluan plan is not perfect.

186
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,020
The number of dead bodies in the forest

187
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
is 99.5%.

188
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
The population

189
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
has become a plant.

190
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Professor Suoqi Si has already made a conclusion.

191
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
The Qingluan plan needs to be corrected.

192
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Qingluan body

193
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
cannot exist in reality.

194
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,020
You are right.

195
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
This ability

196
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,020
cannot be easily confused.

197
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,020
You are Qingluan body.

198
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Let me go back to see the master.

199
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
Yan Zao, get ready.

200
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
Yes.

201
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Follow me.

202
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,620
Earlier,

203
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,020
there was a true murderer,

204
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,020
raising a daughter of Jin.

205
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,020
I finally have some energy.

206
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,020
Grandpa.

207
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
Why are you back?

208
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,020
How did you get the ship?

209
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
Grandpa.

210
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
What do you want to do?

211
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
The Great Yujin City.

212
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
The Great Yujin City that we raised.

213
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Today, I will let you pay for it.

214
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Let's all die together.

215
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Oh, no.

216
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Zhong Ji.

217
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
I still have to take the ship into the rain.

218
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Let me stop her.

219
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Stop the shooting.

220
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Captain, there is a soldier.

221
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
No, stop.

222
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
The main force is our mission.

223
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
Stop.

224
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Don't shoot.

225
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Don't shoot.

226
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
The Great Yujin City.

227
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
The Great Yujin City.

228
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Stop.

229
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
For the Iron Thread Embroidery.

230
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Stop the shooting.

231
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
The first and second soldiers.

232
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
They are the worst of the young men.

233
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
They are not popular.

234
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Go.

235
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
They are moving away.

236
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
The direction is bad.

237
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Turn around.

238
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Turn around.

239
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Captain.

240
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
Captain.

241
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Captain.

242
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
Captain.

243
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Captain.

244
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Send Captain to the Yujin City immediately.

245
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Leave it to me.

246
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
Take her down.

247
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,020
Be careful.

248
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Don't let her die.

249
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
The Holy Tomb should be searched.

250
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I think...

251
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
This...

252
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
Send the Holy Tomb to the city.

253
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,020
It's for them.

254
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Time is up.

255
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Our gift should be sent.

256
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Chafinque's secret door.

257
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,020
Why?

258
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
It'sory.

259
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Good move.

260
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
The Holy Tomb is waiting for...

261
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Aim, as expected.

262
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Why don't you give it to the one who really loves you?

263
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
Let go of that child!

264
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,020
Little brother, we might have to stay here for a few days.

265
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
The door is still open. I'm really sorry.

266
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
You're a weakling.

267
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
You saved me?

268
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
You're lying.

269
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,020
I can't eat the dead one.

270
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
You can save him, right?

271
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
What do you mean?

272
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Not only does he pay, but also find the doctor.

273
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,020
The dead one is waiting for my trial.

274
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
That fire

275
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,020
didn't break through, didn't break through, didn't escape

276
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
It's always me

277
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,020
who's still silent before the sword

278
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,020
How long do we have left?

279
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
I can only endure

280
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,020
the hard journey

281
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm too

282
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,140
motivated, I wanna carry on

283
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,080
the wind that lives on

284
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,980
A fresh morning

285
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,940
I load,tes in

286
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,040
freedom

287
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
I'm not afraid of the world

288
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
I'm afraid of the world

289
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
I'm afraid of the world

290
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
I'm afraid of the world

291
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,020
I'm afraid of the world

292
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm afraid of the world

293
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm afraid of the world

294
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,020
I'm afraid of the world

295
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm afraid of the world

296
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,020
I'm afraid of the world

297
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
I'm afraid of the world

298
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,020
I'm afraid of the world

299
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
I'm afraid of the world

300
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm afraid of the world

301
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
I'm afraid of the world

302
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
I'm excited

303
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
I want to go first

304
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
The hot wind

305
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
The unbreakable

306
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,020
The wine

307
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm not used to

308
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Freedom
