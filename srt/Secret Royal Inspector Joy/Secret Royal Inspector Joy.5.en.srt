00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,820
I'll go with this.

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,590
Are you showing off right now? Take the sword!

9
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,950
Take the sword! Take the sword!

10
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,960
The sword, the sword.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,420
You brought this upon yourself. Don't resent me.

12
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,980
Stop. This person is the secret royal inspector.

13
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,830
So? What do you want me to do?

14
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,440
But he is a s-sec-sec-secret royal inspector.

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,740
What is that? Keep doing what you were about to do.

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,910
It works out well.

17
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,580
Enough. Our master is holding his sword. It's all over now.

18
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,390
It's a sword, not a knife.

19
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,540
It's all some kind of knife anyway.

20
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,860
<i>To protect what's precious to you,</i>

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,650
<i>you should learn to put up with the things you hate.</i>

22
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,420
<i>Someday, you'll be holding a real sword, in place of that wooden one,</i>

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,710
Shit!

27
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,230
I thought necks would be rolling. It's all a show.

28
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,830
What are you doing?

29
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,730
You promised me winner takes all.

30
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,660
Promise? I promised Tae Su, not you.

31
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,280
What are you guys waiting for?

32
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,830
- Don't move. <br> - Let's start with that useless bitch.

33
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,370
You there, Wang Nun!

34
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,310
Do you think your deceased mother would like to see you live so rampant?

35
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,790
How do you know my mother calls me Wang Nun?

36
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:07,810
When you were young, you were probably a kind kid. The name must have suited you, right?

37
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,500
M-Mother?

38
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,250
You have to live kindly for the sake of your mother who raised you with such affection.

39
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,890
Now, remove the guards and

40
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,370
put down the sword.

41
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,550
I don't want to.

42
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,670
Did my mother raise me with just affection?

43
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,510
That kind and innocent Wang Nun

44
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,340
died with his mother.

45
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm Mal Jong. Mal Jong!

46
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,230
What are you doing? Attack!

47
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,200
Aren't our guards coming at all?

48
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,210
Why are you doing this to me?

49
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,800
If you can, don't talk.

50
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Shoot.

Slow and late, he is here.

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,190
He arrived late.

60
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,070
People who work for the country are always one step late.

61
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,030
It's always been like that.

62
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,480
Brother.

63
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,000
Bring the accused.

64
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,280
Mal Jong, I'll take care of it. Don't do anything.

65
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,380
Okay.

66
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,620
The accused Cha Mal Jong and Park Tae Su,

67
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,360
on top of violating the country's law and making liquor,

68
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,960
you've abused your power and made a serious offense by keeping private servants.

69
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,340
You'll be punished by the Great Ming Code. <br> <i> (Yakinyakmaeinjo: criminal code provision for charges on locking up people unjustly, causing damage, or murder) </i>

70
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,620
We are entirely wrong on the account of making liquor against the law.

71
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:24,260
But how is taking in homeless women, clothing them, and feeding them a crime?

72
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,660
When children from the Jinjang* are 10 years old, <br> <i>(Jinjang: A facility for orphans)</i>

73
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,170
they are either officially adopted or taken as slaves.

74
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,130
The ones who can take children in

75
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,020
are people who are qualified for it.

76
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
If you're mentioning qualifications,

77
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,840
you should know Jinhyulcheong*. <br> <i>(*Jinhyulcheong: a bureau that aids citizens who are orphaned or starving)</i>

78
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,930
An announcement was issued with the law.

79
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,120
Well, then, how will you explain the crime of attacking me,

80
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,670
after I revealed my rank?

81
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,870
A lot of people are impersonating a royal inspector these days.

82
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,150
We can't trust you unless we see the horse pass.

83
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,930
On top of that, with your excellent swordsmanship,

84
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,110
you hit Tae Su too, didn't you?

85
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,880
Then I'll ask about your crime of murdering a royal inspector and covering it up.

86
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,260
<i> What? Besides the one we took care of, another one was dispatched? </i>

87
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,980
<i>- Don't kill him. Just catch him. <br> - Why? What will you do if you don't kill him?</i>

88
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,400
<i>We need to know how much he found out.</i>

89
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
<i>We also will kill him after.</i>

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,250
Your joke is far-fetched.

91
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,720
A royal inspector is not just any bastard passing by

92
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,600
for us to murder him. Jeez!

93
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,130
- It's a joke. <br> - It's something you shouldn't say even as a joke.

94
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,760
I'll gladly accept punishment for disregarding the country's jurisdiction.

95
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,700
But, for charges of murder, you have to provide substantial evidence.

96
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,140
You're right. I can't convict you on the grounds of suspicious activity alone, without an evidence.

97
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,540
Though your activities are suspicious, Park Tae Su and Cha Mal Jong,

98
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,150
without evidence it's hard to unveil the truth of this case.

99
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:17,690
But, for a charge as grave as murder, I can't just let you walk away.

100
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:24,320
I'll find the evidence to support my case, after I investigate thoroughly and dig out the truth of this case.

101
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,330
Take these criminals to Uigeumbu!* <br> <i>(Uigeumbu: present day equivalent of Supreme Court)</i>

102
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,300
Huh? Uigeumbu? Are they transferring us to Hanyang*? <br> <i>(Hanyang: former name of Seoul)</i>

103
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,840
For this case, it'd be alright to go with an impromptu trial, isn't it?

104
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,720
It'd be better to keep him locked up.

105
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,830
The look in his eyes is weird.

106
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,640
<i>It will be good for you to stop here.</i>

107
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,970
<i>To stop, I should start, shouldn't I?</i>

108
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,530
"Small loss, big win."

109
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,780
Only a good bait can catch a big fish. I'm doing this on purpose.

110
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,300
This must have something to do with wolfsbane.

111
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,600
You both look into Park Tae Su in detail.

112
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,180
Okay.

113
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,400
- Everyone, come out! Stop hiding. <br> - You can come out in peace.

114
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,730
Cha Mal Jong's gang has been arrested.

115
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,720
The royal inspector has detained Cha Mal Jong.

116
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,520
You've done well.

117
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,050
What did I tell you? I told you not to worry, didn't I?

118
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,960
If you leave here, do you have a place to go?

119
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,330
My Lord, all the women here returned after the war ended.

120
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,560
If the children here leave as orphans, they'll have to go to Jincheng* <br> <i>(Jincheng: bureau responsible for orphaned or starving citizens)</i>

121
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,020
or be sold as slaves somewhere else.

122
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,500
Go to the Provincial Office first. After securing the protection of the government,

123
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,180
how about waiting till the next settlement is decided?

124
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,320
Are you sending them to the bureau?

125
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,870
Even though you are a royal inspector, aren't you too trusting of the bureau?

126
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,230
What will happen if Soyang Trading Group has connections there?

127
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,190
Didn't you see their irreparable behaviors?

128
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,420
It's the law to keep slaves who lost their masters with the bureau.

129
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,490
It's only right to get their protection first.

130
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,990
Honestly, the slaves here are not government employed but private.

131
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,960
It means we don't belong to the government.

132
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Then, what do you want?

133
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,520
Can you have the guards watch over them while they reside here for a while?

134
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,820
We want to decide our fate by ourselves.

135
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,040
Wait! We don't plan to go to the bureau or stay here.

136
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,640
Then what do you want?

137
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,950
Together, we'll board the boat to Gapbi Gocha*. <br> <i>(Gapbi Gocha: former name of Ganghwa Island)</i>

138
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,430
If that's the case, you won't receive protection from me nor the government.

139
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,380
We understand that, but we don't want to lose this chance

140
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,960
where we can live freely.

141
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,030
I respect your decision. Go ahead.

142
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,690
My lord, My lord. A royal inspector can't go along with whatever they want.

143
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,190
Besides how will you report this to your superiors?

144
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,930
For now, let's persuade that woman and make her stay here.

145
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,250
Once we report back, let's send them away. What do you think?

146
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,950
Is your leg okay?

147
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,140
Come this way. I have an ointment for that.

148
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,990
- Go with her. <br> - Yes.

149
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,590
The flesh is torn. It'll take some time to heal.

150
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,300
Ah, by chance, do you know about a person called Park Tae Su?

151
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,350
He's the only comrade who hangs around Cha Mal Jong.

152
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,690
I'm stuck at White Ghost Pass all day. What would I know?

153
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,190
Ah, there's a rumor that he's the bastard of some nobleman.

154
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,230
Do you feel this?

155
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,760
This.

156
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,500
- I feel it. <br> - What about here?

157
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,830
Yes, I feel it.

158
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,020
Fortunately it seems like no nerve is damaged.

159
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,970
Since I've applied ointment over the wound, it'll heal soon.

160
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,820
Are you fine?

161
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,560
- Oh? <br> - Aish!

162
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,030
- What are you doing here? <br> - Why don't you erase... that from your lips?

163
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,800
Ah!

164
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,330
Use more water.

165
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,860
Thank you! I'm clean.

166
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,330
From the looks of it, I'm quite sure he's on the same side with the bureau.

167
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,640
Like you said, My Lord, they don't look like petty thieves.

168
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,490
It's impossible to embezzle a lot without co-operation from authorities.

169
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,210
The mastermind I'm looking for might be closer than I thought.

170
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,730
(Soyang Trading Group)

171
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,600
Before we leave, get a good night's sleep.

172
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
A war is coming soon.

173
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,800
Even though I don't get rewards, I get to sleep comfortably in this palace-like house.

174
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,840
We'll call it even with the silk beddings.

175
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,920
Give the main building to the children, women, and slaves.

176
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,910
They must have suffered a lot so far. You guys should yield.

177
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,660
My Lord, what about us?

178
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,090
Are you saying we didn't work hard enough?

179
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,750
Don't you see the makeup on my face? What do you think about it, My Lord?

180
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,490
What about this? If this isn't going through trouble, what is?

181
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,730
Alright, lie down.

182
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,450
- Why not? <br> - How can I put my dirty feet on a silk bed sheet?

183
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm thankful but how do I sleep with that?

184
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,520
I'll just sleep on the floor.

185
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,750
Every time we step on the blanket, we are beaten.

186
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,000
It feels good.

187
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,900
Why is this so soft?

188
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,630
Elder Cha Mal Jong hates stiff wooden pillows,

189
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,840
so it's made by stuffing cotton. That's why!

190
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,720
Oh, made with such precious cotton, huh?

191
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,040
They change the cotton once a month too.

192
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,210
Oh, then how costly is this pillow?

193
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,810
Here, take it.

194
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,240
Here, here, here.

195
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,960
It's a pillow fight.

196
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,700
It’s a pillow fight!

197
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,730
Wow.

198
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,880
Wow, for the first time in my life, I'm feeling cozy.

199
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,350
I feel like flying above the clouds.

200
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,530
I'll show you something fun.

201
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,350
When I keep my hands like this, look,

202
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,210
how does it look like?

203
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,500
Flutter, flutter.

204
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,030
It's pretty.

205
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,480
It's like a butterfly, right?

206
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,840
Can you do it?

207
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,950
Yes, yes.

208
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,480
I'll make a bird. <br> Me too, a bird.

209
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,390
A snail. <br> I made a butterfly.

210
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,650
I made a snail. <br> I made a deer.

211
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,990
I made a frog.

212
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,000
Frog, dear frog,

213
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,860
I'll give you an old house. Give me a new one.

214
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,020
Frog, dear frog,

215
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,020
I'll give you a bad store, give me a good one.

216
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,100
Frog, dear frog,

217
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,230
I'll give you an empty bowl, give me a bowl full of rice.

218
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,160
Frog, dear frog,

219
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,190
I'll give you my tears, give me laughter.

220
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,960
Frog, dear frog,

221
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,940
I'll give you an old house, give me a new one.

222
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,760
Secret Royal Inspector

223
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,820
is here.

224
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,200
Has arrived.

225
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,990
Has arrived late.

226
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,250
What's the use of a royal decree? Look at all this dust...

227
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,000
This our reality and our fate.

228
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,930
It's my husband.

229
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,810
Your Royal Highness...

230
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,020
Stop it~

231
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,420
Didn't I tell you to stop it.

232
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,750
My lord, this is the night you've first kissed a woman in your whole life.

233
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,320
That too, in front of too many people,

234
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,370
Omo, omo, omo,

235
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,450
What a night it will be for a hot-blooded, old bachelor.

236
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,580
What does he mean, Bachelor? This punk~

237
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,560
Wait, wait. Let's solve this in a gentlemanly fashion.

238
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,790
Wouldn't that be nice?

239
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,200
Everyone, step back.

240
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,560
These useless lot.

241
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,300
You've gone through trouble, putting the kids to sleep.

242
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,620
It's not that hard.

243
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,970
You really don't know Bori?

244
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,020
Who is this Bori?

245
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,670
She is a close friend of mine, like a sister.

246
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,530
Was?

247
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,280
She passed away, not too long ago.

248
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,330
That's why you were surprised when you saw me first?

249
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,500
There are people with the same face in this world.

250
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,210
They say such meetings are as rare as travelling across almost 100 galaxies to meet someone.

251
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,830
Looks like you both had such a rare encounter.

252
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,550
It's fate to meet like this, do you want to come with us to Gapbi Gocha?

253
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,930
As I said earlier, anyone who wants to can come with us, so

254
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,650
if you want to tag-along, let me know. Kwang sun eonni is also coming with us.

255
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,290
I will go with you. I will go.

256
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,200
I want to go with you.

257
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,640
How could you agree so suddenly, when you have no idea where it is?

258
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,770
It's not an easy journey.

259
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,640
I heard that it is a place where women that returned live.

260
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,730
That's enough of a reason to go.

261
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,550
I knew it.

262
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,050
I felt like you would say yes. I am intuitive.

263
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,980
You are okay with it, right?

264
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,630
Why are you asking me about that?

265
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,880
The bigger the party the better.

266
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,200
Ah, by the way, was it good?

267
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,230
Mm?

268
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,180
About kissing the Secret Inspector?

269
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,060
My belongings!

270
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,850
I left my belongings… in the kids room… Yes. In the kid’s room.

271
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,320
I left my belongings… in the kids room… Yes. In the kid’s room.

272
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,160
I'll bring it back right away. Wait for me.

273
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,130
Sleep soon, sleep soon, sleep first.

274
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,960
You were out.

275
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,740
Yeah, you are here too.

276
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,350
♫ <i>Like I'm alone all by myself in my imagination</i> ♫

277
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,450
ㅤ

278
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,990
You must be exhausted, why aren't you sleeping?

279
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,590
Seeing the trumpet creeper reminded me of the old days, hence I'm talking a walk.

280
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,760
You know that flower?

281
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,550
Of course I know.

282
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:58,310
When I took the imperial exam, I used a wreath made of these flowers.

283
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,820
But, how did you know that?

284
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,270
Cha Mal Jong was called 'Wang nun'

285
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:21,090
Ah, I saw Cha Mal Jong wearing mismatched socks.

286
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,340
'Wang nun' was embroidered on one of the socks.

287
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,600
When I was young, my mother embroidered a butterfly in all of my belongings.

288
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,220
Seeing Cha Mal Jong wear that worn out socks,

289
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,700
I figured he misses his mother a lot, so

290
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,890
I took the chance and pleaded him.

291
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,350
Truly, that was very smart of you,

292
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,740
taking note of it in that circumstance.

293
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,470
I have a sharp eye.

294
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,540
Okay. What are you planning to do hereafter?

295
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,730
I've decided to leave for Gapbi Gocha with these people.

296
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,870
That's too bad.

297
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:21,940
Your talent is exceptional. I wanted you to run some errands for me.

298
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,750
That time when you appeared as my wife, it was a stroke of genius.

299
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,010
While I did that, you went on about how much you hated it,

300
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,060
and now you say it was a stroke of genius?

301
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,830
That was... unfortunate.

302
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,940
I thought about it and posing as a fake couple to travel in disguise is not too bad.

303
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,350
Then, what happens if I am forced to kiss you again?

304
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,450
Since I'm a divorced woman, I can act a bit,

305
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,950
but my lord, won't you be busted when you get all awkward?

306
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,570
If only it was not my first…

307
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,630
So...So, what I'm saying is,

308
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,510
I'm saying it was my first time acting.

309
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm not saying it's my first kiss.

310
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,450
Never.

311
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,350
Then it's such a relief.

312
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,240
Anyway, I'm not interested. Look elsewhere if you need a wife.

313
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,440
I'll take my leave.

314
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,210
You too, sleep well.

315
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,670
I have to go hunting.

316
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,030
Yes Master.

317
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:07,330
My lord, there is a message for you from Soyang province.

318
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,160
Did you call for me father?

319
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,790
Tae Seo was arrested by the Secret Inspector.

320
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,560
Really?

321
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,680
Tae Seo is in big trouble, huh?

322
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,400
The judge at <i>Uigeumbu</i> is not one of us hence it's tough to put my hands on it.

323
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,830
By all means, you have to stop him from coming to Hanyang.

324
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,210
Oh, is that so?

325
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:45,430
Then Father, should I go? It looks like fun.

326
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,470
You have to stop his transfer to Uigeumbu.

327
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,060
If you can't stop it,

328
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:59,990
If I can't stop it..., should I kill Tae Seo?

329
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,540
Do Soo,

330
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,150
Tae Seo still has a lot to do.

331
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,300
So I can't kill him?

332
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,430
You punk.

333
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,610
"Father, can't we just kill him?"

334
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,420
You need to ask politely.

335
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,180
Fath-Fath-Father, can't we just kill him?

336
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,130
I don't want blood on your hands. Spare him.

337
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,080
Do you understand?

338
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,810
Yes. I'll return.

339
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,170
Okay.

340
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:45,300
Don't skip meals. Don't do anything stupid.

341
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,830
Yes.

342
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,580
My Lord.

343
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,620
The criminals were just sent to Hanyang.

344
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,400
No matter how hard you look, there are no other scoundrels as crazy as they are.

345
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,230
They fiercely bit the wrists of the wardens who were escorting them.

346
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,050
What's all this?

347
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,190
It's not for you.

348
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,970
What about the women and children? When do they leave for the port?

349
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,350
The ship which is going to Gabbigo will arrive after two meals' time.

350
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,870
It's leaving soon.

351
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,990
Two meals' time.

352
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,300
Let's meet them. It is farewell.

353
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,720
Here you go.

354
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,980
Sir Royal Inspector made the lunch boxes himself

355
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,200
Here. Enjoy it.

356
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,160
Eat it with the children on the way.

357
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,310
Here.

358
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,890
It's the royal inspecter's special lunch box.

359
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,780
Enjoy it.

360
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:29,480
My Lord. There is a lot of baggage. Can I take them to the port?

361
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,960
All right. You may go.

362
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,740
- Goo Pal, you go too. <br> - Yes.

363
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,300
My Lord. Thank you for rescuing us.

364
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,750
- Long life. <br> - Thank you.

365
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,000
- Thank you. <br> - Long life.

366
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,620
Thank you for everything.

367
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,260
We have a long way to go. Let's go.

368
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,050
I'll do it.

369
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,790
Why is a meeting invariably followed by a parting?

370
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,850
Oh, my stomach.

371
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,270
Be quiet and get moving.

372
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,930
I can't move like this.

373
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,830
You need to be clubbed. Get ahold of yourself.

374
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,680
What I'm saying is that my bowels are sensitive.

375
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,840
All of a sudden, the signal came. What can I do?

376
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,560
You really are going to be hit.

377
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,440
- Crude fellow. <br> - I need to relieve myself.

378
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,650
Hurry and untie the rope.

379
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,690
Even if I'm being dragged away, I need to go to the toilet.

380
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:37,090
Oh, my stomach. My stomach. My stomach.

381
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,870
This is not supporting evidence.

382
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,820
Taffy?

383
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,090
Should I take it to her?

384
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,810
Just make do like this.

385
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:11,260
No matter how bad a criminal I am, I need to preserve my dignity.

386
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,500
Oh, it's coming out right here.

387
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,510
This is good enough.

388
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,280
It's done. I'm finished.

389
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,610
This is the best spot.

390
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,350
I knew it. You are the tiger of White Ghost Pass.

391
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,890
Will you make a White Ghost Pass tiger lunch box today too?

392
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,420
Good job.

393
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,820
How was my acting?

394
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,160
Controlling a fart is not easy.

395
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,580
What happened?

396
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,120
It's a long story. Let's go to our hideout.

397
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,500
Well.

398
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,340
Those people are all there.

399
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,890
Tae Su. Hi!

400
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,210
I guess I'm a step late.

401
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,580
You're not injured?

402
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,350
What brought you here?

403
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,730
At the news of an inspector, Dad told me to go take a look.

404
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,410
Do you mean my father?

405
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,270
I think there's going to be a long discussion between you two.

406
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,680
I'll go capture them and be back.

407
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,720
I will end their lives.

408
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,610
- Mal Jong. <br> - Yes?

409
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,200
Bring her back but don't harm even a hair on her head.

410
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,410
Whom?

411
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,060
I mean the woman.

412
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,060
She is the weakness of the royal inspector.

413
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,500
I will. Guys, you have to catch them with me. Let's go.

414
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,470
What are you doing?

415
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,560
Let's go.

416
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,270
If you're going to ride the boat, hurry up.

417
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,480
It's ready to leave.

418
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
Yes, we are coming.

419
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,490
Here we are. Wait a second. We're coming.

420
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:04,850
- Kids, hurry. <i> - Careful, careful.</i>

421
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,190
If you're not going to Gapigoja, get off. The boat is leaving.

422
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,130
Yes, yes. We're going.

423
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,240
I'm all right.

424
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,640
Are you going with her?

425
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,400
Heart, don't ache. I will overwork my body.

426
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,030
Really, what's wrong with him?

427
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,300
You didn't see anything, understand?

428
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,130
If everyone is aboard, we're casting off.

429
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,630
Oh, what was I thinking? I forgot the baggage.

430
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,670
Do you know how to read?

431
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,880
Just words.

432
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,790
But why this book?

433
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,890
It's all burnt.

434
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,400
This isn't a book.. It is a keepsake of my good friend Bo Ri.

435
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,430
Oh, sorry. I didn't know that.

436
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,190
Just a moment. That...can I look at it for a while?

437
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,400
Do you know how to read?

438
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,810
Just a minute would be enough.

439
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,020
This is... <br> Why? What's written there?

440
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,160
Is there something wrong?

441
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,030
It's not just a book, it's a chibuchaek, a ledger recording the stealing of money and commodities.

442
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,960
A ledger? <br> It's no doubt a very important evidence.

443
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,990
You have to show this to the Secret Inspector.

444
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,590
I'm tired. I almost got into big trouble!

445
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,580
Cast off for Gapbigo*. We're really departing. <i>(*present day Gangwha Island)</i>

446
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,550
Wait. <br> Just a minute.

447
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,510
Brother, siblings, can you look after each other?

448
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,870
Please take care of my son.

449
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,390
- You, you, you... <br> - Just we three are leaving.

450
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,660
I can't just give you a refund.

451
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,580
We are okay. Please take care of these people.

452
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,240
Run.

453
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,630
Where are you going?

454
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,570
Where are you going?

455
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,920
I thought you were going to the docks, where are you running off to all of a sudden?

456
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,350
What's this? Why are they here?

457
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,400
Should I teach you?

458
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,290
Why else would we be here? We came to catch you.

459
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,710
- You damned bastards! <br> - Look here. That's just talk.

460
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,940
Try taking a step towards here.

461
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,300
- We won't keep still. <br> - Grab them!

462
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,510
Run.

463
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,700
What are you going to do if you leave your sword behind?

464
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,900
Pick it up quickly! Let's go. Listen to what I'm saying.

465
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,080
Run! <br> Let's go!

466
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:04,790
Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me not.

467
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,890
You spent just one day with her, you know?

468
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,050
Some might think, you are parting after living together.

469
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,010
Time doesn't matter. It's what I feel that matters.

470
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,690
Yes! It must be hard for you.

471
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,330
Is this how 'missing a loved one' feels?

472
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,330
- I keep hearing their voices from awhile ago. <br> - Run!

473
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,330
- That too, very distinctly. <br> - Run! Run!

474
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,200
I hurt so much.

475
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,490
- Hyungnim! - Run!

476
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,540
My Lord! Help us!

477
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,210
Why are you guys doing that? Why did you come back?

478
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,300
My lord!

479
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Grab them! Stop!

480
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,500
My lord, My lord! Take the bundle.

481
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,450
How did this happen?

482
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,860
It's connected to the Gaehwagol incident. I found a ledger.

483
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,930
Ledger?

484
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,290
If you lose them, you all die.

485
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,610
You must catch them.

486
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,790
Let's hear the explanation later. Let's leave here first.

487
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,590
Retreat! Retreat!

488
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,980
Pull faster! Faster!

489
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,920
Faster! Faster!

490
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,180
My lord, pull this way.

491
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,110
Where are we going

492
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,900
We have to cut the rope. Hold tight.

493
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,510
- Lord, how long is this taking? <br>- Wait a minute.

494
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,620
My bundle!

495
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,540
- I grabbed my bundle. <br> - Are you all right?

496
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,500
Lord! Lord!

497
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,540
- Grab him! <br> - My Lord, take my hand!

498
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,230
Pull him off! Pull him off!

499
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,500
Drag him! Drag him!

500
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,660
Pull!

501
00:43:54,270 --> 00:44:00,930
If you don't catch them, don't even think about stepping foot on the shore.

502
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,840
Lord! Lord! Lord!

503
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,140
Lord!

504
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,240
Are you fine?

505
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,180
Yes.

506
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,440
That's good enough.

507
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,280
Help me.

508
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,010
He has no shame. Hey, we almost died because of you.

509
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,860
Spare me. I don't want to die.

510
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,610
Stop.

511
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,370
Please save him.

512
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,730
If he thinks he has no where to go and we save his life, won't he confess?

513
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,100
- Pull him out. <br> - Pull him out? He was trying to kill us!

514
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,390
We're going to rescue him for nothing. Later, he could be more trouble.

515
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,670
If we get a statement about Cha Mal Jong, it will benefit the investigation.

516
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,550
Hey!

517
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,350
Let's go.

518
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,840
We've come all the way here. Why won't you show me your hideout?

519
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,420
We're not that close as brothers.

520
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,650
Oh... That's right.

521
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:54,590
C'mon. Even if we're not that close, I was thinking about becoming brothers.

522
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:59,740
Does saying that mean until now we haven't been brothers?

523
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,260
Is being born a concubine's child

524
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,420
like something which thinks it exists but it doesn't?

525
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,270
It's me. I can't help it.

526
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,590
Because I can't help that you were rejected

527
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,000
I watched you put your life on the line.

528
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,430
Let's go.

529
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,520
Convey to your father

530
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,300
my thanks.

531
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,230
He sent you all the way here even if we're not brothers.

532
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,400
You should have gone at least once to see him. Father... worries a lot about you.

533
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,840
But then, whether you're looking for a ledger or dealing with the secret royal inspector,

534
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,350
one of them should be done so you will have face to show him.

535
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,240
What happened to the criminals who were being transported to Hanyang?

536
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,940
Ji Maeng Soo took them. I just did as I was told.

537
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:20,980
- Ji Maeng Soo? <br> - I had no choice because they took my mother to their hideout.

538
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,070
Spare me, My Lord.

539
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,720
If I don't do as they order, they will kill my mother. If I'm told to kill, I must kill.

540
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,150
It's somewhere if you're told to die you must die.

541
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,790
I also couldn't so anything else. Originally, I didn't intend to...

542
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:38,160
Yook Chil, Goo Pal. Get a straw mat.

543
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,920
-Yes. <br> - Yes.

544
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,040
My Lord, spare me.

545
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,000
There we go.

546
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,940
The straw mat! Cover up.

547
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,150
Don't roll the straw mat but cover it?

548
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,930
Cover the mat?

549
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,530
I'm not talking about the mat.

550
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,660
Isn't he shivering from being wet?

551
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,970
Hurry and cover him.

552
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,400
- We are all wet too. <br> - Yes, sir.

553
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,390
Explain in detail what you were talking about.

554
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,280
The hideout is the headquarters of the Soyang Trading Group.

555
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,790
Cha Mal Jong stores there his stolen goods and the grains paid as taxes,

556
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,580
in the three southern provinces which he and Ji Maeng Soo

557
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,920
stole by joining hands with the officials.

558
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Using the huge amount of money made from the sale in the 8 provinces of these items

559
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,690
and the wine made from the grain, I hear that they operate Park Tae Soo's smelting plant in White Ghost Pass.

560
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,100
White Ghost Pass smelting plant?

561
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,230
Yes. I heard at the plant, silver is extracted

562
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,930
from silver ore from the mines in White Ghost Pass.

563
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,970
There is a

564
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,260
place called White Ghost Pass, actually

565
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,800
oh, everything is made there

566
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,450
Alcohol is brewed, salt is mined,

567
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,530
silver is also mined,

568
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,500
We have to go there. Can you take me to the hideout?

569
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,520
If I did that, my mother will die.

570
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,190
My lord, please don't ask that of me.

571
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,730
Unless we go there, we can't save or rescue your mother, isn't it?

572
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,990
Where is it?

573
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,360
I don't know, I don't know.

574
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,800
I know nothing.

575
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,230
My lord, the master of the hideout,

576
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,630
keeps his men's parents as hostage to

577
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,080
prevent any information leak.

578
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,850
Is there something you know about that place?

579
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,000
I don't know the details, but

580
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,560
in the past, on the master's birthday, I took a theatrical troupe up to the entrance.

581
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,510
- Theatrical troupe? <br> - Yes.

582
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,040
I heard that once a year, on his birthday, he brings in a troupe

583
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,070
and holds a banquet.

584
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,100
If that's the case, take me there.

585
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,130
It's not hard to take you there...

586
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:05,080
When you enter, they thoroughly investigate your ID and you have to follow a gatekeeper to get inside.

587
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:16,150
My lord, how about getting support from Hanyang, get a few additional soldiers and ambush them.

588
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,900
We don't have time for that.

589
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,400
We have to strike before the escapees Park Tae Su and Cha Mal Jong destroy the evidence.

590
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,970
For now put this guy in the storage.

591
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,160
- Okay. <br> - Okay.

592
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,140
My lord, My lord.

593
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,980
I have to see the ledger you have.

594
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,550
How did you get it?

595
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,560
Mm, that...I tried to burn it, thinking it's just a keepsake...

596
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,880
Are you saying you burnt such an important evidence?

597
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,040
I didn't know it was an important evidence.

598
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,160
If only this ledger was in a good condition, we can end everything at one go,

599
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,370
why didn't you tell me before?

600
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:09,140
Well, then, to a man you see for the first time, oh?

601
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,390
that too, to a man looking like a beggar at someone else's house,

602
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,880
is it good sense to tell this to him?

603
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,100
That's true.

604
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,020
This is a Joseja* book. <br> <i> *Joseja: tax receipts</i>

605
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,180
It's not merely a book,

606
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,620
it has the names of those involved in tax grain embezzlement.

607
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,190
You thought this was a keepsake?

608
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,360
It was one of Bori's belongings.

609
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,130
How did this ledger get there?

610
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:46,680
The child Bori was carrying was... actually the Chief's child.

611
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,160
My lord.

612
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,760
What happened to the ledger?

613
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,490
T-That...

614
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,400
To put it simply, I couldn't find it.

615
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,110
What do you mean you can't find it? If it's not in Gaehwageol where will it be!

616
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,450
I searched the Chief's house and Office,

617
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,440
his dead wife's inn, I turned them all inside out and

618
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,430
still couldn't find it anywhere.

619
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,710
But, this,

620
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,980
here,

621
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,680
I found this.

622
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,770
This is...

623
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,500
I found this at the fireplace of the inn.

624
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,200
The inn's fireplace.

625
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,480
Looks like they tried to burn it.

626
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,680
Who tried to burn it?

627
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,140
There's a woman named Joyi.

628
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,180
Then it's enough if we catch her!

629
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,570
She just left Gaehwageol due to her divorce and her whereabouts are unknown.

630
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:59,590
You pest! What are you babbling about?

631
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,470
Please, spare me.

632
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,930
If you want to live, comb through all eight provinces of Joseon,

633
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,680
and find that woman, Joyi.

634
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,730
Head of Shipping, Hong Seok Gi,

635
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,910
even the Head of Shipping is involved in this?

636
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:26,080
But, why the Chief of Gaehwageol?

637
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,590
The ledger,

638
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:31,210
why did he give it to Bori instead of Hong Seok Gi?

639
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,150
By chance, did Bori say or do strange things before she died?

640
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,970
She did say 'she was going to leave anyway',

641
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,240
I thought, if she were to become the Chief's concubine,

642
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,480
she'll have to leave the inn business, I thought she meant that.

643
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,100
I'll leave anyway.

644
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,380
It means someone knew that the Chief gave the ledger to Bori,

645
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,620
came to fetch the ledger and got into trouble.

646
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,000
Then, Bori didn't die from the accident,

647
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,540
but she was murdered?

648
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,500
It looks like that.

649
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:14,450
Then...the one who killed Chief was Hong Seok Gi too?

650
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,910
Coroner says that the assassin's arrow was poisoned with wolfsbane root.

651
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:24,160
Wolfsbane is...a medicine used in the palace, isn't it?

652
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,460
It is said to be one of the best restorative medicines,

653
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,380
but, if misused, it could also be a great poison.

654
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,460
These people are using Wolfsbane.

655
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:40,350
Suppose this wolfsbane has entered the palace, how far is the Head of Shipping involved in this conspiracy?

656
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,700
How about we catch that guy, who...Hong Seok Gi and interrogate him?

657
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,870
It's not that simple. On the contrary, we might lose the one behind this.

658
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,740
Then, mm! How about striking the hideout?

659
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,570
There must be a lot of evidences there.

660
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:58,330
On top of that, people are held as hostages too.

661
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,860
But, that place is not an easy one, they say...

662
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,540
Then... because it's not easy, should we just let the bad guys be.

663
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,680
No, that's not..what I mean.

664
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,850
He's having fun. He's goofing around.

665
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,740
The royal inspector is having the time of his life with the theater troupe.

666
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,510
Forgive her, my lord. Biryeong is just excited, that's all.

667
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:28,270
It's okay Biryeong. It's alright.

668
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:32,580
Did you just say that royal inspector was having fun with the theater troupe?

669
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,830
Did I?

670
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,510
And both of you... watch your words. How could you say that the royal inspector was having fun?

671
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,060
Do you remember the birthday of the master of hideout?

672
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,010
Oh, the day after tomorrow.

673
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,000
We can trust Gwang Soon eonni.

674
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,140
She counts fast and her memory is good.

675
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,760
Theater troupe.

676
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,270
We'll join the troupe and infiltrate the hideout.

677
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,780
That's what I thought too.

678
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,080
Then we'll go find a theater troupe.

679
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,230
- Now? <br> - Now.

680
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,570
I can see it.

681
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,040
He's having fun.

682
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,370
Let's go.

683
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,660
One of your in-law's nephews is waiting for you in there.

684
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,530
Who?

685
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,930
He told me you'd know.

686
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,810
These people just come looking for favors.

687
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:53,850
I told him you were out, he insisted on waiting inside.

688
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,220
I have to tell him off strongly.

689
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,810
You punk!

690
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:10,850
Where do you think you are? Trying to trick officials pretending to be my relative,
