Oh, my...

If you are a ghost, go away. But if you are human...

Bo Ri. You must feel so wronged.

Have you gone mad?

Are you trying to get bewitched by a ghost and end up in trouble?

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,990
I do not care if that is her ghost. She was my friend.

What is that?

It is a goblin fire.

I am busy. Go away.

- Let go of me. - Bo Ri.

24
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,069
Wait.

25
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,969
- This is not it. - What?

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,469
- Gosh. What is wrong with her? - Wait.

Hey, kids.

- Gosh. Hey! - Oh, boy.

30
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,559
So you have been pretending to be a ghost to stop people...

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,029
from coming here?

32
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,930
Otherwise, we would have died. I really did not have a choice.

33
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:49,309
That is mulberry juice.

34
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,010
It looks just like blood.

35
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,920
Do you perhaps have a twin sister?

36
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:01,349
Then do you have a relative who is around the same age as you?

37
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,020
I am an orphan. I do not have any family in this world.

38
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,490
Happy now?

39
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,629
Then who are you guys?

40
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,230
You are not her sisters or brothers.

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,460
No! We are family!

42
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,230
- We are family! - We are family!

43
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,899
- We are family! - We do not share blood,

44
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,170
but we are practically a family who grew up together.

45
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,309
We are family.

46
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,569
I see. I am sorry.

47
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:24,240
You look just like my friend who passed away.

48
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,840
My apologies for my behavior.

49
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,850
By the way, the kids seem sick.

50
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,920
What happened to their eyes?

51
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,619
Their eyes got inflamed while drying medicinal herbs.

52
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,930
- You cannot eat that. - Medicinal herbs?

53
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,059
You will get sick.

54
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,699
- You will get sick. - They seem a bit off too.

55
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,730
We should just go.

56
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,639
We should get going before we end up in trouble.

57
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:53,369
What was that medicinal herb?

58
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,470
Do not intervene in our business. You should just go...

59
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,850
before you end up in trouble because of people who seem off.

60
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,910
No.

61
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,749
I need an answer.

62
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,930
They rubbed their eyes while drying the medicinal herb.

63
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,059
And their eyes got inflamed.

64
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,059
If your eyes come in contact with aconite,

65
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,869
you will go blind.

66
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:20,970
Aconite?

67
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,699
Tell me in detail.

68
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,639
How did you all end up like this?

69
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:28,910
I must know.

71
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,019
Come with me.

72
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,910
It is okay. You are safe.

73
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,550
It is my turn now.

74
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,720
When children at public orphanages turn ten,

75
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,420
they are adopted out or sent to become slaves.

76
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,449
The children here...

77
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,119
were sent to Soyang Trading Group before they escaped.

78
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,559
They broke the rules to run away?

79
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,059
They had no choice.

80
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,639
The head of the trading group is a man called Cha Mal Jong.

81
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,269
He colludes with the village officials...

82
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,869
and makes a huge profit by supplying tributes as a proxy.

83
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,749
He then hoards what others need and amasses more wealth.

84
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,850
He is a madman who treats the slave children...

85
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,980
like toys, depending on his mood.

86
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,459
If a child was unable to obey his order or refused to do so,

87
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,360
he would starve the child and even...

88
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,860
allow the child to die.

89
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,800
Why did you not report him?

90
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Joseon law bans slaves from reporting their owners.

91
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,240
Also, Joseon law states an owner can treat slaves however they wish.

92
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,980
Did you not know that?

93
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:15,110
He could give any punishment he wanted,

94
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,680
and no one questioned him if he said the dead child was frail.

95
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,619
Not one official...

96
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,090
cared about the dead child.

97
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,290
Once they had seen enough,

98
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,059
a few like-minded adults got together...

99
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,530
and started to smuggle the children to bring them here.

100
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,699
That is why...

101
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,800
we spread rumors about ghosts to keep people away.

102
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
Still, you cannot live in a mountain in these conditions.

103
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,709
- Are you sick? - The children must see a doctor.

104
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,119
When the ship to Ganghwa Island comes in, I will leave with them.

105
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,259
I heard that...

106
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,689
there is a village for orphans...

107
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,860
and women who have returned after the war.

108
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,160
Women who have come back are there too?

109
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,900
Women who were taken prisoner who could not return home...

110
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,970
and orphans are allowed to stay.

111
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,369
The village leader is a woman who suffered the same fate.

112
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,059
I am here because I heard you have beef.

113
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,629
Cattle slaughtering is banned, and we have no beef.

114
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,829
Do not lie.

115
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,530
I heard rumors that you give beef to the beggars.

116
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,040
I am sure you have some that is meant for...

117
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,170
the Palace kitchens.

118
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,579
I do not even have any for the King, so go away.

119
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,319
She could just say it is not enough.

120
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:01,819
This should be enough for 70 rolls of hemp cloth.

121
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:08,790
We shall leave.

122
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,459
We will leave.

123
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,930
We are leaving.

124
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,459
This should keep you going for now.

125
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:38,660
This is expensive soup.

126
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,959
Because of the cattle disease, there is barely enough for the King.

127
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,800
We cannot let the living starve so they can offer it to the dead.

128
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,040
It is not a lot, but you can all have a little.

129
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,579
- Thank you. - I will enjoy this.

130
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,140
Thank you.

131
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,880
Hand me the baby...

132
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,650
so you can eat.

133
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:09,250
Hello.

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,459
You are so cute.

135
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:18,260
Are you also a mother?

136
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,069
I heard she was, but she lost her child.

137
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,640
That is why she tries to save children.

138
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
What will you do now?

139
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,329
Before the ship comes,

140
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,900
I will get as many kids from the group as possible.

141
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,130
Why not alert the officials?

142
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,099
That is just as good as telling Cha Mal Jong where we are.

143
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,670
I see.

144
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,280
I will go myself.

145
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,079
You will not go to Gongjinchang?

146
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,809
I must see it for myself.

147
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,319
I will go. Tell me if you need anything.

148
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,959
To tell the truth, my mother has also returned after the war.

149
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:30,739
I want to do all I can to help.

150
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,140
Then...

151
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,780
I do have a favor to ask.

I apologize, sir.

No.

164

If you have the time to apologize, just get beaten to death.

165

What do you say to that? Yes?

Look up at me.

167
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,500
Good girl.

168
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,000
Darn you! You foolish girl!

169
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
I apologize, sir.

170
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,439
This girl needs more than a beating. She needs a good whipping.

171
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,579
She must be taught a lesson, or she will not take you seriously.

172
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,010
I will take her to the shed and string her up and beat her.

173
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,420
Come with me, you brat.

174
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,849
Okay. You do that.

175
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,020
There is a senior slave called Gwang Soon.

176
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,459
Come along!

177
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,059
She brings the child out of the house,

178
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,270
and I pick them up at the meeting place.

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,339
But as you can see, I cannot leave these sick children alone.

180
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,709
Go to the village and bring the children here.

181
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,680
Look. Men who look like servants are all armed with swords.

182
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,250
How closely connected is he with the officials...

183
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,849
that there are sword-carrying thugs?

184
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,250
They are totally crazy.

185
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,890
He is even connected to the magistrate.

186
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:29,989
How can we bring him in?

187
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,900
We must acquire definite evidence.

188
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,500
Or we do not stand a chance.

189
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,199
They must have a secret account book.

190
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,339
You will not raid them now, will you?

191
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,709
The men from the relay station will still be a long way away.

192
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:56,920
Take this. Can you get there before the rooster's first cry?

193
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,520
Your friends' safety depends on it.

194
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,089
Here is a yakgwa, your favorite.

195
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:06,260
Yakgwa.

196
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:07,829
Not now.

197
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,199
Eat it after you reach the relay station, okay?

198
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,300
Wait.

199
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,449
(Starting point)

200
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,489
(Destination)

201
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:36,660
Ouch, stingy.

202
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,219
Ouch.

203
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,410
Hello.

204
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,880
Until the men get here,

205
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,050
we must stall and find some evidence.

206
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:13,089
Would they not suspect something if three strange men were to enter?

207
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,229
We cannot go in as we are.

208
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,430
It is all good now. You are safe now.

209
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,530
Are you hurt?

210
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,670
I am fine.

211
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,839
You must have been scared.

212
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,739
You are safe now.

213
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:07,510
Sorry for hitting you.

214
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,489
Have a drink.

215
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:16,550
Drink up.

216
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,790
Join us.

217
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,510
You need to stay here for the time being.

218
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,239
I will come and get you when it is safe outside.

219
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,439
You cannot come out before then.

220
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,050
We do not know what will happen if Cha Mal Jong sees you again.

221
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,479
I know it is cramped, but be patient.

222
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,579
I will.

223
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,959
Stay inside.

224
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,959
Sit.

225
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:45,157
What are you waiting for? Come out.

226
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,427
He said to come out.

227
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:24,467
Is it amusing?

228
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,028
Is it?

229
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:28,167
No. It is killing me.

230
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,207
You are so pretty, it kills me.

231
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,667
Darn it!

232
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,058
Now,

233
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:56,427
the two of you shall pretend to be lovers.

234
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,197
I would rather be siblings.

235
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,808
Fine. Then say you are siblings.

236
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,528
Are you the same person?

237
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,927
You look like a completely different person.

238
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:01,397
I do?

239
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,897
Do I look that awkward?

240
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:07,868
Then...

241
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:09,798
What about this?

242
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,187
My gosh. How have you been?

243
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:27,318
Hi there, Gwang Soon.

244
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,018
I have been waiting for you.

245
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:31,127
- Wait a minute. - Sure.

246
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:34,197
I was supposed to meet her at the clothing store in the market.

247
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:36,927
Has everything been good?

248
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,197
Of course. Nothing ever happens here.

249
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:44,068
Mi Ryeo has not come yet.

250
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,338
What about the child?

251
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:49,308
There was another problem today, so she is locked up again.

252
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,008
I will bring her later when I come back.

253
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:53,977
You should get back.

254
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:56,147
He will get angry again if you are gone for too long.

255
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,118
- See you later. - Sure.

256
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,417
- Follow her. - I shall.

257
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:16,967
You dropped this.

258
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:20,108
I see. Thank you.

259
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:22,377
The secret code is, "I came from Heunhaengi Hill."

260
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:23,907
I came from Heunhaengi Hill.

261
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:29,647
I heard there was going to be a feast here,

262
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,917
so I had hoped to make a little spending money.

263
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,088
My gosh, what perfect timing. We are short-staffed right now.

264
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:39,157
- Let me carry that. - Thank you.

265
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:41,157
- It is that way. - That way?

266
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:42,998
- Yes. - What luck.

267
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:45,967
Let us go as well.

268
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,707
Here you go.

269
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:02,578
Did you get someone who is skilled?

270
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,647
We hired a carpenter who worked for the palace.

271
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:07,717
I told him to use...

272
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:10,217
only the best raw material, so do not worry.

273
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,717
How are we designing the buildings?

274
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:16,187
He said it would be good to arrange them...

275
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:19,387
to resemble one of the characters for day, month, or entrance.

276
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:21,828
Entrance and day seemed too plain,

277
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,427
so I told him to go with month.

278
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:26,328
I met with other lords,

279
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,697
and the trend of the houses nowadays...

280
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:31,338
shifted from month to luck.

281
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,937
Oh dear. Is that right?

282
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:38,108
I did not know of the recent trends. I apologize.

283
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:40,377
My eldest son will live in this house.

284
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:42,048
Yes, of course.

285
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:45,947
I like this better.

286
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:48,487
I hate complicated things.

287
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:49,887
I prefer this, Dad.

288
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:52,427
But this will bring you luck.

289
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:57,167
Furthermore, how many times have I told you to speak properly?

290
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,068
It is "Father", not "Dad".

291
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,437
Yes, Father.

292
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:01,838
I will go now.

293
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,808
Over here. Carpenter. We need to talk.

294
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:09,078
You are a minister's son. How long will you act like a child?

295
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,508
Father, do not worry about me.

296
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:14,447
You should worry about Tae Seo.

297
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:16,717
Why are you worried about Tae Seo?

298
00:24:17,147 --> 00:24:19,348
The report from the dead secret inspector was submitted.

299
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:21,318
What did you say?

300
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:25,387
Tae Seo always seems to leave loose ends.

301
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:27,998
Everyone is about to find out that you stole the royal offerings...

302
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:30,568
because he failed to get rid of a mere secret inspector.

303
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:31,798
Hey, watch your tongue.

304
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,338
Why should you be careful?

305
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:35,967
You put the King on his throne.

306
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:39,038
Father. You are the leader of the noblemen...

307
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,437
and a loyal subject who replaced the throne with a different King.

308
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,207
You have nothing to worry about.

309
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:49,018
We have failed to locate the account book yet.

310
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:52,618
It is my guess that the King has gotten the Director involved.

311
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:55,417
It will be troublesome if the Director acquires the evidence.

312
00:24:55,717 --> 00:24:57,528
Being careful can never hurt.

313
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:04,167
My gosh. It has been a while since I saw your serious face.

314
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:11,308
Tae Seo must resent us because he is an illegitimate child.

315
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:14,578
So he used my title as the Chief State Councilor...

316
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:16,377
to sweet-talk the officials in the countryside...

317
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:18,477
to increase his assets.

318
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:23,748
So even if the account book turns up,

319
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:25,088
we will not be responsible.

320
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:29,058
It will prove Tae Seo's illegal activity.

321
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,227
What are you talking about?

322
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:39,768
Hey!

323
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:54,278
Oh, no. My lord.

324
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,848
I am so sorry.

325
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:02,387
If you are sorry, work.

326
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:05,487
You will even risk your life.

327
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:09,457
Your determination will save Joseon.

328
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:14,768
How much longer...

329
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,937
will you put up with your lives as farmers, servants, or slaves?

330
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:21,677
The world must not be run based on ranks!

331
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:25,048
In our world, we ought to be rewarded for our hard effort.

332
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:27,318
We must join hands together...

333
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,647
to create that world.

334
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,717
My lord.

335
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:37,687
Until we achieve our goal, you must make sacrifices.

336
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,487
Yes. I will.

337
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:40,858
Do you understand?

338
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:43,127
Yes, I do.

339
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:49,298
What are you talking about?

340
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:51,308
Tae Seo wants nothing but your approval.

341
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:53,808
"Father, just say the word."

342
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:56,237
"Father, is this enough?"

343
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:58,808
"Father. Should I fetch you something?"

344
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:11,528
Gosh.

345
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:14,328
You really are scary.

346
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:16,798
Tae Seo works so hard to gain your approval.

347
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,127
Gosh. I feel awful for Tae Seo now.

348
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:25,308
Not all brothers are the same.

349
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:28,308
Listen, Do Soo.

350
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:33,348
You must brace yourself.

351
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:39,647
I will, Father. Please do not worry.

352
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,358
My lord.

353
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:51,798
Do you have pheasants I could pay as tributes?

354
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:53,798
Pheasants? Of course.

355
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:57,937
I just received some pheasants from Suam Valley.

356
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,338
How much?

357
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:03,877
I need 200 rolls of cotton for a pheasant.

358
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:06,907
Did you say 200 rolls of cotton?

359
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,048
I could buy a horse with that.

360
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:13,088
How can a pheasant and a horse cost the same?

361
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,957
Then you can get flogged for not paying the tribute.

362
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:19,487
If you do not want that, you can sell your children.

363
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:21,727
My gosh. My lord!

364
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:23,727
Please give me a cheaper price.

365
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:25,967
My son has been ill for over a month.

366
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,768
I cannot even afford to buy him any medicine.

367
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:29,768
Gosh. Come on!

368
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:31,707
My lord!

369
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:34,377
What are you looking for? Pheasant?

370
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:36,207
Can you give me a good one?

371
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:37,407
Right here.

372
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:39,647
Look. This looks great.

373
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,018
They gave me a pheasant in exchange for my lunch.

374
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:44,348
So this is how it made its way to the palace.

375
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:46,487
How can we call this a country?

376
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:48,288
Everywhere we go, it reeks of corruption.

377
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:51,088
Seriously. I should leave Joseon when I can.

378
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:16,548
Seeing how you are loitering around, you must be craving drinks.

379
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:20,758
You know, this is the hahyangju only the King gets to drink.

380
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,788
What do you say? Would you like a sip?

381
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:25,028
Do you want a taste?

382
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:30,098
No, I am good. We sometimes have this drink too.

383
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:32,697
Of course I know how rare this liquor is.

384
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:40,108
Gosh. I guess you hold an important position too.

385
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,608
You must have nine lives to have consumed a royal offering.

386
00:29:42,707 --> 00:29:45,877
If you get caught by the Department of Justice,

387
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:47,108
you will be as good as dead.

388
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:52,288
Well, I was born a man.

389
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:54,887
Instead of worrying about the law and living the life of a fool,

390
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:59,328
I would rather eat everything I want and die a happy man.

391
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:01,957
Do you not agree, Chil Guk?

392
00:30:04,697 --> 00:30:05,897
Of course, I do.

393
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,237
Forget about the law.

394
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:13,338
I, Chil Guk, would rather quit pooping than drinking.

395
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:18,348
What about you, Pal Soon?

396
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,417
I agree, my dear brother.

397
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:24,147
Here is the thing about the law.

398
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:27,487
Breaking it gives us the biggest thrill.

399
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,548
My sister is very shy.

400
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:57,647
How beautiful.

401
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:05,927
Do you know that you are adorable?

402
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:10,397
Come inside.

403
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:13,798
- Gosh. What are you doing? - Come here.

404
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,368
He said "beautiful", right?

405
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:22,838
- We should go inside. - Okay.

406
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:34,618
- My gosh. That is a lot. - Goodness.

407
00:31:34,887 --> 00:31:36,657
- Gosh. - Let us go.

408
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:38,887
This is crazy.

409
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:41,528
I am seeing ingredients one would see at the royal kitchen.

410
00:31:41,528 --> 00:31:45,397
Exactly. All these royal offerings should have been served to the King.

411
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,927
(Royal offerings: Goods for kings, magistrates, or the palace)

412
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:49,038
There is more than food. I see hemp clothes too.

413
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:56,838
Hey, scoundrels.

414
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:58,808
Come join me in the backyard.

415
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,377
Sure. I will. It is a great day to be out.

416
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,068
- Mal Jong, you are here. - Hey.

417
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:23,868
Goodness. I always find you guys here.

418
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,508
Keep playing.

419
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,677
Come here.

420
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:31,778
Sit down.

421
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:36,318
Pretty girl, you can sit next to me.

422
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,788
All right. Sit there.

423
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:43,957
Bring us food!

424
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:47,858
We just met, so please excuse me for being blunt.

425
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:51,298
If I may, could I ask who your father is?

426
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:56,298
I should at least know your family before I accept a free meal.

427
00:32:58,508 --> 00:32:59,637
I do not have a father.

428
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:04,778
I do not have a father.

429
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,288
Pretty girl.

430
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:17,357
Have a drink.

431
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,378
This is...

432
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,277
not hahyangju.

433
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:46,217
What?

434
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:48,217
What do you mean?

435
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:51,357
I smell chamomile, not lotus flowers.

436
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:58,898
I can also taste ginger and a bitter flavor of red peppers.

437
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,467
This is hansan sogokju, is it not?

438
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,418
You really are a man about town.

439
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:20,748
If you were a secret royal inspector...

440
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:22,688
who came here to mess things up,

441
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,527
I was going to kill and bury you,

442
00:34:26,058 --> 00:34:28,527
but you know the taste of hansan sogokju?

443
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:32,868
Are you really a lowly scoundrel, then?

444
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:38,637
- He tested me on purpose? - Bring more wine!

445
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:44,248
I noticed on my way in that you have everything.

446
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:48,777
Do you trade medicinal herbs as well?

447
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,748
We do not deal with medicinal herbs.

448
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:56,487
The officer in charge of that is too thorough for my liking.

449
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,628
I cannot be bothered to deal with him.

450
00:34:58,788 --> 00:35:00,487
Oh, is that so?

451
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,868
She definitely said it happened while drying aconite.

452
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:07,168
(Wine)

453
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,467
Where did you get all this wine from?

454
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,237
Do you make it?

455
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:14,737
What? Oh, yes.

456
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,947
Pretty one, where are you from?

457
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,478
Help me out.

458
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:32,288
Does it matter where I am from?

459
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:34,998
The fact that we met today is more important.

460
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,927
Do you know romance?

461
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:44,197
- So... - Yes?

462
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:47,208
All this wine.

463
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:50,708
Where do you make it?

464
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:55,378
Oh, way over there in Jinsan.

465
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:59,217
There is a valley called Baekgwiryeong.

466
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:01,188
That is where we make it.

467
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:05,887
What do you make other than wine?

468
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:09,657
We make wine,

469
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:12,128
weave hemp cloth, make silver...

470
00:36:12,197 --> 00:36:14,337
Silver? Did he say silver?

471
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:25,148
Thanks to you, I got it done in no time.

472
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,177
You even helped me carry the clothes.

473
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,918
Not at all. Tell me if you need anything else done.

474
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:32,047
Just pack me a few yukjeon to go.

475
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,188
Sure.

476
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:38,688
Where is the child?

477
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:40,757
In the storage shed.

478
00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:44,297
There is a side door in the backyard of the annex.

479
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,368
I will bring the child to the door, so you can take her with you.

480
00:36:50,098 --> 00:36:53,708
He was looking for a female servant to help make the side dishes.

481
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:55,337
There is a party today.

482
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:58,378
Is there? I am a great cook, you see.

483
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:00,447
Are you? Great. Come with me, then.

484
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:01,978
- Okay. - Come this way.

485
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,387
How much longer must we do this for?

486
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:19,688
If I am right,

487
00:38:20,288 --> 00:38:22,197
the boy should be at the relay station by now.

488
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,387
I will keep him occupied. You search the house.

489
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,857
- Okay. - We must find the account book.

490
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:57,558
See if they keep medicinal herbs somewhere too.

491
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,007
Can you please look only at me?

492
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:13,748
Okay. I will look only at you.

493
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:15,277
So,

494
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:19,887
I believe you said earlier that you make silver.

495
00:39:20,717 --> 00:39:23,317
Silver is not something you can weave.

496
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:25,188
What were you talking about?

497
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:29,558
Why do you keep asking questions? This is very suspicious.

498
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,907
What odd taste in women you have.

499
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:52,387
The guest of honor should not be so late!

500
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:56,558
I am hosting it for you! You should be on time!

501
00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:00,688
Baekgwiryeong was covered in fog.

502
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,567
But then, the terrain there is quite rough.

503
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:09,137
But could it have been smoke and not fog?

504
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:10,598
From the fires?

505
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:14,007
We have a long way to go. We are just getting started.

506
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:17,337
Anyway, if your father does not throw a fit, all is well.

507
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:19,978
I thought the old man would freak out.

508
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:22,447
Who is this?

509
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:25,087
Me, you mean?

510
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:33,757
He is a passing scoundrel. One of us.

511
00:40:34,328 --> 00:40:35,558
"One of us"?

512
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:38,967
Who is your father, then?

513
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:44,637
My father is...

514
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:45,668
"Father"?

515
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:48,407
He is not "one of us".

516
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:50,107
He said "father".

517
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:17,498
What is it? Do you like her?

518
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,467
She is new from the public orphanage.

519
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:20,567
(Government-run orphanage)

520
00:41:20,907 --> 00:41:23,708
Do not do something that could look bad. It will sour the mood.

521
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,418
There will be no problem.

522
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:31,618
I talked it out with the official who deals with the orphans...

523
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:34,857
and made a fake slave trade ledger.

524
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:36,918
Lie low for a while.

525
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:39,257
Until we catch the secret inspector.

526
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:42,898
What? After we killed the one before,

527
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,828
they sent out another one?

528
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:49,837
My gosh. Must we send out some men again?

529
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:52,007
I already did.

530
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,308
They must be looking in the wrong area.

531
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:56,777
This is a tiny village, and once he arrives,

532
00:41:56,837 --> 00:41:58,777
there is no way out.

533
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:01,007
He is welcome to come by.

534
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:02,777
Do not kill him. Just catch him.

535
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:05,118
Why? What use do you have for him?

536
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,217
I need to find out how much he knows.

537
00:42:08,357 --> 00:42:09,618
We can kill him afterwards.

538
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,728
Sure.

539
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:16,357
I need to go and pee.

540
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:20,567
Hey, you.

541
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:26,067
You had better return in 15 minutes.

542
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:28,837
If you go to pee and do not return for too long,

543
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,878
I would wonder if you went to report us to the magistrate.

544
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:38,387
There is no point in reporting us to the magistrate.

545
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:40,987
He is on my payroll.

546
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:44,317
The fools from his office were here yesterday,

547
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:46,788
and they ate three meals in a row.

I know that.

However,

550
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:53,768
there is always a "just in case".

551
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:59,808
My brother here is not that just or loyal a person.

552
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:03,177
He is so mean, selfish, and self-centered.

You can take your time.

00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,679
Either kiss...

658
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,889
or shout, "The king is a donkey's behind!"

659
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,190
Your choice.

660
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,420
Pardon?

661
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,330
Do it.

662
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,210
What do you say?

663
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,940
Why is he hesitating?

664
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,639
It would be his first kiss.

665
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,650
Would it not be better to say the king is... You know?

666
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,560
The king...

667
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:45,500
The king is a donkey's...

668
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:07,650
Even if you have no desire to succeed,

669
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:10,989
how could you insult the king?

670
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:13,389
In front of all these people.

671
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,659
What if someone reports you?

672
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:19,100
You will be arrested for contempt and face the gravest punishment!

673
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:23,040
The soldiers will be here soon. Hang in there.

674
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:27,310
And you are making a mistake too.

675
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:29,810
I understand that my husband wronged you first.

676
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,650
But how could you be so reckless?

677
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,080
I am sure you know that we must not even joke...

678
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,080
about the King.

679
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,529
You know no shame, woman.

680
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,630
You have no problem kissing a man in front of others.

681
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,799
Are you always that promiscuous?

682
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,069
No, I am not.

683
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,040
But...

684
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,909
So what if I am?

685
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:10,750
I see.

686
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:14,520
Then how about this?

687
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,219
If you kiss me,

688
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:20,330
I will release everyone here.

689
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,989
Watch your tongue!

690
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,130
I do not care what you think about the King.

691
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:30,400
But do not insult my wife.

692
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:42,619
You guys cannot be married.

693
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:46,589
Have you ever seen any married couples kissing?

694
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,520
And she said she was sick of him, that she would not mind...

695
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:52,429
if he were dead.

696
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,900
But they kissed in front of everyone here.

697
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,600
It is as ridiculous as eating a meal in the outhouse.

698
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,739
Who are you?

699
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,770
Answer me.

700
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,580
Who on earth are you?

701
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,949
Allow us to share a kiss.

702
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,920
Or let her die on my sword.

703
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,699
If you can make a decision, I will let the rest of you live.

704
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:36,069
- Let us go! - Go!

705
00:55:39,909 --> 00:55:41,170
Let us settle this, man to man.

706
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,949
What do you say? That would be grander, would it not?

707
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,949
Step back.

708
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,799
Lift your sword.

709
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,610
I do not wish to.

710
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:17,179
Your Highness.

711
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:18,610
If we wield a sword, we will have to use it...

712
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,210
against someone at some point.

713
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,880
I am happy with just my kitchen knife.

714
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:46,469
I will go with this.

715
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:50,210
It is no time to show off. Get the sword now.

716
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:51,940
Grab the sword.

717
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,179
Master.

718
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:55,650
Master, grab the sword.

719
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:38,819
(No animals were harmed during the filming.)

720
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,690
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this episode.)

721
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,670
(Special appearance by Lee Jun Hyuk)

722
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:56,009
(Secret Royal Inspector & Joy)

723
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,440
One day in your life, you will have to protect yourself...

724
00:57:58,509 --> 00:57:59,810
and what is valuable around you.

725
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:02,009
Perhaps, the mastermind I am looking for...

726
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,779
may be closer than I thought.

727
00:58:04,049 --> 00:58:05,380
You must stop him no matter what.

728
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,819
- If you cannot stop him... - Must I kill him?

729
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:11,190
Great bait will catch big fish.

730
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:13,960
Your Majesty...

731
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,860
I told you to stop that.

732
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,400
Do you want to join us to Ganghwa Island?

733
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,100
Yes. I want to go with you.

734
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:20,330
How sad.

735
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,069
That girl is the secret inspector's weakness.

736
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,770
Do whatever it takes to catch them!
