All right. Bi Ryeong. You are all right.

Did you say that he was with the travelling entertainers?

We can be one of the travelling entertainers and get in there.

I had the same thought.

20

No, we did not. We decided not to, so no.

Is it not a strike of luck to meet him outside the shrine?

Inspector. I truly am innocent.

155
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:58,251
I did take a little of the tribute,

156
00:09:58,251 --> 00:09:59,920
but I never took a life.

157
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,560
If only I could, I would cut open my chest and show you my heart.

He is the Gaehwa Valley officer.

166
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,820
- Why is he here? - He asked for the account book too.

167

00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,300
I am glad you are here.

170
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,771
It is time.

171
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,200
All of you.

172
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,940
You need to keep it down.

173
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,280
What is the bell for?

174
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,410
What will you do with those things on the box?

175
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,511
That is a straw doll.

176
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,381
We're going to use that to make him confess.

177
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,591
Why you...

178
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,820
You are all too superstitious.

179
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,790
This is why people must study.

180
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,261
Why do you still maintain the layman's faith?

181
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,900
Ask me anything.

182
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,841
It worked.

183
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,950
Ask him about the account book.

184
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,621
The spirit wants to know.

185
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,251
Tell us everything you know about the account book.

186
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,491
The account book.

187
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:48,091
I received orders from the magistrate...

188
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,501
to look for the account book in Bo Ri's tavern.

189
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,570
Stop it right now!

190
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,711
I...

191
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,280
I...

192
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,290
I...

193
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,690
I met a woman.

194
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:21,761
She was a big woman named Jang Pat Soon.

195
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,361
She lured me into her home.

196
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,501
I said I needed to return to the government office,

197
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,030
but she said to stay the night and pushed me against the wall.

198
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:30,771
She pressed her lips against me...

199
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:34,511
and breathed hot air on the nape of my neck.

200
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,741
- It was... - Reword the question.

201
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,851
Tell us everything you know.

202
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,320
Everything I know?

203
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,180
My family is from Chuncheong Province.

204
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:48,420
The year my father turned 20,

205
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,060
entered into a marriage contract with station house owner...

206
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,790
and had a son.

207
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:55,591
His name was, last name Mi,

208
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,800
first name Ahn Hae. Me. Mi Ahn Hae.

209
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,271
- She asked for everything... - My mother...

210
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,170
and he's saying everything.

211
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,540
Make him stop for a moment.

212
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,611
- Stop. - On my plate...

213
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,371
were a long rice cake and two sweet rice balls.

214
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,341
- I said to stop! - The long one was in the middle.

215
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,981
Why won't he stop?

216
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,981
I don't know how to stop them yet.

217
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,550
- He won't stop? - My mother's baby dream for me.

218
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:20,391
That was how I was born.

219
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,150
When I turned 18,

220
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,761
I met the first woman I ever liked.

221
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,491
But our relationship did not last long.

222
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,060
One day,

223
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:32,300
when that woman came to me...

224
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:36,471
and said, "I am sorry." in a serious tone, I was not sure...

225
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,641
whether she was apologizing or if she was saying...

226
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:42,410
her real name was "Sorry".

227
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,891
I thought I had lost them all,

228
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,121
but I had two left.

229
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,660
Is it because they are travelling street performers?

230
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,461
The veterans are out of control.

231
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,900
They do as they wish.

232
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,471
What about the newbies?

233
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,741
We have to go back again later, or it'll be a real mess.

234
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,040
Let them be.

235
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:14,641
We have a way to infiltrate the bandits' hideout thanks to them.

236
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,580
Be understanding and give in.

237
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,940
He always tells us to give in.

238
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:20,851
He does not give us anything.

239
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,721
If we keep giving in all the time,

240
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,950
we will end up sleeping on the road.

241
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,150
Do not be absurd.

242
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,961
That will not happen.

243
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,290
Anyway,

244
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,330
is entering their hideout the only way?

245
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:36,761
I hear it is a very scary place.

246
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:40,001
We must go eventually in order to find evidence.

247
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:42,170
But they know what we look like.

248
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,400
What about that?

249
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:46,040
That is why we are hiding among the entertainers.

250
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:49,910
If you are so worried, you can put more makeup on.

251
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,440
No.

252
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,511
Say we get through the gate.

253
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,881
What then?

254
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,751
With just entertainers and no strong men.

255
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,621
My point exactly. Please reconsider.

256
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,721
What if we get caught?

257
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,221
Thus, I need one of you to go...

258
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,030
Hoehyeon-dong.

259
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,101
Is that not where the crown prince's house is?

260
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,971
Do you plan to invite those people?

261
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:18,271
- I see. - I see.

262
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,511
I shall go since I am fast.

263
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,741
I run faster than you. I shall go.

264
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,611
- I am faster. - I am faster.

265
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,050
I am older. Of course, I am faster.

266
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,711
My lord.

267
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:34,420
I need to go, so I will go out.

268
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,920
Gosh.

269
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,231
Goodness.

270
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:44,430
You have nowhere to sleep?

271
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:47,471
The entertainers took every single room.

272
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,300
Now, we have no room for us to sleep in.

273
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,170
There are dozens of people sprawled out on the floor,

274
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,641
so there is no empty room.

275
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,940
What do you mean?

276
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,741
I apologize, my lord.

277
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,450
I knew this would happen. He always says to give in.

278
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,150
We have no choice. Give this room to the women.

279
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:10,121
- We... - No.

280
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,530
What? Should we sleep outside in the courtyard?

281
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,560
I refuse.

282
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,400
You can do that if you want.

283
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,131
I am going to sleep in this room.

284
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:22,771
Sleep out here if you wish.

285
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:27,170
I was going to say let the women have this room...

286
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:30,141
and we can sleep in a tavern.

287
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,180
Forget it then.

288
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,680
I was going to buy you a drink while we were at the tavern.

289
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,150
Wait Hold on.

290
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,991
Can we have boiled meat that we could not have last time?

291
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,790
Do not waste your time.

292
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,121
We already checked and did not have any luck.

293
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,091
Perhaps it is because a storm is approaching.

294
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,700
Every tavern is full. There is no vacancy.

295
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,971
What now?

296
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,741
So... Can you think of it as the main room of a tavern...

297
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:03,040
and sleep here together with us?

298
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,080
I know it may be awkward for nobles,

299
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,850
but it is common for us.

300
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:16,521
Well... I apologize if I have offended you.

301
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,161
I was worried that you would suffer if you went out.

302
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,691
Our master has a bit of a temper...

303
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,060
He has a slight temper.

304
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,001
But he has a pure and noble heart...

305
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,040
and accepts things readily if it is right.

306
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,370
He is the noblest of the nobles.

307
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,070
Is that not right, my lord?

308
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,880
That is right.

309
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,050
We shall do that.

310
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,021
If everyone else does it,

311
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,261
I can as well.

312
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,590
- Let us go in. - Yes.

313
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,761
Thank you.

314
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,630
However...

315
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,671
Yuk Chil, you have somewhere to go, do you not?

316
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Yes.

317
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,741
Gu Pal. You go.

318
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,681
You are much faster.

319
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,380
Go on.

320
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,880
Go then.

321
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,451
What are you doing?

322
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:23,890
Thanks, Gu Pal.

323
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,800
I will get some water.

324
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,941
The room is small, so we have to stick together.

325
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,880
Thus, you should stick next to the wall.

326
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,130
- Thank you. - Sure.

327
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,800
Turn off the light and lie down.

328
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,171
Tomorrow will be even busier than today.

329
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,451
So... Go to sleep first.

330
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:27,251
I want to get some air...

331
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,390
Wait.

332
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,901
What are you doing?

333
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,481
Do not worry.

334
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,951
I will not cross over.

335
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,290
My lord.

336
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:46,800
Are you asleep?

337
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,681
My lord.

338
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:01,251
My lord.

339
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:04,181
My lord.

340
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,390
My lord. Are you sleeping?

341
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:54,771
All right.

342
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,961
Come on.

343
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,771
Gosh. My lord.

344
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,100
How much longer are you going to sleep?

345
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:05,771
The sun is hanging high in the sky.

346
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,771
Put these on and come on out quickly.

347
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,038
Great.

348
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,578
There you go.

349
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,788
Gu Pal, you are pretty good at this.

350
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:43,187
Look at you jumping around. I guess you are a shaman indeed.

351
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,458
It is just that your energy comes and goes.

352
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:47,167
Gwang Soon.

353
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:49,328
Did you...

354
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:51,968
Did you see how high it went up?

355
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,768
There are 29 entertainers in the group.

356
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,337
Not counting the kids, there are 27 entertainers.

357
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:57,877
And 3 different colours for each outfit. So that is 81.

358
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,478
And including the outfits for the 5 of us, it should be 96.

359
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:03,318
But we are missing one.

360
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:04,718
There it is.

361
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:08,818
"The five of us"?

362
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,387
Why are you joining us? It will be dangerous.

363
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:14,488
No one knows Cha Mal Jong better than me.

364
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,127
So I am sure I will be helpful.

365
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:18,397
Being literate or knowing math has nothing to do with this.

366
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:20,268
Swords may be involved.

367
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:22,597
You should not come.

368
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:25,397
This is a chance to end an awful jerk like Cha Mal Jong.

369
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,667
Why are you telling me to butt out?

370
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,337
If I was going to stand back and watch,

371
00:24:28,337 --> 00:24:31,278
I would not have gotten off the boat after seeing the account book.

372
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:32,538
Gosh.

373
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,447
Go and play with this!

374
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:36,008
Gosh.

375
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,758
Goodness. You startled me.

376
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:51,498
When did you get here? Today is your birthday, Maeng Soo.

377
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:53,627
How is your birthday party coming along?

378
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,867
- Where is Tae Seo? - Tae Seo?

379
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,968
He is probably training at a corner or something.

380
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:01,708
There he is.

381
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:06,308
Hong Seok Gi was arrested.

382
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,877
That secret inspector even locked up Hong Seok Gi?

383
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:14,748
It is only a matter of time before he starts talking.

384
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:16,958
Wait.

385
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:20,187
How did he know that Hong Seok Gi was involved?

386
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:23,758
That only means the secret inspector must have found the account book.

387
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:26,498
We ransacked Gaehwa Valley, but we could not find it.

388
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,597
How did he find that book?

389
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,768
The girl from Gaehwa Valley probably had it.

390
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:36,877
I should have killed all of them when I had the chance.

391
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:40,078
Hold on. If Hong Seok Gi is caught,

392
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:42,248
it means this place might be comprised too.

393
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,437
Goodness.

394
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,578
Let me.

395
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,877
It is very difficult to tie them by myself.

396
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:21,548
You cannot even tie them on your own?

397
00:26:22,518 --> 00:26:23,657
- Well... - What did you do?

398
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:25,857
Goodness.

399
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,667
First, put this strap here like this.

400
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,337
Start from the right shoulder.

401
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:39,798
And wrap it from the left side of your waist.

402
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,568
Then you can tie it here.

403
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:47,208
Afterwards, put it on your left shoulder.

404
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,417
Then wrap the right side of your waist with it.

405
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:52,218
Then cross the straps like this.

406
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:55,048
And tie them in the middle of your waist.

407
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:01,228
Lastly,

408
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,828
put this belt on.

409
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:06,927
Just like this,

410
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:08,768
wrap it around your waist.

411
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,798
Then tie them together in the middle of your back.

412
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:13,298
Afterwards, you can let go of them.

413
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,308
You cannot even do this by yourself?

414
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,917
Let me do yours too.

415
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:34,758
- It is okay. I can do it alone. - Wait.

416
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,937
How come you know everything?

417
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,578
Commoners like me get to watch an event called durepoongjang.

418
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:57,347
People hold a farming event to wish for a good harvest year...

419
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:59,248
while wearing straps in three different colours every spring.

420
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:00,818
And I saw them a lot during the event.

421
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,758
So you have never worn an outfit like this before.

422
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:09,958
But you are using what you saw to patronize me.

423
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,028
No matter how much I want to try,

424
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,538
they will not let me join them because I am a woman.

425
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:21,238
Only men can wish for a good harvest year.

426
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:22,837
That is how women are patronized.

427
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:31,947
That is why I must get into the hideout with the entertainers.

428
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,387
Do not even try to kick me out because I am a woman.

429
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:37,488
Under one condition.

430
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,958
Do not get hurt no matter what.

431
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:47,298
It is an order.

432
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,078
Thank you.

433
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:07,147
What about the silver for Ganghwa Island?

434
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:09,788
We are almost done digging. It will be done today.

435
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,087
We will head to Ganghwa Island with the silver we promised...

436
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:13,087
as soon as the party is over.

437
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:14,558
And you are going there yourself?

438
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:16,058
But Han Gi is there.

439
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,857
No. I will handle the gunpowder trade myself.

440
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,058
I must expedite the plan.

441
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,627
Sure. What is the point of stalling time?

442
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,337
Getting rid of it fast can be a nice option too.

443
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:27,268
Han Gi will be so happy to see you.

444
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:30,278
Wait. Is it the wrong guy? Would she be happy to see you?

445
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:31,677
No, you fools.

446
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:33,877
She will be happy to see me.

447
00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:35,978
But we do not have to expedite the plan.

448
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,447
- Given what has happened... - Can you forgo this plan?

449
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:40,887
Think carefully.

450
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:44,657
We can still live a good life with the silver we get from here.

451
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:48,587
We did not start this, so we could become rich.

452
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,498
Let Gokdu know...

453
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,197
that I will bring it in person.

454
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:53,728
Okay.

455
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:01,268
You want me to wear this?

456
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:04,377
Yes. Wear that.

457
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:06,038
It suits you well.

458
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:09,708
If you want to disguise, then this is the best role.

459
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,147
Oh, here comes the nobleman.

460
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,887
My gosh. It suits her well.

461
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:19,657
You look great.

462
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:24,157
No nobleman is complete without a beard.

463
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:25,558
You need a beard.

464
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,528
Here we go. Nice.

465
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,867
My lord, get dressed quick...

466
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:34,238
and put this on your head.

467
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,867
You look lovely. It is a great look.

468
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,107
This is how you walk.

469
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:42,778
Twist your knees left and right and shuffle forward.

470
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,347
Like this?

471
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,647
Nobleman, how about you try out your walk?

472
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,328
You do not mean me.

473
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,857
Give it a go.

474
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:02,397
Nobleman, watch me carefully.

475
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,637
You unravel your fan...

476
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,837
and stretch your legs.

477
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:10,837
Clear your throat and yell, "Come out and serve me!"

478
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:15,508
Come out and serve me!

479
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:19,278
- Well done. - Thank you.

480
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:21,087
- You can sit down. - Okay.

481
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:24,157
My lord, come over here.

482
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:28,288
Okay.

483
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,998
Do it right this time.

484
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,568
Do this. Dance like this.

485
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,897
Like this.

486
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:40,768
And like this.

487
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:42,738
Your spell is not working.

488
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,778
Oh, dear, help me.

489
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,048
My lord.

490
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,518
You just have to do this.

491
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:51,917
Is it that hard?

492
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,818
Do you expect a true nobleman to do this?

493
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,917
This is not working.

494
00:31:57,988 --> 00:32:00,458
How about you both just wear a mask?

495
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:02,828
Yes.

496
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:05,357
That would be best.

497
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:08,798
Are you sure it will be okay?

498
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,238
Yes. You saw me do it before.

499
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,837
A ship from Ganghwa Island comes in today.

500
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:17,068
I will wait here, then go to the market at night.

501
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:19,278
I want to ask the peddlers...

502
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,347
if the children arrived safely, for my own peace of mind.

503
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,518
Okay. But still, you must be careful.

504
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:27,018
I will be fine.

505
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,548
Do not worry too much.

506
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:31,887
Soldiers will be here soon.

507
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,058
- Take care of things. - Sure.

508
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:40,228
(Farmers are the foundation of the world)

509
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,147
Let us go.

510
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:03,187
Let us go!

511
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,887
Why do you keep submitting petitions that keep getting denied?

512
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,358
If your people have time to spare,

513
00:33:41,427 --> 00:33:43,288
help out in the kitchens.

514
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,527
I have a very important petition...

515
00:33:45,597 --> 00:33:48,097
on Chungcheong Province's chief clerk of maritime transport.

516
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:52,168
The royal inspectors...

517
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:55,038
have been sending their reports.

518
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,208
I was going to suggest...

519
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:01,078
the King order an inspection of the tax grain warehouses.

520
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:08,518
If it is that important a petition, you should give it to me.

521
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:10,088
I will pass it to the King.

522
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,088
I plan to ask Saheonbu...

523
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,458
and the Three Office to work on a joint petition.

524
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,088
So it is not rejected.

525
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,168
Hongmungwan studies public sentiment.

526
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:24,097
Even if it means death,

527
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:27,338
we speak the truth and what we believe is right.

528
00:34:28,438 --> 00:34:30,268
That is our only honour.

529
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,007
Oh, and by the way,

530
00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:40,447
we do have time to spare as well.

531
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:03,637
How have you been this past year, sir?

532
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,308
- You made it. - Yes.

533
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,237
You have some new people.

534
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:11,347
I thought you would be bored if you saw the same thing each year.

535
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:13,378
This year, I brought another team,

536
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,688
and some masked entertainers.

537
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:18,487
We prepared a very exciting program.

538
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,628
You look forward to it.

539
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:21,728
Good!

540
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:07,097
This is nicely made.

541
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,567
Give me one before you leave.

542
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:10,978
Yes, sure. Of course.

543
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,608
- Let them in! - Thank you.

544
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:15,507
Let us go inside!

545
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:26,288
It was easier to get in than we thought.

546
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,427
Yes.

547
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:30,558
I heard it was a scary place, but it does not look too bad.

548
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:34,597
The hideout is too empty.

549
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:37,998
You are right.

550
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:40,737
My gosh.

551
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,137
You get up to all sorts.

552
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:00,887
Gosh.

553
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,128
Let me see.

554
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:48,208
I think it will be fun. That is all.

555
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:52,108
How will you catch the darn inspector?

556
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,007
He is crafty and persistent.

557
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:56,248
It might help if he were to come here.

558
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,117
He would not dare come here.

559
00:37:58,447 --> 00:37:59,918
He would not, would he?

560
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,347
It would be easier...

561
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,688
to invade the Celestial Palace.

562
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,157
It is possible once a year.

563
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:11,828
For just one day.

564
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:18,498
Yes.

565
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,407
My gosh.

566
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:26,007
Maeng Soo, you should have an entertaining party this year.

567
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:32,047
I will have Pebble follow them.

568
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,898
Even an inspector who aced a state exam...

569
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,538
does not always make the right decision.

570
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,268
The state exam is a stupid policy.

571
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,808
How can there be an exam that smart people...

572
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:02,378
like Tae Seo cannot even take?

573
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,148
Still, the world...

574
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:08,188
turns out to be a fair place after all.

575
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:14,757
Even a ten-year-old child knows how precious a life is.

576
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,097
You abused children and sold them for profit.

577
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:20,197
You have no right to speak of fairness.

578
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:27,838
One more thing.

579
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:31,438
As for aceing the state exam.

580
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:34,137
I wonder.

581
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:36,507
Is it really just for anyone?

582
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:39,978
Attack!

583
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,297
Who are these people?

584
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,768
The crown prince's bodyguards.

585
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:56,398
The crown prince's bodyguards?

586
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:57,938
If they really are...

587
00:39:58,097 --> 00:39:59,967
We are dead meat.

588
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,507
They are Joseon's best guards.

589
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,478
I will handle things here. You find the ledgers.

590
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,648
Yes, my lord.

591
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,047
That way.

592
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:20,588
Hey.

593
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:22,788
Hey.

594
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:26,157
Why is a woman so ignorantly strong?

595
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,668
A man should be proud of being strong,

596
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:29,927
but it is ignorant if a woman is strong?

597
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,168
Stop.

598
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:34,438
I think this is the place.

599
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,308
They may have left it out in the open.

600
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,608
Look.

601
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,878
Not something that looks expensive. Something out in the open...

602
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:47,148
like it is not important.

603
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:57,958
Why are you getting in my way?

604
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,228
Stop getting distracted. Focus!

605
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:06,297
Get over here.

606
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:14,878
Fine. Stay behind me.

607
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:17,108
Do not back down!

608
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:23,088
Good. Do Soo.

609
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:25,518
You came back. Were you not hurt?

610
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,728
No.

611
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,958
The secret inspector that I said to kill keeps sending reports.

612
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:35,398
Why is he still alive? What is Tae Seo doing?

613
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:38,867
I know. You cannot entrust him if you want something done.

614
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:40,237
The chief clerk of maritime transport.

615
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:42,967
We must eliminate him first.

616
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,938
Do Soo.

617
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:50,847
You need to go one more time.

618
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:54,248
Go and push Tae Seo a little more.

619
00:41:54,317 --> 00:41:56,788
If those annoying Three Offices were to join forces,

620
00:41:57,188 --> 00:42:00,418
the Saheonbu may raid and search the house.

621
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:03,188
I just got back from Chungcheong Province.

622
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,228
You must set forth right now.

623
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:10,828
Tell him...

624
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,867
to get rid of the Chief clerk of maritime transport first.

625
00:42:13,438 --> 00:42:14,507
Here.

626
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,137
Simply relay my message to Tae Seo.

627
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,578
Do not get involved. Do you understand?

628
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:23,507
- Here. - No, not this. That one.

629
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,018
Sure. Here.

630
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:29,288
Get a horse ready right now.

631
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,137
I just got home.

632
00:42:51,137 --> 00:42:52,578
We have no choice.

633
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:58,878
Go on. Buy yourself some good food too.

634
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:01,248
Fine. I got it.

635
00:43:02,887 --> 00:43:04,558
There. All done.

636
00:43:04,657 --> 00:43:07,018
I will tell him to get rid of that chief clerk.

637
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:09,728
But Father.

638
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:11,257
Yes? What?

639
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:14,257
Do you need more money?

640
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,867
May I go visit Tae Seo's hideout while I am there?

641
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,507
His hideout?

642
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:24,878
Do you mean where Tae Seo's minions live...

643
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:26,578
deep in the woods?

644
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,208
Why?

645
00:43:28,507 --> 00:43:29,648
You know,

646
00:43:30,378 --> 00:43:32,047
I always wondered...

647
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:36,487
how Tae Seo could spend so much money.

648
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:40,757
All that alcohol, those banquets, and lavish lifestyle.

649
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,588
How is that possible?

650
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:44,328
That is because...

651
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:52,637
Did you find out his source of funds?

652
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,237
I think I will during this trip.

653
00:43:58,708 --> 00:43:59,808
Go on.

654
00:44:03,047 --> 00:44:06,148
Whatever I find in his hideout is mine.

655
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:07,987
Agreed?

656
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:10,018
- Bye. - Sure.

657
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:11,487
- Giddyap. - Be careful.

658
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:33,508
Darn it!

659
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:50,928
What now?

660
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:52,398
I think they will kill us.

661
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,597
Take the tax ledger and go before they find it.

662
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:56,568
The ledger. Yes.

663
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:09,378
Darn it!

664

There you go.

My lord.

670
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:26,488
If you follow them, they will likely hide in the woods...

671
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,428
and ambush you.

672
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,557
They are wounded, so they cannot get too far anyway.

673

My lord! Help!

674

Are you all right?

675
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:44,907
I am, but look at them.

676
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:54,318
Let us treat the wounded first.

677
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:56,988
They are exhausted. We need to feed them first.

678
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:02,727
- The wounded first. - Yes, my lord.

679
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,997
My lord!

680
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:08,698
The ledgers. We found the ledgers.

681
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:12,068
We found the people who were captured... What is all of this?

682
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:13,168
Where are they?

683
00:47:14,137 --> 00:47:16,437
They all scattered.

684
00:47:18,738 --> 00:47:20,178
They ran.

685
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:26,178
We won!

686

If not for these ledgers...

687
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:43,168
I would have...

00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,168
Gwang Soon.

689
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:50,108
Gwang Soon.

690
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:53,577
We have people like that in Joseon?

691
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,378
They are...

692
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:59,178
the crown prince's bodyguards. A special team of royal guards.

693
00:47:59,378 --> 00:48:00,818
It goes without saying.

694
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:05,088
Goodness. People who guard the royal family...

695
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:07,358
are not only great in martial arts, they are beautiful too.

696
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,687
- It is not only martial arts. - Exactly.

697
00:48:09,758 --> 00:48:12,657
Look at that solid physique, the confident eyes...

698
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:15,468
Their shoulders are broad like rafters.

699
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:16,628
Right.

700
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:18,298
Did you see them fight? No?

701
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,307
They went clang, whish, yap.

702
00:48:22,937 --> 00:48:26,137
They must be tired. We should prepare food for them.

703
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:27,678
Is the kitchen this way?

704
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,878
- That way? - Sure...

705
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:31,318
This way.

706
00:48:31,477 --> 00:48:33,878
Come this way. Thank you so much.

707
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,318
This way.

708
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:38,258
Rafters.

709
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:45,358
Look at my shoulders.

710
00:48:46,698 --> 00:48:48,827
These are clearly rafters, are they not?

711
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:52,198
I should go and prepare some food.

712
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:58,008
My shoulders are as wide as a ridge pole. Do you not agree?

713
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:02,307
Get this!

714
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:29,867
Come on. We must hurry.

715
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:32,077
- What about the ledgers? - Oh, that.

716
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:36,608
This is all I could bring. They had already taken the rest.

717
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:38,418
I must get them back. If not, my father will be in danger.

718
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:39,878
It is already too late.

719
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:42,418
Luckily, I was able to take the book that had...

720
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:44,117
your father's name as one of the people who took bribes.

721
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,157
So do not worry.

722
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:48,727
Go to Gokdu and help the gunpowder trade go through.

723
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,387
I got it.

724
00:49:52,398 --> 00:49:54,097
We must get going first.

725
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:05,077
Let me see.

726
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:06,477
Both of you, step aside.

727
00:50:23,957 --> 00:50:25,198
This is my turf.

728
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:40,238
All right.

729
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:43,907
The ingredients look fresher than usual.

730
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:46,178
Should we start with removing the blood?

731
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:47,918
Cut the tail off first.

732
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:49,918
Do not cut off the flesh too much.

733
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:51,148
Right away, chef.

734
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:55,628
What are you doing?

735
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:57,157
I am making chicken soup.

736
00:50:57,787 --> 00:51:00,657
What? No. I did not mean it literally.

737
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:03,468
I am asking why you are here.

738
00:51:03,568 --> 00:51:04,997
To cook, of course.

739
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,168
What? You have never met a smart, bright, perfect guy...

740
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:13,077
who can cook on top of his gorgeous looks.

741
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,577
That is it, right?

742
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:16,048
All right.

743
00:51:20,617 --> 00:51:24,247
You must let the men take care of any physically demanding jobs.

744
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:31,597
Have you gone mad?

745
00:51:31,957 --> 00:51:34,398
We need them as a whole. Why did you crush all of them?

746
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:41,238
Right. You are getting old.

747
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,137
You must at least know how to cook if you will be a bachelor forever.

748
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,477
No...

749
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,437
Then have fun cooking.

750
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:50,378
By the way, will his food be edible?

751
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:52,847
He may have a nasty temper,

752
00:51:52,918 --> 00:51:54,818
but he is the best scholar and cook.

753
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,687
- Right. - I see.

754
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,187
I am glad he is good at something.

755
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:01,758
Then we will leave you be and do something else.

756
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:05,428
- Thank you. - But still, Jo Yi. You must help...

757
00:52:05,657 --> 00:52:07,097
- We cannot let him... - Gosh.

758
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:17,137
I am old...

759
00:52:19,037 --> 00:52:21,907
and have a bad temper. Me?

760
00:52:21,977 --> 00:52:23,378
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

761
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:27,918
I was not asking you a question.

762
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,247
- Okay. - Okay.

763
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:33,157

764
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:40,528

Hey.

767
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:01,477
You still have not realized the situation you are in.

768
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:03,347
I can see the wheels turning in your head.

769
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,457
I am watching you.

770
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,258
I am watching.

771
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:14,758
Do not even budge. If you do, I will scold you.

772
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:47,398
- My lord. - Yes.

773
00:53:48,928 --> 00:53:50,327
- Be careful with this. - Yes, my lord.

774
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:52,798
- Thank you. - Give us some food too.

775
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,267
- Sure. Wait, please. - Sure.

776
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:55,738
You will get your food soon.

777
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:00,008
Your food will be ready right away.

778
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:01,137
Right here.

779
00:54:01,207 --> 00:54:03,508
- Thank you for your patience. - Thank you.

780
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:05,818
- My goodness. Sure. - Thank you.

781
00:54:05,878 --> 00:54:08,077
My lord, this is the last table of food.

782
00:54:08,347 --> 00:54:10,988
I see. You guys should start eating too.

783
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:12,088
Okay.

784

It is getting cold. Hurry.

786
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:35,807
Goodness. The meat tastes amazing.

787
00:54:35,878 --> 00:54:38,378
Their chicken soup is so good. What a surprise.

788
00:54:39,378 --> 00:54:40,878
The chicken was stewed for a while.

789
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,387
Nothing gets your energy up like the broth.

790
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:44,247
- Eat a lot. - Thank you.

791
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:47,187
Enjoy your meal.

792
00:54:47,258 --> 00:54:49,287
- Thank you. - Thank you.

793
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:51,698
- Let us eat. - This is delicious.

794
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:53,428
I will not leave any food behind.

795
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:56,128
- You should eat first. - Gosh. No.

796
00:54:56,497 --> 00:54:58,637
Gosh. I can eat later.

Thank you, my lord.

Here.

802
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:32,898
- Hot! - Are you okay?

803
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,907
No, it is not hot at all.

804
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:39,537
It is not hot at all.

805
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:41,407
Here. Have some.

806
00:55:41,477 --> 00:55:42,648
It must be hot.

807
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:48,648
Gu Pal, you should slow down. You might get indigestion.

808
00:55:48,718 --> 00:55:50,648
Hey. That hurts.

809
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:56,488
There is only one leg here.

810
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,327
I cannot have this.

811
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:00,657
I can have the rest.

812
00:56:05,668 --> 00:56:08,097
I saw a mosquito. I guess we are in the mountain after all.

813
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:10,068
Please enjoy your chicken leg.

814

My lord.

815
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:25,387
Are you not going to eat?

816
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:33,957
Gosh. That looks so great.

817
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:37,798
I used sesame oil and light soy sauce...

818
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,137
to season the chicken.

819
00:56:39,198 --> 00:56:41,238
Nice. It is seasoned too.

00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,787
that we were to protect you.

829
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:42,488
I must know more about the entrance of Baekgwiryeong.

830
00:58:42,557 --> 00:58:44,957
No. You cannot go there alone.

831
00:58:45,028 --> 00:58:46,758
You are acting like his wife.

832
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:49,668
They committed every single crime with the officials.

833
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,327
What on earth is up there?

834
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,838
I heard there is something that explodes when you step on it.

835
00:58:54,068 --> 00:58:56,468
I can blow up bigger things to catch the inspector.

836
00:58:57,537 --> 00:59:00,278
How many murders have there been in just one month?

837
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:03,247
I hope you find the answer to this mystery.

838
00:59:03,347 --> 00:59:05,108
I will do that.
