You must wash the seaweed until the bubbles come up in order to eliminate the bitter taste.

8
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,920
Especially, if it is to be eaten fresh and not steamed, if you don't clean it well,

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,650
the seaweed could be too slippery and ruin its texture in your mouth. So you must be careful.

- Young Master! 
 - Sir Yi Eon!

Sir, don't you have to wear your clothes to work?

Ah, there. Look here!

30
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,710
I asked you to wait for me.

31
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,030
I will accept payment starting today.

32
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,050
You cannot expect to take someone else's hard work for free.

33
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,530
For me to come to work at myosi, in order to prepare lunch,

34
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,320
I have to wake up at insi.*

Wow, look at his cooking skills...

38
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,940
- We should eat, right? 
- What's there to debate?

39
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,220
Gosh, wait. I'm getting dizzy here.

40
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,430
Oh, well. I'll give you two bowls of rice and five hobs* from my stipend next month.
(1 hob = 180ml)

41
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,890
- I agree. 
 - Me, too.

42
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,490
I'll take Jeju buckwheat flour, Wanju ginger, or pheasant meat as payment for this meal.

43
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,050
Is that not too much? Our stipend has been cut, too.

44
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,590
But the bribes you've taken behind closed doors  increased, no?

45
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,370
This guy... jeez... you have no idea since you're new, but...

46
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,870
Look here. If we don't even take those bribes, how else would we be able to protect our noble lifestyle?

47
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,790
If you're interested, should I introduce you to some financers?

48
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,630
Don't bother.  It is just that I need ingredients to suit the level of my cuisine.

49
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,910
I'm not at all interested.

50
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,180
I'm thinking of preparing taro soup and steamed chicken.

51
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,230
Although I'm not sure if you would be interested.

52
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,170
I am. I am interested.

53
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,330
- I am extremely interested.
 - Me, too.

54
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,010
Hey, did you hear? Huh? You heard? He said Jeju buckwheat flour!

55
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,060
Ginger and pheasant!

56
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,220
He must be making something for the Chief Scholar or something.

57
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,790
What in the world! What!

58
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,150
- Who is this!
- Isn't this Chae Bok...

59
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,440
who was sent out as an inspector to Gyeonggi Province?

60
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,060
Advisor, sir? 
<i>Eunggyo: An advisor to the king, official of the 4th class at Hongmungwan.</i>

61
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,900
My goodness. All the inspectors who were dispatched returned in that condition. Does that make sense?

62
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,770
But still, that inspector managed to come back alive from Gyeonggi.

63
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,880
Wait, did anyone come back as a corpse?

64
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,260
They have to march through many miles of tough terrain without having enough to eat.

65
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,510
- How could their lives be guaranteed? 
- Right.

66
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,970
That sure is the case. As for Inspector Park Moo Gyeong who was dispatched to Choongcheong Province recently,

67
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,330
no one knows whether he's dead or alive. No one has heard from him.

68
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,010
- There was such an incident? 
 - So no one has heard from him yet?

69
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,130
- What do you know exactly? Stop eating...
 - He should send a message...

70
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:24,120
So, you know, the minute you've been appointed as an inspector,

71
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,170
you can say your life is over. Okay?

72
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,260
So you should watch out... hello?

73
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,200
Where did he go? Look here. Where are going? I'm talking to you.

74
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
It has nothing to do with a new official like me in any case.

75
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,670
Why would I concern myself with the dispatching of inspectors?

76
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,060
There, there, there, that senseless bastard. Just because it didn't happen to him.

77
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,200
If it weren't for our ranks, I would've slapped him right in the back of his head--

78
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,830
But guys like that always score highest on the government exam and...

79
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,910
they never experience a single hardship and continue winning in life.

80
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,480
That wretched person...

81
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,610
No, no... I meant, you can go...

82
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,060
But if the Advisor returns midway, do they select another out of the hat?

83
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,450
Wait... select out of the hat?

84
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,670
Your Majesty, I would like to mention something to you.

85
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,930
Will there not be a new secret royal inspector chosen soon? That's why I'm bringing this up but...

86
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you trying to say?

87
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As for the selection, we can select anyone from the Hongmungwan.

88
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,560
The last secret royal inspector just happened to go to Chungcheong Province.

89
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,850
I happened to be slightly inconvenienced by this.

90
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,330
Ah, you should have been more responsible.

91
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,680
Even if I am the king, I cannot completely ignore all of the bribes you are receiving.

92
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,870
Take it easy. Please...

93
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,320
Your grace has no limit. So, about the province that is chosen...

94
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,820
What place should I select?

95
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,220
As long as it's not the south. Especially the Chungcheong Province.

96
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,540
Your Majesty, the Chief Scholar would like to meet with you.

97
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,450
Why bother coming to meet me every time, Chief Scholar?

98
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,340
As for the inspector selection, the Chief State Minister and I can take care of it.

99
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,120
Are you choosing the province today as well?

100
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
I just brought in a report from a Hongmungwan official

101
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,520
who returned home from his dispatch to the platoon.

102
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,060
Then hand that over here, and take your leave.

103
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,110
Well, now that I'm here. Please let me assist you in choosing a province.

104
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,090
I already stopped by the Hongmungwan and notified them of a selection of a new inspector already.

105
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:21,550
Because you are so concerned,  we will be able to send out a new royal inspector tonight.

106
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,210
Then do so, Chief Scholar.

107
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,990
<i>Chungcheongjwa Province*</i>
(West of Chungcheong Province)

108
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,960
I am Kim Joy, the wife of Noh Choo Han from Gaehwagol Jipjooe Town  in Chungcheongjwa Proince.

109
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,330
According to the royal command in the rule of law, I request a divorce, Sir.

110
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,000
The royal command of the law says divorce is allowed if the married couple desires it.

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,920
I wish for you to make a decision on my objection to this marriage according to the law of the land.

112
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,240
Why not just live in peace? Must you go through with the divorce?

113
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,080
Yes, I must.

114
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,980
At age 21, I married a perfect stranger, and now I'm 24.

115
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,270
Thinking about the last three years makes me angry as it is.

116
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,760
Rather than live 30 more years in vain, I'd rather separate now

117
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,170
and live as Kim Joy, not as Noh Choo Han's wife from Gaehwagol.

118
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,150
Look now, it looks like she's an annoying woman. Why not just give her the divorce?

119
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,290
- Sir, as for me... 
 - I don't want to!

120
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,320
That cannot be!

121
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,150
Sir, I'm the one who is upset and frustrated.

122
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:21,130
Show me another mother-in-law who's been better to her daughter-in-law!

123
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,000
Did I ever starve her or not let her sleep?

124
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,720
I prepared three meals every day...

125
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,980
- I prepared all those meals. 
 - With freshly made kimchi...

126
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,930
I made that kimchi every time.

127
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,630
All the vegetable dishes from every season...

128
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,960
I did all the farm work for those vegetables.

129
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,780
I let her eat hot meals every mealtime.

130
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,710
Who do you think prepared all those meals for every mealtime?

131
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,260
Look. Do you see how she talks back every word?

132
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,820
I just added more explanations.

133
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:58,570
Despite that, I always thought of her as my own daughter.

134
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,740
To put this to an end, she does not have a daughter.

135
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,120
My gosh!

136
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,890
I never laid a hand on her.

137
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,080
I did grab her hair a few times, though.

138
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,690
A mother-in-law treating someone else's daughter that badly is nothing to brag about.

139
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,310
How dare a woman raise her voice?

140
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,790
Isn't it given that a daughter-in-law should take care of her mother-in-law?

141
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,620
That woman!

142
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,590
Be quiet!

143
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,870
They say marriage is a major life event.

144
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,020
You do not think that a separation would be granted over these small matters, do you?

145
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,040
- Yes, sir.
 - Then you must know that the law enforces

146
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,980
80 beatings if you insist on divorce, right?

147
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,620
Yes, sir. I do know.

148
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,700
Then tell me the specific reasons why you want to be separated.

149
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,790
I never wanted this marriage from the start.

150
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,260
Sir, from the start, Joy...

151
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,800
What she's saying is a total lie.

152
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,460
Mother, let me speak, too!

153
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,240
How could she say that she never wanted to get married

154
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,790
when both families gave permission for their union?

155
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,660
- Sir, this is my litigation.
 - Hey!

156
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,180
Jang Pat Soon, stay out of this.

157
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,240
And I have my name, Kim Joy.

158
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,600
But ever since I got married, 'This b****, that b****, despicable b****, deserves to die...'

159
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,960
That's what I've been called. I've never been called by my name.

160
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,750
What the hell. Why does she need a name? It's not like she's a gisaeng.

161
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,160
That seems trivial.

162
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,600
On top of that, look how outrageously she's dressed!

163
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,930
I'm so embarrassed to face my neighbors.

164
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,730
Sir, please understand how hard us women work.

165
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,800
And if modifying my skirt in order to work easier is an embarrassment,

166
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,030
do you think this many women would've asked me to fix their skirts?

167
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,400
This is so comfortable.

168
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,810
It's no fault of hers to have good sewing skills.

169
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,360
That looks hideous.

170
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:30,690
That's not the entire story. I have not been treated

171
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,280
properly as a mother-in-law!

172
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,090
Mother, it's past lunchtime. Are you not hungry?

173
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,130
I'm sleeping.

174
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:52,690
Mother, I prepared your lunch table, so eat when you get hungry. I'll be going out...

175
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,390
Where are you going?

176
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,790
I have your lunch prepared. Would you like to eat now?

177
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,160
How about Choo Han? Did you feel him lunch?

178
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,660
Yes, he ate lunch already and went to watch Namsadangpae.*
(<i>*A traveling entertainment group</i>)

179
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,730
Oh, yeah? How about you? Did you eat?

180
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,120
Gosh, no. How can I eat before you eat, Mother?

181
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,360
On top of that, I got sick from eating the leftover rice you gave me this morning.

182
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,190
How can you be so squeamish? That's no good.

183
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,310
I'll take a nap for now. Bring out the lunch later.

184
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,150
I have your lunch table prepared, so eat it when you want. I'll...

185
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,930
What are you saying? Are you telling me to eat a cold meal?

186
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,060
To be honest, I heard that my mother came home.

187
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,760
I wanted to go over and see her briefly, Mother.

188
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,280
What? Being taken away to the Qing dynasty is nothing to brag about.

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,160
She should be living quietly and that wouldn't be enough. Why let everyone know about it?

190
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,930
Saying, 'My mother came back from China.'

191
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,980
My mother is not a criminal.

192
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,110
We're the ones who are ashamed for not protecting our family. Not my mother.

193
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:18,390
So brazen. She's just like her mother. As they say, "like mother, like daughter."

194
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,560
Gosh, anyway! I don't feel like eating right now.

195
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,820
So bring it to me later!

196
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,960
I already prepared everything, so scoop up the rice and eat it when you get hungry!

197
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,010
What? Scoop up the rice? That b****!

198
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,120
That b**** is starving her mother-in-law!

199
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,230
Aigoo, she says to "scoop up the rice." Scoop it up...

200
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,890
What in the world. Telling your mother-in-law to scoop up the rice?

201
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,540
She must've lost it. That Joy is no joke.

202
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,230
Gosh, it's been so long since I've been back at my home ever since I got married.

203
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,720
My mother is still alive!

204
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,420
I couldn't even witness my mother's passing because I had to prepare our great-grandfather's ancestral ritual table.

205
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,500
It's okay. It's okay.

206
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,530
Sir, that rude b****!

207
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,930
My kind Choo Han says he'll keep her as a wife for the rest of her life.

208
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,330
Even though she has no idea what she's done wrong and is embarrassing herself

209
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:25,000
in front of the neighbors, I'll teach her well and look after her.

210
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,160
Our apologies for concerning you with this.

211
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,430
What in the world...

212
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,950
Do you even know that your kind son has been going to Jamojeon due to his gambling debt?

213
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,960
- What a loser he is! 
- Quitting gambling is impossible!

214
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,330
What nonsense are you spewing? My Choo Han was gambling?

215
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,170
- He did gamble.
 - No, no!

216
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:06,430
Noh Coo Han, did you ever gamble?

217
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,530
No, I didn't.

218
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,230
No, I didn't.

219
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,730
Request a witness.

220
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,230
Do you have a witness, plaintiff?

221
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes, I'm sure some of the men who are present know about it.

222
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,720
Gosh, I don't even know what that means.

223
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,390
If you want divorce, bring in evidence or a witness.

224
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,930
A witness? What witness?

225
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,690
If it turns out that you falsified this lawsuit, you will get a beating!

226
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,690
Oh, no, Joy...

227
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,700
You think you could stand it without coming back home?

228
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,730
If you don't want to get a beating, hurry home and make dinner!

229
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,630
- Choo Han.
 - Yes, Mother.

230
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,340
Let's go.

231
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,990
Welcome, sir!

232
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,820
Welcome sir!

233
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
We have pork and chicken.

234
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,890
- I'll take the pork. 
- Of course.

235
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,990
Pheasant meat. Jeju buckwheat flour.

236
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,680
Wanju ginger.

237
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,130
They've already brought it here.

238
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,180
Yook Chil!

239
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,200
Have you gotten off work, Young Master?

240
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,650
Young Master, you use the kitchen more than the outhouse.

241
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,600
And if the head madam finds out?

242
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,840
Our lives will be over.

243
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,480
If I had to choose between my taste buds and you getting spanked. I'd definitely have to choose the latter.

244
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,760
You're so good at calmly cooking like this.

245
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,530
I don't know who the lucky bride will be, but once she is married to you, she will feel nothing but bliss.

246
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,750
And yet, there's no one.

247
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,820
Saying you'll feel bliss in life through marriage is nonsense.

248
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,450
There will be an increase in the amount of in-laws I have to serve.

249
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,260
And if there were a child, how would I look after him?

250
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,360
How much more should we save for the stipend? (<i>People paid officials "in kind" such as rice, barley, silk, etc.)</i>

251
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,740
Who is marriage for anyway?

252
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,560
Let's eat!

253
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,380
<i>The Story of Madam Park</i>

254
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,520
It's just right.

255
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,620
<i>The Tale of Jeon Woo Chi</i> 
 <i>The Tale of Hong Gil Dong</i>

256
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,960
<i>Yi Eon.</i>

257
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,780
<i>Here, this is Joseon.</i>

258
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,640
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

259
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,630
<i>Young Master, wake up!</i>

260
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,170
<i>You must make haste and run away!</i>

261
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,200
<i>The crown prince...</i>

262
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,680
<i>Is the crown prince all right?</i>

263
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,020
Anyone home?

264
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,790
Lord So Seung Ji?

265
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,010
Surrender to his royal command.

266
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,360
<i>Secret Royal Inspector Ra Yi Eon</i>

267
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,530
You should already know the procedures that follow from the time being?

268
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,300
Execute your task to the best of your abilities.

269
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,640
Wait a minute, my lord!

270
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,000
Is this truly a royal command directed to me?

271
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,060
A secret royal inspector?

272
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,090
Secret royal inspector?

273
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,580
I'm a new official at Hongmungwan, a rookie.

274
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,710
Everyone selected before you were disqualified.

275
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,780
Ah, I apologize.

276
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,360
Lord Do Seung Ji, my fever is too severe.

277
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,340
My lord! My grandfather passed away last night!

278
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,720
There are only a few days left until her delivery date...

279
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,710
Oh, is it coming out already?

280
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,020
Wait a little bit longer. Go give birth inside the home.

281
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,420
You can't do that here.

282
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,340
What? His grandfather passed away?

283
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,380
How can a grandfather who passed away last year pass away again?

284
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,850
Fever? Delivery date?

285
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,160
They all prepared their excuses so thoroughly, huh?

286
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,730
They did, they did!

287
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,910
Excuse me...

288
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,530
Young Master, since yesterday my body has been...

289
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,980
Why? Are you close to your delivery date too?

290
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,400
Yes, my delivery date is...

291
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,170
Then what about you?

292
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,030
- Yeah, well back in my hometown... 
 - Hometown?

293
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,150
Did your dog back at home pass away? Do you have to send it off with an entire ritual or something?

294
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,080
If you don't immediately start packing and run out in 15 minutes,

295
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,860
you'll have nothing but bean paste and soy sauce mixed together to eat for all future meals. Understood?

296
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,970
Leave out our food ingredients so that the village people can take them.

297
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,660
Ah, don't worry about that. Go ahead and open up that envelope.

298
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,640
I'm curious.

299
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,160
I believe in you, Gyeonggi Province.

300
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,320
Alright, since I'm being transferred. Might as well have it be close to home.

301
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,160
Gyeonggi.

302
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Gyeonggi.

303
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,960
Yeah. Gyeonggi.

304
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,150
Gyeonggi. Gyeonggi.

305
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,470
Gyeonggi! Gyeonggi!

306
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,200
Gyeonggi. Gyeong...

307
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,280
Chungcheong Province?

308
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,920
Chungcheong Province...

309
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,220
Chungcheong Province you say...

310
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,530
How many days until we get to Chungcheong Province?

311
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,780
Our Young Master was always so petty at work.

312
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,420
Would the people above him like him?

313
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,010
When I was expected to never succeed, who said to not look at the past?

314
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,160
But when I was getting hit by my grandmother,

315
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,440
who was the jerk that hurriedly went out to find a stick from the bush clover tree?

316
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,660
But then, they said that a bush clover tree stick would easily snap.

317
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,850
He said the ash tree was much sturdier, and guided my grandmother in that direction.

318
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,190
Now that I look at it, for me to be transferred as the youngest secret royal inspector...

319
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,980
The individuals that were so critical in this occurring have been here the whole time.

320
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,390
Shouldn't you be running here?

321
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,010
Since things have come to this, I might as well visit all the delicious restaurants in the Chungcheong Province.

322
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,340
I just happened to hear about many places I wanted to visit through rumors anyway.

323
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,480
Hey... But you're still the secret royal inspector, Young Master.

324
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,060
You should still inspect places and open investigations here and there.

325
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,250
That's enough, you jerk.

326
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,650
I shouldn't waste my energy on useless government matters.

327
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,030
I'm just going to cruise around different restaurants and

328
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,640
show my face in the province a few times, then come back.

329
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,760
When the crown prince was alive, you were so sincere when it came to the nations affairs.

330
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,170
Young Master. No, Royal Inspector!

331
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,110
We're not going to walk all night like this, are we?

332
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,440
No, you shouldn't just be thinking about restaurants. You should look for an inn, no?

333
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,380
<i>It's Bo Ri.</i>

334
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,980
Bo Ri, you're inside right?

335
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,150
Hwang Bo Ri!

336
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,600
Bo Ri, what are you doing?

337
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,700
Eonni Joy!

338
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,050
Why are you so surprised?

339
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,400
What is that?

340
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,080
What is this?

341
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,390
Why is a virgin making baby clothes...

342
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,110
It's not mine.

343
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,610
It's for... that Gwi Soon that lives down the street.

344
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,250
You half-witted girl. You must be crazy, crazy!

345
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,410
It hurts, Eonni!

346
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,030
You don't know what your future is going to be like, so how can you be with child? A child, huh?

347
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,710
- What are you going to do? Ah, what are you going to do?! 
- Just hold on!

348
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,540
What kind of low-life did you fall for?

349
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,530
He's not a low-life. I'm saying he's not a low-life!

350
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,530
If he's not a low-life, then what? Is he a the administrative head or something? Huh?

351
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,540
Yes! It's a administrative head's child.

352
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,160
- The administrative head? 
- That's right. The administrative head's child!

353
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,070
I don't like warming up to random men so I can sell alcohol.

354
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,850
I want to wear pretty clothes and live in a warm room. That's why I did it! And what about it?

355
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,160
Bo Ri, then you!

356
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,230
You! Are you going to go live in a mansion?

357
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,990
You did well. Yeah, you did well. It's not like love will feed you.

358
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,520
If it's the administrative head, he's a noble with the highest position in town.

359
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,470
Anyway, with our place in society, fixing our place that way is totally understandable. You did well. You did great.

360
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,220
- Is that right? 
- I was afraid you had a one-night stand with some nobody and got pregnant.

361
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,420
You did well. If it's the administrative head then at least you won't have to suffer like this anymore.

362
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,580
Freezing in the icy snow and melting in the sweltering heat.

363
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,080
Didn't you suffer enough by running this business?

364
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,840
Give me your hand, what is this? A log of wood would look better than this.

365
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,460
Ah, and more than anything...

366
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,670
If you were to serve as witness in front of the administrative head, then he wouldn't be able to turn a blind eye.

367
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,450
Witness?

368
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,270
To be honest, the reason I came to you today is...

369
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,500
<i>Stand right there. Ah, that's precious fabric!</i>

370
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,500
<i>Ah, are you not going to work!</i>

371
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,160
<i>Hit it with the bat.</i>

372
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,030
Ah, he definitely went to gamble that day.

373
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,510
Ah, do you happen to remember anything?

374
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,930
Ah, you know that day. The... the night of the last full moon.

375
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:54,780
You said the woodcutters from Gyeongsang Province set up a gambling room with a bundle of silver coins.

376
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,500
Ah, I think I did see them when I brought a table to the back.

377
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,170
Bo Ri, then...

378
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,670
can you be my witness?

379
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,350
- Witness? 
- Yes.

380
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,120
If you become a concubine, you're going to quit the business anyway.

381
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,340
As long as I can prove that he's gambling, I can receive a "butterfly."

382
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,380
<i>Butterfly: proof of divorce for citizens of the Joseon era</i>

383
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,790
Bo Ri, please.

384
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,010
Please let me fly far, far away.

385
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:48,770
So you're telling me to serve as a witness for your husband gambling here.

386
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,400
Yes.

387
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,450
All the men in this village are on the same side. No one will step forward for me.

388
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,680
Bo Ri, please.

389
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,120
But still, they're all my customers.

390
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,160
Give me a chance to change my life, thanks to you.

391
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,270
If I could, I would like to take the state exam and hold an office like men.

392
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,900
But I cannot do that.

393
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,530
But what's worse is to continue to live like this, whining about my life, Bo Ri.

394
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,010
I want to become happy.

395
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,950
Would it be possible, Bo Ri?

396
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:49,580
Sure. Of course, I can do that for you, Eonni.

397
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,680
Don't worry. I'll be your witness.

398
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,730
Thank you, Bo Ri!

399
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,880
Oh, right. Your baby.

400
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,280
I didn't hit your stomach earlier, did I?

401
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,490
Hwang Bo Ri, you'd better stay alert. Got it?

402
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,870
You are a mother now. A mother. Got it?

403
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,000
<i>A Joseon token which entitled an official to requisition a horse.</i>

404
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,940
You can pull the reins this way like this.

405
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,760
Geez... gosh... okay, okay... I landed.

406
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,850
How do I stop him?

407
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,590
I think I get it now.

408
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,810
Good, good, good.

409
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,940
How far are you going?

410
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,070
Take me with you!

411
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,770
- Sir. 
 - Giddyup.

412
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,980
Aren't we going to eat?

413
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,230
<i>- A delicacy is waiting for us in Chungcheong.</i> 
- The horse got to eat some carrots, at least.

414
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,110
Go ahead.

415
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,280
Sir Yi Eon, I'm hungry.

416
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,480
Oh! Yes...

417
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,120
Here.

418
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,050
Eat up.

419
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:51,690
Zzageul, zzageulyi, zzogeul, zzoguelyi, here is zzageulyi...

420
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:04,440
Zzageul, zzageulyi, zzageulyi, zzageulyiyo...

421
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,570
Here I go to eat zzageulyi...

422
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,660
Whoa, feels so refreshing!

423
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,640
What are you doing? That's filthy!

424
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,840
Goo Pal, I noticed a mill at the entrance of this village.

425
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,070
I'll go and rob them later.

426
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,400
I'll hit the owner's temple and knock him out.

427
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,950
You tie him up with a rope.

428
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,870
Yes, let's make sure we do that.

429
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,860
If only we had met a good master, we could've led a good life. Don't you think?

430
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,800
While traveling 300 ri,

431
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,690
he fed us two rice balls and three tiny jujubes.

432
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,440
Is this ... Is this how a person should live?

433
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,760
My stomach lining is stuck to my feel now.

434
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,440
I cannot walk any longer.

435
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,290
Please tell our master that I'll go to God in heaven before him...

436
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,600
Goo Pal! Goo Pal!

437
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,750
Wake up! You cannot die alone! Wake up, Goo Pal!

438
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,460
Goo Pal!

439
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,030
Hey, hey.

440
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,790
You ate light only yesterday and today. People would think that I starved you for days.

441
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,710
I hear the marketplace will be our side dishes.

442
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,950
If you want to eat delicious food, you should show this much effort, at least. That's nothing...

443
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,860
Get up. We're almost there. I'll feed you.

444
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,790
So when? In the next life?

445
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:43,360
I told you. If we go about 50 ri further, the best delicacy in Chungcheong...

446
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,010
Bo Ri's Jjageuli* House is there. <i>(*Spicy pork kimchi stew)</i>

447
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:51,070
I hear that place makes their broth with a special marinade made from ground dried pepper flakes. Aren't you curious how it would taste?

448
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,420
Whether it's jjageuli or jjuguruntangi, I can't go any further. I'm starving.

449
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,110
Even during that brutal year of Byeongja,* I ate more than this. <i>(*December, 1636 to February 1637 Qing invasion)</i>

450
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,820
I will let you eat double amount of jjageuli.

451
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,050
Goo Pal could eat a double portion in one bite. We can't go. We can't.

452
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,040
Fine. I got it.

453
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,240
I will add beef broth to the double portion.

454
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,930
Add rice wine on top of beef broth.

455
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,740
All right. I got it.

456
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,340
Let's go.

457
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,030
Aren't we going?

458
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,210
<i>It's Bo Ri.</i>

459
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,840
<i>Ledger</i>

460
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,430
What is this?

461
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,260
- Our lifeline. 
 - Huh?

462
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,380
You must keep this safe. Somewhere you can grab it quickly if we must leave at any given point.

463
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,540
Leave?

464
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,070
Why would we leave?

465
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,370
Anyway, get ready to leave.

466
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,320
Just know that.

467
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,230
<i>Bo Ri, you're not asleep yet, are you?</i>

468
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,820
Oh!  Eonni Joy.

469
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,090
What's going on this late at night? Is something wrong?

470
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,990
My gosh!

471
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,940
What's this?

472
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,530
You were craving this. Try it.

473
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,170
That's true, but...

474
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,840
where did you find such a precious fruit?

475
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,700
A peddler came up from Cheongdo. He had hidden it.

476
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,840
Then isn't this a gift?

477
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,060
A gift for the king?

478
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,820
It's okay.

479
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,590
The aristocrats all sneak things out like this and eat them.

480
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,170
But they're aristocrats.

481
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,240
Gosh, I said it's okay.

482
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,860
The baby in your tummy is craving it. I could do this much for the baby as his aunt.

483
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,160
Hurry up and eat it.

484
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,740
It's delicious. Really good!

485
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,420
Gosh, take your time. You'll get sick.

486
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:44,310
So what kind of man is that persimmon... I mean...

487
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,180
What kind of man is the magistrate? Is he a good man?

488
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah. Perhaps it's because I grew up as an orphan.

489
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,050
I like a man who is like a father.

490
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:59,290
Gosh! But you're still too good for him in my eyes, girl.

491
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,980
How about the baby? Does he seem okay inside your tummy?

492
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,710
Yeah.

493
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:10,480
I can't really feel him yet, but I could still feel him.

494
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,550
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

495
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,260
I knew it.

496
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,820
So long as you two will be happy, well.

497
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,600
I'm leaving.  I left home without my mother-in-law knowing.

498
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,260
You're already leaving?

499
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,810
- You also have to taste this! 
 - Never mind.

500
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,990
- Bye! 
 - You probably haven't eaten something like this either.

501
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,080
- Eonni Joy! 
 - See you tomorrow!

502
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,140
But, where!

503
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,970
If there is a witness, bring him out!

504
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,540
Bring it on!

505
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,290
Disgraceful!  Disgraceful!  Hurry!

506
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,700
The Head of Shipping showed up in Gaehwagol.

507
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,590
Please give me the ledger.

508
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,510
- I will keep it well hidden. 
 - My lord!

509
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,610
Yes.

510
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,430
Oh, yes. How far did we get, that...

511
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,840
Secretary.

512
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,260
Yes, sir.

513
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,740
Oh, right.

514
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,490
Have you gotten a witness?

515
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,550
Yes, sir.  Someone saw my husband gambling.

516
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,770
Bring the witness!

517
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,300
Gosh, that's ... truly ...

518
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,270
But ...

519
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,530
No!

520
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,220
That is Gaehwagol in Chungcheongjwa Province.

521
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,870
Will we finally eat jjageuli* (*<i>Spicy pork kimchi stew</i>)

522
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,830
But, my lord,

523
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,500
what will happen if there is a rumor that a strange nobleman is looking around the village?

524
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,000
You said it would be dangerous if they find out that you are a secret royal inspector.

525
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,730
So?

526
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,820
If it's for your safety,

527
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,070
I'll sacrifice my body.

528
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,450
Bang Deuk, you scallawag.

529
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,640
Don't behave frivolously.

530
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,550
Be sedate like me.

531
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,300
Settle down.

532
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,030
Even though I'm disguised for my safety's sake,

533
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,100
- when it's among just us ... 
 - You jackanapes!

534
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,630
What kind of talk is that to my lord? Damn.

535
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,400
"Damn!"

536
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,360
Stop the prattle and

537
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,700
let's just eat.

538
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,110
It's beans, the jjuguli, whatever.

539
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,090
Guide us to the restaurant.

540
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,140
It's barley.  The jjageuli. (<i>Correcting the name of the dish</i>)

541
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,230
There.  They said it's on the edge of the market to the right.

542
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,890
Let's go.

543
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,410
Here it is.

544
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,590
<i>It's Bo Ri. ("barley")</i>

545
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,310
What is this? 
 <i>Closed</i>

546
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,470
It's closed.

547
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,550
- Hey there! 
 - It's closed.

548
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,830
Isn't anyone there?

549
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,700
Closed?

550
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,940
- What's with being closed? 
 - Nobody's here!

551
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,180
What was closed?

552
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,610
There's no one here.

553
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,960
- Why is it closed? 
 - There's no one!

554
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,640
We're starving!  Is anybody there?

555
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,000
Is no one here?

556
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,820
Young Master, what are you talking about?

557
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,760
What happened?

558
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,650
But, we can't eat?

559
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,430
No, this place is good.

560
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,660
Will you stab me in the back?

561
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,130
It seems the owner is here.

562
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,660
There, quickly, quickly, quickly!

563
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,940
Hey, Hwang Bo Ri!

564
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,500
Hwang Bo Ri, you ...

565
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,250
What the heck?

566
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:08,050
Oh my, look at this.  She was yelling so loud not to worry.

567
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,930
Could you be looking for the owner?

568
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,280
She's run away because she knows if I catch her, she's dead meat.

569
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,730
Run away?  Does that mean the restaurant owner has run away somewhere?

570
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,780
She must have been too scared to show up, huh?

571
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,210
It seems she was  in such a hurry as soon as she dropped the spoon, she took off.

572
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,140
She's not too swift in the head, but a fast runner.

573
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,970
But, if she wasn't going to testify, she should have left the evidence.

574
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,070
- But ... 
 - Bad girl!

575
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,190
- Have a good life! 
 - Where is the restaurant owner?

576
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,580
Hey, where did she go, really!

577
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,580
Hey there!

578
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,350
Someone here isn't talking to me.

579
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,480
But since earlier, what are these beggars?

580
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,650
Why have you come to beg at a restaurant where the owner is missing?

581
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,310
- We aren't here to beg— 
 - Get out of here!

582
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,410
Hwang Bo Ri died.  Today is her funeral.

583
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,500
Are you going to go to the restaurant owner?

584
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,950
Is there anything here that I can eat?

585
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,130
Oppa.

586
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,860
Haven't you seen Hwang Bo Ri?

587
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,880
Hwang Bo Ri!

588
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,660
- How far is she going? 
 - Haven't you seen Hwang Bo Ri?  Hwang Bo Ri.  Hwang Bo Ri.

589
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,600
Have you perhaps ...

590
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,370
Can we find the single girl Bo Ri?

591
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,040
No, food ...

592
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,860
That's not a human!

593
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,370
How has she lost so much weight?

594
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,350
<i>It's Bo Ri.</i>

595
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,450
Bo Ri.

596
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,080
Bo Ri!

597
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,810
Bo Ri, wake up, Bo Ri!

598
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,960
Let's get out of the water.

599
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,600
Bo Ri.

600
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,940
Bo Ri.

601
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,880
Bo Ri! Open your eyes, Bo Ri!

602
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,470
Bo Ri.

603
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,870
Bo Ri.

604
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,150
Oh dear, Bo Ri.

605
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,630
Bo Ri.

606
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,080
Bo Ri.

607
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,080
What's happening here?

608
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,540
We were just going to the market.

609
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,190
It's unbelievable that the owner of the speciality restaurant is dead.

610
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,420
The mountain trail is too rough.

611
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,620
Was she trying to take a bath?

612
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,310
Bo Ri.

613
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:25,120
Wake up, Bo Ri.

614
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,970
Oh my god.

615
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,270
Damn!  What in tarnation!

616
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,860
- Take the body. 
 - Yes

617
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,600
Wait.

618
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,110
Please wait.

619
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,820
Why are you doing this?  Where will you take Bo Ri?

620
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,330
That's not for you to know! Drat!

621
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,960
Bo Ri!

622
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,580
My lord, shouldn't you investigate this?

623
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,800
A person is dead.

624
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,670
Bo Ri.  Bo Ri!

625
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,250
If I do, what difference will it make?

626
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,460
Although it is a shame that a young woman has died,

627
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,370
isn't it an accident caused by losing her balance?

628
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,600
Even if it is, this is too much.

629
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,300
- They are treating a dead person so roughly. 
 - Bo Ri.

630
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,970
- Shall we go over and say something? 
 - Bo Ri!

631
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,790
- Still --   I'm still not ready to let her go. 
 - We don't have time.

632
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,190
I told you to hurry up!

633
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,590
- Please! Please let me say goodbye ... 
 - Get out of our way!

634
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,200
Be gentle!  You're treating a person like trash!

635
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,290
Step aside before you get beaten with a chidogon* (<i>*club used to flog criminals</i>)

636
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,620
Even if you flog me a thousand time, I will do it.

637
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:44,270
Saying she has no family, are you not allowing any time to placate the resentment of a dead person?

638
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:51,210
So would you like to go together with her to heaven?

639
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,150
I said to make haste!

640
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,830
Bo Ri. Bo Ri!

641
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:26,200
Bo Ri!  Bo Ri!

642
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,480
Bo Ri!

643
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,770
Lord!

644
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,850
Bo Ri!

645
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,100
Bo Ri!

646
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,020
Seeing that they took her into the government office, they must be conducting an investigation.

647
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,830
They sure conduct a rough investigation.

648
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,840
They must be guilty about something.

649
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,850
Let's leave for now.

650
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,950
Leave?

651
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,360
To where?

652
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,220
Didn't I tell you?

653
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,340
That we would never get involved in official duties, but return after visiting specialty restaurants.

654
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,980
It will upset the village magistrate.

655
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,550
It's not an incident I should spy on.

656
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,460
So the next restaurant to visit is...

657
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,850
Magistrate sir!

658
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,350
What do we do? Magistrate sir!

659
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,550
Move!

660
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,610
Open up!

661
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,740
<i>Leave?</i>

662
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,820
<i>Why would we leave?</i>

663
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:13,390
<i>To buy a small house for us to live in, I just...</i>

664
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,780
<i>I just stole a little bit from the cargo vessel as the provincial governor told me to.</i>

665
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,300
<i>You stole from the cargo vessel?</i>

666
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,530
<i>My lord!</i>

667
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,930
<i>I had no idea that would happen to a royal inspector...</i>

668
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,350
<i>To run away before the matter becomes more serious, you must keep this ledger!</i>

669
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,810
<i>That's how we can survive.</i>

670
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,750
<i>My lord.</i>

671
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,540
My lord! My lord!

672
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,380
The dead royal inspector's corpse is found at the beach.

673
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,390
What?

674
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,020
Get rid of her for now!

675
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,540
- Bury her today? 
 - That's right!

676
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,140
- But to follow the law...
- But what?

677
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,380
Get rid of her! Burn it! Whatever!

678
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,380
That's not the problem here!

679
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,280
Wait. Cremate her?

680
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,530
Secretary sir!

681
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,330
Secretary sir, cremate her?

682
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,960
Whether you cremate her or bury her, just get rid of it quickly!

683
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,220
What are you doing? Hurry!

684
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,460
Bring the carrier!

685
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,830
What is wrong is wrong.

686
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,360
I will say what I have to say.

687
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,090
Sir! Please come out!

688
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,730
I have a desperate plea for you!

689
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,910
Sir!

690
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,920
Sir, please!

691
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,760
Hurry up and put her on it.

692
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,570
Bo Ri!

693
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,390
Hurry up and burn her.

694
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,840
Burn her? What are you talking about?

695
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,780
I will set up her burial and have a funeral, sir.

696
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,820
Sir! Sir!

697
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,860
Sir!

698
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,540
How can this be?

699
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,100
A person is dead. Never mind her funeral. How can you get rid of the body on the same day?

700
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,420
How can this happen under the heavens?

701
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:37,930
Why are you so cruel?

702
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,650
Just because we're lowly in class, how can you cremate her on the day of her death?

703
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,690
Move out of the way!

704
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:47,970
I have to do what I'm told. What other choice do I have?

705
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,720
Can I dress her in burlap clothing before she leaves for good? Please?

706
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,010
In her tummy...

707
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,830
She is with a child...

708
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,870
Move!

709
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,720
My lord!

710
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,200
How can you do this to Bo Ri?

711
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Let's rush. Hurry!

712
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,580
You!

713
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,380
Hurry up! Hurry!

714
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,030
Hurry! Aigoo!

715
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,660
Did you hear what that woman said earlier?

716
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,510
<i>How can this be?</i>

717
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,480
<i>She's...</i>

718
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,880
<i>She is with a child...</i>

719
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,780
There's no reason she would climb the waterfall when she's with a child.

720
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,260
<i>- She must've slipped on the boulder. 
 - I know!</i>

721
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,000
<i>The mountain trail is too rough.</i>

722
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,730
<i>Was she trying to take a bath?</i>

723
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:30,090
A bath... a bath...

724
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,920
<i>- My lord!
- Let's rush. Hurry!</i>

725
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,430
<i>How can you do this to Bo Ri?</i>

726
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:42,720
Forget it. There's no need to make up a story here.

727
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,530
Let's just go.

728
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,610
All right.

729
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,480
Gosh, I'm so baffled.

730
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,760
Let's just find out one thing. Just one thing.

731
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,480
<i>Park Moo Gyeong.</i>

732
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,140
That... that's...

733
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,060
Where did you find him?

734
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:15,320
Something was caught in my fish net...

735
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,250
I thought it was a shark, so I brought it up.

736
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,020
This is something...

737
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:26,470
I made sure that we took care of this along with the sunken vessel.

738
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:31,180
Since it's the middle of the month, it came into the shore with the tide.

739
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,320
My Lord, we have the ledger.

740
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,280
Things could work out as long as we get rid of the corpse. Don't you think?

741
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,640
Led... ledger...

742
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,860
<i>You must keep this ledger! That's how we can survive!</i>

743
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,660
<i>My lord.</i>

744
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,360
That...

745
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,130
My lord, you must be aware of where it is hidden.

746
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,960
The location, yes?

747
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,030
Well, I had no time...

748
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,880
I didn't get to find out.

749
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,640
Let's avoid the onlookers. Hurry, hurry!

750
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,750
Move the body!

751
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,580
What are you all doing? Carry him!

752
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,430
Move him! Hurry! Hurry!

753
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:15,250
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut in order to live!

754
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,850
Of course, sir.

755
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,580
What are you doing? Hurry up.

756
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,440
Aigoo, hurry up!

757
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,730
Hurry.

758
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,590
Goodness!

759
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,780
Move out of the way!

760
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,380
Lower your gaze!

761
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,340
<i>Hurry, hurry!</i>

762
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,020
Open the door!

763
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:14,490
It's the royal inspector.

764
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,740
Open the door!

765
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,990
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by

767

<i>Where is the ledger? The ledger!</i>

768
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,790
<i>None of her things remain, huh?</i>

769
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:55,650

 - Don't get involved!</i>

<i>Oh, my gosh! Look at this guy!</i>

772

<i>Whether you shred him to death or not, what we need is the ledger.</i>

774
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,080
<i>They couldn't have murdered him and covered it as accidental death, could they?</i>

775
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,190
<i>Please be careful.</i>

776
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,160
<i>This belongs to the government office.</i>
