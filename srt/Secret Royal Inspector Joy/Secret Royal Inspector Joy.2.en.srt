00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,530
My Lord, since there is the ledger,

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,920
don't you think things could work out as long as we get rid of the corpse?

10

That...

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,270
My lord, you must be aware of where it is hidden. The location, yes?

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,620
Well, I had no time... I didn't get to find out.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,130
What?

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,910
<i>Where is the ledger? Where is it!</i>

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,710
Hurry up.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,390
Goodness!

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,100
Move out of the way!

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,490
Lower your gaze!

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,820
My lord, did you see? Just now, from the corpse...

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,630
It was a horse pass. <i>(Issued to officials dispatched out of the capital allowing use of horses from the transportation posts)</i>

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,340
If he has a horse pass, does it mean that he was also...

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,200
He must be one of the secret inspectors who was dispatched but ended up reported dead or missing.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,220
Inspector Park Moo Gyeong went to Chungcheong Province.

26
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,610
There's still no news of whether he's dead or alive.

27
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,770
- Yook Chil. <br>- Yes?

28
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,300
- You're going to have to wear those clothes properly. <br>- What?

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,920
Come on out!

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,680
Come on out!

31
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,260
Come on--

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,980
Everyone has returned back to their homes.

33
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,950
Who is making such a ruckus at our entrance?

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,670
Pay your respects.

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,740
- What? <br> - If I were to introduce myself,

36
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,190
- I am the Chief Clown of Land and Property at Hanseongbu, the Capital Bureau. <br>- Chief Clerk.

37
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,060
I am the Chief Clerk. My name is Oh Dong Yoo.

38
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,370
As in empress tree leaves?

39
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,800
That's right. The thing is, I was on my way to my hometown for a vacation.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,040
But I ended up getting robbed by a group of thieves up on the hill.

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,490
Because of this, I have come to ask the magistrate if he could serve me gukbap <i>(rice soup)</i> and let me rest here for a bit.

42
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,090
I was wondering if I could seek food and shelter for the time being. That's why I'm here.

43
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,260
I doubt that. Why not ask for food at a restaurant or any house?

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,830
This is a government office where important matters take place.

45
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,070
You fool! How could a noble man like me ask for a meal where others can see?

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:54,030
Yes... I do apologize, but we are in the middle of resolving urgent affairs so...

47
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,730
My master is the Saheonbu's Lord Oh's first cousin once removed. <i>(Saheonbu is the Office of the Inspector-General)</i>

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,940
Bang Deuk, you fool. How dare you mention that my uncle is Lord Oh of Saheonbu?

49
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,300
If I have to call out a relative's name to get food in my stomach...

50
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,970
Then I'll look like such a desperate person.

51
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,890
Now, how am I to face my uncle who is Saheonbu's Lord Oh?

52
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,870
Forget that my distant uncle is Lord Oh of Saheonbu.

53
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,120
No, my lord. Where are you trying to go with that bad knee of yours?

54
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,190
If your uncle, Lord Oh of Saheonbu finds out of this, imagine how furious he'll be.

55
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,500
Did we struggle to walk all the way over here for our efforts to be wasted? Hurry and talk to him again.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,430
Stop, stop, stop with it all!

57
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,620
If I were to die on the roadside, let that be the fate of the Chief Clerk from Hanseongbu.

58
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,490
Don't worry about it.

59
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,330
My lord, please.

60
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,390
My lord, my lord. That wasn't what I meant.

61
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,290
Let's go. Let's get started.

62
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,980
Let's hurry on so that I can see my uncle who happens to be Lord Oh of Saheonbu.

63
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,270
Get moving, knees!

64
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,360
M-m-m-y l-l-l-l-ord! Hold on. Could you wait just a moment?

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,540
- I'm telling the truth! <br>- How am I supposed to believe that?

66
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,770
There have been more than one case of fraudsters claiming to have powerful relatives.

67
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,060
What if we send him back, but it turns out to be the truth? Then what will we do?

68
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,220
Even so, we cannot let just anyone in here in the midst of this chaos.

69
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,040
Why don't we just fix him a bowl of rice soup and send him on his way?

70
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,390
Are you willing to risk your honor for a measly bowl of rice?

71
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,220
In the meantime, I will go and search for the ledger.

72
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,960
- Where is the book? <br> - I told you, I don't know!

73
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,390
Bo Ri must have gone and hidden it well somewhere.

74
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,190
So you must definitely find it and bring it back. You must.

75
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,760
Hurry, hurry. Go on.

76
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,420
<i>It is Bo Ri.</i>

77
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,360
Rotten girl.

78
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,990
<i>Unni, you're going to organize everything for me, right?</i>

79
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,730
I don't know. Why do I have to look after you anyway?

80
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,730
<i>Besides you, Unni, I don't have any family.</i>

81
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,400
Again, again! With those words of yours.

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,330
Then why did you have to die before your time?

83
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,610
<i>You're going to do everything anyway, but you always act like this.</i>

84
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,080
<i>Unni, make sure to clean everything here.</i>

85
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,800
<i>And my belongings... Burn them thoroughly, so they can be sent off with me.</i>

86
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,160
<i>Understand?</i>

87
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,160
You're funny. Fool.

88
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,840
She couldn't even put this tiny jeogori (<i>Traditional jacket</i>) on them.

89
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,360
You were always sweet and never enjoyed life.

90
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,670
You were amazing, Hwang Bo Ri.

91
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,830
You stupid half-witted fool, so completely dumb.

92
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,590
Even if it's just this.

93
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,790
I'll make sure to bury this well. I'll make sure of it, Bo Ri.

94
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,920
<i>It's Bo Ri.</i>

95
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,420
Ah, why is that girl in a room without its owner?

96
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,400
What if she finds the book?

97
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,180
Ah no, even if she did find it, she'd have no idea what it was. Then should I go in and drive her out?

98
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,050
No, no. That'll garner more suspicion.

99
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,220
Ah, my lord.

100
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,340
Have you seen my daughter-in-law by chance?

101
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,580
That wench ran away through the back entrance again.

102
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,790
I felt anxious about it so I left it open and worked around it.

103
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,590
I don't really want to hear that story with all those specifics.

104
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,730
Ah, that wench. That wench has gone to Bo Ri's again.

105
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,000
Let her be alone. She's grieving over a lost friend.

106
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,260
Have you eaten... dinner yet?

107
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,040
If not, would you like to come over to my house

108
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,430
and have some dinner while listening to my story?

109
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm so frustrated that I don't think I can live.

110
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,770
I'm... not... hungry.

111
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,190
Then why are you, this late at night,

112
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,900
wandering around the tavern like you're looking for something?

113
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,050
A widow knows what widower's situation.

114
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,920
Even if you went back home, you'd be lonely.

115
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,100
This person...

116
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,750
By the way, what were you doing at that wench Bo Ri's?

117
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,430
Well. Let's go, let's go. Let's go home and talk.

118
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,340
Then were you two in some kind of relationship?

119
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,910
Let's hurry and go.

120
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,920
Welcome, Your Excellency.

121
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,450
When I see him running and playing with a bell hanging under his chin, I'm not aware the time for sales has passed.

122
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,660
- Please give me the price of one pear... <br> - Are you out of white doves?

123
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:48,240
White doves are so scarce you have to get them from a merchant in Nagasaki, Japan.

124
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,330
They are worth a set of dear antlers.

125
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,250
If you obtain one for me, I'll give you two sets of deer antlers.

126
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,810
Yes, I will. Yes.

127
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,850
The makkuraji* <i> *Mud fish, loach, "rotten apple", "sneaky person"</i>

128
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,500
This is a place which sells mudfish as food for cranes.

129
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,870
I came here for that.

130
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,570
Did you go through the effort of coming all the way here to buy mudfish?

131
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,590
Our household's crane caught and ate all the bugs and worms.

132
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,580
I heard the news that you have slippery guys.

133
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,190
Please be careful. If you get caught by a crane, it's all over.

134
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,240
Do you think you will become a crane yourself? (<i>Joseon official wore robes with cranes embroidered on them</i>)

135
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,060
In my view, you and I are mudfish.

136
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,790
In front of the crane called His Majesty the King.

137
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:43,120
I raised a crane and when the feathers I cut grew back, it flew away.

138
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,630
Don't be so sure how long the State Councillor will remain in your mockery.

139
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,080
Even if my crane were to fly away, how will it go to you?

140
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,120
Hurry and purchase the mudfish and feed your crane.

141
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,090
Have a safe trip, Your Excellency.

142
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't believe he couldn't handle anything properly.

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Where on earth is Tae So and what is he doing?

144
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,480
Tae So, Tae So, you came here.

145
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,240
What is the Head of Shipping doing here so late at night?

146
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,590
- That's what I mean. <br> - I came at the right time.

147
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,430
Take a look at this. It's silver.

148
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,880
Yes.

149
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,500
You finally succeeded in separating the silver from the silver ore.

150
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,970
What did I say? Didn't I say I could do it?

151
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,890
From one geun (<i>a Korean measure of weight</i>) of silver ore, I will get two silver coins.

152
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,550
Now we will be able to trade with countries which used silver as currency.

153
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,220
We must buy weapons.

154
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,650
It's enough to overthrow Joseon.

155
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,500
F-for th-that, c-c-congratulations. But, this isn't the time for that.

156
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,610
Oh, gosh. We can't find the ledger.

157
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,480
I found the concubine of the magistrate, according to what the secretary said.

158
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,670
She never opened her mouth. I tried to intimidate her and she fell to the bottom of the valley.

159
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,900
What is the Chief State Councillor doing?

160
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,160
Another royal inspector was dispatched from Hanyang.

161
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,960
You should have said to search the Flower Valley even if it was all burned down.

162
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,800
Whether you rip it or flay it to death, His Excellency will take care of it.

163
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,900
Whether it is a magistrate or a royal inspector, it doesn't matter.

164
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,550
What we need is the ledger. Do you understand?

165
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,990
I know it is the ledger. The ledger.

166
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,100
Gracious. Thank you for your hospitality.

167
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,790
This, this, this. These days I have hand tremors.

168
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,640
If it's not disrespectful, could I ask my assistant for some help.

169
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,160
Of course.

170
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,060
I appreciate that.

171
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,570
Bang Deuk, come here and serve me.

172
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,360
Kneel. Kneel.

173
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,250
Water. Give me some water.

174
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,660
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,820
<i>If he is truly the nephew of the inspector general, why, of all places, is he here now?</i>

176
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,930
<i>Young Master, please spare me. Do I really have to do this?</i>

177
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,320
<i>Start.</i>

178
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
<i>You are so mean.</i> <br> Oh, by the way.

179
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,790
On my way here earlier, I happened to see someone dead.

180
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:57,190
Dead, you say? Who? Jeez. No way.

181
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,890
But why are you so surprised?

182
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,360
She was a woman from this village.

183
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,890
Oh, a woman. That's right.

184
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,480
It seems she lost her footing after going up the mountain to bathe.

185
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,730
The terrain around this village is rough.

186
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,440
Well, we are discussing how to prevent such unfortunate accidents.

187
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
You've worked too hard today.

188
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,660
<i>More meat jun. Hurry up.</i>

189
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,490
<i>Bite it.</i>

190
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,450
I mean... I am, well, when it comes to criminal matters, I am an outsider.

191
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,690
Ordinarily, when there is a death, don't you examine the body?

192
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,970
It isn't a murder case, so how can I do an examination of the body?

193
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,330
That woman died accidentally.

194
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,530
I see. I didn't know.

195
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,230
Not at all. That can happen when you don't know.

196
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,200
She was someone who was skilled in cooking.

197
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,570
<i>Dig deeper.</i>

198
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,820
But there's something a bit strange.

199
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,830
A woman with child went to take a bath in a cold valley stream.

200
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:30,490
Furthermore, I wonder how she climbed to the top of the mountain with her pregnant body.

201
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,100
But how do you know she was pregnant?

202
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,830
Well, that, I heard people whispering outside the front of the government office.

203
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,440
But how do you know that?

204
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:56,060
Oh? I, too, hear this and that around the village.

205
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,180
It seems there isn't a husband. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

206
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:10,290
Perhaps... It's not like someone killed her and disguised it as an accident.

207
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,490
What are you saying? It was murder?

208
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,100
Doing that is completely absurd. That didn't happen.

209
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,160
Why would someone want to kill a tavern girl of that sort unless

210
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,880
he might have been engaged in an illicit affair?

211
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,230
Ask him about the royal inspector.

212
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,540
By the way, the royal inspector who went to Chungcheong Province to do an inspection

213
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,090
returned as a complete beggar a few days ago.

214
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,380
That couldn't have happened. What do you mean he returned?

215
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding. He couldn't have returned.

216
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,560
Not Chungcheong but Gyeonggi. He was the Gyeonggi inspector.

217
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,800
If we're done, I'm going. It's late.

218
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,320
Customers are leaving.

219
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,390
No, just one meat jun.

220
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,660
Oh my.

221
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,920
Isn't it nice to eat alone?

222
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,020
You could have asked them to bring a table of food for us.

223
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,360
Was that so hard? I'm starving.

224
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,130
I was busy acting. I didn't think of asking.

225
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,930
I...

226
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,930
I dug pretty well.

227
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,400
I need to find evidence.

228
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,040
Are you going somewhere?

229
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,070
The ledger.

230
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,490
Where is the secretary?

231
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,470
That bitch. That bean sized one.

232
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,910
She's a tomboy annoyingly smart for her age.

233
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,500
In case she gets indigestion, I even gave her soy sauce.

234
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,600
I fed my son all the fatty meat.

235
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,730
How many times have I fed her these fresh vegetables to make sure she's healthy?

236
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,540
Yeah, eat.

237
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,200
I need to go and look for the ledger.

238
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,430
But my lord...

239
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,510
What have you been thinking about since earlier?

240
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,430
If you have something to say, just say it.

241
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:53,210
Is there something you want from me?

242
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,650
No. There isn't anything.

243
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,150
What do you mean there isn't anything? If there isn't, why did you ask to come to my house?

244
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,790
Oh my. What is it with men?

245
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:13,200
Why do they act so foxy?

246
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,750
This hellish Joseon, this Joseon is hell. You used to chant that all the time.

247
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,370
You must be happy now that you've escaped.

248
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,030
When you're on the other side, I hope you live in a nice mansion.

249
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,010
Wear only silk clothes, eat to your heart's content, and live happily ever after.

250
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,870
Don't you wander around in limbo.

251
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,430
(Take off your clothes and...)

252
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,730
<i>- Wow, take a look at this. Look.<br>- Ah, what is that man and woman doing?</i>

253
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>You have to know all of this later on.</i>

254
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,070
<i>- I don't have to know. <br>- The drawings here are illustrated so well.</i>

255
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,250
<i>Oh, Unni, this is so perverted. How can you enjoy reading this?</i>

256
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,430
<i>Look at this. Oh my, oh my.</i>

257
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:20,950
<i>- Playing with love, in this shape. <br>- Are you sure?</i>

258
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,500
What is this?

259
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,160
<i>Records of Cheongheong Provincial Office</i>

260
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,980
Look here. Is there anyone back there?

261
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,230
Who is it? Though this place isn't in business anymore.

262
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,580
I am a Chief Clown of Land and Property at Hanseong Ma...

263
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,530
Could you open the door?

264
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,160
Go ahead and pass on.

265
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,310
Look here. A person is talking here.

266
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,270
Look here?

267
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,180
What kind of servant is...?

268
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,050
Oh? What is this? You're those beggars that were begging for food earlier.

269
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,070
We're not beggars!

270
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,890
Ah, you should just leave... But you're shouting! Shame.

271
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,180
Aren't you going to lower your gaze?

272
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,480
Bang Deuk, you scoundrel. Lower your gaze.

273
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,300
- Lower it. <br> - I, a noble, will settle this.

274
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,480
I am a chief clerk at the Capital Bureau and hold the junior 5th rank.

275
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,550
Don't mistake me for a bad person.

276
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,510
Don't make me laugh.

277
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:23,130
Do you think you're the first swindlers I've encountered from Hanyang who go around asking for food?

278
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,460
Huh! You think you can look down on us because we're from the countryside.

279
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,580
If you keep pretending to be such high nobles like this, your life could be over in a second. You understand?

280
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,610
Come to your senses and live on.

281
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,400
If your body is in good condition, you could do some hard labor or something.

282
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,080
What kind of young men are you? Trying to score a meal without pay.

283
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,870
Oh my, this messed up world.

284
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:52,560
I-I right now... I-I right now... My head. I-I right now... Did I get hit on my head?

285
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,880
She hit me knowing I held the junior 5th rank.

286
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,360
My lord, let's just go. We'll end up finding the grim reaper while looking for her belongings.

287
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,140
Stop bothering that tempered girl.

288
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,440
- Hey! <br>- What?

289
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,860
You. You!

290
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,780
What would you do if I really was a noble of high position?

291
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,680
Are you insane?

292
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,400
What I'm trying to say is...

293
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,770
O-o-our lord... what if our lord was really a noble of high position? That's what I'm saying.

294
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,600
That's what I'm saying.

295
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,130
High position, my behind.

296
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:44,060
But... did you really come from Hanyang... sirs?

297
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,420
This isn't my house so there isn't anything to eat.

298
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,090
- Don't worry about it. <br>- What?

299
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,840
No, I said don't-- do not worry yourself over it.

300
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,100
A judge from the Hanseongbu (Capital Bureau) is a very high position, isn't it?

301
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,700
Then you must have passed the test.

302
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,370
Of course. I did pass it.

303
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,180
I did. I passed it with flying colors, only had to take such a thing once.

304
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,850
Our lord didn't really care about government duties.

305
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,950
But the elders in the house kept urging him to take the examination over and over again, so he took it once and!

306
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,040
He got first place.

307
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,330
Wow, first place?

308
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,210
That's right, that's right.

309
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,510
What was the theme?

310
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,690
The theme?

311
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,970
What was it again?

312
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,410
The theme... What was the theme?

313
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,630
You know what 'theme' means, right?

314
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,060
You are beggars, right?

315
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,640
"Gwaneohaejananisoo" <i>( A saying by Mencius)</i>

316
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,350
For one who has seen the sea, the lake does not even appear to be water.

317
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,050
How could small matters concern an individual who has only dealt with larger ones?

318
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,790
It is from Part One of "The Whole Heart" by Mencius.

319
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,110
"Gwaneohaebu" was the supporting theme.

320
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,980
Do you remember now, judge?

321
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,640
That's right! "The Whole Heart" by Mencius.

322
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,580
Ah, I remember it now! I'm glad I taught you.

323
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,450
T-then what about... Hold on, hold on a minute.

324
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,750
My lord.

325
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,530
My lord. My lord!

326
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,810
He looks completely normal.

327
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,790
But now I can see why he lives alone.

328
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,850
This is all because of that girl Joy!

329
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,290
That wench always sneaks out in the middle of the night!

330
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,520
Could you look at this? No, no, not this.

331
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,220
(Petition for the magistrate of Gaehwa Valley)

332
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,440
This is a petition I wrote myself.

333
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,030
I don't know if it's my sloppy handwriting or what. But it looks like I'm about to lose in court.

334
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,370
What do you mean by court?

335
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,990
Are you trying to file for a divorce?

336
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,860
Isn't this not too bad?

337
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,090
But my in-laws are so terrible.

338
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,510
They do nothing but tell lies and there seems to be no hope for me.

339
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,430
So that's why I'm bringing this up.

340
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,410
Since you passed the state exam, your handwriting must be perfect.

341
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,930
If I repeat that, it'll be overkill.

342
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,790
Then, could you fix this?

343
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,730
So that it'll sound more... eloquent?

344
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,670
- So that it sounds eloquent? <br>- Yes.

345
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:06,330
But why are you trying to divorce? Your age is still...

346
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,040
What about my age? What does it have to do with my age?

347
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,740
Ah, you can't really talk to her.

348
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,730
This isn't the place for you to speak!

349
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,390
You jerk! You!

350
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,300
Oh my, my. Look at him. Look.

351
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,290
How dare you act out in front of the noble you serve? Shame!

352
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,980
Did I just get hit?

353
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,370
Yes. Move those lips again, and I'll hit you double.

354
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,230
She hit them twice...

355
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,570
D-did I just get h-hit on the lips? H-hit on the lips. Right on it.

356
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:52,090
So anyway... If you could look over this from here to there, I'd be really grateful! Look over it please.

357
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,920
That girl hit a person.

358
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,410
And nobody cares!

359
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,790
My, no... Bang Deuk!

360
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,910
Oh, he's going off again.

361
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,900
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my. He must have a severe illness.

362
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,970
It is severe. He was fine before then suddenly he gets like this.

363
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,330
Ah, could you move this? Thank you.

364
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,940
Where is she? That harpy!

365
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,720
What time is it right now?

366
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,730
My daughter-in-law won't even come home at this late hour.

367
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,680
Are you just doing whatever you want now?

368
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,890
I'm not your daughter-in-law anymore, since I'm getting a divorce.

369
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,110
Ah, you're the size of a dried plum.

370
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,710
You're really hard-headed. You won't quit!

371
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,420
What is this? Are those men? Those are men, aren't they?

372
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,140
Are you crazy? Huh?

373
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,550
Were you with those men this whole time? I've caught you red-handed, you wench!

374
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,970
Ah! Mother-in-law!

375
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,890
What are you doing?

376
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,720
You have nothing to do with this, so don't speak.

377
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,680
I am this girl's mother-in-law!

378
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,060
And he is... a chief clerk at the Hanseongbu, the Capital Bureau.

379
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,030
- What did you say? <br>- You heard them.

380
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,280
He is a chief clerk at Hanseongbu.

381
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,020
And he has come to help with my petition for divorce.

382
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:24,020
What are you saying? How would a country bumpkin like you know someone like him?

383
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:30,480
You just got caught doing this and that with men, so you're saying all sorts of nonsense!

384
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,750
If he is a chief clerk then...

385
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,270
I am the queen consort, you wench!

386
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,880
I'm telling you the truth. That person is--

387
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,670
Hanseongbu administers the law.

388
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,960
The Capitol Bureau, the Ministry of Justice, and the Office of the Inspector General are the three ministries

389
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,180
usually dealing with disputes between citizens.

390
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,820
Not only within Hanyang, but within the eight provinces as well.

391
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,690
And they can deliver punishment.

392
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,810
Punishment?

393
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,610
If you want to test whether my lord is a real judge or not, do as you please.

394
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:07,580
However, my lord will not easily forget the insolence that was displayed today.

395
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,190
Hurry up! And get on home...

396
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,690
You understand?

397
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,870
What is the reason you are trying to get a divorce?

398
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,610
You just saw what happened, didn't you?

399
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,350
But it's not just because of my mother-in-law.

400
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:44,450
If anything, it's because I want to become happier than how I feel now.

401
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:55,190
Ah, I don't want to talk about this now. I'm only going to be cursed anyway.

402
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,370
If only Bo Ri was alive...

403
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,980
That... woman that you're speaking of. Bo Ri?

404
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,720
Does that woman

405
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,520
happen to be the corpse that was found today?

406
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,080
How did you know?

407
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,330
Oh? We happened to hear about it on our way over here.

408
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,500
It just happened to be a great coincidence.

409
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,680
She was really like a younger sister to me.

410
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,520
She said that she would stand as a witness during my divorce trial.

411
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,840
She said she would come at ohsi.* (<i>11 am to 1 pm</i>). Why would she suddenly take a bath?

412
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,810
Then... She got into an accident.

413
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,630
She promised to be a witness at ohsi.

414
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,210
She's not the kind of person to ever go back on a promise. I don't know why she did that.

415
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,480
<i>It's at least 3 ri to the valley, and considering the stride length of a female</i>

416
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,820
<i>and a pregnant one at that, to even complete a round trip would have taken at least an hour.</i>

417
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,230
<i>However, she was pushed</i>

418
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,670
<i>Bo Ri.</i>

419
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,020
<i>around misi.* (<i>*1 pm to 3 pm).</i></i>

420
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,290
<i>She's not that kind of girl.</i>

421
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,030
<i>It just doesn't make sense.</i>

422
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,100
<i>If she's not the kind of woman to openly break a promise,</i>

423
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,000
<i>she wouldn't have suddenly gone to an inexplicable outing.</i>

424
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,350
Would that woman named Bo Ri have had another reason?

425
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,220
- What if there was someone harassing her? <br> - That's not it!

426
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,730
There's no way that would be the case.

427
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,860
She's was so kind and everyone in the village loved her!

428
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,900
Did Bo Ri have any possessions she left behind?

429
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,210
But this kid is really out here, speaking to me informally.

430
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,050
You need to ask with humility.

431
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,820
Aren't there any? Possessions?

432
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,790
Yeah, she doesn't. I burned them all.

433
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,320
What? Why would you burn them all? They could all be evidence!

434
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,390
Even if you are dead, you have to take the things you used when you meet the Jade Emperor.

435
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,860
But why are you asking this?

436
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,810
Why are you suddenly asking this?

437
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,110
My friend suddenly passed, and I'm so sad I could die.

438
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,480
Ah, that's...

439
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,390
I'm sorry about that... We're curious about something.

440
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,310
So what you're saying is that there's nothing left of the deceased's possessions?

441
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,340
Let's go, my lord.

442
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,950
No, no. My lord.

443
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,240
This is my lawsuit. You said you would take it for me.

444
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,100
I got it. I'll do it for you then.

445
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,670
No, not you. No, m-my lord.

446
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,340
Ah, there. There.

447
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,320
My lord!

448
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,560
How can she be so thoughtless?

449
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,470
And she's violent on top of that.

450
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,590
If that's not enough, she is ingratiating.

451
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,030
If you're a noble, she bends over backwards.

452
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,550
And if you're a commoner, she runs over you.

453
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,900
That's the kind of heart we have while living our lives.

454
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,710
Of course, we are lucky to have met such a great lord to serve

455
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,020
and are living a blessed life.

456
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,330
Let's think. Let's do some thinking.

457
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,460
Even though I crammed for the exam, I won first place.

458
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,190
My brilliant intelligence.

459
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,410
This case. The dead royal investigator is Park Moo Gyeong.

460
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,250
Park Moo Gyeong?

461
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,500
I heard at Hongmungwan that was the name of the senior inspector who was dispatched to Chungcheong.

462
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,030
If that is so, within a few days of his death, his body was swept onto the beach.

463
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,330
If someone did not kill him,

464
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,010
there would be no need for the magistrate to think about hiding the body.

465
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,760
- Gu Pal. <br> - Yes?

466
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,000
- There's a place you and I must go to. <br> - Where?

467
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,250
And, Yook Chil. No...

468
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,560
My Lord Judge.

469
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,240
Instead of this Bang Deuk, would you please investigate the actions of the dead inspector?

470
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,430
Focus especially on the fisherman at the beach where the body was discovered.

471
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,710
It's been a long time since sunset.

472
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,780
I think it will be good if you visit places crammed full of peddlers and fisherman such as an inn.

473
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,780
- That method. <br> - I think our master is like a real secret inspector.

474
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,400
- I am a real inspector. <br> - A real inspector who speaks out of both sides of his mouth.

475
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,810
You always say we will only visit good restaurants.

476
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,540
This will be the only case.

477
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,710
After just this one, I won't do it again.

478
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,080
We will visit famous restaurants as we planned.

479
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,820
You really mean it?

480
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,170
Let's get moving.

481
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,710
Oh, yes.

482
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,390
Barmaid, please! Not four bowls of rice soup, but one bowl of rice wine.

483
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,850
Yes, sit there.

484
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,140
Excuse me. Could I ask you something?

485
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,500
My stomach...

486
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,460
It seems like someone deliberately made a hole in the boat.

487
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,660
They couldn't find the body.

488
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,100
Where did you hear that?

489
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,370
She is asleep like that again.

490
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:29,560
I hid it but you found and ate everything. You said you can't digest it.

491
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,210
I said don't eat salty food.

492
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,530
Let's leave delicious snacks alone.

493
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,230
Blanket. On top of the blanket.

494
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,530
So annoying.

495
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,790
Don't roll too far.

496
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,430
Pillow.

497
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,470
There.

498
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,740
Mother also has gotten old fighting with me.

499
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,240
If he takes away my lawsuit, what am I going to do?

500
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,520
But what is this?

501
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,560
I should have asked the judge before.

502
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,630
Oh?

503
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:00,050
This is... a government office item.

504
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,980
You know Bo Ri.

505
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,880
Sir, you know Hwang Bo Ri, don't you?

506
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,540
She was a good cook and was so kind. You know Hwang Bo Ri.

507
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,240
But... you...

508
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,790
What kind of mischief is this so late at night?

509
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,610
I was sorting Bo Ri's possessions

510
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:43,320
and I found something from the government office.

511
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,610
Yes. That ledger, no...

512
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,940
that item, where was it?

513
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,770
I put it somewhere that only I know.

514
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,400
Can't you bring it right away?

515
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,680
I will give it to you. What use would I have for it if I kept it?

516
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,990
But...

517
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,950
But?

518
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,450
My divorce lawsuit has not been adjudged yet.

519
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,190
That is because you should have brought a witness.

520
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,090
That witness...

521
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,800
is Bo Ri.

522
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,580
Bo Ri wrongfully met an untimely death and

523
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,260
I may not know the reason

524
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,080
why the dead Bo Ri had in her possession a government item,

525
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,000
but have I figured out who left it with her?

526
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,600
What should I do?

527
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,500
I can't believe you're trying to make a deal with me.

528
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,030
What do you want?

529
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,030
I want a divorce by mutual consent.

530
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,600
It's up to me to decide whether to allow it or not.

531
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,360
How dare you interfere with my decision?

532
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,250
Is that so?

533
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,030
If that's what you are doing...

534
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,970
I... I... one...

535
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,740
I'll allow it.

536
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,680
When the sun rises tomorrow morning, the first matter I will handle will be your lawsuit.

537
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,990
If you are going to do that, wouldn't it be good if you wrote your decision in advance?

538
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,160
Give me the item first.

539
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,680
Tomorrow, if you stamp the government seal here,

540
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,680
then I will tell you where the item is.

541
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,590
Thank you for your help, my lord.

542
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,430
But...

543
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,810
I'm curious about Bo Ri, but it seems you aren't at all curious.

544
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:49,430
I told you that I was her best friend.

545
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,650
If you are going to pay your debt to her

546
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,400
for her sincere feelings for you,

547
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,270
then shouldn't you hold a Cheondo ritual for the baby who died in her stomach

548
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,580
so that he will have a safe trip to the afterworld?

549
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,000
Good job. Kim Joy, you did well.

550
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:40,800
I'm sorry, Bo Ri. I couldn't help doing that.

551
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,770
But I, even if I did do that, want to have a fresh start, Bo Ri.

552
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,270
It's a mess. It's a mess.

553
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,390
What should I do?

554
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,400
Halt.

555
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,630
Don't you take a single step.

556
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,550
You, you, who are you?

557
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,360
I am serving a secret royal inspector.

558
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,760
Starting now, I am taking over this case.

559
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,120
Are you okay?

560
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,080
My heart is pounding. I thought I was going to die.

561
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,170
What will just the two of us do?

562
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,810
It's not two.

563
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,120
Even if Yuk Chil comes, it's just the three of us.

564
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,600
If you go to the transportation relay post, you can bring back more.

565
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,110
Transportation relay post? <i> (Government office to provide assistance for dispatching messages and transportation)</i>

566
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Enjoy a snack. It's taffy.

567
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,360
Now, buy taffy!

568
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,100
You have neither a witness nor evidence.

569
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,550
Why were you like that, trusting that wench?

570
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,150
Today it will be over. It's the end.

571
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,840
The heaven-like husband and the mother-in-law. If you knew how she laughed —

572
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,100
It's noisy. Be quiet.

573
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,350
If a case like this is processed for a long time,

574
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,690
it will only make a mess and be of no benefit,

575
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,250
so I will make a quick decision.

576
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,490
That's right.

577
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,310
Of course.

578
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,260
It will be sufficient if you beat her butt several times

579
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,400
and send her home.

580
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,180
Noh Choo Han and Kim Joy, step forward.

581
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,840
Yes, sir.

582
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,370
This is the judgment.

583
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,200
<i>It's Bo Ri.</i>

584
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,580
Secret royal inspector.

585
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,890
Let's go to work.

586
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,980
It's truly a pity.

587
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,430
A man and a woman should meet, respect each other, and grow old without harming each other.

588
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:21,380
Since they have become enemies, engaging in mud slinging and arguing,

589
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,650
there is no point in maintaining the relationship anymore.

590
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,140
No, that can't be.

591
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,590
On the basis of the plaintiff's petition and the testimony of others—

592
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,230
What other testimony?

593
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,290
Shut up. Yi Bang, here, is a witness.

594
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:39,420
If the epic-like stories you told him weren't abuse of your daughter-in-law, then what is abuse?

595
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,980
Of course, Kim Joy was not obedient to her mother-in-law and husband.

596
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,210
Her behavior as she pleased is a mark against her. But to punish it, you have to prove that it was criminal.

597
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,900
Of course, of course.

598
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,000
I have thought about it...

599
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:07,080
In my view, to say that Kim Joy is solely responsible for the breakup of the marriage

600
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,360
is difficult to prove.

601
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,370
So applying Article 2 of the Royal Mandate

602
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,980
I grant the dissolution of the marriage and a divorce.

603
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,370
What?

604
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,140
You two should give up.

605
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,510
- Mother. <br> - Yes.

606
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,650
Yes.

607
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,470
I have an objection.

608
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,540
It doesn't make sense.

609
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,320
It doesn't matter how illiterate I am.

610
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,730
Allowing a divorce when the woman has committed wrongdoing

611
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,180
means she has the right to kick out her husband.

612
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,590
I know it isn't true that the law was made

613
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,450
to take the wife's side.

614
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,230
You said you knew it was funny to say that I was happy to meet my heaven-like husband and in-laws.

615
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,060
You said you would humiliate my whole family, Mother-in-law.

616
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:15,340
So, according to the law, I am a cheap woman even if my husband kicks me out.

617
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,840
Isn't that so?

618
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,150
So you should kick me out.

619
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:24,250
I am such an insolent and arrogant wench.

620
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,410
I apologize for that. Please disown me.

621
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,610
No, that's not it!

622
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,690
It's correct that you are a badly behaved child.

623
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,320
That's what I am saying.

624
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,140
You haven't done as well as you should, but you haven't done anything which deserves being disowned.

625
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,060
Tell the truth.

626
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,220
Up to now you said Kim Joy is disgraceful and you were enraged by her.

627
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,920
Everyone here heard and saw that.

628
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,170
So my daughter-in-law hasn't done anything which deserves being kicked out.

629
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,610
If I didn't do anything wrong, why have you scolded your daughter-in-law?

630
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:04,650
I was hurt for no reason. Can I file a suit against my father-in-law and mother-in-law?

631
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,420
What are you talking about?

632
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,970
What would you do?

633
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,770
Do you stop kicking out your evil daughter-in-law or

634
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:15,990
will you be accused of blaming your daughter-in-law who has done nothing wrong?

635
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,350
I feel sorry for you.

636
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:36,580
Even in this situation, my husband hides behind his mother and doesn't accept any responsibility.

637
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,410
He's waiting for you to clean up his poopy diaper.

638
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:48,360
The one who brought you all the way here to humiliate you is not me.

639
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,960
It is your son, Noh Choo Han.

640
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:01,720
Mother, Mother.

641
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,790
Don't tell me you are thinking of asking your mother to do something in your place.

642
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,670
What is it now?

643
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,390

644
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:44,540
Well, it's nothing...

A secret inspector is here!

669
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:29,700
Out of all days, why did the secret inspector come today?

670
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,920
Am I the only one that sees that the numbers do not match?

671
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,870
Even an illiterate person can see that the numbers are not adding up.

672
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:41,770
There are three more carts filled with documents in the storage.

673

Criminals are never guilty of just one crime.

674
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,700
Listen here, Magistrate Jang Gi Wan.

675
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,390
Forgive me for interrupting but there is something I must say.

676
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,150
Please forgive me for my crimes.

677
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,150
I am nothing but a corrupt magistrate who abused his power.

678
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,990
Why are you confessing when I did not ask?

679
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:19,340
You were going to find out anyway.

680
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,760
Please punish me.

681
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,840
No. Please, take me to Hanyang.

682
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:33,720
The right punishment for you will be decided when I review all the fabricated documents and report it to His Majesty.

683
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,910
Your punishment will not be discussed now.

684
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:42,720
In addition to that, the crime I am charging you of has nothing to do with corruption or abuse.

685
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,640
This is a murder charge.

686
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:57,190
An inspector, Park Moo Gyeong, was investigating the missing grains and military supplies from here.

687
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:01,850
He suddenly disappeared after sending his report.

688
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:08,020
However, after finding his body, you ordered it to be abandoned.

689
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:12,200
Why? To hide the cause of death.

690
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,080
No. I only did that to identify the man.

691
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,220
That is the only reason I brought him here.

692
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,950
Bring him out.

693
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:35,110
This horse pass was found on the corpse.

694
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:39,630
Was the Magistrate aware that the deceased man was an inspector?

695
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,320
<i>My Lord! My Lord!</i>

696
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,120
<i>The dead body of the inspector was found in the ocean.</i>

697
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,570
<i>What?</i>

698
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:50,230
Yes, he was aware of this.

699
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,850
That is a lie.

700
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,390
I was not aware.

701
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,370
Bring him out.

702
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,330
Did you hear what he said in front of the dead body?

703
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,190
Yes.

704
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:13,510
<i>I made sure that we took care of this along with the sunken vessel.</i>

705
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,540
Take care of it?

706
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,200
What exactly is it that you took care of?

707
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,090
Were you talking about sinking the vessel and killing the secret inspector?

708
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,330
No! I did not murder anyone!

709
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,550
Then you must have sunk the vessel.

710
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,480
T-t-that's not how it is.

711
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,130
Do you know what this is?

712
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:51,400
How would I know?

713
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,500
This is black pine, an expensive wood...

714
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,470
It is only used to make vessels that transport products for the king.

715
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,830
It was found where the body resurfaced.

716
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:10,750
<i>In this region, vessels rarely capsize.</i>

717
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,130
<i>It seems as though</i>

718
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,220
<i>someone made the hole intentionally.</i>

719
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,000
<i>Look here.</i>

720
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,460
You feared that all your corrupt deeds would be revealed,

721
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,350
so you killed Park Moo Gyeong who was sent to inspect this region.

722
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,870
Also, to cover this fact, you sunk the vessel.

723
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,760
Regardless of everything, the body washed up...

724
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,730
So you tried to dispose of it!

725
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,550
I swear that I did not kill him.

726
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:49,100
Even if you did not see to it yourself, you covered it up.

727
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,280
You do not need to hold a knife to take a life.

728
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,020
This is an order!

729

732

He cannot take the seal.

733
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,680
Jang Gi Wan is to be put in prison.

734
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,770
Until the investigation ends, no one is allowed to enter!

735
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,990
