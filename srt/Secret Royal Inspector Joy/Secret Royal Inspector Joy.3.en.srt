3
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,104
Your Highness.

4
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:52,784
Did you say that you were scared and lonely?

5
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:56,384
Then having some sweets will definitely do the trick.

6
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,053
You are right.

7
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,623
Having this fruit is easing my anxiety.

8
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:05,453
Then what shall we eat next?

9
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:29,184
- Lift your sword. - I do not wish to.

10
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:30,884
Why not?

11
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:36,593
Do you know how long it has been since we met in private like this?

12
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:39,093
Why do you want to train during this valuable...

13
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,934
Your Highness. If we wield a sword,

14
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,964
we will have to use it against someone at some point.

15
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,703
I am happy with just my kitchen knife.

16
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:57,673
When have you ever had your way in this world?

17
00:01:57,974 --> 00:01:59,173
When have we ever had...

18
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:01,483
our way in this world?

19
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,194
To protect what is valuable,

20
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,664
we must be able to endure what we dislike.

21
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,393
One day in your life, you will have to wield...

22
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:18,463
a real sword, not a wooden sword...

23
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:20,203
to protect yourself...

24
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,904
and what is valuable around you.

25
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,414
Even so, I do not think I can wield a real sword.

26
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,564
Your Highness.

27
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:31,504
Your Highness.

28
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,074
You ought to stay away.

29
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,314
Escort him safely to Mount Gwanggyo.

30
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:38,173
- Your Highness. - What do you mean?

31
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:40,713
Those intruders do not know your face.

32
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,983
Those men could try to harm you on your way there.

33
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,754
I will head to the fortress on my own.

34
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,183
However, we are obligated to escort you.

35
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:49,794
Did you not hear me? This is an order from the Crown Prince.

36
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,393
No, Your Highness.

37
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:54,694
I cherish him...

38
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,634
even more than my real brother.

39
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,703
Protect him as if you are protecting me.

40
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,504
Yes, Your Highness.

41
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,344
No, Your Highness.

42
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:08,874
Your Highness!

43
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:11,613
No! Your Highness.

44
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:15,344
Your Highness! I do not want to go!

45
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:16,683
Your Highness!

46

Your Highness!

Your Highness!

48
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,063
Have you been well?

49
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,183
Your Highness!

50
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,683
Royal death!

51
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:53,854
Royal death!

52

(Remarrying the first guy a divorced woman sees at a shrine)

55
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:11,073
You feared your corruption would be discovered,

56
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:13,303
and killed Park Moo Kyung who was sent...

57
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,204
by the King to inspect the region.

58
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:18,943
And to cover up the fact that you killed him,

59
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:20,844
you sunk the vessel.

60
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:23,214
When the body washed up despite all you did,

61
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:26,553
you tried to dispose of the body!

62
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:29,354
I swear I did not kill him!

63
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:32,964
Even if you did not do it yourself, you assisted or ignored it.

64
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,394
This is my command.

65
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:38,693
Seal the storage, and confiscate the seal!

66
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:40,464
I object!

67
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:47,073
You are the violent sly...

68
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,303
You are Bang Deuk.

69
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,383
- My lord! - Mother!

70
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:56,014
You came at the opportune moment.

71
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:59,354
We shall return to our home now.

72
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,923
You brazen thing.

73
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:04,123
You are impudent to no end.

74
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:07,764
Let her go.

75
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:11,264
You dare use violence in a government office?

76
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:19,743
I hope I am not too late.

77
00:06:21,873 --> 00:06:23,414
As of today, May 5...

78
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:29,584
your divorce is approved.

79
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:40,764
The royal inspector's body washed up?

80
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:44,063
The royal inspector sent to Chungcheong Province...

81
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,604
raided the secret storage room and found out about the vessel.

82
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,933
We had no choice but to destroy evidence,

83
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:51,803
so we sunk the vessel...

84
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:53,503
and drowned the inspector.

85
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,803
Then you should have dealt with it thoroughly.

86
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,313
Why would you come all the way here to tell me this?

87
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:00,743
We gave you half of the taxes we embezzled.

88
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,084
In return for protecting us.

89
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:04,354
You paid Park Tae Seo.

90
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,954
Do not bring me into it.

91
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:09,284
Are you trying to dupe us?

92
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:13,264
You used Park Tae Seo to take what needed, and now you ignore us?

93
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:14,794
Park Tae Seo...

94
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,164
is your son, is he not?

95
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:21,803
How is he my son when he is not on the family tree?

96
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:30,373
My lord!

97
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,183
My gosh.

98
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,294
Get him! He is an assassin!

99
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,823
Mother is over there.

100
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,024
- No. - Now you must...

101
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:22,594
protect her. I cannot.

102
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,003
- Will you grow up? - Mother!

103
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:37,243
My lord!

104
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,044
Today is Dano and the marketplace will be crowded.

105
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,984
If your men clash with them, people will get hurt.

106
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:48,323
Why not have them block all streets leading to the marketplace,

107
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:50,353
and send only a few after him?

108
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:54,364
Listen up. Block all streets leading to the marketplace,

109
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:57,593
and surround the village so the assassin does not get away.

110
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,534
- No one is to get hurt. Understood? - Yes, my lord!

111
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:02,063
- Yuk Chil, Gu Pal. - Yes?

112
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,234
- We will chase the assassin. - Yes, my lord.

113
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,073
If you want, I can lead the way.

114
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:07,803
I know my way around.

115
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,244
Show me the way.

116
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:12,473
You cannot keep up with a horse.

117
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:13,683
Get up.

118
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:23,723
- Giddy-up. - You should have...

119
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,593
prevented him from sending another inspector.

120
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:28,524
You must have stopped him for your safety at least!

121
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,734
Did I sink the vessel?

122
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:35,034
Or did I kill the royal inspector?

123
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,904
What did I do that you would voice concern for my safety...

124
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,303
and threaten me?

125
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:43,914
If you are in trouble, get out of it...

126
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:48,044
by killing the witnesses and all those involved,

127
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,914
or take your own life...

128
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:53,484
so things do not get any worse.

129
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,193
Help me, my lord.

130
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:06,734
What did Tae Seo do to your face?

131
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,774
He should have just killed you.

132
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:16,073
Giddy-up.

133
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,183
Giddy-up.

134
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,254
Oh, gosh.

135
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:41,803
Stop.

136
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,004
Come over here.

137
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,443
- Get out of the way! - Make way!

138
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:54,183
Yuk Chil, Gu Pal.

139
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,284
Do not cause a fuss. It is dangerous.

140
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:59,053
We must move with caution.

141
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:01,124
Let us go.

142
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:33,784
Did we lose him?

143
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:35,183
We must find him.

144
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:39,494
I had the men block the streets. He cannot have gotten far.

145
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:44,593
Just a moment.

146
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:13,864
Watch out!

147
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,173
What was that?

148
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:28,544
- Master Yi Eon! - Gosh.

149
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,053
After him! Get him!

150
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:44,823
Stop!

151
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:50,463
- This way! - Okay.

152
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,504
- Watch out! - He is up there.

153
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,234
He is on the roof.

154
00:12:58,573 --> 00:12:59,573
Gu Pal!

155
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,813
Get him!

156
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:11,284
Stop. I want him alive.

157
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,884
My lord. Over there.

158
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,073
Get him!

159
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,713
This way.

160
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:47,754
Are you all right?

161
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:49,994
Pardon?

162
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:53,254
Oh. Yes.

163
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:59,864
With your quick wit, we got the assassin without harm.

164
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,703
I am more grateful that I could be of assistance.

165
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:07,144
You got me my life back.

166
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:11,644
Thank you so much.

167
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,154
No.

168
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:22,384
You got it back yourself.

169
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:23,994
With your courage.

170
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,264
I wish to reward you.

171
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:33,803
Tell me what you want.

172
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:35,764
Do you mean that?

173
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:39,933
If I may ask for something,

174
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:43,073
I do wish to ask for a favor.

175
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:45,073
What is it?

176
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:50,353
I wish to bury my friend Bo Ri.

177
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:53,884
Do you mean the woman who ran the tavern?

178
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,093
Yes. Although her body was burned without a trace,

179
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:02,524
I wish to bury at least her spirit in a sunny spot...

180
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:04,894
to appease her.

181
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:13,504
You are divorced and will need means to survive.

182
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:16,073
I can submit a paper to have you rewarded.

183
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:17,813
Why not ask for a prize?

184
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:18,874
A prize?

185
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,313
You mean a monetary award?

186
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,453
It is fine.

187
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,624
I think I will regret it for the rest of my life.

188
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,664
I chose divorce, which was difficult to get,

189
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,593
because I did not want to regret anymore.

190
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,664
I want to stop living with regrets.

191
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,004
My lord. We are ready to transport the culprit.

192
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,103
We should go.

193
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:35,017
I will not interrogate you.

194
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,757
Since you were captured, you have failed.

195
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,467
Thus, those who hired you will kill you anyway.

196
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:46,866
Moreover, since you have committed murder,

197
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:50,737
I may sentence you to death.

198
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:54,106
Naturally, I may show mercy if you have a good reason...

199
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,106
that may mitigate your crime,

200
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,677
but you will not turn in the one who hired you.

201
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:01,917
Am I wrong?

202
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:10,826
Am I wrong?

203
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:21,566
Think it over.

204
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:25,066
Are the people you are protecting with your life...

205
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,737
truly worthy?

206
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:33,177
- Lock him up. - Yes, my lord.

207
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,126
They intentionally sent someone who cannot speak.

208
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:52,326
They may send another assassin,

209
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:53,796
so tighten security.

210
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,096
Since we have sent a report,

211
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,066
Hanyang will send us instructions.

212
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:01,677
All of you must guard him until then.

213
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:03,576
Pardon?

214
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:08,017
Are you not doing it yourself?

215
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:12,687
I received a royal decree to inspect...

216
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,157
all of the Chungcheong Province.

217
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,257
I cannot remain here.

218
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:17,356
I see.

219
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,957
I know everything is a mess,

220
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,556
but please do your best...

221
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,397
at your post.

222
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,796
I shall, my lord.

223
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,507
Let us go.

224
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:33,937
But... My lord.

225
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:42,147
The coroner stated that the arrow...

226
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:44,217
was made from an aconite root.

227
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,717
- Aconite? - Yes, that is correct.

228
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,757
Aconite?

229
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,697
Is that not used in the palace as medicine?

230
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,366
Yes. They say it is the best tonic,

231
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:02,566
But if misused, it can be the deadliest poison.

232
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:08,606
The deadliest poison? What do you mean?

233
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:12,776
Maybe people know aconite for its medicinal use,

234
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:15,717
but it depends on how it is used.

235
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:18,017
It can be used as a poison.

236
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,267
I have a boil on my back.

237
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,296
What did you use for the medicine?

238
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:40,306
I used aconite.

239
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:47,116
Since civilians are banned from growing it,

240
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:49,147
it means he is no ordinary man...

241
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:51,316
if he used aconite for his arrows.

242
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,786
Please be careful.

243
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:09,036
My lord, let us go to the next good restaurant.

244
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,866
What are we having next?

245
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:14,606
Aconite.

246
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,106
Aconite?

247
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,576
Is that a dish?

248
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:21,576
Does it taste good?

249
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:24,816
What?

250
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,856
It was a stroke of luck that I came here.

251
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:31,757
We must make haste.

252
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,856
Before word spreads that a secret royal inspector...

253
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:35,457
is in the area,

254
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,497
we will track the movements of the vessel.

255
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:39,626
I will find...

256
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,937
the person responsible for these events.

257
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:45,437
But...

258
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:55,376
Gu Pal. I think we will have to wait to go to the next good restaurant.

259
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:00,816
Darn it.

260
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:03,457
Seriously.

261
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:08,356
They say even pieces of furniture absorb memories.

262
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:20,707
Please forget me.

263
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:34,217
What are you taking?

264
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:37,116
You should be kicked out with nothing.

265
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:39,856
How dare you take alimony? Not a chance.

266
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,957
I broke all of your jars for alcohol.

267
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:45,497
- What? - Because I hated you.

268
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:48,836
It is the final revenge of a runaway daughter-in-law.

269
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:54,437
Why you... You are just openly acting out.

270
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:58,407
How dare you break those precious jars, you witch?

271
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:04,586
Even if you get sick,

272
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:06,917
you cannot afford medicine because of his gambling addiction.

273
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,326
So, do not use this for alcohol.

274
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:14,457
Save it and use it for your medicine later on.

275
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:20,366
How dare you try to lecture your mother-in-law?

276
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,197
You wicked wench!

277
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,237
The alcohol inspectors may come at any time,

278
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:26,667
so do not make any.

279
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:28,136
Why do you care?

280
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:30,007
You say we are strangers now!

281
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,217
Darn it. You say we are strangers now.

282
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:44,187
You disrespectful ingrate!

283
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:47,187
Go back. Since when did you see me out?

284
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:51,927
You... You really cannot do this.

285
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:54,237
I will forgive you for everything.

286
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:57,407
I'll give you one rice paddy patch...

287
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,566
I mean, a tenth of a patch.

288
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:06,846
Come back!

289
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,247
Are you deaf?

290
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:12,586
Does she not hear me?

291
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:18,457
Where are you going?

292
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:21,727
She gave me so much money.

293
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:24,026
How did she save all this?

294
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:28,636
What? He left? Already?

295
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:30,667
Things are a big mess,

296
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:32,507
so he must have much to report to Hanyang.

297
00:23:33,136 --> 00:23:34,407
He left in a hurry.

298
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:39,977
Did he say where he was going?

299
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:42,776
Do not be ridiculous.

300
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:46,247
He is a secret inspector. He moves in secret.

301
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,286
He would not disclose where he is going.

302
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:51,187
I guess not.

303
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:58,366
Maybe I should have accepted the reward when he offered.

304
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:01,767
Anyway, he gave this to me...

305
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:03,267
to give to you.

306
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,106
What is this?

307
00:24:12,546 --> 00:24:14,546
He said to go there.

308
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:26,227
Lady, you wait there.

309
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,457
Do you think we will let you go just like that?

310
00:24:29,556 --> 00:24:31,267
You think you can divorce your husband that easily?

311
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:33,227
Listen. A man and a woman...

312
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:34,767
That hurts.

313
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:40,407
- Hey! - How dare you?

314
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:48,546
Gosh.

315
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,687
That is one pigheaded woman.

316
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:55,556
I foresee a lot of trouble in your future.

317
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:59,187
Goodness. Like mother, like daughter!

318
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:01,596
I heard her mother was taken to Qing,

319
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:03,157
but she did not end her life when she came back.

320
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,727
You are a disgrace to our village!

321
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,947
My dear friend.

322
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:58,217
You did well, trying to live a good life.

323
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:00,856
Good job.

324
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:07,316
Look.

325
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:09,286
Hey.

326
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:11,786
Gosh.

327
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:14,727
Are you leaving now?

328
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:18,427
Child.

329
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:24,967
What is that?

330
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,907
They are the seeds of trumpet creepers.

331
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:31,606
That is a rare flower only the noble families...

332
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:33,447
plant in their yards.

333
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:38,046
But do you know what this flower symbolizes?

334
00:27:40,217 --> 00:27:41,487
Honor.

335
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:45,056
Even the sky in the south...

336
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:48,427
could not stop the flowers from blooming.

337
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:51,596
I will root for you,

338
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:53,796
so you will never have to bend your will...

339
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,296
or lose to this world.

340
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:02,106
Goodbye.

341
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:05,007
- Thank you. - Sure.

342
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:17,556
Jo Yi!

343
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:20,586
You did well putting up with them!

344
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,997
Take care!

345
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,897
You made the right decision!

346
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,636
Never come back here!

347
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:31,767
Fly away freely like a butterfly and live a good life!

348
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,276
Hello, my lord.

349
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:18,017
- Hello. - Hello.

350
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:19,987
- This way. - Goodness.

351
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:23,616
So I heard that there would be a banquet.

352
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:25,886
Why make a fuss about holding a banquet?

353
00:29:26,187 --> 00:29:28,397
We are having a banquet all year round.

354
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:31,697
This time, it is different because there is a reason for it.

355
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:32,897
A reason?

356
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:35,866
Tae Seo successfully pulled off cupellation.

357
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:40,106
Cupellation? That is a method of separating pure gold...

358
00:29:40,507 --> 00:29:42,376
from silver ores.

359
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:44,846
Is that true?

360
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:47,477
Congratulations.

361
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,977
How can the King look down...

362
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:50,947
on this refined method of separating silver from impurities?

363
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:54,417
Tae Seo is much better than the King, is he not?

364
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:55,717
Of course, he is.

365
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:59,187
Getting Joseon under your control will be only a matter of time.

366
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,397
He is indeed pathetic, is he not?

367
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,026
The King...

368
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:07,526
has no idea what is happening in the world.

369
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:09,836
He just sits on his throne in Changdeok Palace.

370
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:12,937
And the only thing he cares about is keeping his throne.

371
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,806
Father. What brings you here?

372
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:28,017
Everyone, keep still.

373
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,596
I need a big crowd...

374
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:37,596
for me to enjoy humiliating him.

375
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:42,737
- Father. - Be quiet!

376
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:46,667
If any of you are stupid enough...

377
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,636
to mooch off him for any gains,

378
00:30:50,437 --> 00:30:52,677
remember what you just saw.

379
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,457
Father.

380
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:03,257
Father.

381
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:07,427
Father.

382
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,856
Father.

383
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:11,667
I was a fool...

384
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:15,536
for giving you a job, thinking that you would be useful.

385
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:19,667
I have no idea what you are referring to.

386
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:23,477
If I told you to steal,

387
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,776
you should have made sure there would be nothing but silence.

388
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,977
Thanks to you who forgot to clean up your mess,

389
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:33,316
everyone in Joseon has heard there was a thief in the south.

390
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:36,616
It will be much better...

391
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:39,886
if I bury you myself. Do you not agree?

392
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:46,826
Father. I...

393
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,737
only did it for you.

394
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,066
I did everything...

395
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:57,336
- you asked without any questions. - I told you not to leave any trace!

396
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:05,487
A secret royal inspector was murdered.

397
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:08,157
And no one knows where the account book is.

398
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:11,757
The next inspector from Hongmungwan...

399
00:32:11,957 --> 00:32:13,987
will try to identify you.

400
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,596
Here is my opinion.

401
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:22,697
Given how the incident unfolded, I want you to take the fall...

402
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:26,407
and disappear from the world with this investigation.

403
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,517
Tae Seo.

404
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:03,937
Do not...

405
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:06,747
disappoint me.

406
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:15,756
My son.

407
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:29,937
I will not,

408
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:32,866
Father.

409
00:33:39,806 --> 00:33:40,906
Get up!

410
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:45,716
Go and kill the secret inspector who was recently dispatched.

411
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:48,716
How can we find this secret inspector?

412
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:51,587
I do not care if he is the secret inspector...

413
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:54,357
or someone who might be the secret inspector.

414
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,897
You can just kill all of them.

415
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:02,667
If I hear...

416
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,806
the secret inspector has returned to Hanyang after his task,

417
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,576
all of you will be dead.

418
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,616
Giddy-up.

419
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:30,096
Whole bars of rice cake are rare and precious,

420
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:31,797
so why are you burning them?

421
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:34,596
Exactly. We should be licking and sucking on them.

422
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,466
Silence. When cooked like this, they taste even better,

423
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,236
crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

424
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:43,877
I think they are nicely grilled.

425
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:46,977
Take out the soft persimmon we got from Gaehwa Valley.

426
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:48,477
The soft persimmon?

427
00:34:58,156 --> 00:34:59,187
Wait.

428
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:01,227
Let me see.

429
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:11,236
Why would you do that?

430
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:13,466
No.

431
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:18,747
Give me that.

432
00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:34,227
Here.

433
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:54,817
See? I am a true gourmet.

434
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:56,277
I said it would be good.

435
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:58,517
Soft persimmons are easy to digest...

436
00:35:58,587 --> 00:35:59,946
There he goes again.

437
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:02,457
He has begun his lecture on food.

438
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:04,687
He is a Hongmungwan scholar who came first in the exam.

439
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:07,286
Do you not just hate every single posh word scholars use?

440
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:09,797
- It has many benefits. - Such a show-off.

441
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:12,127
- Chew on a pebble, you fools! - "Chew on..."

442
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:16,536
Here.

443
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:25,346
Did the Crown Prince like soft persimmons too?

444
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,047
What?

445
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:32,587
Oh.

446
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:39,457
The Crown Prince has been gone...

447
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:41,656
for over a year now.

448
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:44,797
He has not gone.

449
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,036
I see him often even now.

450
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:52,506
Every night, in my sleep,

451
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:58,377
who else would I dream of but him?

452
00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:00,647
Your Highness!

453
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:06,417
You were at my side.

454
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:19,366
He saved my life in the war.

455
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:22,866
I cherish him even more than my real brother.

456
00:37:22,937 --> 00:37:24,536
He was taken to Qing as a hostage,

457
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,906
and when he returned nine years later,

458
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:31,337
I was the first person he asked to see.

459
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,477
- He always... - Your Highness.

460
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:37,417
put me first.

461
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,457
The Crown Prince...

462
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:47,156
protected me.

463
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:52,397
And yet I...

464
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,866
did not do the same for him.

465
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,517
I wish to nap. Wake me in a short while.

466
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:14,957
We must pass the hill before nightfall.

467
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:18,957
Have you decided on the next destination?

468
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:22,857
I will go to Gongjinchang...

469
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:25,696
where the grain from the vessel was from.

470
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,609
This is the way to the pier.

471
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:09,158
Once you get divorced, what will you do?

472
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,598
I will go to Hanyang.

473
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,569
I heard that a large ship sails from the pier to Hanyang.

474
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:15,569
Many nobles will live there.

475
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:18,569
I can make a living by sewing clothes for the ladies.

476
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:20,968
I am pretty good at making clothes.

477
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,908
Can you forget about getting divorced...

478
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:26,908
and just stay with your husband?

479
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:28,748
No. I do not want to do that.

480
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,979
I do not want to live like this.

481
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:36,058
And more than anything, I want to find my mother.

482
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:52,768
Bo Ri.

483
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,239
Even before I get a fresh start,

484
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:59,609
I think I got lost.

485
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:01,178
Giddy-up.

486
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:10,218
Giddy-up.

487
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:23,098
Master Yi Eon. I just do not think...

488
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:25,739
this is the right way.

489
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:30,739
How is this a path for men? It is more like a path for ghosts.

490
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,748
If we take the paths that most travelers take,

491
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:37,178
we are bound to meet a tiger.

492
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:38,288
Are you sure...

493
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,518
this is the right direction?

494
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:41,819
Do not worry.

495
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:45,328
Once we scale this hill, a path will appear.

496
00:40:48,428 --> 00:40:49,759
This is not the right way.

497
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:35,408
Oh?

498
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:47,049
Wow. Bo Ri.

499
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,218
There is a shrine here. Is that not fascinating?

500
00:41:52,158 --> 00:41:53,629
The candles are lit.

501
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:16,578
Yes. Rather than wander in the dark,

502
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:18,118
I should spend the night here.

503
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:24,359
The deities will look after me if I stay close by.

504
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:28,259
Excuse me for intruding.

505
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:43,279
All these signify someone's wish.

506
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:46,109
They must have prayed so eagerly.

507
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:41,768
Fly away freely like a butterfly and live a good life!

508
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:44,439
So you will never have to bend your will...

509
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,509
or lose to this world.

510
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:13,368
You got it back yourself.

511
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:16,598
With your courage.

512
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:20,268
Why?

513
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,609
Why was I thinking about Bang Deuk?

514
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:26,149
What is wrong with me?

515
00:44:27,408 --> 00:44:28,919
It was because I was uncomfortable.

516
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:30,379
I need to lie down.

517
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,578
I need to straighten my back.

518
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:35,419
I must be insane.

519
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:37,218
That is not like me.

520
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:56,038
Found it!

521
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:02,018
Found it. Yes.

522
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,158
We almost died because you have no sense of direction,

523
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:11,118
but we made it. We are alive.

524
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:13,759
I would have killed him if he were not our master,

525
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:14,959
but we are alive.

526
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:16,299
Yes, I am alive...

527
00:45:17,158 --> 00:45:18,158
What?

528
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:20,098
We are alive. That is what matters.

529
00:45:20,669 --> 00:45:21,828
- Run. - Yes.

530
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:23,968
Why you... Stop right there!

531
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:27,538
Why you! Stop right there.

532
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:28,709
Stop running.

533
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:30,509
Stop where you are.

534
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:35,209
What is that? Who is it? What is it?

535
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:36,618
What...

536
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,058
You.

537
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:47,629
Bang Deuk?

538
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:55,739
The secret inspector?

539
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:09,419
So, you were sleeping here?

540
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,018
Alone?

541
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:14,149
I meant to take a short break because I did not know where to go.

542
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:17,489
I guess I was too tired. I fell asleep.

543
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,759
Anyway, my apologies.

544
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,229
Are you all right?

545
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:27,698
Even if you are tired, how could you sleep in the woods?

546
00:46:27,928 --> 00:46:31,069
What if bandits or wild animals had found you?

547
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:33,538
What if you died here...

548
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:37,979
to get a divorce? How could you sleep in front of a shrine?

549
00:46:39,649 --> 00:46:41,549
Thank you for making a grave for Bo Ri...

550
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,049
Yes. A shrine.

551
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,089
That was why.

552
00:46:50,888 --> 00:46:52,029
Pardon?

553
00:46:52,288 --> 00:46:53,489
I see.

554
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:56,098
Do you not know?

555
00:46:56,629 --> 00:46:58,359
What is it this time?

556
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:01,569
This is why I have no choice but to teach you.

557
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,468
Why? What do we not know...

558
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,569
Yes, my lord. What is it that we do not know this time?

559
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:10,739
There is a custom in Joseon. If a divorced woman...

560
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:14,779
stands in front of a shrine,

561
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:18,578
the first man she meets there must marry her.

562
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:21,288
It is called "seupcheop".

563
00:47:21,618 --> 00:47:22,718
- Seupcheop? - Seupcheop?

564
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:25,428
If the man is unwed,

565
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:27,859
he must marry the divorced woman.

566
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,299
If he had already wed,

567
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:33,468
the divorced woman must become his concubine.

568
00:47:35,368 --> 00:47:36,569
I never knew that before.

569
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:39,538
Yes, that is correct. I have heard of it before.

570
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:44,439
Were you waiting here to find a man to marry?

571
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:47,578
What? No. That is silly.

572
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:58,759
I was not. I was just resting.

573
00:47:58,828 --> 00:48:00,129
I didn't even think of seupcheop.

574
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:03,058
The ink on my divorce decree has not even dried yet.

575
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:06,968
True. And you do not need to abide by that seupcheop custom.

576
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,669
How dare you speak of such things?

577
00:48:10,339 --> 00:48:11,799
If you break a custom,

578
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:15,339
you may be taken and beaten by the department of justice.

579
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,779
Is it that serious?

580
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:21,509
I did not know about that.

581
00:48:21,948 --> 00:48:23,919
- Laws really are scary. - Yes.

582
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:25,518
Gosh.

583
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:29,288
Thank goodness no one passed by all this time.

584
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:32,658
Wait. If no one passed by until now,

585
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:34,788
- that means we were the first. - Yes.

586
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,828
Was Master Yi Eon the first person you saw when he tripped and fell?

587
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:37,899
Yes.

588
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:40,328
What?

589
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:42,899
He said the first man she sees...

590
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:45,038
- must marry her. - No.

591
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:46,709
That is not it. Listen.

592
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:50,609
Then what? Are you saying...

593
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:56,848
Master Yi Eon has to marry her or something?

594
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:58,948
Is that what it means?

595
00:48:58,948 --> 00:49:00,649
- Sorry. - What gibberish.

596
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:04,959
He must have lost his mind.

597
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,928
How absurd.

598
00:49:15,468 --> 00:49:16,799
My stomach hurts.

599
00:49:19,308 --> 00:49:21,038
That is so funny.

600
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:44,799
What did I do wrong?

601
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:46,828
Seupcheop?

602
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,598
No.

603
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:53,209
- No... - Please.

604
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,768
It is not even a law.

605
00:49:54,768 --> 00:49:57,308
How could something like this happen?

606
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:01,078
- I cannot get married. Please. - No.

607
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:02,578
I just met her.

608
00:50:02,578 --> 00:50:05,279
- It does not count. I will not. - No.

609
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,388
- This does not count. Yes. - I pray...

610
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:09,058
It does not count.

611
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:11,989
How many times is he going to repeat himself?

612
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:13,959
Please.

613
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:16,928
Let us say it did not happen. We did not see each other.

614
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:18,029
What do you say?

615
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:21,268
But we saw. How could we lie like that?

616
00:50:21,629 --> 00:50:25,468
You said earlier, "If you break a custom,"

617
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:27,669
"you may be taken and beaten"...

618
00:50:27,669 --> 00:50:29,138
"by the department of justice!"

619
00:50:30,178 --> 00:50:31,408
Did you forget?

620
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,408
And he is an official who is paid by the government.

621
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:35,049
He cannot break the law.

622
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:40,319
I was talking to myself. Why were you eavesdropping?

623
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:44,718
Please.

624
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:46,558
Why me?

625
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:48,888
Why were you lying there?

626
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:54,169
It was not like I wanted to be here.

627
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:56,569
I was simply resting briefly.

628
00:50:57,098 --> 00:51:00,638
I fell asleep, so I didn't hear you coming.

629
00:51:10,578 --> 00:51:14,149
Why did you have to walk in front of the shrine?

630
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,589
This is the woods, so you could have walked anywhere.

631
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:18,788
Why did you step on and trip over my leg?

632
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:22,259
Who was the one who came at me, screaming, when I was asleep?

633
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,129
That was because...

634
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:32,308
Fine. I apologize for stepping on your leg.

635
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:36,908
However...

636
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,448
I do not want to get married!

637
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,689
I even took the difficult state exam...

638
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:54,129
just so I could avoid getting married.

639
00:51:54,428 --> 00:51:56,799
My grandmother said to either get married...

640
00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:00,229
or take the state exam, and went on a hunger strike for several days.

641
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:02,098
That was why I chose the lesser of the two...

642
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:03,998
that I hate the most.

643
00:52:04,498 --> 00:52:07,169
- That was true. - Yes.

644
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:08,939
Do you understand...

645
00:52:09,578 --> 00:52:13,549
what I hate more than anything in the whole world?

646
00:52:20,518 --> 00:52:21,589
Then...

647
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:25,558
do you know what I hate more than anything in the world?

648
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:32,299
Not my forced marriage or the difficult divorce.

649
00:52:32,428 --> 00:52:35,229
It is marrying a pompous, egocentric man...

650
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:36,698
that I am not attracted to at all!

651
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,178
Did she just call him pompous?

652
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:46,808
And egocentric.

653
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:49,618
Fine. I understand.

654
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:52,178
Let us never meet again.

655
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:54,348
Fine. Why would we ever meet again?

656
00:52:54,348 --> 00:52:55,759
- My point exactly. - My point exactly.

657
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:04,058
- My lord! - My lord!

658
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:05,399
- My lord! - My lord!

659
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:28,848
Master Yi Eon!

660
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:30,658
Look at them!

661
00:53:30,718 --> 00:53:33,788
Do not move. If you do, all of you will be dead.

662
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:37,359
Take everything in their bags.

663
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:39,998
And tie them with that band.

664
00:53:40,328 --> 00:53:41,428
- Okay. - Okay.

665
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:43,299
Who are you?

666
00:53:44,098 --> 00:53:46,709
My gosh. What a nasty temper. Goodness.

667
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:54,248
How can a mere girl be so strong?

668
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,819
She must be much stronger than a man.

669
00:53:58,149 --> 00:53:59,989
Do you know who this man is?

670
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:06,558
- He is... - Do you think we are fools?

671
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,558
He must be your husband.

672
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:10,698
- No! - No!

673
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:14,729
What? Of course, he is.

674
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:17,739
I heard you talking about seupcheop in front of the shrine.

675
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:18,968
Was I the only one?

676
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:20,868
- No. I heard it too. - I heard the whole thing.

677
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:23,009
- We are your witnesses. - I heard it too.

678
00:54:23,879 --> 00:54:24,879
See?

679
00:54:24,939 --> 00:54:27,549
All of us here heard what you said. Do not play dumb.

680
00:54:28,178 --> 00:54:29,379
You know what?

681
00:54:31,678 --> 00:54:35,189
I will let you be buried together since you two are married.

682
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,158
Let us bury them quickly and leave.

683
00:54:38,218 --> 00:54:39,259
- Okay. - Okay.

684
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:42,658
- How dare you? - Wait.

685
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:44,399
- I did not move. - Hold on.

686
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:46,729
- Let go! - Let go of me!

687
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:06,149
It will be better if you tell them who you are.

688
00:55:06,218 --> 00:55:08,448
No. If I tell them, my investigation will fail.

689
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:10,018
You were never so serious about this investigation.

690
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,459
We are all about to die here.

691
00:55:11,518 --> 00:55:13,658
Take out your horse tally and yell at them now.

692
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,328
I cannot reveal my identity that easily.

693
00:55:15,998 --> 00:55:18,158
- To get to the bottom of... - First, reveal who you are first.

694
00:55:18,229 --> 00:55:20,029
And then you can get to the bottom of this case.

695
00:55:20,169 --> 00:55:22,698
Then why would we hide our identity when we go on inspections?

696
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:25,569
Hey.

697
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:34,209
Hey. Did you eat?

698
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:36,618
Yes. How is your oldest?

699
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:39,118
Gosh. My oldest is growing a lot.

700
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:41,388
What are you doing down there?

701
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:42,859
I am digging a hole.

702
00:55:43,518 --> 00:55:44,959
So I can bury them.

703
00:55:45,018 --> 00:55:48,729
You know, they were talking about seupcheop in front of the shrine.

704
00:55:48,788 --> 00:55:50,428
So I am going to steal their stuff.

705
00:55:51,158 --> 00:55:53,899
By the way, where are you going? It is pretty dark now.

706
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:56,598
Are you on your way to catch the secret inspector like before?

707
00:55:58,399 --> 00:56:00,368
Do not get so chatty. Cover it up thoroughly.

708
00:56:00,808 --> 00:56:02,408
So the bodies do not slide down when it rains.

709
00:56:02,808 --> 00:56:05,638
If you see those who ran away from the market, bring them to me.

710
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:07,948
- Let us go. - Okay.

711
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:09,448
Good luck.

712
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:11,549
Gosh.

713
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:13,589
- Why are you so heavy? - Come on.

714
00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:15,748
Gosh.

715
00:56:17,118 --> 00:56:18,359
It is all done.

716
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,209
- Are you all right? - Do I look okay?

717
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:34,538
I am not okay either.

718
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:39,808
I think they are really going to bury us alive.

719
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:42,848
What do we do now? Come on, do something!

720
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:45,348
Gosh.

721
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:47,919
Look at him. Our lord has no plan.

722
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:49,489
I am about to die as a bachelor.

723
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:50,919
"Our lord"?

724
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:52,388
Why should we care about him when we are about to die?

725
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:53,529
We had the worst luck with him.

726
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:55,658
- You are young. Bachelors... - Who cares about him now?

727
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:57,129
- I have not gotten married yet! - He is not my lord anymore!

728
00:56:57,198 --> 00:56:58,759
Be quiet! Let me think!

729
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:05,368
Hey.

730
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:09,538
You!

731
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,739
- Gosh. - Oh, no!

732
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:21,189
What just happened?

733
00:57:24,658 --> 00:57:26,288
Was my yelling that scary?

734
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,359
A tiger. A tiger must have shown up.

735
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:31,029
No. I did not hear any sounds of animals.

736
00:57:31,098 --> 00:57:32,698
Then what is it?

737
00:57:32,768 --> 00:57:34,368
You are scaring me even more.

738
00:57:35,229 --> 00:57:37,268
We must get out of here first. Let us cut the rope first.

739
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:38,768
Can you reach inside my robe?

740
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:41,408
You must do it.

741
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:44,109
Put your hands under my rope, and you will find a ruler.

742
00:57:44,178 --> 00:57:45,279
Hurry.

743
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:48,709
We do not have time. Pull it out now.

744
00:57:50,518 --> 00:57:52,989
In that case, pardon my reach.

745
00:57:59,888 --> 00:58:01,589
I got it.

746
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:03,029
I got it.

747
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:07,198
I remodeled it just in case.

748
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:08,998
All right. Open it.

749
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:10,239
Okay.

750
00:58:11,439 --> 00:58:12,439
- Gosh. - A knife.

751
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:14,739
- All right. - I knew it.

752
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:17,339
You fools. Do you know the most pointless thing to do...

753
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:20,049
in this world? It is worrying about Master Yi Eon.

754
00:58:20,109 --> 00:58:22,819
Exactly. I knew he would be fully prepared for this.

755
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:23,979
Right, my lord?

756
00:58:25,218 --> 00:58:27,189
- Are you all right? - Yes, I am all right.

757
00:58:27,248 --> 00:58:28,248
Let us go now.

758
00:58:28,649 --> 00:58:29,819
My lord.

759
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:32,089
What about us?

760
00:58:32,788 --> 00:58:35,459
Why must I? You said you no longer cared about me.

761
00:58:36,198 --> 00:58:37,498
It hurts.

762
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:39,598
Come on, my lord. Just this once.

763
00:58:42,698 --> 00:58:44,038
You make things worse.

764
00:58:48,408 --> 00:58:50,609
You are almost there. All good.

765
00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:53,649
Nice!

766
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:55,879
Okay.

767
00:58:56,218 --> 00:58:57,518
Goodness.

768
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:00,848
- Let us go. - All right.

769
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:04,859
Oh, no.

770
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:09,089
Hey!

771
00:59:26,248 --> 00:59:27,279
Gosh.

772
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:45,828
Grab it now.

773
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:49,299
Come on. Hurry.

774
00:59:50,698 --> 00:59:51,799
Climb up now.

775
00:59:54,368 --> 00:59:55,669
Here. Hurry.

776
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:03,979
Gosh.

777
01:00:10,118 --> 01:00:12,118
Your grip must be stronger than that of a man.

778
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:14,759
Master Yi Eon's hands are as delicate as flowers.

779
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,129
Try carrying the water jug, doing laundry,

780

farming, and cooking.

781
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:19,998
How can I not have a strong grip?

782
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:21,368
The chores sound pretty demanding.

783
01:00:21,468 --> 01:00:23,739
You punks. Stop talking. And help me up!

784
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:24,968
Help me too!

785
01:00:57,299 --> 01:00:58,339
Gosh.

786
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:08,279
- Master Yi Eon. Look over there. - What is wrong?

787
01:01:13,518 --> 01:01:14,549
