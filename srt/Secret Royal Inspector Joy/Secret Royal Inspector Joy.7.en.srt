<i>Secret Royal Inspector &amp; Joy</i>

<i>The characters, organizations, place names, and incidents in this drama are fiction and not related to reality.</i>

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,020
<i>Wolfsbane's tuberous root</i>

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,380
It looks delicious. Looks delicious.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,870
On top of that, it has a special seasoning of sesame and chungjang.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,450
It's well seasoned.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,830
She's a woman with cruder eating habits than I thought.

11
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,630
Ah, but don't you think that you're too much?

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,450
Even though it was a plan, how could you completely fool us about the presence of the "Hidden Protectors?"

13
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,530
If I told you beforehand, you would not have been able to hide it.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,730
Ah, even if that's so!

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,660
I thought I would die from shock.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,250
I apologize.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,160
Are you all right?

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,250
That's why I told you to eat slowly and chew thoroughly.

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,210
Don't do that. Can you just pat my back in a downwards motion?

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,290
Pat your back... In a downwards motion?

21
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,490
Yes. Like this, downwards.

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,050
Downwards...

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,520
Ah, what are you even doing? Are you doing it?

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
I am doing... it.

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,690
They say that people who have eaten meat before know it well.

26
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,670
But you're gobbling down the meat as if you've never even seen it before.

27
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,520
Look at how you look now.

28
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,850
And I made this for you too.

29
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,050
How could a girl, like me, coming from a woman's house ever taste lean meat?

30
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,850
This is the first time I've seen so much meat on my plate before.

31
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,330
Even if that's so!

32
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,900
What is there to do, when you spit out the food you were chewing?

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,090
It spread all over my food, so I cannot eat it anymore.

34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,110
You should eat it.

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,990
What is this?

36
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,520
It's taffy.

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,860
Taffy?

38
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,390
<i>Like I am all alone in this world</i>

39
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,450
<i>Am I the only one like this?</i>

40
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,730
<i>Do you know?</i>

41
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,490
Is he crazy? Why are there handles on the taffy?

42
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,460
<i>As we comfort each other</i>

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,590
<i>It'll all pass.</i>

44
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,330
<i>If I close my eyes</i>

45
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,040
They're not there.

46
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,710
Where is Hong Seok Gi?

47
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,440
Chief of Shipping or whoever it is, tell him to come out now.

48
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,760
Oh, the judge is not here.

49
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,420
So he left? Where is his house then?

50
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,260
That's not it...

51
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,160
He was arrested by the Secret Royal Inspector that was transferred here.

52
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,130
The royal inspector?

53
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,360
He's being held at Soyang.

54
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,890
Why are you telling me this now?

55
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,190
I told you several times before...

56
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,780
Did you?

57
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go.

58
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,650
Eh?

59
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,660
My Lord, are you not feeling well?

60
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,890
Shut it!

61
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,530
Kids.

62
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,530
You were well, right?

63
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,800
Oh my, what should we do?

64
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,420
Ah, these lovely ppungmul* musicians are here on the master's birthday. <br> <i> (ppungmul: traditional Korean percussion instrument)</i>

65
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,520
They were able to come congratulate him.

66
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,760
Our stubborn master from Hanyang

67
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,060
has the means to beat you people into fishing bait.

68
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,700
It all means that if you do well, you'll stay alive.

69
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,440
If you can't, you're as good as dead.

70
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,640
And so, whether you can make it out alive or dead.

71
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,030
- You have to play the game to find out. <br>- That's right!

72
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,970
The bird that cries in the morning

73
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,990
cries because it is hungry.

74
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,950
The bird that cries in the evening

75
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,930
cries because it misses its beloved.

76
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,960
Sister, you must be happy. Sister, you must be happy.

77
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,090
Because the men are so strong.

78
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,900
The sister is happy.

79
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,960
You and I will play together.

80
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Day time or night time

81
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,840
<i>You and I...</i>

82
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,200
Those people are having a festival in the village

83
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,460
like it's the start of an era of peace.

84
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,230
They're celebrating someone else's birthday in someone else's house. What kind of festival is that?

85
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,600
Let them enjoy themselves while they can.

86
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,210
I'll kill them all soon.

87
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,830
Tae Seo, what are you going to do about your hand?

88
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,600
It won't interfere with killing those things at all.

89
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,870
You bring the landmines. I will be lighting the fuse. <br> <i>(moktong: landmines buried underground)</i>

90
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,230
Are you perhaps, going to use that here?

91
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,100
Hey, punk, if something goes wrong, the entire White Ghost Pass could go poof.

92
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,160
As long as I can catch the royal inspector, I'm willing to do more.

93
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,860
Hurry.

94
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,250
Is there anything that I cannot do?

95
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,960
I wonder what kind of woman will take me. I wonder!

96
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,940
Ayy ayy...

97
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,690
She's so easygoing with her laughter.

98
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:42,060
Oh, do you see this? Do you see?

99
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,710
My Lord, you have to learn how to play too.

100
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,420
What... What are you saying?

101
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,900
- What are you telling me to do? <br>- Oh, everyone is doing it.

102
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,950
So right about now...

103
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,420
Oh my, just go.

104
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,600
My Lord, you should try doing this too. Like this.

105
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,550
Ah, your hands. Big movements, like this.

106
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,650
Like this.

107
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,080
Are you all right?

108
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,430
Oh my, you almost ran into big trouble.

109
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,050
One wrong move, and these two lips would've met.

110
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,170
Really. How would you live without me? It's a relief, right?

111
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah, yeah. That's right, thanks.

112
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,040
Thank you. Yeah.

113
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,380
When did you start caring about me so much?

114
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,660
Yes, yes, yes.

115
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,920
Huh? What? My lord. My lord, I'm here.

116
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,300
My lord, my lord!

117
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,840
- Don't try any tricks on me. <br>- And you know how to use that?

118
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,300
Did I not mention that my previous occupation was being a mountain thief?

119
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,110
Your previous occupation is that of a criminal and now you're a swindler. How impressive, huh?

120
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm not much different from corrupt officials like you, don't you think?

121
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,720
My Lord, if you do this...

122
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,070
That's Hong Seok Gi, right?

123
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,930
This thing has to die, so that my father can sleep peacefully.

124
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,200
I was right to kill him, right?

125
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,160
You're r-r-r-r-r-r-ight!

126
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,180
Chief of Shipping, yes.

127
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,050
Who are you?

128
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:35,520
I-I-I-I-I-I-I a-a-am n-nothing.

129
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I don't know the reason why I'm being held here.

130
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,610
I don't have any relations to them!

131
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,030
That girl wanted to hurt the Chief of Shipping.

132
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,280
She must have some deep grudge against him.

133
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,360
- She did? <br>- Yes.

134
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,470
What are you doing? Catch her!

135
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,580
Hurry up and catch her!

136
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,100
Hey.

137
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,860
Hold on.

138
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,810
Slow down.

139
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,650
Let's have some fun.

140
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,490
Hyungnim.

141
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,490
Should I take the back bones, add in the leftover perilla leaves, and make some soup?

142
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,120
It's time for the kids to start getting hungry.

143
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,500
- Why? <br> - Gokdu wants to push back the payment deadline by five days.

144
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,870
They say poverty is the enemy.

145
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,910
Trying to make money and live on can be so unfair.

146
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,270
- I'll go with you. <br>- Make sure you look after the children.

147
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,890
It'll do you good, not to cross that line.

148
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,930
I'll do that.

149
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,350
- What are you doing? <br>- If you took the products, you should pay the price.

150
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,960
One way or another. That is how we trade.

151
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,680
We asked for five days' time, didn't we?

152
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,820
Something came up in White Ghost pass.

153
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,730
We will pay the price.

154
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,040
Five days, you say? I don't live betting on such a far future.

155
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,470
Pay up by tomorrow.

156
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,290
If not, this exchange never existed.

157
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,730
Do you think I will sell all that gunpowder at the market?

158
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,500
Or should I deliver it to the Ministry of war?

159
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,300
If that's not it either, you shouldn't treat me so disrespectfully.

160
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,550
There is no other place in Joseon that will buy such large quantities of gunpowder besides Gokdu.

161
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,300
Chief Kang, you shouldn't be looking down on me either.

162
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,380
Besides me, there is no one else in Joseon who can supply

163
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,020
the large quantities of gunpowder that Gokdu wants.

164
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,260
I will give you three more days.

165
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,710
Hey, if you've destroyed our goods,

166
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,960
you're going to have to reimburse us!

167
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,630
I have given advice on our exchange.

168
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,020
That is not free.

169
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,650
Leader, we have a message with the conditions.

170
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,730
<i> East India Trading Co., Portugal </i>

171
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,760
A ship that goes from Portugal to Nagasaki is loaded with rifles.

172
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,170
Just how many times have people attempted to murder me?

173
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,690
Gosh, I should just confess everything.

174
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,960
This is why humans shouldn't commit sins while they're alive!

175
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,470
You must be exhausted. Why don't you leave after a day's rest?

176
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,940
Joining when we should join and leaving when we should leave is our life motto.

177
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,000
Now that we've had a good round at this game, we must leave in search of a new one.

178
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,130
Gwang Dae, what are you doing?

179
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,890
Yes!

180
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,460
My Lord.

181
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,160
- I will take my leave. <br>- You're leaving so quickly?

182
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,850
If a nearby bureau knows there was a commotion here,

183
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,420
they will come out soon for an inspection.

184
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,730
Before then, we'll leave quietly.

185
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,520
Whenever we're in danger, you've saved us time and time again.

186
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,870
I feel so supported, yet apologetic at the same time.

187
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,890
I can't put all my feelings into words.

188
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,010
That was the crown prince's order.

189
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,600
No matter what happens, we should protect you, My Lord.

190
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,170
How do you make a living?

191
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,700
We make enough to eat. Don't worry about us.

192
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,530
How about you re-enter the palace?

193
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,760
I do not want to.

194
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,980
It is already an overwhelming sin to live longer than the crown prince.

195
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,170
How could I aim for anything higher?

196
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,110
Our last duty is to protect you, My Lord,

197
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,780
as long as we live.

198
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,370
That...

199
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,800
is the least we can do to show our loyalty to His Highness.

200
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,010
And the treatment records you requested last time... <br> <i>(Naeuiwon: royal physician)</i>

201
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,360
Did you find out?

202
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,650
Around the time of death of the Crown prince,

203
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,780
the register of royal physicians also disappeared,

204
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,130
so we couldn't find it.

205
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,180
Fortunately, from all the time I worked at the Crown prince's palace,

206
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,630
I kept the prescription with me.

207
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,460
Bai lian and rhino horn should not be administered with wolfsbane.

208
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,110
A 1/10th nyang of wolfsbane <br> <i>(nyang: ancient unit for weight, 37.3 grams)</i>

209
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,370
to be administered every meal? Isn't that overdose?

210
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,750
Also, I request that you, My Lord,

211
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,010
find the answer to this question.

212
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,010
I will surely find it.

213
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,850
I will do my best to find it.

214
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,070
What? Is it already over?

215
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,860
There is no fun. Again.

216
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,450
Run.

217
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,210
Run.

218
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,070
Catch her well.

219
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,790
Why are you alone? Where did Yook Chil go?

220
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,450
I don't know where he is or what he is doing. I haven't seen him for a while.

221
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,020
Why are you alone? Where did Kwang Soon go?

222
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,790
That's right. I have not seen Kwang Soon in a while.

223
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,030
Goo Pal, go and get some sleep.

224
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,010
I'll sleep after looking into the ledger some more.

225
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,910
I'll go then. A day feels like three days.

226
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,310
Go back.

227
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,390
Who is there?

228
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,570
Is somebody there?

229
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,430
Who is that? Is it Kwang Soon?

230
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,860
Kwang Soon.

231
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,320
Mother-in... it's Mother-in-Law.

232
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,810
It must be exhausting, but don't let your guard down till the late hour.

233
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,570
-Yes. <br> - Yes.

234
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,490
Where is she going?

235
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,170
Why is she going there?

236
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,890
Where is he going?

237
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,490
Where are you going? There is no road there.

238
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,580
She does not have a light either.

239
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,220
How will she come back if she gets lost?

240
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,650
Stop there.

241
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,560
Can you not hear my voice?

242
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,350
Isn't this... wolfsbane?

243
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:19,550
<i>Bai lian and rhino horn should not be administered with wolfsbane.</i>

244
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,370
Mother-in-Law!

245
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,480
- Mother-in-Law? <br> - Mother-in-Law, I am Joy.

246
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,870
Hey hey... don't go there.

247
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,850
Mother-in-Law!

248
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,330
Mother-in-Law!

249
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,460
I said not to continue going.

250
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,090
Caught you.

251
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,840
Sp-spare me.

252
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,440
Now it's over.

253
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,970
They say you'll run into your worst enemy at the worst place.

254
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,770
Ah, this bad wench. How did she know about this place?

255
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,020
Aigoo! Aigoo!

256
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,820
Aigoo! Aigoo!

257
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,810
Ah, oh my gosh. Aigoo!

258
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,720
Mother-in-Law, I've finally caught you!

259
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,340
Let me go, you girl.

260
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,300
Aigoo, everything is broken because of you! It's broken!

261
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,260
Aigoo, what happened?

262
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,770
Aigoo, what do I do?

263
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,910
Are you all right?

264
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:43,320
Oh, aren't you the secret royal inspector?

265
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,340
Did you come all the way here for an inspection?

266
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,290
What do you mean by "inspection"?

267
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,250
By the way, what are you doing here?

268
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,030
Really... why are you doing this?

269
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,770
Not letting me feed my kid a lump of rice,

270
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,840
why on earth are you doing this?

271
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,050
My kid?

272
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,750
Say it properly.

273
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,600
Chu Han is here.

274
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,370
What is he doing here?

275
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,240
Mother, do you even know what kind of a place this is?

276
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,400
Do you even know how dangerous...

277
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,100
I am indebted. What do you want me to do?

278
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,150
Just because it is Chu Han, would you want him to

279
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,300
be dragged to the middle of this mountain and be treated like a slave?

280
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,900
So are you saying that you are working in the mountain?

281
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,340
There is no work.

282
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,180
Anyway, I don't know anything.

283
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:07,060
I-In this place, many leopards and foxes also live.

284
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,950
W-Wild... wild boar too.

285
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,490
First, we need to go down. Follow us.

286
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,670
I don't want to come. I cannot.

287
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,980
We are saying it's dangerous.

288
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,530
I cannot.

289
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,090
No, what are you going to do if some wild mountain animal attacks you in this darkness? Really!

290
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,790
My Chu Han...

291
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,830
Keep quiet!

292
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,390
Did you sleep well?

293
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,320
Even if I don't tell, you know where you are, right?

294
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,710
Then tell me now. What's your relationship to Head of Shipping Hong Seok Gi?

295
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,640
Who are you to be there?

296
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,100
There is no relationship.

297
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,750
It's something I don't care about.

298
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,060
Then why were you guarding them?

299
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,440
Hong Seok Gi was captured by the inspector punk, so...

300
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,090
Are you some minion of his?

301
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,130
Secret Inspector's minion?

302
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,610
I-I don't know that at all. I haven't even met him in my life.

303
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,170
Then why are you here?

304
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,180
If you don't know both Hong Seok Gi and the secret inspector.

305
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,440
So what is your identity?

306
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,170
What is it?

307
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,140
You are with the inspector, right?

308
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,960
Hey.

309
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,070
It was Lord Tae Seo's order.

310
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,340
There is Lord Park Tae Seo, who has taken over this area.

311
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,590
The Lord... Lord found the Head of Shipping old man faster than the secret inspector and locked him there.

312
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,200
I was there because of Lord Park Tae Seo's order.

313
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,000
Tae Seo?

314
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,440
If you caught him, you should have killed him or something.

315
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,190
He was whining and made me come all the way here.

316
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,790
This is not helpful.

317
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,340
Then, you would know where the mountain hideout is, right?

318
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,640
Take me to the mountain hideout.

319
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,050
<i>Lord Yi Eon and Joy are at the hideout now... </i>

320
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,440
You don't want to?

321
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,270
I will guide you there.

322
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,710
I know the den where Lord Tae Seo's mine is.

323
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,450
Mine?

324
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,980
Yes. I will take you that way.

325
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,270
Something like that was there?

326
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,350
Wow, my Tae Seo!

327
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,610
Pull her up.

328
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,950
Why is this so dirty?

329
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,940
Had I known earlier, I would have washed this also.

330
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,370
Take them off now.

331
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,230
If I quickly wash and hang it, it will dry up by tomorrow morning.

332
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,710
The fact that we are already in a kind of relationship where we smell each other's feet...

333
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,290
isn't it a little too rushed?

334
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,730
<i>Let me go. Why the hell!</i>

335
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,940
<i>I'm going!</i>

336
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,100
I am talking here now. Who is there?

337
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,170
<i> I cannot come now. </i>

338
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,820
Aren't they Lord Yi Eon and Joy?

339
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,450
<i> I wonder what's going on? </i>

340
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,150
In such situations, not going there is the wisest choice according to my experience.

341
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,560
It might be his official duty.

342
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,090
He won't kill anybody. He is such a learned nobleman.

343
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,140
It looks like he killed.

344
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,650
K-Kill.

345
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,260
Take off those socks.

346
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,510
I want to die, really.

347
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,470
- Ah, wait. <br> - Remove them quickly.

348
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,430
Oh, I am sorry. I took off too much.

349
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,970
Mother.

350
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,630
Please kill me.

351
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,820
What is your son doing in the mountain?

352
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,350
Be it manual labor or other chores, he is probably doing whatever he is ordered to do.

353
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,840
He has been sold to the gambling debt.

354
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,190
Then, what about you, Mother-in-Law?

355
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,530
Why were you dragged here?

356
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,340
My Chu Han was being dragged by unknown people in the world.

357
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,840
How could I send him off alone?

358
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,480
It was my choice to follow him and at least help with the kitchen work.

359
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,560
So you secretly...

360
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,890
No, until when is that man going to be able to eat at least one meal by himself

361
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,940
and not make you work this hard?

362
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,960
So what is up there?

363
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,300
I really don't know about that.

364
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,030
There's a mine, and they supposedly dig out something from there.

365
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,710
I can't even go up there myself.

366
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,380
Nobody can enter that place without permission.

367
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:11,880
If I leave one rice ball on the mountainside...

368
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,480
<i>The hideout's chief Ji Maeng Su partners with officials in the three southern provinces</i>

369
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,000
<i>and stores all the stolen goods and grain there.</i>

370
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
<i>Using the huge amount of money made from sales</i>

371
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,840
<i>of these items and the wine made from the grain in the eight provinces,</i>

372
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,980
<i>I hear that they operate Park Tae Soo's smelting plant in White Ghost Pass.</i>

373
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,040
<i>White Ghost Pass smelting plant?</i>

374
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,490
<i>I heard at the plant, silver is extracted</i>

375
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,910
<i>from silver ore from the mines in White Ghost Pass.</i>

376
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,770
Silver ore.

377
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,780
All I know is that Chu Han came down and took it.

378
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,830
So even when there was so much chaos, you were hiding?

379
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:50,450
But what do I do if this punk skips his dinner today?

380
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,480
Aigoo! My kid must be waiting.

381
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,550
But still, your son was captured.

382
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,760
Did you not hear anything from a distance?

383
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,770
Tell me whatever you know.

384
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,610
That.. Chu Han said... he will light up the fire...

385
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,440
Light up the fire?

386
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,370
Let's go.

387
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,090
How many people live there?

388
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,670
I'm asking about the thugs who guard that place.

389
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,480
There is no need for guards.

390
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,620
Ah, also...

391
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,970
I heard that they have something that explodes when you step on it.

392
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,340
Why do they have a lot to hide?

393
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,340
From tax extortion to wolfsbane,

394
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,750
just what is the ultimate goal of these people?

395
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,590
You should leave this place immediately.

396
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,950
Despite gambling debt, it is illegal to kidnap and restrain a person.

397
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,360
I will take care of those people.

398
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,820
Please make sure you save my son Cho Han.

399
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,490
Mother-in-Law.

400
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,760
Take this with you.

401
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,050
What about you?

402
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,900
I don't have anyone to show filial piety to.

403
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,700
Take care of yourself.

404
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,100
The road is rough, so walk slowly.

405
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,140
Why are you giving me this money?

406
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,740
The last time too,

407
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,320
you gave a lot of money.

408
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,560
Save it for later.

409
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,180
Shouldn't you give it to me when I meet you again?

410
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,350
Take care of yourself too.

411
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,300
I am sure you will figure it out.

412
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,370
Aigoo, my son Cho Han, what do I do?

413
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,430
Aigoo, becoming a mother...

414
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,920
Aigoo, my fate.

415
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:14,050
♫ Come back on third month of next year.

416
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,790
♫ In the back hill, a dead tree

417
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:26,010
♫ Leaves unfurl, petals blossom

418
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,770
- My Lord. <br> - Are you waking up only now?

419
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,340
Where are we going?

420
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,390
The sun is up and I want to figure out the entrance to White Ghost Pass.

421
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,640
I have to at least know where that mine is to bring the miners.

422
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,340
Starting at this dawn... I will get ready then.

423
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,280
No. It will be faster for me to go alone.

424
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,830
Let's go together. What if there's a trap? That's big trouble.

425
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,510
A trap or whatever,

426
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,170
it's only information passed down in whispers.

427
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,090
If it wasn't seen by someone,

428
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,330
it is most probably a rumor not the truth.

429
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,240
No, you can't. Where do you think you are going alone?

430
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,340
I'll go to the nearest Provincial Office and request backup right away. Just write me a letter.

431
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,220
It's no use. The bureau is on their side.

432
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,660
- Then take at least Yook Chil and Goo Pal! <br> - No need.

433
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,780
They will only drag me down. Just me alone is enough.

434
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,670
- Don't be like that. Let's solve this safely! <br> - Oh ho!

435
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,230
What's with all the commotion? I'm just going to confirm the location.

436
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,310
- Why? Are you worried about me? <br> - Yes. No.

437
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,330
I-It's not like that...

438
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,570
Me! Yes, I'm worried about myself.

439
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,920
Because I've been involved with you all this while, as soon as I open my eyes, there is either an unexpected fatal crisis

440
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,880
or some misfortune in the middle of the night. Just how many times have I gone through this!

441
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,580
That's why I'm saying I will go alone.

442
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,630
If that's the case, then I will go too.

443
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,750
No, you stay here

444
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,380
and look for the ledger with Gwang Soon.

445
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,800
That will help me.

446
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,090
Ah, I'm telling you, you can't!

447
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,020
My Lord, then what about us?

448
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,790
You both have something to do.

449
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,800
We have to report this illegal hideout as soon as possible.

450
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,060
- You both— <br> - No way, the size...

451
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,710
Rescout the size of this place.

452
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,990
From over there...

453
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,120
to there.

454
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,190
He is making a hassle.

455
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,580
- I almost said a swear word. <br> - I said it.

456
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,430
- What? <br> - What, what?

457
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,310
Didn't you just drop the honorifics?

458
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,710
He wasn't speaking informally; he swore.

459
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,580
- And now you're dropping the honorifics too. <br> - No, I'm not.

460
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,970
- So we have to size up this place, huh? <br> - Size up, you say.

461
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,080
Ouch!

462
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,990
Hey!

463
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,830
Are we going the right way?

464
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,280
We have to walk only a little more.

465
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,580
<i>If I go that way,</i>

466
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,680
<i> Lord Yi Eon is there.</i>

467
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,580
This way.

468
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,820
Hey!

469
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,180
What is with you? Why are you changing the route suddenly?

470
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,720
Are you sure about this?

471
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,850
Yes, I was confused. This is the right path.

472
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,240
Looks like this is correct.

473
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,920
Let's go.

474
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,440
Lord Lee Bang!

475
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,800
- Pal Sun? <br> - You're right.

476
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,200
But, Lord Lee Bang,

477
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,250
why are you in this part of the town?

478
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,730
And why do you do that every time we meet?

479
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,910
You always hug me closely like this!

480
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,310
Why are you shouting Lord Lee Bang!

481
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:10,550
What if others hear that? Don't say my name so recklessly.

482
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,730
Why?

483
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,310
- If I can't call you Lord Lee Bang, then... <br> - Silence, silence, silence.

484
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,700
But what are you doing here?

485
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,350
I heard rumors that a mother and son were sold off to resolve a gambling debt,

486
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,800
is this that place?

487
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,620
Don't even get me started about that.

488
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,600
The royal inspector found me

489
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,750
and sent me on my way back alone.

490
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,320
Royal inspector... what royal inspector?

491
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,330
That guy... who made my Chu Han a divorced man

492
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,000
That... Where...

493
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,240
Where... where is he now?

494
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,190
Here? He's here now?

495
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,500
Around here?

496
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,640
No, not here, up there...

497
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,300
He's there at the mountain hideout.

498
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,890
Because you're alive, we meet again.

499
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,170
If only you stay alive,

500
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,610
we'll meet again some day, right?

501
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,360
When would that be?

502
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,340
The royal inspector is at the mountain hideout? How did she know that?

503
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,130
Even the marine inspector is dead.

504
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,600
What's the reason I should risk my life like this!

505
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,230
If I'm not careful, I might even be blamed for the murder.

506
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,800
Rather...

507
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,860
Should I report this?

508
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,340
Oh! This sort of man is just the worst!

509
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,480
Just doing whatever he wants, not listening to anyone else, and just making others worry.

510
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,410
What are you murmuring about?

511
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,160
If people see you, they would think you're his wife.

512
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,540
What wife? I'm just...

513
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,210
So...

514
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,610
I just want to catch the bad men who killed Bo Ri and punish them.

515
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,130
To do that, I need the royal inspector. That's all.

516
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,280
That's why I'm mad at the royal inspector for just going off and doing whatever he wants.

517
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,250
Okay, okay, let's first look for the ledger.

518
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,620
We have to find that to catch the criminals, right?

519
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,610
No... I just hate losing time for no reason.

520
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,370
I just hate being misunderstood like this for no reason, even more.

521
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:21,260
And I'm just mad at the royal inspector for acting like this.

522
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,730
Makes me mad, really!

523
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:26,970
Isn't that right? He really doesn't listen to anyone!

524
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,080
<i>Look carefully for what items were traded,</i>

525
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,740
<i>the places where trading took place, the names of the traders,</i>

526
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,040
<i>whether or not an official seal is on it, and maybe any names you recognize.</i>

527
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,420
Ah...

528
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,880
Seeing that they were trading such high quality items, this must a public tribute ledger.

529
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,940
These are records of slave trading, since there are names of children here.

530
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,710
These bad people... they colluded with officials to do all the bad things that could possibly be done.

531
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,680
Which government office, which provincial officials... they are all there, right?

532
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,840
Yes. With this, we can catch all the officials who colluded with Cha Mal Jong.

533
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,520
Then, you should look through the ledgers written in Chinese characters.

534
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,350
I will look at the ones written in colloquial language.

535
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,570
By the way, how did you learn to read?

536
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,620
It was hard for me to get a hold of even the basic Chinese character text.

537
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,440
Ah, th-that...

538
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,460
Anyway, you're amazing; you've learned it on the side.

539
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,520
Yes, that's right.

540
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,510
Where are you from?

541
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,980
From the way you speak, you don't seem to be from Choongchung Province.

542
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,000
I... that...

543
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,350
My hometown is in Gyungsang Province, but I came from Hanyang.

544
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,980
Hanyang? Wow.

545
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,660
Then, you must know a lot about Hanyang. Ever since I was born, I've never been to Hanyang.

546
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,490
I heard that in Hanyang, your valuables can be stolen right before your eyes. Is that true?

547
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,480
Even with your eyes open like this, they can just—

548
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,570
But your hometown is in Gyungsang Province. How did you come here from Hanyang?

549
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:31,680
Oh, well, I don't know why I'm here either.

550
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,970
Originally, I was going to bid farewell and go to Hanyang, but by getting involved with the royal inspector...

551
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,520
Ah, really, what am I doing up here in the mountain?

552
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,480
But because of Bo Ri, I cannot just leave.

553
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,340
Really, you just can't foresee how things will turn out in life. What can you do, right?

554
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,110
- Grain tax ledger! <br> - Yes, that.

555
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,190
You have to have the grain tax ledger to find the one who killed Bo Ri...

556
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,630
But that...

557
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,690
I cannot find the ledger related to grain tax.

558
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,890
Maybe that bastard Cha Mal Jong Cha took it.

559
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,840
No, no, no, it could be mixed in there somewhere.

560
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,260
Let's first look through here,

561
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,180
- and search the mountain hideout some more. <br> - Yes, let's.

562
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,950
This has all Chinese characters. You should take a look.

563
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:31,060
I have a lot more to look at, Joy.

564
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,440
This one also has Chinese characters.

565
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,990
I am angry till the end.

566
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,790
Ah, there is no route also on this side.

567
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,080
Why did they set a trap here? Who will even come this way?

568
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,460
The secret inspector is under that.

569
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,670
Path or no path, install these anywhere that leads up the mountain.

570
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,580
Make it so that he cannot come up.

571
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,860
We have to buy some time until the silver cools.

572
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,790
To sum up, work meticulously.

573
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,800
It's better to bury it rather than losing it to others.

574
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,940
To sell this silver, Tae Seo has worked so hard, didn't he?

575
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,960
This ba-bastard!

576
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,790
It works well.

577
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,310
Install as many and as densely as possible,

578
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:50,010
So that no matter which way he comes from,

579
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,420
the moment he takes one step in, he becomes a hedgehog.

580
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,920
You, you... you try doing that hedgehog thing!

581
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,660
Come here. Today, you...

582
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,780
You, come here! This...

583
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:10,500
If you're busy, do what you have to. I'll do this.

584
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,390
Or you could apply Wolfsbane to the arrowheads.

585
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,820
Tae Seo, looks like you were serious when you said you wanted the royal inspector dead.

586
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:25,160
Still, isn't it better to just catch him alive?

587
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,370
We are not inspector hunters, you know.

588
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,880
Is it okay to kill all these people?

589
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:40,970
<i></i>

590

<i>Secret Royal Inspector &amp; Joy</i>

591

592
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,840
<i>Today, the number of people going to the peak is especially large.</i>

593
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,480
<i>Is this my mistake? I'm asking you, is this my mistake?</i>

594
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,350
<i>You'll regret this. You should send people to check the situation!</i>

<i>Gunpowder in a rural village?</i>

596
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,200
<i>I guess these people are not just petty thieves.</i>

597

<i>Our honorable guest has arrived, huh?</i>

598
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,520
<i>Where are you going?</i>

599
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,720
<i>Which bastard dares to drop the honorifics at me?</i>

<i>If you mess with me, you're all gone, like poof.</i>
