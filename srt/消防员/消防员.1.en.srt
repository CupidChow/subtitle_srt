1
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:07,500
The rapid development
of global industry has caused

2
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,750
electronic waste to rise
to 35 million tons per year

3
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:16,000
Since the Basel Convention in 1989,

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,500
most developed nations
have enacted environmental regulations

5
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,625
The average cost of processing
one ton of electronic waste is US$700

6
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,250
Criminals recycle it
at the low cost of US$25 per ton,

7
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,167
smuggling the waste to
Asia and developing nations for profit

8
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,833
Most of these wastes are
transferred to and disassembled in Hong Kong

9
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:42,875
Many multinational corporations participate,
the DOE Group being one of them

10
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,292
It was the best of times

11
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:58,042
it was the worst of times...

12
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:01,625
But the one thing we HongKongers

13
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,167
are best at is adaptation

14
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,083
Churchill once said...

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,500
Success is not final

16
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,625
How do we retain our advantage

17
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,250
The key is...

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,083
Our vision

19
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,542
In this new age of

20
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,833
ever-increasing logistical demand...

21
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,000
We have to seize the opportunity at hand

22
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,333
The customs clearance procedures

23
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,208
are now more streamlined

24
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,542
Foreign contianers for re-export are

25
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,000
only subject to spot checks

26
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,792
Our daily throughput will soon

27
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,583
equal all of Asia put together

28
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,792
Riding this momentum

29
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,500
and remaining Asia's number one

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
This is our goal

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you

32
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,417
Cheers

33
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,167
To our flourishing business

34
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,000
Cheers

35
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,375
Mr. Fan, are there any concerns
that people will take advantage

36
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,583
of the simplified customs clearance procedures

37
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,292
Will Hong Kong become a smuggling port

38
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,208
Can this really propel us
to be the world's best

39
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,042
I'm confident in Hong Kong

40
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,500
Man-made calamities

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
can be more terrifying than natural disasters

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,417
(This story is a work of fiction)

43
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,167
Don't worry, firefighters are here to save you

44
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,167
Stay calm, we're going to give you oxygen now

45
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,000
Relax

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,458
Slowly. You'll be able to go out soon

47
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:45,917
Be careful

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,833
5 minutes 26 seconds

49
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,125
Still the fastest in the division!

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
A fleeting life,
to have had you was enough for me

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,458
To share beer and peanuts with you,

52
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,542
in the dead midnight hours

53
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,583
Laughing at each other until the sun rises

54
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,875
I've never spoken the words in my heart

55
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,458
for I get too shy

56
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,625
How could other people understand

57
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,208
It's ready!

58
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,042
Great!

59
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,500
I booked a restaurant after work

60
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,125
for Chainsmoker's last day

61
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,625
Let's give him a proper send-off

62
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,917
Thank you, sir!

63
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,542
I'm leaving my hose in your hands

64
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,750
Hold it well

65
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,125
Don't worry, Chainsmoker

66
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,625
I'll take good care of it

67
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:36,958
Rookie

68
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,333
You haven't even seen any action

69
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,042
since you've arrived

70
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,750
He's a lucky charm

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,958
No business is good business

72
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,625
Most importantly,

73
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,208
don't be stubborn in a fire

74
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,208
Ask for help when you need it

75
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,208
Yes, sir

76
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,292
Do you understand what I'm saying

77
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,625
If I said I wanted the baby,

78
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,750
would you change your mind

79
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,500
If you take desk duty,

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll keep it

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:06,750
Madam

82
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,375
Another lovers' quarrel

83
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,333
I'm going back to work

84
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:16,458
Hey

85
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,750
Kit Sir made dessert

86
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,875
Come have some

87
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,292
Yes, Madam

88
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,417
Don't make a huge fuss

89
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,125
Madam, have a seat

90
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,917
Madam

91
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,000
This is too much

92
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,208
Here

93
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,625
They're so shy...

94
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,875
They're obviously hot for each other

95
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,167
How hard is it to say the word

96
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,750
It's pretty hard

97
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,750
They're both the stoic, macho type

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Say that again!

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The table's all dirty

100
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,750
Excuse me, Madam

101
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,750
Our guest today

102
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,417
should be no stranger to you all,

103
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,583
former Financial Secretary...

104
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,042
and curently an environmental pollution expert

105
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,333
Dr. Simon Fan

106
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:12,250
Welcome

107
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,417
Thank you

108
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,417
I'm Simon

109
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,542
Fan Wai Lap

110
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,792
You left politics 10 years ago

111
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,625
then went to earn 2 doctorate degrees

112
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,208
Your research was on the effects of

113
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,958
electronic waste on the environment

114
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,458
Your new book calls on all

115
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,917
to reduce electronic waste

116
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,083
Are you really only trying

117
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,792
to reduce waste

118
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,833
Or are you making up for simplifying

119
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,500
the container transit inspection procedures

120
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,292
10 years ago

121
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,792
Do you feel it was your fault

122
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,292
Madam

123
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,250
What are in the containers

124
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,750
Customs declaration says scrap metal

125
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,833
What kind of scrap metal

126
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:01,958
No idea

127
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,292
With the new procedures,

128
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,875
customs won't inspect every container anymore

129
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,750
We just know they're

130
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,833
headed for Cambodia

131
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,958
White flames!

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,542
Run!

133
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,833
Hang on, Sis!

134
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,792
Hang on, Sis!

135
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,167
Sis!

136
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,458
Sis, don't let go!

137
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,167
Sis!

138
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,083
You bastard!

139
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:06,792
Kit!

140
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,833
Don't!

141
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,042
You got us firefighters killed!

142
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,542
Don't be impulsive
If it weren't for scum like you,

143
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,583
my sister would still be alive!

144
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,417
Go away!

145
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,583
I want my sister back!

146
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,167
Give me back my sister!

147
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,542
Give me back my sister!

148
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,875
Was it a problem with policy

149
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,958
My job was

150
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,625
to develop our economy

151
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,042
All I can say is...

152
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,583
I could've done better

153
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,583
Your decision

154
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,125
indirectly led to an accident

155
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,292
Do you feel like you owe an apology

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,292
It's been 10 years since I've left politics

157
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,167
I don't think

158
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,500
I owe anyone anything now

159
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,375
Not even to the firefighters

160
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,042
(Eileen)

161
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,917
(Mr. Fan, Grandma really wants you there)

162
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:28,625
(7 at Shun's)

163
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,583
(Don't be like last time. It's just a meal)

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,750
Uncle, smile!

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,167
Give us a smile!

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
Smile!

167
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,500
He's here

168
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,250
Daddy

169
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,750
Sit over there

170
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,458
Mom

171
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,583
Sit

172
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,542
Time to eat!

173
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,542
Here

174
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,208
Thank you

175
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,625
Thank you, Daddy

176
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,500
I'm fine

177
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,542
- Eat first
- Okay

178
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,333
Have this

179
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Thanks

180
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,500
Eileen...

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,083
Best of luck with your studies

182
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,542
Come home soon

183
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,000
Have a safe trip

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,792
I can't see you off tomorrow

185
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:35,167
So call us as soon as you land

186
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,750
What's tomorrow

187
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,000
I didn't tell you

188
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:44,833
No

189
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,792
I thought I told you

190
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,375
You changed your flight

191
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,958
Why didn't you discuss it with me

192
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,042
What's there to discuss with you

193
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,042
This is my family's business,

194
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,292
not yours

195
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,500
Exactly, it's your family

196
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,042
So leave it at your home

197
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,458
We haven't taken a family photo

198
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,958
Get the manager to take it for us

199
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:22,625
Okay

200
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,875
I arranged your flight for next week

201
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,375
Why'd you change it

202
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,792
I arranged your flight for next week

203
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,208
Why'd you change it

204
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,167
Because, this

205
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,750
isn't what I want

206
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:50,833
Why don't you ever

207
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,917
ask me what I want

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,833
We agreed on next week

209
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,208
I want to decide this time

210
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,625
I want to choose the major I want

211
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,917
We agreed on next week, that's that

212
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:04,958
Hey

213
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:08,542
Where are you going

214
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,083
To Grandma's!

215
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,875
Is that OK with you

216
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,500
Be careful!

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,583
Stop resenting Simon

218
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay

219
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,250
Mom...

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,958
Don't worry

221
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,958
Don't think about it too much

222
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,125
Have tea with your Mom after work

223
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,375
You're always drunk

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,167
Doing this everyday won't get you rich

225
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,875
I'll show you something worth your while

226
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,500
I hit the jackpot this time!

227
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,625
Don't say I don't treat you two well

228
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:35,833
Look

229
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,042
Isn't it pretty

230
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,750
Where did you find it

231
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,583
Take me there

232
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,083
In northern Philippines, Typhoon Murphy

233
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,333
brought heavy rain, triggering mudslides,

234
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,958
killing at least one

235
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,250
and injuring thousands

236
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,000
Murphy's diameter is nearly 900 km

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,833
It is moving on a northwest path

238
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,500
and may become a Super Typhoon

239
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,500
Who's there

240
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:23,750
Let's go

241
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,500
Let's go

242
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,000

Any updates on Tai Tong Village

259
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,292
We only got one call

260
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:09,083
No casualty or entrapment report

261
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,583
It's just a small fire

262
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,833
Don't be so nervous

263
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,583
I'm not nervous

264
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,917
I'm thrilled

265
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,833
Kid, what's so thrilling about a fire

266
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,208
Firefighting is my dream

267
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,542
I've been waiting for this day

268
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,208
There's been an error

269
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,042
The correct location

270
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,208
is the recycling yard northeast of the estate

271
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,292
Get ready

272
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,625
What's going on

273
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,292
What's with all these fire trucks

274
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,000
That one

275
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,333
- This one
- Hop on!

276
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,208
Come this way!

277
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,083
Chainsmoker, check the perimeter

278
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,125
Get a lay of the land

279
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:10,750
Yes, sir

280
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,875
Po, hook up the fire hydrant

281
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,500
- Yes, sir!
- Everyone, breathing apparatus on!

282
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,333
Yes, sir!

283
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,125
The containers are affecting visibiity

284
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,458
The fire's too big for No. 1 Alarm

285
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's raise itto 3

286
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,083
Better play it safe

287
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:25,750
All right

288
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,000

293
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,000
Copy

294
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:40,500
Madam

295
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,125
He's the supervisor

296
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,500
How many people in the yard

297
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Have they all made it out

298
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,958
They're all out and accounted for

299
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,917
Do you have a floor plan

300
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,542
We found this in the office

301
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,458
What's placed here

302
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,000
Scrap paper and metal, appliances

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And here

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,167
Same

305
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,042
He's all yours

306
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,042
How's it looking

307
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,958
The yard is the size of Victoria Park

308
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,500
There's a northeast entrance,

309
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,875
but it's blocked by shipping containers

310
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,958
This is the only exit left

311
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,833
That supervisor was lying

312
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,750
There may be toxic materials inside

313
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,750
Shall we push the cold zone

314
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,542
back by 100 meters, Madam

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,500
Don't get antsy in there

316
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Safety first and focus

317
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,375
Play the long game!

318
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,125

Focus

327
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:12,542
Water on!

328
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,750
Move the hose! Aim it at him!

329
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,333
Yes, sir!

330
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,250

Back up

341
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,125

00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,042
Fuel truck

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,833
Everyone fall back!

344
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,542
Fall back!

345

Are you all right

349
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,917
Get everyone out first!

350
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,000
Is everyone out

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,250
I don't see BA Team 2

352
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,500
Calling BA Team 2, do you copy

353
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,500

How about Water and Finger

357
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,875
They're still inside

358
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,000
Finger do you copy

359
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,250

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,167

I'll request backup

375
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,833

388
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,083
at a recycling yard on Queen's Hill

389
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,750
Firefighters have been deployed

390
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,000
The cause of the fire

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,083
has yet to be disclosed...

392
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,875
(Chief Executive)

393
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:34,083
Hello

394
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,333
Chief Executive

395
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,042
Simon Simon

396
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,208
there's a No. 3 Alarm Fire in Fanling

397
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,750
ESMC has been activated

398
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,417
Radiation's been detected

399
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,625
Radiation

400
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,875
I'm working in Europe with Chief Secretary

401
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,125
I won't be there until tomorrow

402
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,167
Cecilia is the interim Chief Executive

403
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,417
She's calling the shots

404
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:51,542
Okay

405
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,875
It's an emergency

406
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,917
Get everyone for a meeting in 30 minutes

407
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,625
Dr. Fan...

408
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm Financial Secretary Fong's assistant

409
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,833
Someone will brief you soon

410
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,958
We have an emergency

411
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:05,958
The government wants to appoint you

412
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,208
as expert consultant

413
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:07,875
Simon

414
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,917
We really need your help this time

415
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,417
I understand. Goodbye

416
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,333
The report

417
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:27,500
Wait here

418
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,583
Sir

419
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,917
Dr. Fan

420
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,292
Get in or lead the way

421
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,375
Sir BA 2 Water calling Kit Sir

422
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,542
Water calling Madam

423
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,000
Madam, come in!

424
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,000
Doctor, where are you going

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,167
To the fire

426
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,292
You're putting me in a bind here

427
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:46,250
I'm responsible for taking you back to HQ

428
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,000
I've read the file

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,583
If I'm just reading it again at HQ,

430
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:50,583
what's the point

431
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,083
Chapter 1, 18A of the Emergency Response Code

432
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,625
It is the expert consultant's duty to make

433
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,417
immediate assessments to the relevant parties

434
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,958
Your report was last updated

435
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:01,958
at 907 AM

436
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,083
What time is it now

437
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,625
It's 1002, an hour later

438
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,958
If I'm not there,
my assessments wouldn't be immediate

439
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,042
You have to be in HQ

440
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:10,000
so departments can consult you

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,125
That's where you're most effective

442
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,958
We can call HQ and

443
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,542
join meetings that way

444
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,875
I can answer any queries they have

445
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,208
I drafted the Emergency Response Code

446
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,375
a decade ago

447
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,208
Reciting is useless

448
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,083
Learn to improvise

449
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,000
Call your boss, I'll talk to her

450
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,125
You're afraid of getting in trouble, right

451
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,125
I'm not afraid

452
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,625
- I'm saying if
- I'm not afraid of getting trouble!

453
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,125
Doctor!

454
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,958
We don't have permission

455
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,500
Sir, what do you want

456
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,125
This area is closed to the public

457
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,167
EMSC has activated

458
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,792
Response Level 3

459
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:06,750
I'm the expert consultant

460
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,750
Business card

461
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,750
The government sent us to survey the scene

462
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,750
Officer 28852 here

463
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,583
The government has sent surveyors

464
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,750
They're going in

465
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,750
Mild injuries wait here

466
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,833
Cross match, emergency operation ready

467
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,125
Copy

468
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,500
Sorry...

469
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,333
Please wear your IDs first

470
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,250
Thank you

471
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,250
The injured is conscious

472
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,042
Burns on left leg and face

473
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,042
Excuse me...

474
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,708
How many have Acute Radiation Syndrome

475
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,292
I have at least 5 with nausea

476
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,333
Further tests need to be done before

477
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,375
we can confirm

478
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,833
Get the doctor's number

479
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,792
I need constant updates

480
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,167
Can I have your number

481
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:23,917
Okay

482
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:31,708
Hey

483
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:32,708
Hey!

484
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,333
The situation here isn't

485
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,250
as simple as you think

486
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,792
I think there's more than one radiation source

487
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,292
Carry a Geiger counter

488
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,125
along with you

489
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,833
Firefighters are working, step aside

490
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,958
Do you hear that

491
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,875
I hear it

492
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,542
I'll go there

493
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,250
I'll go that side

494
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,792
No way in on this side

495
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,125
There's a way here

496
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,750
I'll go up

497
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,750
Your leg's hurt

498
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,000
Stay out here!

499
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,292
Will you be fine by yourself

500
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:35,292
I'm okay

501
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:41,250
Water!

502
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,208
Is someone there

503
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,833
Help!

504
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,250
Calm down

505
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,667
Firefighters are here to save you now

506
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:58,708
Here!

507
00:28:58,708 --> 00:28:59,750
Help!

508
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,333
Coming over

509
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:03,667
Help!

510
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:04,958
Help!

511
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,083
Here!

512
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,833
I told you to stay outside!

513
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,042
Worry about yourself first

514
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,833
Can you move

515
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:28,625
Are you okay

516
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,542
Get up!

517
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:35,667
Son!

518
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:36,292
Water!

519
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:38,750
Son!

520
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,750
Jump!

521
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:45,583
Jump!

522
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,667
No!

523
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:47,667
Jump!

524
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,375
No!

525
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,208
Jump!

526
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,833
Dad!

527
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,083
Okay

528
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,000
Son

529
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,292
Are you all right

530
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,000
Run!

531
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,292
Any updates on the fire

532
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:11,625
It's a No.5 Alarm now

533
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,750
Over 100 firefighters are on the scene

534
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,833
18 of my men are in the hospital

535
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,125
Simon Fan is there

536
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,167
God knows why

537
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,708
Simon is the best

538
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,792
Simon is the worst

539
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,250
He's a natural showman

540
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,625
He loves the limelight

541
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,000
Don't worry

542
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,583
I've got eyes on him

543
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,125
Dr. Fan, this way

544
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,292
The radiation is already enough trouble,

545
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,167
now we've got Simon Fan too

546
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,708
After what he did
to Fire Services 10 years ago...

547
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,083
The Chief Executive
still brought him back to consult

548
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,125
He joined an NGO
after he resigned and took part

549
00:30:57,542 --> 00:31:00,625
in nuclear disaster investigations abroad

550
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:01,833
To be fair,

551
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,500
his profile makes him

552
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:06,625
the ideal choice for our expert consultant

553
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,917
He was incredibly headstrong back then

554
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,583
He didn't care about the people around him

555
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,583
So we were all quite happy when he had to

556
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,708
take the blame for the Kwai Chung accident

557
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,375
Just don't let him get in our way

558
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,750
We can handle this

559
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,875
Don't worry

560
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,750
As long as reason is on our side

561
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,750
I'll back you up

562
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,875
It's been a long time, Dr. Fan

563
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,667
No time to waste, let's start

564
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,208
Wait

565
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,750
Has Dr. Fan signed the non-disclosure agreement

566
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:49,042
Non-governmental personnel must sign first

567
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,542
Is this a new version

568
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,500
It's still the one I drafted

569
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,292
The government is a team...

570
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,875
Not an individual

571
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,167
If I don't sign,

572
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,500
you won't let me in

573
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,750
If the Chief Executive is here,
we can make exceptions

574
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,000
But he's not here

575
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,583
and I'm in charge

576
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,208
Legally...

577
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,958
You have to take full responsibility

578
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,250
After you

579
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,917
After the explosion

580
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,625
all entryways into the yard were sealed

581
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,292
If we don't approve the use of water

582
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,250
we cannot conduct search and rescue

583
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,792
nor can we locate the radiation source

584
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,750
Radium-226 was in a sample from the scene

585
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,250
Using water may have dire consequences

586
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,083
Our firefighters have to wait

587
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,500
That's right

588
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,167
This type of material dissolves in water

589
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,333
Water will send it

590
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,875
into the catchment area

591
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,750
and pollute the district's water supply

592
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,500
The region will lose running water

593
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,750
We'll definitely get complaints

594
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,000
I have two men stuck inside

595
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,333
How do we fight fire without water

596
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,375
Lau Sir

597
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,875
I've done this for 30 years

598
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,167
I've never fought fire without water

599
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,083
We're opening a path

600
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,083
We'll go in when it's opened

601
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,250
They're trapped in there! They can't wait!

602
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,667
Even without water...

603
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:13,500
We have to try

604
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,625
There's gotta be a way

605
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,250
Lau Sir...

606
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:16,750
Without your say-so

607
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,083
we won't use a drop of water

608
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:21,708
Safety first

609
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,708
Thank you, sir!

610
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,042
Radium-226 is usually found in

611
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:26,167
illegal fluorescent paint

612
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,042
The radioactivity is not very strong

613
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,500
As long as it's contained...

614
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,083
The fallout can be controlled

615
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,083
The peak radiation reading is

616
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,208
11 mSv per hour

617
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,292
That's the equivalent of

618
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,875
two chest CT scans

619
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,250
Smoking an extra cigarette

620
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,833
is more lethal, then

621
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,792
Have you all read through the report

622
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,167
Didn't you all read

623
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,708
the weather forecast

624
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,333
Observatory Director!

625
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,167
Say something

626
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,292
Tropical Storm Murphy is located

627
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:12,083
862 km southeast of Hong Kong

628
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,667
Its outer rain band
has reached the southern coast

629
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,042
We're preparing
to hoist a Signal 1 Storm Warning

630
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,250
The typhoon will reach Hong Kong in 18 hours

631
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,958
Hear that

632
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,042
It'll rain!

633
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,208
When it rains,

634
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,292
everything will spread anyway

635
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,708
Approve the use of water and

636
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,042
open a path to the scene

637
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,750
There's still time

638
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,125
We can control this ourselves

639
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:36,917
Why rush the use of water

640
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,500
Isn't it obvious

641
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,625
This recycling yard

642
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,708
is a toxic materials market!

643
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,542
Enter the scene ASAP...

644
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,750
Find the source...

645
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,542
Then bury it with concrete

646
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:50,250
That's the optimal solution

647
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,833
I don't see any proof

648
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:55,125
These are simply your own speculations

649
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,083
We can't work on blind guesses

650
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,042
I'm not speculating!

651
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:04,917
I based everything on fact

652
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,708
This is my professional judgment

653
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:08,667
Take minutes

654
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,125
Take nothing!

655
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,125
In addition to radium-226,

656
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:17,833
I believe there are

657
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,542
stronger radiactive materials inside

658
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:22,958
What makes you say that

659
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:23,833
At least 5 of the injured

660
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,208
have Acute Radiation Syndrome

661
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,208
One of them has a swollen

662
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,083
and ulcerated arm

663
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,083
The source's radiation is

664
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,125
at least 300 mSv per hour

665
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:33,792
Doctor

666
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,333
What does 300 mSv do

667
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,125
A short period of
such intense radiation exposure

668
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,167
will result in vomiting, diarrhea

669
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,083
headache, fatigue and skin ulcers

670
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,208
I don't see radiation poisoning in the report

671
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,167
It's a battlefield down there!

672
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,875
They're fighting to save lives!

673
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,833
It's easy to mix up symptoms

674
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,167
How can they report to you so quickly

675
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,583
I don't understand

676
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,750
There's nothing on the gauges at the scene

677
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,875
There's nothing on the gauges at the scene

678
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,208
The lab has 13 samples,

679
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,042
why was only one material found

680
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,125
Why

681
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,750
I'm waiting for you to explain!

682
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,792
Because the radiation source

683
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:10,250
is out of the firefighters' reach!

684
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,000
That's why!

685
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,500
The illegal laborers must've touched it

686
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,250
Otherwise...

687
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,542
They wouldn't be so badly poisoned

688
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,083
You're all here in your cushy chairs...

689
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,125
Do you have any idea what it's like down there!

690
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,333
Finger calling Kit Sir

691
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,542
Nothing

692
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,708
Finger calling Kit Sir

693
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,083
Hey, try yours

694
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,208
Using water

695
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,750
is our best bet

696
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,292
It's true... radium-226 spreading

697
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,042
is a big problem

698
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,333
But the fallout

699
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,708
is still manageable

700
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,333
Let them use water

701
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,083
Give them a chance to save lives

702
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,000
Give us a chance

703
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,333
to defuse a bigger bomb!

704
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,042
Fire Services, say something!

705
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,250
Give them a chance!

706
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,542
We don't need you to speak for us

707
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:17,667
As long as there is an appropriate solution,

708
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,167
all my firefighters

709
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,208
cooperate fully

710
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:23,500
Foam truck on hold,

711
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
it hasn't been approved

712
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,750
Keep spraying! Keep at it!

713
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,167
Rain is a natural disaster,

714
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,583
the public can accept that

715
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,500
But a radiation leak
from spraying at the fire...

716
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,250
That's on us!

717
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,000
Are you ready to take the fall

718
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,667
Your job is more important than their lives

719
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,542
Recycling yard fire continues

720
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,125
with sporadic explosions

721
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,042
Some speculate

722
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,542
there's an illegal oil depot underground

723
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,500
There are still containers left in there

724
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,750
Relax

725
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,250
Requesting Government Flying Service

726
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,667
to drop borax

727
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,292
Target location KK072920

728
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,917
Queen's Hill, Fanling

729
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:50,667
Come wait here

730
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,708
I'm helping you now

731
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,375
Make way

732
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,333
Water, Finger, come in

733
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,667
Do you copy!

734
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:06,750
Hey

735
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:08,625
Eat something

736
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,708
You gotta eat

737
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,750
Fighting a fire isn't a solo effort

738
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:15,792
Eat up

739
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,083
We haven't found them yet

740
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,958
Why are you here

741
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,083
Why don't I talk to Lau Sir

742
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,458
and get you put on back-up duty

743
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,208
What are you talking about

744
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,542
Take care of yourself first

745
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,000
There's radiation here

746
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,042
Even if the baby's not your concern...

747
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,167
You shouldn't be here

748
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,542
Mister, I asked you to leave

749
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,958
Where can I go

750
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,292
My house is gone!

751
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,250
Y'all have worked hard

752
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,958
- Have some tea-It's dangerous here

753
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:16,250
Please listen to our colleagues and leave

754
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,083
I was born here, and I'll die here

755
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,333
That recycling yard kept piling up

756
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:23,583
blocking my road

757
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,333
Those South Asians would always

758
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,583
crawl out of the yard and steal my veggies!

759
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:28,458
Go, go

760
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,042
Let's get out of here first

761
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:31,292
Mister,

762
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,667
is there another way in

763
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,208
Near those fancy apartments

764
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,458
Zoe, ask Government Flying Service about a path

765
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,833
under the luxury apartments

766
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,583
on the hill

767
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,667
Copy, I'll ask right away

768
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,917
Mobile command unit calling Heli 27

769
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,833
Is there a path
near the construction site on the hill

770
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,458
Air command Heli 27

771
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,500
Target located

772
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,458
Luen Wo Hui's Kit Sir

773
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,458
Construction site path confirmed

774
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,583
Water, Finger...

775
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,375
We're on the way in

776
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,958
Hang in there!

777
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,000
We have three units working on opening a path

778
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,917
Why are you acting on your own

779
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:16,542
Sorry, sir

780
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,958
A firefighter's duty

781
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:18,833
is to protect and save lives

782
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:19,500
You taught us that

783
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,375
The two people in there are family

784
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:23,417
I'll take responsibility!

785
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,042
Madam Chan

786
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,417
Don't join their madness!

787
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:26,333
Rescue isn't trading

788
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,375
your life for theirs

789
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,583
I'm in charge here!

790
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,917
Lau Sir, my men are inside

791
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,542
I won't leave them behind

792
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:33,542
- Sorry, sir
- Kit Lai

793
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:35,583
Don't be reckless!

794
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,042
Full gear!

795
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,250
Yes sir!

796
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,792
We don't know what's in there

797
00:41:58,833 --> 00:41:59,583
Watch your backs

798
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:00,292
Copy

799
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:13,000
Water calling Kit Sir, do you copy

800
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,667
Water calling Kit Sir

801
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:17,042
We're trying to leave, do you copy

802
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,000
Water calling Kit Sir, do you copy

803
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,958
Where's that exit again

804
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,583
There's a path below those luxury apartments,

805
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,958
we can climb up there

806
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,292
The kid can't wait

807
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,542
Come on

808
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,458
How

809
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,542
You're gonna carry all 3 of us

810
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:10,833
I can do it

811
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,625
Find that path

812
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,625
Finding Kit Sir is our only hope

813
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,417
Dragging us along will get us all killed

814
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,542
What are you doing

815
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:47,833
Don't go anywhere

816
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,375
I'll make it back

817
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,375
Sir!

818
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,625
Don't leave us!

819
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,542
At least take my son with you

820
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,167
I'm begging you

821
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:03,792
Get up

822
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,417
I'll get you out first

823
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:08,917
Hey

824
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,417
I can do this

825
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:14,958
Wait for me

826
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,417
You still owe me $900

827
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,583
I haven't forgotten

828
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:45,125
- Rope!
- Yes, Madam

829
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:45,750
Chainsmoker!

830
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,292
Come on

831
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,042
I'll cross first

832
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,250
All safe

833
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:27,958
Rope

834
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,542
Get ready to rappel

835
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:29,500
Yes, sir

836
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,917
300 meters to target

837
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,125
200 meters

838
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:40,292
100 meters

839
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,208
Now!

840
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:10,792
Sending gear down

841
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:16,250
Take your time

842
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:19,833
Now!

843
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,292
We've lost control!

844
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,583
Mayday! Mayday!

845
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,667
Madam hold on!

846
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,250
Chu!

847
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:11,958
Watch out

848
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,083
Hold tight!

849
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,333
Hang in there!

850
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:20,458
Are you all right

851
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,042
Hey!

852
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,292
Are you OK!

853
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,458
Still breathing

854
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,542
Kid...

855
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,625
Don't give up

856
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,042
Can someone double-check the readings

857
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:33,417
Why is it still rising

858
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:38,208
I want a report from the scene

859
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,125
every 30 minutes

860
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:40,958
That lab report better be here

861
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,958
in 10 minutes!

862
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:54,042
Water, Finger

863
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,667
...do you copy

864
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:58,125
We're in

865
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,458
What's your position

866
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,417
Kid...

867
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,000
Don't give up

868
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,833
I'll definitely save you

869
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:20,458
Water, Finger, come in!

870
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,000
Sir...

871
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,417
Sir...

872
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,792
Sir...

873
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:51,833
Wait

874
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:56,083
That way!

875
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:57,042
Hurry!

876
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:04,417
Water!

877
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:05,875
Finger!

878
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:11,000
Po!

879
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,542
Tie the rope to the bricks

880
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,542
Hand it to me

881
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:46,667
Over there!

882
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,625
Water!

883
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,792
Careful

884
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:52,792
Water!

885
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,458
Water! Water!

886
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,125
Where's Finger

887
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,458
It's OK, we're here to save you

888
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,167
We'll go look around

889
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:02,167
OK

890
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,917
Pulse and breathing are weak

891
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:04,833
Yes

892
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,583
500 mSuv...

893
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:16,792
That's lethal

894
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,542
Well

895
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:23,667
Don't see him

896
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,083
Radiation's too high

897
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:27,167
It's too dangerous without protective suits

898
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:31,542
Fall back immediately!

899
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:32,500
Fall back!

900
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:33,333
Fall back!

901
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:40,917
Hurry!

902
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:41,875
Hurry!

903
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:52,417
Is there anyone still inside

904
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,375
Yes, we haven't located him

905
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:56,583
Keep a close eye

906
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:57,458
Update me

907
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:58,417
Yes, Sir

908
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,875
Deep wound, the patient has an infection

909
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:06,458
Ask when surgery can be arranged

910
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,333
Okay

911
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:10,417
Pethidine 100mg

912
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,208
Madam,
Northern Hospital's isolation facility is full

913
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,625
It'll take a few more minutes

914
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:28,542
The lab report just came out

915
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,542
The illegal laborer rescued this morning

916
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,125
carried another radioactive substance...

917
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:36,542
Cesium-137

918
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,125
The Goiania Accident!

919
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,542
The worst medical waste leak in history

920
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,083
Over 100,000

921
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,208
needed tests and treatment

922
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:57,458
Many suffered from leukemia and cancer

923
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,333
Infertility and teratosis rates rose greatly

924
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,875
Most homes and topsoil had to be removed

925
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,458
due to radioactive contamination

926
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,042
That leak was only 93 grams...

927
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,917
That's half this glass!

928
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,667
We don't know how much

929
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,542
is in the yard

930
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,833
It'll do serious damage in humans

931
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,417
Organ failure, even death!

932
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:19,667
Let me remind you all...

933
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:22,042
Cesium isn't only soluble in water...

934
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,875
In addition to spreading via rain,

935
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,625
cesium has a lower boiling point than radium...

936
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,583
At only 600 degrees

937
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:33,250
It evaporates the moment

938
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,958
it touches fire

939
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:37,000
It'll spread even quicker

940
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:39,583
The area around the fire

941
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:41,833
will be contaminated

942
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:43,500
Hong Kong will become

943
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,792
the next Goiania

944
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:49,042
Cesium-137's half life is very long

945
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:51,333
The contaminated zone

946
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,458
will be uninhabitable

947
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,125
for the next century

948
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:10,917
Evacuate

949
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,292
Estimate an evacuation range

950
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,833
based on the current situation

951
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,500
Wind direction,

952
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,417
rainfall

953
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:39,417
and leakag

954
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,417
will affect the estimate

955
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,917
Use the current weather forecast

956
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:45,833
and set the leakage

957
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,833
at 10 times bigger than Goiénia

958
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,250
for the simulation

959
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:12,333
What are you doing

960
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,500
The radiation reading is too high!

961
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,833
It's finding a needle in a haystack!

962
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:20,583
I get it

963
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,542
You still blame yourself

964
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:24,333
for what happened

965
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:25,958
to your sister

966
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,458
If I don't go in now...

967
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,542
Finger will die

968
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,542
We're not superhumans!

969
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:36,625
What will your mother do
if something happens to you

970
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:57,833
We'll find another way

971
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,083
Let's find another way

972
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:06,375
(At the airport yet)

973
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,625
It's urgent

974
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:13,250
Okay

975
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,250
(Roger)

976
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,042
Is the Observatory ready

977
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:26,125
According to Murphy's circulation...

978
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,625
Anywhere within 15 km of the disaster...

979
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,417
will be severely contaminated

980
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,875
Affected areas include Sheung Shui,

981
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,833
Fanling,

982
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,792
Kwu Tung,

983
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,042
Tai Po,

984
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,042
Yuen Long,

985
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,625
Tin Shui Wai,

986
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,625
Ma On Shan,

987
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:48,542
Shatin,

988
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,208
Sai Kung,

989
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:53,792
Sham Tseng,

990
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:55,333
Tsuen Wan,

991
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,042
Kwai Chung

992
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,542
Evacuate the Northern District first

993
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:01,542
I'll make arrangements

994
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:03,542
We're talking about 2 million people

995
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,458
We can't move them all!

996
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,625
Not a word about the radiation gets out

997
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:14,250
Evacuation is unnecessary right now

998
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,833
Raise the fire to Disaster-level

999
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:20,333
We're talking about radiation

1000
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:23,542
You can't hide something this big

1001
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:27,542
Without the latest information,

1002
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:29,458
the public will panic

1003
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:31,542
There'll be more misinformation

1004
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,375
Evacuate

1005
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:35,375
I can't evacuate

1006
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,375
Evacuation will only bring more panic

1007
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:39,292
The whole district will be paralyzed

1008
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:40,792
Then it would be impossible to send

1009
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:42,833
more firefighters to the scene

1010
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,417
More firefighters

1011
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,083
may not put out the fire quicker

1012
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,208
I don't need the fire put out!

1013
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:51,667
I just need to open the northeast entrance

1014
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,292
to remove the cesium-137

1015
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,167
All I need to do is to

1016
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:59,542
quickly mobilize manpower to open that path....

1017
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,375
Then the worst scenario won't come true

1018
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:05,667
This is the only way to save Hong Kong!

1019
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,000
Face the facts!

1020
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:09,458
In our current situation...

1021
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,333
anything could happen right now!

1022
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,000
Is it really worth risking everyone's lives

1023
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:15,208
just to protect yourself!

1024
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:19,667
All of you know

1025
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:22,625
clearing a path
and evacuation aren't contradictory

1026
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:24,958
You won't even give people

1027
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,333
a chance to escape

1028
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,500
This debate is over

1029
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,333
My decision is final

1030
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:32,792
Take five

1031
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:33,542
Cecilia!

1032
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:35,042
Cecilia!

1033
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,250
The radiation will drift over here

1034
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:40,583
We should move to

1035
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:42,042
the Government House's

1036
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,208
Command Centre as a precaution

1037
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,292
We still have to lead

1038
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:00,125
Roger, what's wrong

1039
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,792
Why all the missed calls

1040
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:03,458
How bad is the fire

1041
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:04,833
Really bad

1042
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:07,583
Why don't you...

1043
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:10,458
leave Hong Kong with our son first

1044
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,250
I have to go

1045
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,292
We should run

1046
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:35,292
Your wife will protect us

1047
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,667
We'll be all right

1048
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,083
We're handling it

1049
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,250
I need to go back to work

1050
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:47,833
I have to go

1051
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:51,458
Just take the kids to Lantau Island for a while

1052
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,500
I have a meeting now

1053
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:57,750
The following vehicles

1054
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,292
are to participate in a Disaster-level event

1055
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:01,042
Address Queen's Hill Tai Tong Village

1056
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:02,333
Hung Lik Recycling Yard

1057
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,042
Sung Wong Toi,
send light rescue unit, large ladder truck...

1058
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,083
Tsim Sha Tsui, lighting tender
and breathing apparatus tender...

1059
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,583
Kwun Tong, pump truck and light rescue unit...

1060
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,083
Sheung Wan, ladder and heavy pump...

1061
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,458
North Point, pump truck and canteen...

1062
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,792
Southern District,
light rescue unit and decontamination...

1063
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:34,333
Bye-Bye

1064
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:36,333
Hurry home, Daddy!

1065
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,833
All vehicles from the Peak are present

1066
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,792
All vehicles from Central are present

1067
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:09,042
All vehicles from Causeway Bay are present

1068
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,333
Attention all vehicles

1069
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:12,625
Mobile command unit
is at Tai Tong Village's entrance

1070
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:20,292
We can see the scene is shrouded in black smoke

1071
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:22,167
There are occasional explosions

1072
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:23,667
Even though I'm standing

1073
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:25,375
quite far from the fire right now,

1074
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,042
I can feel the temperature here

1075
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:29,625
is much higher than normal

1076
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,292
Fire Services has mobilized more units

1077
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:35,333
but the flames are far from contained

1078
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:38,125
There are blackouts thoughout the north

1079
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,458
with many firetrucks assisting with the rescue

1080
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,375
Under the storm warning,

1081
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,833
smoke and dust have spread to nearby homes

1082
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,375
After inhaling smoke

1083
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,542
many have rushed to the North District Hospital

1084
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:56,458
Hospitals have set up temporary tents

1085
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:58,792
to cope with the influx of patients

1086
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:05,208
There are power outages in the north,

1087
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:06,250
causing chaos in multiple districts

1088
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,125
Residents are panicking

1089
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:08,917
Even now, the government

1090
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,625
have yet to provide updates

1091
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,417
Citizens are advised to stay home and

1092
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:14,792
keep windows and doors closed

1093
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,042
Trains between Shatin
and Sheung Shui are suspended

1094
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,417
Emergency broadcast

1095
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:20,792
Due to power outages,

1096
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,458
the signaling system is severely affected

1097
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:23,333
Service will be disrupted

1098
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,292
Please wait patiently for bus arrangements

1099
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:33,292
Posts in multiple Internet discussion forums

1100
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,375
suggest that the fire has spread toxic dust

1101
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,042
all across Hong Kong

1102
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:40,333
The city's healthcare system is in collapse

1103
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,167
Can you treat me first

1104
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,458
As the Queen's Hill
Recycling Yard Fire rages on,

1105
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,292
sources reveal that

1106
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:13,458
there is a radioactive material at the scene

1107
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,292
Cesium-137

1108
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:17,750
It is believed that
a half-km radius around the yard

1109
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,542
has been severely contaminated

1110
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,375
However, radiation levels across Hong Kong

1111
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,125
remain normal

1112
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:23,833
Kowloon,

1113
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:24,500
Hong Kong Island,

1114
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,167
Lantau Island

1115
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:26,792
are relatively safe areas...

1116
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:28,542
The government will likely evacuate soon

1117
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:29,292
Dr. Fan...

1118
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,875
A non-disclosure agreement violation

1119
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:32,042
is 7 years in jail

1120
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,583
You should know better

1121
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:36,083
I don't care who you are

1122
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,250
We're in a critical situation

1123
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,250
and you're playing divide and conquer

1124
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,333
We don't have enough resources for evacuation

1125
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:44,250
I won't change my mind

1126
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,542
I have no time to play politics with you

1127
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,750
Open all public venues immediately

1128
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,875
Requisition every tour bus in Hong Kong

1129
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,792
Order an evacuation

1130
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,292
Evacuate as soon as possible

1131
01:04:54,292 --> 01:04:55,583
Your families are not the

1132
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,417
only people with the right to know

1133
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:09,333
If it's the right thing to do...

1134
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:11,125
You should do it

1135
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,625
What's happening over there

1136
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:25,875
Simon and Cecilia, stay in the room

1137
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,375
Everyone else, step out

1138
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:43,542
I saw the news

1139
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:44,375
Cecilia...

1140
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,083
How did you manage to mess this up

1141
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:48,083
I suspect someone leaked classified intel

1142
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,792
We're in a severe catastrophe

1143
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,667
If no one steps up

1144
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:55,375
and tell the truth,

1145
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,792
Hong Kong will spiral out of control

1146
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:58,417
It's impossible to

1147
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,792
evacuate everyone

1148
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:02,125
The truth will
just bring more terror and chaos,

1149
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,583
only creating more panic

1150
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:05,500
We have to believe that...

1151
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,583
one more life evacuated...

1152
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:09,167
is one life saved

1153
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,583
That's enough

1154
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,542
The public has the right to know

1155
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:13,833
Evacuate now

1156
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:26,583
Stop following me!

1157
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,125
You can stay behind!

1158
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:33,208
If you're scared,

1159
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,875
tell them I didn't let you come

1160
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:35,792
I'm not scared!

1161
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:37,792
I want to help!

1162
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:43,583
Everyone has their role to play

1163
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,417
Thank you

1164
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:05,125
Due to severe pollution,

1165
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:06,750
around the recycling yard...

1166
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,250
The area will be sealed

1167
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,292
The government
has declared a state of emergency

1168
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,333
Civil Affairs and the police

1169
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:14,417
are evacuating residents in the north

1170
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,542
Slowly...

1171
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:17,417
Watch your step...

1172
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:19,042
Over 2,000 tour buses

1173
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:20,792
have been sent to housing estates

1174
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:22,292
for evacuation

1175
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,292
Most residents are being cooperative

1176
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,083
There's been no sign of chaos

1177
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,667
The radiation from the recycling yard fire

1178
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:33,250
has spread to nearby homes

1179
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,458
Several thousand residents are affected

1180
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:38,667
An hour
after the government's evacuation notice,

1181
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:40,375
emergency evacuations are being carried out

1182
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:42,167
within 5km of the fire

1183
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,125
This way please

1184
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:46,875
According to the Airport Authority,

1185
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,875
an influx of people going to the airport

1186
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:51,083
has caused gridlock on highways

1187
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,667
The government is urging people

1188
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:55,583
to not go to the airport

1189
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:03,583
Main roads in the northern district
are heavily congested,

1190
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,792
blocking buses from picking up residents

1191
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,292
People are still waiting patiently
for arrangements

1192
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,458
Nurse!

1193
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:10,708
My daughter is vomiting really badly

1194
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:12,208
Is it caused by radiation

1195
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,500
We're overloaded right now

1196
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,583
Please wait

1197
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,792
But feel her temperature

1198
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,250
She's really sick

1199
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,750
I'll get a doctor

1200
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,333
Wait

1201
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,083
Nurse!

1202
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,208
Hang in there, relax

1203
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,542
We're almost at the hospital

1204
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:28,875
The oil truck ahead has stalled

1205
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:29,875
Both lanes are blocked

1206
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,250
Hey, a truck has stalled

1207
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:31,833
Yeah

1208
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:32,667
Hey!

1209
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:33,542
Wait here

1210
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:35,292
I'm Ambulanceman, what happened

1211
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:36,208
My truck broke down

1212
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:38,042
It's not like I wanted this to happen

1213
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:39,833
Help us push!

1214
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:40,708
Help us push!

1215
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,125
Thank you!

1216
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:44,542
One, two, three!

1217
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,333
One, two, three!

1218
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,750
One, two, three!

1219
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:49,208
Go!

1220
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,292
OK, thank you!

1221
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,792
Help us open a path!

1222
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:54,333
Let the ambulance through!

1223
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:57,708
Careful!

1224
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,292
Please stay calm

1225
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,333
and follow personnel instructions

1226
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,708
Thanks for your cooperation

1227
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:20,875
Is there no way we can go home

1228
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,542
I've registered you already

1229
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,333
The Queen's Hill Recycling Yard Fire

1230
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:35,375
has burned for 16 hours

1231
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,375
and is not looking to let up

1232
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,792
All residents within 8 km of the scene

1233
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:41,458
have been evacuated

1234
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:44,333
Evacuation is still in progress

1235
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,208
Grandma, are you hungry

1236
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,333
Want some bread

1237
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,333
I'm not hungry

1238
01:09:59,083 --> 01:09:59,708
Hello

1239
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:01,792
Daddy

1240
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:04,208
Waiting for your flight

1241
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,250
I didn't go

1242
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,042
I'm with Grandma

1243
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:21,042
Are you all right

1244
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:27,542
I'm at work

1245
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,167
Look after yourselves

1246
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:39,708
(Be careful, Daddy.)

1247
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:44,083
If you're worried about your dad,

1248
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:47,042
why not just tell him

1249
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:49,333
Is it that hard

1250
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,292
He can be hard to talk to

1251
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:59,250
When your mom passed away,

1252
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,833
your dad came to see me

1253
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:05,625
He cried like a child in front of me

1254
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:09,208
After he lost his wife,

1255
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:11,833
he still had to face the public

1256
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,833
while raising you

1257
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:16,542
He's under a lot of pressure

1258
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,667
Don't take it to heart

1259
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:28,750
Simon, is there a way to

1260
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:31,542
stop the radiation leak

1261
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:32,583
Yes...

1262
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,417
But it's risky

1263
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,042
According to radiation monitors

1264
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:40,583
by the Weather Observatory

1265
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:43,458
and Government Flying Service's
on-scene reports,

1266
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:45,292
the leakage escalated when

1267
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:47,375
the helicopter crashed into the containers

1268
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:49,208
300 meters east by southwest

1269
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,708
of the yard's entrance

1270
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:53,292
Radiation levels are highest there

1271
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:54,667
I'm sure

1272
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:57,292
the cesium-137 is inside those containers

1273
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,042
Even if we can locate the container,

1274
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,792
the road hasn't been opened

1275
01:12:00,792 --> 01:12:02,167
Cars can't access it

1276
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:03,542
Cars can't go in...

1277
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,750
But people can

1278
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,333
You mean to

1279
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,375
remove the materials manually

1280
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,042
Yes

1281
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,208
You want to order firefighters to go in

1282
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:12,292
Simon

1283
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:14,208
Hong Kong
has never had a disaster like this before

1284
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,125
You need to handle this very carefully

1285
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,417
The whole fire brigade
only has 8 protective suits

1286
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,875
There's no data
the suits can withstand radiation

1287
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,250
I'll go there myself

1288
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,542
Since we can't confirm

1289
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:30,292
the amount of radioactive materials inside

1290
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,333
and since the road is sealed...

1291
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,417
We need to remove the materials

1292
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:35,750
from the scene

1293
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,583
then seal it in concrete

1294
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:39,125
That's the order from up top

1295
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:43,625
Dr. Fan will give the details

1296
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,583
We found a very strong

1297
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,208
radioactive material on the

1298
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:50,583
injured illegal laborer from the yard

1299
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:51,875
Cesium-137

1300
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,792
Chlorinated cesium-137 is

1301
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:55,708
usually sealed

1302
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:57,792
and used in radioactive medical instruments

1303
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,375
or industrial measurements

1304
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:03,375
When leaked,

1305
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:06,750
nearby areas will be severely contaminated

1306
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,542
along with the people in them

1307
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,792
Lau Sir

1308
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,500
We've never touched this kind of stuff before

1309
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:18,667
How do we handle it

1310
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:19,333
Sir

1311
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,667
It will be hard to locate it

1312
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:22,833
with all those containers in there

1313
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:23,792
The radiation level in the yard

1314
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,083
is over 300 mSv

1315
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:28,167
Anyone who goes in

1316
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:29,750
will be infected

1317
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:31,750
We need to wear protective suits

1318
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,333
With the temperatures inside...

1319
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:35,833
And the lack of data...

1320
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:37,792
Will the suits last

1321
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,792
Our guys are still in there...

1322
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,500
Can we save them first

1323
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,167
I know this operation is dangerous

1324
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:47,333
If you're not willing to go...

1325
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:48,833
regardless of who's giving the orders

1326
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,458
I will support you

1327
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:54,583
Even if I'll get fired...

1328
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:57,167
I won't force them to go in for you

1329
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:09,208
I know this mission is dangerous

1330
01:14:09,667 --> 01:14:11,417
and I understand

1331
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,500
why you'd have suspicions

1332
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:17,542
I know this material

1333
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:21,333
better than anyone here

1334
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,375
I'll go in myself

1335
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:27,917
If we pull off this mission

1336
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:29,917
will this crisis be defused

1337
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:33,875
I don't want to give any false hope

1338
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:36,750
Success...

1339
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:40,042
is not just hinged on our determination

1340
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,792
It's hinged on our luck, too

1341
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:47,875
Ten years ago...

1342
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,292
I made a decision

1343
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,458
It cost the lives

1344
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,250
of 6 firefighters

1345
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:00,208
I'm to blame for that

1346
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:03,917
Today, I stand here...

1347
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,125
asking for a chance...

1348
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:09,333
to stand by you

1349
01:15:10,792 --> 01:15:13,208
There's a chance you will die on this mission

1350
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:15,583
You all have families

1351
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,417
If you choose to walk away...

1352
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:21,750
I understand

1353
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:39,083
As long as there's hope...

1354
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,125
I'm in

1355
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:01,250
I can't leave my brothers behind

1356
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,667
I'm sorry, honey

1357
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:09,292
Don't you dare leave me

1358
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,083
You better come back

1359
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,792
You still have to be a father

1360
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:34,167
The breathing apparatus
has 30 minutes of oxygen

1361
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:35,250
Don't waste time

1362
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,458
Even over a short period, radiation levels of

1363
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,625
over 3000 mSv are very dangerous

1364
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,625
We only have one shot

1365
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:43,292
Stay only as long as you need to

1366
01:16:47,792 --> 01:16:50,292
Speak up if you feel ill

1367
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,667
The team has entered the scene

1368
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:39,792
(480 mSv)

1369
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:43,333
(510 mSv)

1370
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:00,125
(620 mSv)

1371
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,792
980 mSv

1372
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:28,375
Go

1373
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:51,625
(1560 mSv)

1374
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,125
Water Ghost, are you all right

1375
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,125
Get him out

1376
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:38,458
(2100 mSv)

1377
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:01,292
(2400 mSv)

1378
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,708
(2900 mSv)

1379
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,708
This place is filled with dangerous metals

1380
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:30,292
But they're not the radiation source

1381
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,167
It's all toxic chemicals

1382
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:37,708
Magnesium metal

1383
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,250
It explodes when it touches water

1384
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,500
This space is too narrow and toxic

1385
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,083
Leave the lead box outside

1386
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:46,167
Chu, Po, stand by outside

1387
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,042
Yes, sir

1388
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,792
(3800 mSv)

1389
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:23,792
This is cesium-137

1390
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:25,542
Cover it with lead

1391
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:27,208
Stop the leakage

1392
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:40,167
(3220 mSv)

1393
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,292
The reading is still high

1394
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,292
It's this medical scanner

1395
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:08,250
Pass it carefully

1396
01:22:19,542 --> 01:22:20,625
Careful!

1397
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:46,333
Check their breathing apparatus's levels

1398
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,500
16 minutes of oxygen left

1399
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:32,458
Are you all right

1400
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:35,333
Can you keep going

1401
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,333
Big B!

1402
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:13,292
Careful!

1403
01:24:13,292 --> 01:24:13,875
Big B!

1404
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:15,167
Don't worry! Everything will be fine

1405
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:16,042
Ah!

1406
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,375
Abort mission!

1407
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,708
It's all over!

1408
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:25,708
Fall back!

1409
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:27,042
Fall back!

1410
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:43,792
Tell everyone

1411
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,250
to evacuate

1412
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,208
Lau Sir...

1413
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:49,875
If you're not leaving...

1414
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:52,417
neither are we

1415
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:51,875
Excessive hemorrhage

1416
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:53,917
Give me Gelofusin full rate 500 cc

1417
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:00,500
His heartbeat is weak

1418
01:26:00,542 --> 01:26:02,542
Defrib, 120J

1419
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,583
Start CPR

1420
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,833
Planning so much in life is pointless

1421
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:53,500
Hey

1422
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:01,542
Are you OK

1423
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:04,750
I'm contaminated

1424
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:16,000
Is there really no other way

1425
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,292
Is there really nothing we can do

1426
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:53,792
All these years...

1427
01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:56,375
I haven't been able to forgive myself

1428
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:58,708
That's why

1429
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:02,792
I don't know how to forgive you

1430
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:08,625
That doesn't matter now

1431
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,417
Ten years ago...

1432
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,208
If it wasn't for my daughter...

1433
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:49,125
I would have given up a long time ago

1434
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,125
The radiation is already spreading

1435
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:21,333
It'll blow up when it rains

1436
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:24,583
Get your men out

1437
01:29:26,292 --> 01:29:28,167
There's nothing you can do

1438
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,875
(Eileen)

1439
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:58,167
(Uncle Kit)

1440
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:01,792
Little Brat!

1441
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:03,000
Uncle

1442
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:04,500
Hang on

1443
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:22,250
Hello

1444
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:24,375
Daddy...

1445
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,375
Are you done with work

1446
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,125
Not yet

1447
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I regret not listening to you

1448
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,417
If I had, you'd be on a plane

1449
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:49,375
Daddy...

1450
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:02,292
I believe...

1451
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:06,958
this is Mom's will

1452
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,875
It'll be OK...

1453
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:20,542
Wait

1454
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,208
Where's Grandma

1455
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:35,375
Hello

1456
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,208
Mom

1457
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,000
How are things over there

1458
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Are you all right

1459
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,375
I'm fine

1460
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:43,458
Don't worry

1461
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:49,792
Kit

1462
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:51,458
Hmm

1463
01:31:58,542 --> 01:32:00,583
Don't worry about me

1464
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,375
Do what you're meant to do

1465
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:07,417
Focus on getting your job done

1466
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,292
Get to it

1467
01:32:16,167 --> 01:32:18,708
I'll wait for you to come home

1468
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,333
There's really no other way

1469
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,125
You said concrete

1470
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:47,333
stops radiation from spreading

1471
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:48,792
How much do you need

1472
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:50,250
At least 100 tons

1473
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:53,250
We need 6 feet of concrete

1474
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,833
over the containers

1475
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:56,583
to block the radiation

1476
01:32:58,292 --> 01:32:59,375
Those luxury apartments

1477
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:01,375
have plenty of construction waste!

1478
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:11,375
What's wrong

1479
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:12,958
This isn't the only battlefield!

1480
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,250
Kelly, I have a solution!

1481
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,833
Tell Cecilia to get

1482
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,667
explosives experts

1483
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:21,625
and civil engineers!

1484
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,708
There's a file the government hasn't disclosed!

1485
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:25,875
The one on the Kwai Chung fire 10 years ago!

1486
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:28,125
That's a Class 1 classified file

1487
01:33:28,292 --> 01:33:29,667
The content is confidential

1488
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:31,375
This is our last chance!

1489
01:33:31,417 --> 01:33:33,250
I'm blowing up Peter Cowen's luxury apartments!

1490
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:34,417
Get moving!

1491
01:33:35,292 --> 01:33:35,875
Hello

1492
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,208
Hong Kong Information

1493
01:33:42,417 --> 01:33:44,250
Heli 25 3 Persons On Board

1494
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:47,875
from Fanling via Lead Mine Pass for Wan Chai

1495
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,167
It's a huge construction site

1496
01:34:57,167 --> 01:34:58,667
Would Cowen be willing

1497
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:00,250
to just give it away

1498
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:02,292
I'm friends with Peter

1499
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,375
I think it's negotiable

1500
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,708
Have you found the file

1501
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:22,958
Why are you

1502
01:35:22,958 --> 01:35:24,542
looking into that fire

1503
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:25,875
10 years ago...

1504
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:28,375
Peter Cowen took advantage
of a loophole in the new customs procedures

1505
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:30,917
and labeled electronic waste for re-export

1506
01:35:30,917 --> 01:35:33,458
He snuck them in under Customs' nose

1507
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:35,417
It was then shipped to recycling yards

1508
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:38,292
turning Hong Kong into a trash transfer point!

1509
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:40,000
Do you think the same people are

1510
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,625
involved in this radiation leak

1511
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:42,375
Yes

1512
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:45,708
Cowen's DOE controls the entire industry chain

1513
01:35:45,708 --> 01:35:47,375
It's been going on for years

1514
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:48,917
They charge foreign firms to dispose of waste,

1515
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:50,833
They charge foreign firms to dispose of waste,

1516
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,875
they strip valuable parts and sell them

1517
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:54,250
for extra profit

1518
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,708
Thousands of containers a year...

1519
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,125
That's billions in profit

1520
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:58,417
I didn't have enough

1521
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:00,417
to nail Cowen when I was in office

1522
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:01,500
Dr. Fan

1523
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,583
You're only half-right

1524
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:06,875
The redacted sections
on the report implicate more than just Cowen

1525
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:21,542
Don't worry

1526
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,375
I'll get this sorted for you

1527
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:33,250
The bigger the mess,

1528
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,625
The better our odds are

1529
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:47,500
How do you get this file

1530
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:53,833
Roger wouldn't break the law

1531
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,292
and he definitely couldn't have been

1532
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,000
involved in that fire 10 years ago

1533
01:36:57,917 --> 01:37:00,167
The yard is owned by DOE

1534
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:02,458
Hung Lik is your husband's business

1535
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:05,458
Your husband and Cowen are obviously

1536
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,458
colluding in illegal smuggling

1537
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:09,250
This is Class 1 classified

1538
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:10,583
You don't have clearance

1539
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:11,750
Sorry

1540
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:12,583
I don't

1541
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:13,792
But I've read it already

1542
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:16,500
All I know is, this is our bargaining chip

1543
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,542
Protocol forbids us from

1544
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:19,667
using this file to negotiate

1545
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,750
Don't talk to me about protocol

1546
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,375
Don't talk to me about protocol!

1547
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:26,333
All I want to know is Do we blow it up or not

1548
01:37:30,542 --> 01:37:31,208
Come in

1549
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,667
Peter Cowen is here

1550
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:38,542
Long time no see

1551
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:40,375
Cecilia

1552
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,500
I already know the government

1553
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:46,375
wants my Jade Pavilion

1554
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:48,792
If it'll save Hong Kong,

1555
01:37:48,792 --> 01:37:50,250
I'll happily oblige

1556
01:37:50,292 --> 01:37:51,208
However...

1557
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:53,417
I'm a businessman

1558
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:55,292
I deserve compensation

1559
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,875
You're demanding money

1560
01:37:58,708 --> 01:37:59,625
Simon

1561
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:02,542
A businessman never turns down money

1562
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:06,667
I just need Cecilia

1563
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:08,500
to sign something for me

1564
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:09,792
Put that down

1565
01:38:13,667 --> 01:38:14,542
Cecilia

1566
01:38:14,542 --> 01:38:17,417
if you call off investigating this accident,

1567
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,000
I'll give you 30% off

1568
01:38:20,542 --> 01:38:22,208
The blood of millions of people

1569
01:38:22,292 --> 01:38:23,792
are about to be on your hands

1570
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:25,167
Do you think...

1571
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,792
Do you both think you'll get away with it

1572
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:39,000
Cecilia, honey, I'm so sorry

1573
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,750
I was coerced

1574
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:44,917
After the Kwai Chung fire

1575
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,708
he asked me to pay your people

1576
01:38:46,917 --> 01:38:48,417
to cover it up

1577
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:50,833
Then he forced me to work with him

1578
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:52,500
I didn't know this would happen

1579
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:58,875
We're protecting lives

1580
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:01,167
In the name of public interest...

1581
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:04,708
We can blow it up without paying

1582
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:07,917
Sure

1583
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:11,458
You can blow it up, for all I care

1584
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,625
Intentional destruction
or damage of other's property

1585
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:17,208
That's a criminal offense

1586
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:19,625
DOE is a multinational corporation

1587
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:22,125
My company will turn this into

1588
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,375
an international embarrassment for Hong Kong

1589
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:25,833
And I promise...

1590
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:27,750
no reasonable investor

1591
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,750
will hedge their bets on this city again!

1592
01:39:30,292 --> 01:39:31,708
If I'm going down...

1593
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,875
I'm taking everyone down with me

1594
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:35,417
Persecute me

1595
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:37,000
or save your economy

1596
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,458
Your call!

1597
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:55,542
Please, I don't have all day

1598
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,625
What a waste of time

1599
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:12,917
Door!

1600
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:29,375
You were once a politician too

1601
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:53,208
We've done several simulations

1602
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,875
with the data we have

1603
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:56,125
The success rate

1604
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,833
never crossed 50%

1605
01:40:57,833 --> 01:40:59,250
It won't cover everything

1606
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,417
We still have to try

1607
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:02,000
Half is better than none

1608
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,875
Half is pointless

1609
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:05,375
It has to be 100%

1610
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:07,167
to fully block the radiation

1611
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:09,375
Can we direct the rubble

1612
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:11,750
on the radioactive material

1613
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:14,833
I would need a survey of the yard...

1614
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:16,375
...Jade Pavilion, and the slope first

1615
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:19,333
If we had 6 months, it would be possible

1616
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:21,208
I've checked the slope catalogue

1617
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:23,000
The slope is 69 degrees away from

1618
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,708
the successful coverage deviation value

1619
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,417
Where in the recycling yard

1620
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,792
is this cistern

1621
01:41:31,792 --> 01:41:32,792
How deep is it

1622
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:35,833
It's under the east side of the yard

1623
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,583
It's about...

1624
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:39,375
13 meters deep

1625
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:43,375
We'll blow up Jade Pavilion first

1626
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:45,167
to create a landslide

1627
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:46,750
Then we blow up the cistern

1628
01:41:46,917 --> 01:41:47,833
to trigger a cave-in

1629
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:49,792
The containers will all fall in

1630
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:50,917
The depth of the concrete

1631
01:41:50,917 --> 01:41:52,458
will be more than three stories tall

1632
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:54,292
Theoretically, it's sound

1633
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:56,167
But we're only going by these plans

1634
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:57,208
We're understaffed

1635
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:58,875
Our firefighters can help too

1636
01:41:58,875 --> 01:41:59,875
Manpower is no issue

1637
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:02,000
Murphy has picked up speed

1638
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:04,542
It'll arrive sooner than projected

1639
01:42:04,542 --> 01:42:06,208
We only have two hours

1640
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:07,167
Two hours!

1641
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:07,875
Get moving!

1642
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:08,583
I can't tell you

1643
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,125
whether it'll work

1644
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:12,458
We can't wait anymore

1645
01:42:13,667 --> 01:42:15,375
Give it a chance

1646
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,375
I'm counting on you all

1647
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:32,125
With your affiliated unit

1648
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,167
Work in the assigned area

1649
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:33,833
Copy!

1650
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:37,333
90 minutes left!

1651
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:38,625
Everyone move quickly!

1652
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:48,792
The rain band will arrive

1653
01:42:48,792 --> 01:42:50,708
in 90 minutes

1654
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:52,750
Do all you can to help the explosives team

1655
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:58,208
Each unit is responsible for 9 columns

1656
01:42:58,375 --> 01:42:59,875
5 people per unit

1657
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,875
Unit heads, keep me updated

1658
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,208
Copy!

1659
01:43:17,583 --> 01:43:18,958
Has the storm path changed

1660
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,125
It hasn't

1661
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,625
Unit B ready!

1662
01:43:37,708 --> 01:43:39,208
Get ready to pull out!

1663
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:43,208
How's the explosives team doing

1664
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:46,250
Jade Pavilion is ready to go

1665
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:47,333
The environment

1666
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:48,833
in the cistern is too harsh

1667
01:43:48,917 --> 01:43:50,250
There are still a dozen pillars that

1668
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,625
haven't been set yet

1669
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:53,167
The unit at the scene said

1670
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:55,208
they need 10 more minutes

1671
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:01,125
Unit C complete!

1672
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:02,333
Okay, leave!

1673
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:03,000
Let's go!

1674
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:07,875
Hurry up!

1675
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:08,625
Copy!

1676
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:12,375
Which pillar's done

1677
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:13,458
Connect the detonator then

1678
01:44:13,542 --> 01:44:14,250
Copy

1679
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:23,208
Kit Sir!

1680
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:24,750
Water...

1681
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:25,917
didn't make it

1682
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,792
We charged his phone

1683
01:44:36,417 --> 01:44:38,333
He left a message for us

1684
01:44:45,375 --> 01:44:46,458
Finger!

1685
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,167
Hello

1686
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,292
How much time do we have

1687
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:02,167
We've located a firefighter
who's trapped inside

1688
01:45:02,167 --> 01:45:02,875
This is the last chance

1689
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:03,917
I need to save him

1690
01:45:04,417 --> 01:45:05,542
All right

1691
01:45:05,542 --> 01:45:06,458
Give me a moment

1692
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,583
They found him!

1693
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:09,417
They found the firefighter trapped inside!

1694
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:10,500
Observatory, is there enough time

1695
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:11,750
to get him out

1696
01:45:11,875 --> 01:45:14,500
The rain band arrives in 30 minutes

1697
01:45:14,667 --> 01:45:16,208
We can't delay any longer

1698
01:45:18,792 --> 01:45:20,000
My firefighters

1699
01:45:20,333 --> 01:45:22,458
just want to save one more life

1700
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:24,167
Please give us a chance

1701
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,458
Okay...

1702
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:41,750
I promise...

1703
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:44,375
But remember to prioritize our situation

1704
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:46,375
30 minutes

1705
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,875
You must leave by then, successful or not

1706
01:45:47,875 --> 01:45:48,792
All right

1707
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:51,792
There's no time

1708
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:52,958
to put on protective clothing

1709
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,583
Let's go!

1710
01:45:53,792 --> 01:45:54,500
Yes, sir!

1711
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:13,667
Po, go look around

1712
01:46:13,667 --> 01:46:14,875
for a working car

1713
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:17,167
We'll go this way

1714
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:22,500
Are you ok

1715
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:23,958
You must hang in there...

1716
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:26,250
Up ahead!

1717
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:33,500
Look!

1718
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:35,583
We should move towards this direction

1719
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:48,625
Sir!

1720
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,875
Noises over there!

1721
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:09,792
Finger!

1722
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:11,292
Finger!

1723
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,375
Finger!

1724
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:17,792
Finger!

1725
01:47:17,792 --> 01:47:18,917
Help him up!

1726
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:20,583
Careful

1727
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:25,708
Po, we've found Finger!

1728
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:26,833
At the junkyard!

1729
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:36,917
Finger

1730
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:38,208
Are you okay

1731
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:43,125
Kit Sir...

1732
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:44,458
Where's Water

1733
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,667
We'll talk later

1734
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:50,917
Chainsmoker, where's Water

1735
01:47:51,208 --> 01:47:52,375
Let's get out first

1736
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:56,333
Po

1737
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:58,792
Where's Water

1738
01:48:03,375 --> 01:48:04,208
Good to go

1739
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:04,875
Okay!

1740
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:06,333
Where's Water!

1741
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,750
Where's Water

1742
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:10,375
I'm asking you where is Water!

1743
01:48:42,583 --> 01:48:43,125
Yes

1744
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:45,042
Sir, it's Lau

1745
01:48:45,042 --> 01:48:46,208
There was an accident

1746
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:47,792
Wait

1747
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:50,417
Accidental explosion in the cistern

1748
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:51,500
Casualties unknown

1749
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,667
We may have to change course

1750
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:54,500
No update on the explosives

1751
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,292
Keep them on the line

1752
01:48:55,292 --> 01:48:56,417
I want constant updates

1753
01:48:56,417 --> 01:48:57,333
Copy

1754
01:48:59,458 --> 01:49:01,750
How much does this affect our plans

1755
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:03,167
Last we heard...

1756
01:49:03,167 --> 01:49:05,000
A team is still trapped inside

1757
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,458
Their status inside is unknown

1758
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:08,750
We're screwed...

1759
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:10,458
It's all over

1760
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:14,292
(Kit Li)

1761
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,583
According to the simulations...

1762
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,083
Even without the cistern

1763
01:49:22,083 --> 01:49:24,167
we still have a 50% chance

1764
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:26,167
Continue with the operation

1765
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:27,792
Yes, ma'am

1766
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:41,333
Help!

1767
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:42,792
Hang in there!

1768
01:49:43,042 --> 01:49:43,875
Someone will save us soon

1769
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:44,625
Hang in there!

1770
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:47,333
Help!

1771
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:49,708
Help!

1772
01:50:00,875 --> 01:50:02,125
Help!

1773
01:50:04,083 --> 01:50:05,167
Help!

1774
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:06,208
Stop!

1775
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:16,125
Is anyone down there!

1776
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:18,042
Anyone in there

1777
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,333
Help us!

1778
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:22,500
Sir!

1779
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:24,167
Finger's badly hurt

1780
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:26,500
Shouldn't we get him out first

1781
01:50:30,417 --> 01:50:31,833
Chainsmoker, get them out

1782
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,083
I'll stay

1783
01:50:33,167 --> 01:50:34,250
Kit Sir, take me with you

1784
01:50:34,417 --> 01:50:35,833
We leave no one behind

1785
01:50:36,292 --> 01:50:38,500
Might as well. Go!

1786
01:50:41,417 --> 01:50:42,292
Wait here

1787
01:50:51,417 --> 01:50:52,042
Go!

1788
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:52,750
Okay!

1789
01:50:56,458 --> 01:50:57,083
All right

1790
01:50:57,875 --> 01:50:58,500
Ready

1791
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:01,625
Release

1792
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,250
Someone is coming to save us

1793
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:11,125
Hold on

1794
01:51:11,125 --> 01:51:11,833
Is he hurt

1795
01:51:12,167 --> 01:51:13,000
He's hurt bad

1796
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,167
Are you all right

1797
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:16,708
Chainsmoker, help me

1798
01:51:19,458 --> 01:51:20,542
Silly boy,

1799
01:51:20,542 --> 01:51:21,792
it's not your turn yet

1800
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,250
Stay here

1801
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,375
Get him above ground first

1802
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:39,125
His right side is hurt badly

1803
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:39,875
Don't be scared,

1804
01:51:39,875 --> 01:51:41,042
we're here to save you

1805
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:42,542
I'll check over there

1806
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:43,667
Okay

1807
01:51:51,167 --> 01:51:51,875
It's over

1808
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:55,000
The cables are crushed

1809
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,083
It can't be pulled out

1810
01:51:56,083 --> 01:51:58,583
The detcords in my unit aren't ready

1811
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,083
Pull up!

1812
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:12,208
You two leave

1813
01:52:12,292 --> 01:52:13,250
Let's get you out

1814
01:52:13,542 --> 01:52:15,250
How

1815
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:17,250
I'm not done here

1816
01:52:17,792 --> 01:52:19,250
Every pillar has to blow

1817
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:20,292
in order for this to collapse

1818
01:52:20,292 --> 01:52:21,375
If I fail

1819
01:52:21,375 --> 01:52:23,250
millions will die!

1820
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:29,750
The cables are crushed

1821
01:52:30,167 --> 01:52:31,667
Go get help

1822
01:52:31,667 --> 01:52:33,250
Drag the cables in

1823
01:52:34,083 --> 01:52:34,875
You have to

1824
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:35,875
All right!

1825
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:38,000
What can I do

1826
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,208
I'll help

1827
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:42,792
I don't know what can be done now

1828
01:52:44,625 --> 01:52:46,000
Get it together!

1829
01:52:50,042 --> 01:52:51,458
Kit Li calling mobile command unit

1830
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:53,708
Copy, go ahead

1831
01:52:53,708 --> 01:52:55,333
We need to help the explosives team

1832
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:56,750
Come again

1833
01:52:57,167 --> 01:52:58,500
During extraction,

1834
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,375
we saw the explosives team

1835
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:00,833
They had an accident

1836
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:02,708
Two dead, one injured

1837
01:53:03,125 --> 01:53:04,667
A set of detcords have not been installed yet

1838
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
We'll finish it with them

1839
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:08,458
Tell HQ...

1840
01:53:08,458 --> 01:53:09,792
To carry on as planned

1841
01:53:09,792 --> 01:53:11,125
We'll get the job done

1842
01:53:12,125 --> 01:53:13,250
Get everyone out

1843
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:14,667
before the rain falls!

1844
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:21,750
Tie the detcord around those explosives

1845
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:24,792
The yellow wires are for the TNT

1846
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:27,333
Tie them with the explosives on the wall

1847
01:53:27,417 --> 01:53:28,792
There must be contact

1848
01:53:28,792 --> 01:53:31,000
to blow the pillars

1849
01:53:32,208 --> 01:53:33,583
After the wire is pulled in

1850
01:53:33,833 --> 01:53:35,500
we can detonate outside

1851
01:53:37,708 --> 01:53:40,083
The landslide sealed the entrance

1852
01:53:43,167 --> 01:53:44,458
Now what

1853
01:53:44,458 --> 01:53:46,750
The cables can't reach outside

1854
01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:48,708
We can't detonate outside

1855
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:50,000
Even if we set up

1856
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,500
all the explosives...

1857
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,875
It's pointless

1858
01:53:55,417 --> 01:53:57,708
What if we pull the cord up to the yard

1859
01:53:58,208 --> 01:54:00,417
We've used up all our wires

1860
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,458
We have to detonate in here

1861
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:13,875
How much longer

1862
01:54:14,042 --> 01:54:16,083
We only have a few minutes left!

1863
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,000
Chainsmoker, get them out

1864
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:27,792
Pull up!

1865
01:54:30,083 --> 01:54:31,292
Careful!

1866
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:33,250
Pull!

1867
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:35,750
Up!

1868
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:39,167
Careful!

1869
01:54:44,208 --> 01:54:44,875
Hey

1870
01:54:45,708 --> 01:54:46,667
Time to go

1871
01:54:48,333 --> 01:54:49,708
I'll be right behind you

1872
01:54:55,292 --> 01:54:56,750
Don't even start

1873
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:58,750
I know what you're thinking

1874
01:54:59,583 --> 01:55:01,542
All right...

1875
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:02,750
We'll finish this

1876
01:55:03,208 --> 01:55:04,333
and leave together

1877
01:55:05,458 --> 01:55:06,250
Chainsmoker, stop!

1878
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:06,875
Leave!

1879
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:08,875
Like hell I will!

1880
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:10,833
You can't do this alone!

1881
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:12,333
Let me be! I can do this alone!

1882
01:55:13,167 --> 01:55:13,833
Lunatic!

1883
01:55:14,083 --> 01:55:15,167
Leave!

1884
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,625
You've lost your mind

1885
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:18,208
Stop trying to be the hero!

1886
01:55:19,542 --> 01:55:20,833
You're sick in the head!

1887
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,458
Psycho!

1888
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,583
The wind is picking up

1889
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:30,667
The rain band has entered Hong Kong waters

1890
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,125
Hang on tight

1891
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,042
What are you doing!

1892
01:55:52,542 --> 01:55:54,042
Why are you down here!

1893
01:55:54,042 --> 01:55:55,125
Go back up!

1894
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,125
Kit Sir, I'm here to help

1895
01:55:57,125 --> 01:55:58,083
Get back up there!

1896
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:01,000
Go back up

1897
01:56:01,083 --> 01:56:02,625
You said it yourself, Chainsmoker

1898
01:56:02,625 --> 01:56:04,167
No one gets left behind

1899
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,708
If you're not leaving...

1900
01:56:05,708 --> 01:56:06,625
neither am I

1901
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:08,000
Let's finish up and leave together!

1902
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,000
Get your ass up there!

1903
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:12,042
Lunatic!

1904
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:14,208
I know we shouldn't risk our lives!

1905
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,208
But millions of lives are at risk here!

1906
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:19,125
Let me do something!

1907
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:20,417
Let me help!

1908
01:56:20,667 --> 01:56:21,625
There's no time!

1909
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:22,667
Come help!

1910
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:25,042
I got three pillars left!

1911
01:56:25,042 --> 01:56:25,875
Everyone's insane...

1912
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:27,292
Everyone's goddamn nuts!

1913
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,250
Kit Sir

1914
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:31,583
Drag that cable over!

1915
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:32,292
Okay

1916
01:56:36,083 --> 01:56:38,250
The rain band has reached the north!

1917
01:56:43,417 --> 01:56:44,375
Rain's coming!

1918
01:56:44,375 --> 01:56:46,125
Come back!

1919
01:56:50,125 --> 01:56:52,375
Po, leave before it's too late

1920
01:56:52,375 --> 01:56:53,458
Go!

1921
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:54,667
Kit Sir, what are you saying

1922
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:57,750
Honey, what's going on!

1923
01:56:58,625 --> 01:56:59,792
There's no time left!

1924
01:56:59,792 --> 01:57:01,000
Stop this madness

1925
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
and come out!

1926
01:57:02,792 --> 01:57:03,500
Kir Sir...

1927
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:04,542
Kit Li!

1928
01:57:04,542 --> 01:57:05,542
This is an order!

1929
01:57:06,458 --> 01:57:07,375
This is Simon Fan

1930
01:57:08,125 --> 01:57:08,833
Kit Li!

1931
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,083
Bring the other firefighters out!

1932
01:57:12,208 --> 01:57:13,542
Right now!

1933
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,333
Immediately!

1934
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:32,125
Jade Pavilion is ready for blasting

1935
01:58:20,042 --> 01:58:21,333
It's too late

1936
01:58:22,292 --> 01:58:24,167
Rain has started falling

1937
01:58:24,625 --> 01:58:26,458
I have to detonate from inside

1938
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,708
Simon...

1939
01:58:50,417 --> 01:58:52,000
Take care of my mother

1940
01:58:59,208 --> 01:59:00,292
Mei Yan...

1941
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:02,458
I'm sorry

1942
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:10,333
I bought this ring a long time ago

1943
01:59:13,125 --> 01:59:16,333
I was going to give it to you
at Chainsomker's dinner tonight

1944
01:59:17,292 --> 01:59:19,750
Who would've thought
things would turn out like this

1945
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,167
My ring's in here

1946
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:29,750
Keep it for me

1947
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:30,833
until I come back

1948
01:59:32,042 --> 01:59:33,417
You better come back

1949
02:00:23,583 --> 02:00:24,875
Initiate detonation!

1950
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:23,042
Radiation level at the yard

1951
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:24,542
have stabilised

1952
02:03:40,375 --> 02:03:44,000
Chainsmoker...Chu...

1953
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:13,500
Dr. Fan...

1954
02:04:14,458 --> 02:04:17,250
You're in trouble if this goes public

1955
02:04:17,708 --> 02:04:19,667
It's 7 years in jail

1956
02:04:21,375 --> 02:04:23,625
Are you sure about this

1957
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:43,167
Here they come...

1958
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,125
Today...

1959
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:55,250
We successfully prevented a catastrophe

1960
02:04:56,125 --> 02:04:57,458
I have to thank

1961
02:04:57,458 --> 02:04:59,667
DOE Corp's Peter Cowen for his support

1962
02:05:00,042 --> 02:05:02,750
in resolving this crisis

1963
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,583
This was no natural disaster!

1964
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,250
It was man-made!

1965
02:05:08,042 --> 02:05:10,375
It should not have happened

1966
02:05:13,292 --> 02:05:16,250
Every sacrifice made in this incident

1967
02:05:17,708 --> 02:05:19,500
was caused by

1968
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:22,042
your greed and selfishness, Cowen!

1969
02:05:22,875 --> 02:05:23,583
You know that law enforcement

1970
02:05:23,583 --> 02:05:25,250
can't touch me

1971
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:27,542
And you still violated
your non-disclosure agreement

1972
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:29,625
You are losing your mind

1973
02:05:30,125 --> 02:05:31,875
You'll lose everything

1974
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:36,417
I'm prepared to

1975
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:38,458
This world

1976
02:05:38,833 --> 02:05:41,250
doesn't belong to you rich pricks!

1977
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:42,708
7 million lives in Hong Kong

1978
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:45,750
nearly died by your greedy hands!

1979
02:05:46,792 --> 02:05:48,875
He caused that fire 10 years ago

1980
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,542
He got away then

1981
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:55,583
But today...

1982
02:05:57,083 --> 02:05:58,250
I refuse to believe...

1983
02:05:59,833 --> 02:06:01,125
I refuse to believe

1984
02:06:01,125 --> 02:06:03,083
that you profiteers always win!

1985
02:06:05,458 --> 02:06:06,375
You are wrong

1986
02:06:06,417 --> 02:06:07,833
You're done for!

1987
02:06:09,583 --> 02:06:11,542
You can't bring me down

1988
02:06:16,458 --> 02:06:18,458
You're done for!

1989
02:06:21,125 --> 02:06:22,750
I'm very grateful

1990
02:06:22,750 --> 02:06:24,292
that Hong Kong averted

1991
02:06:24,292 --> 02:06:26,250
a catastrophic disaster,

1992
02:06:26,417 --> 02:06:27,667
thanks to the firefighters

1993
02:06:27,667 --> 02:06:29,792
and front-line rescuers

1994
02:06:31,292 --> 02:06:34,625
who stepped up in the face of danger

1995
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:37,875
They gave their blood, their sweat...

1996
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:40,625
even their lives

1997
02:06:40,792 --> 02:06:41,750
I would like to express

1998
02:06:42,375 --> 02:06:45,208
my heartfelt gratitude to them

1999
02:06:48,042 --> 02:06:49,250
We may have avoided

2000
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:51,292
a large-scale radiation leak...

2001
02:06:51,583 --> 02:06:54,625
but we paid a dear price for it

2002
02:06:58,125 --> 02:06:59,208
We will face the problem

2003
02:06:59,583 --> 02:07:00,750
and admit our faults

2004
02:07:01,667 --> 02:07:03,250
I assure you...

2005
02:07:03,333 --> 02:07:05,167
in the remainder of my term...

2006
02:07:05,208 --> 02:07:06,750
I will do my utmost

2007
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:08,833
to restore the public's trust,

2008
02:07:08,833 --> 02:07:10,250
to build a more beautiful...

2009
02:07:10,292 --> 02:07:11,375
safer...

2010
02:07:11,375 --> 02:07:13,208
...and better Hong Kong for all

2011
02:07:14,583 --> 02:07:15,875
I hereby announce...

2012
02:07:15,875 --> 02:07:19,250
I will personally lead ICAC's investigation

2013
02:07:19,292 --> 02:07:21,250
There will be no mercy for those responsible

2014
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:23,167
There will be no mercy for those responsible

2015
02:07:23,375 --> 02:07:27,875
(The Hong Kong government conducted
an investigation into the radiation accident)

2016
02:07:27,875 --> 02:07:33,583
(The administrative order
signed by Cecilia was under judical review)

2017
02:07:34,833 --> 02:07:39,500
(Citing personal reasons, she has resigned...)

2018
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:43,250
(and is voluntarily cooperating
with ICAC's investigation)

2019
02:07:44,542 --> 02:07:47,750
(Peter Cowen and Roger Fong
were arrested for bribery...)

2020
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:53,250
(Obstruction of justice, and illegal
handling of highly dangerous materials)

2021
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:57,000
(Causing multiple injuries and deaths,
sentenced to 30 years in prison)

2022
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,083
(Due to public interest considerations,)

2023
02:08:02,083 --> 02:08:06,458
(the Department of Justice
decided to not prosecute Kelly Wong)

2024
02:08:07,833 --> 02:08:10,833
(Due to good behaviour)

2025
02:08:10,833 --> 02:08:14,250
(Simon Fan was released three years early)

2026
02:08:29,042 --> 02:08:30,208
Daddy

2027
02:08:44,167 --> 02:08:45,500
Mom

2028
02:09:25,583 --> 02:09:27,250
Let's go

2029
02:09:46,792 --> 02:09:54,750
(In the aftermath,
upwards of 1000 citizens were contaminated)

2030
02:09:59,042 --> 02:10:04,208
(The Northern District
was listed as a high-risk zone)

2031
02:10:04,208 --> 02:10:09,875
(The government has resettled
300,000 residents to other areas)

2032
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:26,583
(The radiation-affected area will be
uninhabitable for the next several decades)

2033
02:10:27,625 --> 02:10:31,833
(Though it may seem out of reach,
perhaps it's only a step away)
