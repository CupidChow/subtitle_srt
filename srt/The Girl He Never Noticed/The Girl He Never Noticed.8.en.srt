1
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
Zion!

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,360
Zion!

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,240
Is it the guy at the party?

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,080
Is it Joe?

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,600
It doesn't matter.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,680
Are you going to keep it?

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,640
How can you even ask me that?

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,680
You have options.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,880
I mean, you don't need to...

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,480
Yes, I know I have options.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm choosing to keep my baby.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,920
Zion, where are you?

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,200
Zion!

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,480
Maybe I'll take you to a park.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,840
I will do my best

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,560
to be the mother that you deserve.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,000
Here's a little hat for you.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,240
Sorry. I covered your eyes.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,600
There. That's nice.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,120
I promise

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,720
you will never spend a day
feeling like you are alone.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,560
Saph!

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,720
Yeah?

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,440
It's...

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,320
Okay.

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,160
You have to go.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,240
Okay.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,600
Hello, Jade.

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,360
I did it.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
I told my dad I...

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Slow down.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
What?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,160
Jade,

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,560
-where is Zion?
-You!

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,600
You people,
why are you doing this?

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,040
Your father...
Call him and ask him!

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,560
He must have taken Zion.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
Jade, calm down.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,320
My dad will never do this.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,680
No, call him, please!

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,080
I don't need anything
from you people.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,520
Please, just tell him to stop this.

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,400
Jade, relax, okay?

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Calm down.
You are not thinking clearly.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,880
Look, let's go home.
We'll make a police report.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,360
And everything will be okay.
Let's go.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
No!

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
You will never get it!

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,960
It's not the same for you and me.

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,240
Your life didn't spiral out of control

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,720
just because you had a random night out
with a random girl

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,120
whom you wouldn't even have noticed
on any other day.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
But mine did!

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,360
My whole life changed.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
It was a complete 180.

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,720
And it was good.

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Zion is good.

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
And he is mine!

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,920
And now, your father
wants him just like that?

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
No!

61
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,600
Hello, Don.

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,760
Don, we need to step it up.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,960
Zion is still missing!

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,040
Please update me.

65
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you okay?

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,480
I'm excellent.

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
How bad was it?

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,200
It was an emergency-board-meeting-tonight
kind of bad.

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
Why did you do that?

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,200
Do what?

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
You went for the jugular.

72
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,800
What? With the girl and the child?

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,560
How could you think
that she would give up her son?

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
It was a calculated move.

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
A calculated move based on what?

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
That a mother will willingly give up
her child for money?

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
Eros is in love with her.

78
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,080
I just wanted to show him
maybe she's not in love with him.

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, that blew up spectacularly
in your face, didn't it?

80
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,720
Yes, it did.
Thank you, grandma.

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,400
I am one.

82
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,480
Gosh.

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
I get it.
I get why you did it.

84
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,560
Look, if he marries her, then...

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,920
He can never get the respect he needs
to run what he needs to run.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
But at the same time,

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
I can't let his son grow up...

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
Without us.

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
It's spectacular, indeed.

90
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,360
I've sent all of you a photo of him.

91
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,320
We already have enough team out there
looking for him

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,640
with a list of possible locations.

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,760
We'll find him,

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,840
okay?

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
All right.

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,320
Boss, isn't that...

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,120
Is he...

98
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
He's okay.

99
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
He's full of questions,
so get ready.

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,960
All right.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
Tell Jade, okay?

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Thanks, Donovan.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,520
Hey, buddy.

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Eros Petrakis.

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
You remembered my name.

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
I googled you.

107
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,920
Is that how you got here?

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,280
I booked a taxi.

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,120
Okay, that's very smart,
but that's very dangerous.

110
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,960
You can only do that
when you get older, okay?

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
Okay.

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,680
So, now, let's get you home.

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,640
Your mum is very worried about you.

114
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,840
Is this your office?

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,520
It's not anymore.

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,280
Why?

117
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,920
Because I quit.

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,080
Why?

119
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,760
Because my boss is not that nice.

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,480
Are you my daddy?

121
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,880
My mummy said Uncle Joseph isn't.

122
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,280
No, he's not.

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,120
If you are my dad,
can you pay for my medicine?

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,400
I think Mummy is crying every night
because she cannot pay for it.

125
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,800
I want her to stop crying.

126
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
Zion?

127
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
Zion?

128
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
Zion!

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,400
I was so worried about you.

130
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,080
Where did you go?

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,600
You can never do this again, okay?

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,640
I can only do it when I grow up?

133
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,360
He said that.

134
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
Thank you, both.

135
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,280
Bye, Eros Petrakis.

136
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,240
Bye, Zion.

137
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,960
Jade.

138
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,480
Hey, Zion, come.

139
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,960
Let's go out and play.

140
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
What's wrong with Zion?

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
What do you mean?

142
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,560
He showed me this

143
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,760
and talked about his medicine.

144
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,280
You don't need to worry about that.

145
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,640
I made a choice a long time ago
to do this on my own.

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,760
Zion is my responsibility.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,320
What's his condition?

148
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,800
Juvenile dermatomyositis.

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
JDM for short.

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
Wait, it's a skin disease?

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
It's more than that.

152
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,800
It causes muscle inflammation
and leads to weak muscles.

153
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,960
It's an autoimmune disease.

154
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,880
It's treatable, but...

155
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,280
but the long-term effects
can be life-altering.

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,120
So, he's constantly in pain.

157
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,480
I didn't tell you about it
because it's not on you.

158
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,040
It's my responsibility.

159
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,920
Wait, is this for the long term?

160
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Are you done with your declarations yet?

161
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,800
The board is meeting in 30 minutes.
You can continue your tantrums there.

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
I was out of line.

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,400
And I apologise to the board too.

166
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,440
I just want my job back,

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,120
and I don't need any other job,

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,280
but just my current job.

169
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,000
Why?

170
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
I just need it.

171
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
And I need to know why.

172
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,720
Because I have responsibilities.

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,760
It's on my terms,

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
and I have three.

175
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,320
One,

176
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,040
I can't just put you back up for CEO,
not after the stunt you pulled.

177
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,200
You will be the COO to support Chloe.

178
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay.

179
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,160
Two,

180
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,400
you'll write a formal note
to the board.

181
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,520
Okay.

182
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,360
And what's the third?

183
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,760
Stop laughing.

184
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,440
Fine.

185
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,680
Laugh.

186
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
It makes sense.

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
You left.

188
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,560
You're one more person
to add to the list of those who left me.

189
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,680
Yeah. "Stop whimpering."

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,360
"Stop throwing this pity party."

191
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,040
But you know I'm right.

192
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,720
You made it look so easy.

193
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,360
You never make me ask for anything.

194
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,600
It's so impossibly painful for me
to ask anything from anyone.

195
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
He calls me his cotton candy sunset.

196
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
I haven't told him
he's my coffee pot on a rainy afternoon

197
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,120
and that he makes me feel comfortable

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,280
and warm.

199
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,240
He's not that insufferable man anymore.

200
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Oh.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,440
He kind of is,
but that's not all he is.

202
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,920
He is also gentle

203
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,280
and kind,

204
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,680
and I'm starting to believe him
when he says that he loves me.

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
What if Zion asks me when he is older?

206
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,280
I didn't give him
the love of a father.

207
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,320
I didn't let him enjoy...

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
having one.

209
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,760
What if he hates me?

210
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
I can't do that to Zion, right?

211
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
I'll tell Zion about Eros.

212
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,120
And...

213
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,920
I'll tell Eros
about the girl who loves him.

214
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,480
I withdrew the complaint.

215
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,160
It was a... move, and I'm sorry.

216
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,920
Look, I had it completely wrong,

217
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,800
I didn't realise
that Jade has already moved on,

218
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,960
so I'm bowing out.

219
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm heading back to the States.

220
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200
You love her.

221
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
Yeah, I do.

222
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
-But it doesn't...
-So, keep her happy.

223
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,400
You know what?

224
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm done playing these games.

225
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
She's all yours.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,480
Just keep her...

227
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,320
Keep them happy.

228
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,560
You are hovering.

229
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,640
Why?

230
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
It's the life of a messenger.

231
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
Huh?

232
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,400
Is it from Eros?

233
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,240
It's a new contract.

234
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,080
Okay, it says he is going to remain
as an investor here,

235
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,120
and I am under no obligation?

236
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,080
Yeah.

237
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,600
And there is a stipend?

238
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,560
Yeah.

239
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
What's the stipend about?

240
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,640
Your pay

241
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
for your expertise.

242
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,040
It's generous.

243
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,200
Yeah.

244
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
Okay, what's the catch?

245
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,440
There's no catch.

246
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,640
What's going on?

247
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,080
He's getting married.

248
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,480
Who?

249
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
Eros is getting married.

250
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,680
What's the third?

251
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,320
You'll marry the person
whom I'm choosing,

252
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
Marshall's daughter.

253
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,080
They have six generations
of the shipping dynasty.

254
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,720
Undo some of the damage
that you've done.

255
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,960
Okay

256
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,440
to all of the above,

257
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
but I have one too.

258
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,720
You don't go near my son or Jade,

259
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,400
ever.

260
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,720
Sit.

261
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,000
What...

262
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,400
What are you two doing?

263
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,880
What you two knuckleheads
should have done,

264
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,800
talk.

265
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,400
And since you two aren't,
we are going to.

266
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,160
And you need to listen.

267
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,240
Your future bride is looking for you.

268
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,960
Are you sulking?

269
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
-No.
-Because you made the choice.

270
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,400
Well, it wasn't really
much of a choice, right?

271
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,520
You know,

272
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,480
it's just an engagement party, okay?

273
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,920
You can still change your mind.

274
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,480
It's too late.

275
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,240
The engagement party is today.
Are you two crazy?

276
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,800
-Don't you love him?
-Don't you?

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,760
-Why are you so stubborn?
-You're so stubborn.

278
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,240
Why are you two telling me this?

279
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
He is the one getting married, not me.

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
Thank god I didn't listen to anyone

281
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,120
and didn't let him into my life,
or Zion's life.

282
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,920
The only reason he agreed
to get married is for Zion!

283
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,200
He quit his job

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
and walked away from everything
that was his.

285
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
And when he found out
about Zion's condition,

286
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,200
he went right back to his father.

287
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Why?

288
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,000
It's to invest in this and in you,

289
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,360
because he knows that you are too proud
to ask for any help,

290
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,360
and he knows that Zion needs it.

291
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
But I didn't ask for it.

292
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,560
You don't have to
with some people, Jade.

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He came looking for you

294
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,560
that night when you first met.

295
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,040
He spent the whole night
looking for you.

296
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,720
He spent days
trying to figure out who you were.

297
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,160
So, if you think
he is doing this out of guilt,

298
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
I think you're wrong.

299
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,080
My gosh, where did you put it?

300
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,360
-I don't know. I can't remember.
-You're the responsible one.

301
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,640
I need it.

302
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
There's so much to keep track of.

303
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Oh, I know.

304
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Yes, found it.

305
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
Let's go...

306
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
Okay.

307
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,920
Ladies and Gentlemen,

308
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,280
are you ready for the entry
of the man of the hour?

309
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,200
The most eligible bachelor is ready
to give up his throne.

310
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
Eros Petrakis,

311
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,920
get up here, buddy.

312
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,080
I heard that you were looking for me.

313
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,520
I heard you were looking for me too

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,520
on that night.

315
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
I didn't go through with it.

316
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,200
Do you want to do right by your son?

317
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,080
Whose side are you on, Mum?

318
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,160
Do you think it's easy
being your father's wife?

319
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,360
But I made that choice years ago.

320
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,680
I love your dad deeply, yes,

321
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,920
but there are times
when I go to bed hating him,

322
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,000
hating his cold-hearted choices.

323
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
But then I wake up,
and I have a choice.

324
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
Love him or hate him.

325
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,760
I choose to love him.

326
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,760
I choose to love him every day.

327
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,040
Good for you, Mum.

328
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,640
No, listen. It's not that
I fully agree with your dad on this.

329
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
But I do agree on one thing.

330
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,280
He believes he's doing
what's best for his son.

331
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Are you doing the best you can
for your son?

332
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,320
Because you have a choice.

333
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
Coffee pot.

334
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
What?

335
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,360
You're my coffee pot
on a rainy afternoon.

336
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,840
Wait, does that mean you...

337
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes.

338
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes?

339
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Yes, I do.

340
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, I want to hear you say it first.

341
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
You're going to milk this
for a long time, aren't you?

342
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
A little bit.

343
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,200
I love you.

344
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,720
Okay.

345
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
That's it?

346
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,840
Yeah, why?

347
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,480
Do you want me to say it back?

348
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Well, yeah.

349
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,960
Okay, fine.

350
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,800
I made a choice to love you today,

351
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,480
so today seems to be settled.

352
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,080
And I will make that choice
again tomorrow,

353
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
so I'll keep you posted.

354
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Eros Petrakis, as arrogant as ever.

355
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,400
Jade Aquino Ong,

356
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
you're mine forever.

357
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,040
What?

358
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,920
That's it?

359
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,040
Really?

360
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,760
Okay.

361
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,800
It looks great.

362
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
You're looking good.

363
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,520
Thank you.

364
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,720
Okay.

365
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
All right. Are you ready?

366
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,840
Ladies and Gentlemen,
friends and families,

367
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,840
we are gathered here
on this happy occasion

368
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,720
to celebrate the marriage
