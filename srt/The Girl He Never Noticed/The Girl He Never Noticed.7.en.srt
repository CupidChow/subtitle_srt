1
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,840
Eros...

2
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,480
What are you doing?

3
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,600
Jade...

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,080
Something happened at the cafÃ©.

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,880
At the cafÃ©?

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
When your staff couldn't reach you,

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,280
they contacted me and...

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,800
What happened?

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,880
Mrs Changley...

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
She passed away.

11
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,200
Her kids never came.

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,160
It seems like
they couldn't book a flight on time.

13
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,320
I had my legal team contact them.

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,880
Thank you.

15
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,000
We have to get you home.

16
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,480
How do I do this...

17
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
without her?

18
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Hey.

19
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
She trusted you.

20
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
I know that she did.

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,600
What is it?

22
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,880
I just...

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,160
I just remembered
how smitten she was

24
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,600
when she saw you
the first time you came to the cafÃ©.

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Really?

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
Yeah.

27
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,800
She said that you were yummy.

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,080
Well, I'm sure that
Mrs Changley was also a heartbreaker

29
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,680
during her heydays.

30
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,320
So, you think you're a heartbreaker?

31
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,480
Am I not?

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,160
I still had so much to learn from her.

33
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
She...

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,480
She was supposed...

35
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,760
-She wasn't supposed...
-Hey...

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
She trusted you.

37
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
She believed in you.

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,000
She even wanted
to run the cafÃ© with you,

39
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,800
so please, just trust yourself.

40
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
What...

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Hey, come here.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,240
Get the car.

43
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,600
We're home?

44
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah.

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,760
How long was I out for?

46
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320
Probably two hours.

47
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,000
Why didn't you wake me up?

48
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,320
Well, you look tired,
so I just wanted you to rest.

49
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
Thank you.

50
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
-Hey!
-Mummy...

51
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
Mummy!

52
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Why aren't you asleep yet?

53
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,400
What is this?

54
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,080
Did you have fun?

55
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,680
-Thanks for looking after him.
-Yeah.

56
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,440
-What happened?
-Nothing.

57
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
Just nothing.

58
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Thank you both for everything.

59
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
You should get some rest.

60
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,680
-You too.
-Yeah.

61
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Hey, wait.

62
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,080
That...

63
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,240
That's not nothing.

64
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
It came from me.

65
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,560
It was from inside the ring.

66
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,960
Okay, come on.

67
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Let's go, Zion.

68
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080
I think that the three of us
should talk this one out.

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
I don't get it.

70
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,160
Jade,

71
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't want to live my life with you
based on lies anymore.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
I think that we should tell him
about our arrangement.

73
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Let him know.

74
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,880
And I want you to make a choice now

75
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,400
so that both of us can hear it.

76
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,600
What arrangements?

77
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
I love you, Jade.

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,560
And I mean it.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,320
Do you love me too?

80
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,480
You shouldn't have pushed her.

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,160
Well, at least now I know,

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,160
that it will never be me.

83
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,680
She is scared, Eros.

84
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
She is terrified!

85
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,480
Of what?

86
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
-Me?
-No.

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,160
She is afraid of admitting
that she is in love with you

88
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,920
because she feels that
you are only doing this

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
because you feel guilty.

90
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
Are you?

91
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
No.

92
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,200
No!

93
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,280
What if I told you
that you will move on

94
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
and that you will meet someone?

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,240
-No.
-I'm very sure.

96
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,600
Look, it doesn't work that way, Donovan.

97
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,960
You just don't get over someone
by meeting someone new.

98
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,600
She is irreplaceable.

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
She is stubborn,

100
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,280
rude

101
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
and infuriating.

102
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
But she is kind.

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
She is smart.

104
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,440
She is funny.

105
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,680
She is super beautiful.

106
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,840
She is just irreplaceable.

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,560
Then, go and tell her that!

108
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,280
Go!

109
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
Go...

110
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,320
He is asleep.

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Thank you.

112
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,480
You should go.

113
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,560
I know about the medical bills.

114
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
It must be tough but...

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,080
I can help.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,160
It's very kind of you to offer,

117
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,240
but I have got it.

118
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,280
Please, just go.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
I know it's been a long day,

120
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,920
but can we please talk?

121
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,960
Talk about what?

122
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,200
Us.

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,800
Joe, I told you, there is no "us".

124
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
You just called it off with Eros.

125
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,680
So?

126
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,080
That doesn't mean that I want this.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
It will be different this time, I promise.

128
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
Just give me a chance.

129
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
Is anybody going to listen
to what I want?

130
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,200
Okay.

131
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,360
Okay...

132
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,720
I will listen.

133
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,280
But please just look at me

134
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,040
and tell me you don't feel
the love you had for me

135
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,400
all those years ago,

136
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
and that what we have isn't real.

137
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,880
Please, Joe.

138
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
No, Joe.

139
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,480
Stop!

140
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,960
-Stop!
-What are you trying to do?

141
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
Stop!

142
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,040
Zion!

143
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
Mummy...

144
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,080
Both of you, get out!

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,400
Now!

146
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
Did you know?

147
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,600
About what?

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
Jade's son.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,600
He's mine.

150
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,920
That's not something that you thought
I should know about?

151
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,760
Well, not until I fixed it.

152
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,640
How?

153
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,480
By marrying her.

154
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,680
Do you think that
I'm going to allow that now?

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,360
You were okay when you found out
that Jade had a son,

156
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,200
so what is your problem now?

157
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,680
This is even better.

158
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,720
If you think that this is better,

159
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,040
you are obviously not ready
for what I thought you were.

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,320
You know what?

161
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't get you.

162
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,800
Did she know you were the father
when you saw her again?

163
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,400
Are you trying to say
that she manipulated her way here?

164
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,120
If this isn't the oldest trick in the book
to get the rich guy...

165
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
-then, I don't know what...
-Stop!

166
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,280
You are not marrying her.

167
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,400
This family's name is not going
to get dragged through the mud

168
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,360
because my son is a naive fool.

169
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,000
It's either her or a seat at the table.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,480
You choose.

171
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,880
We are closed.

172
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,680
Even for me?

173
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,680
Especially for you.

174
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,400
Why am I getting the bullets?

175
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,960
He is sorry

176
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,520
I don't care.

177
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,480
He misread the situation.

178
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
It's not a good excuse.

179
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,880
He was just trying to protect you.

180
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,800
Hashtag, #EpicFail.

181
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,280
I don't need anyone to protect me.

182
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
I don't need anyone to save me.

183
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
-I don't need anyone to...
-Love you?

184
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
Should I even be drinking that?

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
Okay.

186
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,080
It's so good.

187
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,480
It makes me feel all warm inside.

188
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,480
Just like her.

189
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
Mrs Changley.

190
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm going to call it "The Changley".

191
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
Can you please tell Eros that I'm done?

192
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,800
-Jade...
-No.

193
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm done.

194
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,080
I need to...

195
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,360
There's so much to do.

196
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,680
I need to make sure
that I make this place a success.

197
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,920
I need to focus.

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,640
And I'm done
with all of these distractions.

199
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,080
He is still an investor here

200
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,960
I will find another way.

201
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,040
Okay.

202
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,400
I will stay with the company.

203
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,560
Finally, you're doing something right.

204
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,400
I'll take care of Jade.

205
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,600
What do you mean?

206
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800
I could not stop them.

207
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,680
Eros Petrakis,
we need to bring you in for questioning.

208
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,160
What is the meaning of this?

209
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,720
Assault charges.

210
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,960
Welcome!

211
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,880
Good afternoon, Jade.

212
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,080
Oh.

213
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,560
Mr Petrakis.

214
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,080
Can I get you anything?

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,200
Let's take a seat.

216
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,600
What can I do for you?

217
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,680
I know about your son.

218
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,960
Uh-huh.

219
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,880
I know that he's Eros' son too.

220
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,480
What is your endgame here?

221
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,800
What do you mean?

222
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,040
Was it the family legacy?

223
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,200
Or do you want money or what?

224
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
What are you implying?

225
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Look, Jade,

226
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,960
it's not wrong
to want the best for your boy.

227
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,280
You just need to tell me
what is it that you want.

228
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,080
Nothing from you.

229
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay.

230
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Okay, but I want something from you.

231
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,800
I want you to give up your son.

232
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,880
What?

233
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
I can't have Eros publicly claiming
that he has a child out of wedlock,

234
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
but I can take care of your son.

235
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,560
And make sure he doesn't want
for anything in his life.

236
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
But I can only do that
if I have all rights to him.

237
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,720
I don't want you
to come back in the future

238
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,400
making a claim or blackmailing Eros.

239
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,440
Do you understand me?

240
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,800
Leave before I call the cops.

241
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,680
Take your time with this
and we will talk again.

242
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,120
No, we won't.

243
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Who do you think
can take better care of your son?

244
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,480
-You or me?
-Get out!

245
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,560
You know what?

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,120
You strike me as a smart girl.

247
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,680
Think about this.

248
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm going to kill that guy.

249
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,800
Don't do anything rash.

250
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,600
Look.

251
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,800
He was the one
who reported me to the police.

252
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,360
The board is going
to lose confidence in you

253
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,080
if you keep acting this way.

254
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,600
Come on, let's just get you home.

255
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,560
Eros!

256
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,800
Eros.

257
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,360
What kind of a sick joke are you playing?

258
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,880
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,440
Sending your daddy to buy me out?

260
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,720
What?

261
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,680
What did he do?

262
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,600
Do you think that
I would sell my son to you?

263
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Jade...

264
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,360
It makes me sick to even think
that you would try...

265
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,960
Look, I didn't know
what he was going to do.

266
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Don't lie to me.

267
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,680
You said that you would leave me alone
after I made my decision.

268
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,800
This is how you...

269
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,600
I got arrested.

270
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,400
And I just got home today.

271
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
What?

272
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,080
Yeah, for assaulting Joseph.

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Did he report that?

274
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Look, Jade,

275
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,560
I wouldn't do anything like that to you.

277
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,760
And I meant it.

278
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,560
I'll just stay away from you.

279
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,880
I'll just stay away.

280
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
I want this.

281
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
What?

282
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,720
You...

283
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,800
Me...

284
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
Just here.

285
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,960
I know it's pretty selfish, but...

286
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,760
You remind me of the cotton candy sky

287
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
that I used to love.

288
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,400
Huh?

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Okay, back when I was still young,

290
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
my dad would always
bring me to the beach,

291
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,280
and I would always feel so alone.

292
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,200
But whenever I looked up
to the cotton candy sky,

293
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,400
it would always make me feel
like I was never alone,

294
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
And that's how you make me feel,

295
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,800
even if it's just for a few moments,

296
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,800
just for a few seconds.

297
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
What? Too much?

298
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I have never heard
you say so much in one go.

299
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,720
You love me.

300
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,680
It's not that simple.

301
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,880
Let's make it simple then.

302
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,880
I have to trust you completely.

303
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,360
What's stopping you?

304
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,280
I don't know.

305
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,120
I think I know what to do.

306
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
Oh, come on!

307
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,600
Did you guys start without me?

308
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,040
Different matters, you can join later.

309
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,960
Well, you can continue after I'm done

310
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,600
because, after this,

311
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,680
I won't be back here later.

312
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
Or ever.

313
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,760
What are you talking about?

314
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,960
Okay.

315
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,600
Well, dad,

316
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,360
I just wanted to discuss the price
that you were willing to offer

317
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,640
in order to buy my son, your grandson.

318
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,960
So, what was the starting offer?

319
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Eros, leave.

320
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,960
We will talk later.

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
Oh, come on.

322
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,680
Can't we have a bit of fun here?

323
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,880
And don't you think
that these guys right here

324
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,560
deserve to know
just as much as you do?

325
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,280
Well...

326
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,280
I have a son.

327
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,920
He is seven years old,

328
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,560
and I am going to marry
the mother of my son

329
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,680
whom I love very, very much.

330
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,640
But this guy right here,

331
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,280
who happens to be my dad,

332
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,280
is making me choose.

333
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,280
It's either a seat at this table

334
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,360
or her.

335
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,080
And guess what?

336
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm choosing her.

337
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
I quit.

338
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,080
Zion.

339
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,720
Zion?

340
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,320
Zion...

341
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,200
Zion!

342
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,680
Hello.

343
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,880
Hey, is Zion with you?

344
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,160
What do you mean?

345
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
I thought that you picked him up.

346
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,080
No, he is not with me.

347
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,800
He is not here either.

348
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
Zion?

349
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Zion!
