1
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,600
Hi.

2
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,560
Are you looking for Jade?
Because she is not in.

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,520
Is Zion around?

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,840
Yeah.

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,400
-Do you...
-All right, thanks.

6
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,080
Hi.

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,360
Hey, Zion.

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,480
I am Eros,

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,840
your mum's...

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,040
her friend.

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,120
But she is not here.

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,440
That's because I came here to see you.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,080
Wow, this is a very nice handshake.

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,320
It's very firm. I like it.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Thank you.
Uncle Joseph taught me that.

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
This is for you.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Thank you.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,600
Do you want coffee?

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,840
Mummy makes the best coffee.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,760
Maybe I can save that coffee
for next time, okay?

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
Can he?

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,920
Yeah.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Sure.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,640
I'll see you soon.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay. Bye.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,640
He is nice.

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,920
I don't think Mummy would agree.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
This is very impressive.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,520
The shipping industry has been facing
very fierce competition

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
in recent years,

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,640
especially in terms
of vessel size and modernisation.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,600
But ecological and sustainability aspects
play a very important role in this.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,720
And Mrs Lucas,
I believe that, with this,

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,080
our company will emerge on top
against all our competitors.

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,360
Getting engaged has certainly
made you very productive.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,560
About that, Mrs Lucas,

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
Did my dad ever talk to you about...

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,480
the succession planning?

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,360
Yes, he did,

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
and I'll be very honest with you, Eros.

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,400
I had my doubts about you.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,040
But with the way you have taken control
of the shipyard's manpower issue,

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,720
this bidding proposal,
and  of course your personal life,

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,360
I am quite impressed.

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,240
You are settling down.
It's a promising look on you.

46
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
Thank you.

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,960
Some of the other members and I
are going for dinner tomorrow.

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,320
You should join us.

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,240
They are going to be really excited,
seeing this proposal.

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah. Sure.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
And please do bring
soon-to-be Mrs Petrakis, okay?

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
Okay.

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Hey.

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,120
He was here.

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,920
Who?

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,160
Eros.

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
What?

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,560
He spoke to Zion,
gave him that toy and left.

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,440
Zion, baby,

60
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,480
can Mummy have that ship
for a while?

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
Thank you.

62
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,640
Chloe's coming next week.

63
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,320
I want to make an official announcement
when she's here.

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
About what?

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,680
About her taking over as the CEO.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Okay.

67
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,680
Okay?

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
Okay.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,760
Do what you have to do.

70
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,240
What do you mean by
"do what you have to do"?

71
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,440
If you want Chloe to take over,
then let her.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,520
You know what? I'm done.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm done with this whole thing.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Of trying to prove myself to you
every single time.

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,600
If you want me to become COO
for the rest of my life,

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
then I will become COO
for the rest of my life.

77
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
You're done
when I tell you, "You're done."

78
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Just get to that dinner.

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,520
I'm not going to leave her, you know.

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
You know she has a child,

81
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,040
and you think it's going
to endanger our family,

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,640
but I'm not leaving her.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,800
Then make sure it works out

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
for the family.

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't you dare waltz into my house
and start talking to my son.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,280
Jade, it's my...

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,520
Don't say it.

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,240
Look, I just wanted to see him, okay?

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,520
Why?

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
What do you mean why?
What kind of question is that?

91
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,200
I have every right to.

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
No, you don't.

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,760
I didn't give you any.

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,320
Jade,

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,640
we can do this the easy way...

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Or what?

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
Well,

98
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
I can fight for custody.

99
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,080
I can,

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
but I won't.

101
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
What do you want?

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay,

103
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,360
so

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,440
there is a dinner later
with all the board members.

105
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,720
I want you to come
and pretend to be my fiancee.

106
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
You see?

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
It's that easy.

108
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,520
And after that, we can break it up.

109
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,320
I'll come to dinner.
I'll pretend.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,000
But all of this ends with me.

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,920
I don't want
Zion dragged into this mess.

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,920
He is off-limits.

113
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,160
I'll pick you up at 6!

114
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,640
Sapphy,

115
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,040
he's that guy.

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,720
Remember, when Joe left,

117
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,120
you took me to a party,
and I met a guy.

118
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,880
Yeah.

119
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,600
It's Eros.

120
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh my god.

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,160
I always assumed it was Joe.

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,920
-No, we have never...
-I got it.

123
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
Eros.

124
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,520
Eros is Zion's father.

125
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,920
And now, I am fake-engaged to him,

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,720
and I don't know
how to get out of this mess.

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,320
Are you in love with him?

128
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
I mean, from the way
you were bawling your eyes out,

129
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
that wasn't desperation.

130
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,320
That was heartbreak.

131
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,080
I don't know.

132
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,600
It's all about business for him.

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,840
He just needs us
to be a picture-perfect family,

134
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,480
so he can get a seat at the table.

135
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
And now...

136
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,000
And now, Joe is back.

137
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,880
You know, I always thought
I was on Team Joe.

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,200
But I'm not.

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,840
I'm on Team Jade.

140
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,480
What does that even mean?

141
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,800
It means I'm on your side,
no matter what you choose.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,160
I thought you said it was dinner.

143
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,920
It was, until I changed it to here.

144
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,200
Well, I want to show them
that business can also be fun.

145
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,840
Do you really want me to sing?

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,280
-Yeah.
-All right, guys.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,160
Why?

148
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay, you know what?
I'm not really good at this.

149
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,720
Well looky looky

150
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,240
Jaws be dropping

151
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,840
All your sweetness, I need it

152
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
Sugar sugar

153
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,560
I've been waiting

154
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,560
No one like ya, I mean it

155
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,360
I wanna take you higher

156
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Forget about tomorrow

157
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
I can't wait

158
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,680
It's time to play

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Darling better hold tight all night

160
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,800
Cause I ain't got other plans,
don't know about you

161
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah, this feels so right, alright

162
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
So what does it take,
what does it take

163
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,320
I wanna beat your high score, yeah, yeah

164
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Ring, ding, ding

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,720
Oh, yeah, yeah

166
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
Anyway, I'm so glad we are here
instead of the same old boardroom.

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,480
Yeah, can all their dinner meetings
be like this?

168
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Eros is a genius.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,880
Too bad
he isn't taking over Markos.

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Isn't he?

171
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,040
But Mrs Lucas loves him.

172
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,480
I don't think the rest of them do.

173
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,640
They think of him
as a self-entitled brat.

174
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,520
Today is their last attempt
to evaluate him.

175
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,480
Well, it's no wonder
he is trying so hard.

176
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
Poor thing.

177
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,000
Did you see that girl, his fiancee?

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes!

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,240
She has absolutely no spark.

180
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,360
-Right!
-Yeah.

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
I thought so too.

182
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,760
It looks like they are being forced
to get married.

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,720
-Really?
-I don't know.

184
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
I wonder where they met.

185
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,640
Let's go.

186
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
You got this.

187
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Oh, I've shared a few of your plans
with the members, Eros.

188
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,120
They were very impressed,

189
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,960
and I should say that the voting
is going to go your way.

190
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, thanks, Mrs Lucas,

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
but I'm afraid that
I'm not gunning for the seat anymore.

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Yeah. Don't worry.

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,280
The acquisition plans
remain the same.

194
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
And I guess I'll work on it
while Chloe calls the shots.

195
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,240
I didn't think you had it in you
to give it up.

196
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, I'm not giving up, Mrs Lucas.
I'm just taking a step back.

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
But why?

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Well,

199
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,800
maybe I just want to get the position
based on my professional merits.

200
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
And as of now,

201
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,280
that ship has sailed.

202
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,600
No pun intended.

203
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,920
And here I thought that
you're going to do better than your dad.

204
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,240
Hey.

205
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
We need to talk.

206
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
Okay.

207
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,320
Why are you here?

208
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,880
What do you mean?

209
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
I mean, what is this dinner about?

210
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,480
Well, it's just some of the board members
and just bouncing of some new ideas.

211
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,520
No, that's not what it's about.

212
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
You are being evaluated.

213
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,960
They are giving you scores.

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,280
Why would you say that?

215
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,280
That doesn't matter.

216
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you want this or not?

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
I did.

218
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
You did?

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,280
Then why am I still here?

220
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,600
Look, you asked me
to be your fiancee to get the job.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm here as your fiancee.
Now go get the job!

222
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
It's yours, right?

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,680
You deserve this, right?

224
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
Right.

225
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,600
But look, it's complicated, okay?

226
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,040
No, it's not.

227
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,440
The company is your life
and your connection to your father.

228
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
You can't...

229
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,760
You wouldn't just give it up
just like that

230
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,400
without fighting
until your very last shot.

231
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,960
You...

232
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,480
You are the most frustrating,
irritating and stubborn man

233
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,080
whom I have ever met.

234
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,560
But you have a heart
for your employees.

235
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,800
And I have no doubt
you will be a great CEO.

236
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,800
Let's get you what you deserve
and get this over with.

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Yeah. Okay.

238
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,960
You just had to attack me a bit, huh?

239
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
But before that...

240
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,520
Cheers.

241
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
Let's go show them
what a spark looks like.

242
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,240
Ring, ding, ding

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,400
Go play a song.

244
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,200
-What?
-Go play a song.

245
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,920
-Go, play a song.
-Go.

246
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,360
It's gonna be alright, you know

247
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
It's gonna be alright, you know

248
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,960
It's all gonna be alright, you know

249
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,160
It's gonna be alright, you know

250
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,080
Let's do this together

251
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,680
Gonna get through this

252
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,720
Whatever it takes

253
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,880
Oh yeah, we can do this together

254
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,160
Walk one another
through this stormy weather

255
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
I love you.

256
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Can you please take me home?

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
Are you going to be okay?

258
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
He meant what he said.

259
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm sure he thinks
that he meant it,

260
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,120
but he didn't.

261
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,360
It's all about the business for him
and his guilt.

262
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,280
Guilt?

263
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,880
About having a son
whom he didn't know about.

264
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,440
Jade, no.

265
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't have the strength anymore,
Donovan,

266
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,240
to fall in love with an idea
and watch it walk away from me again.

267
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,160
I just don't.

268
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
Tell Eros to stay away from Zion

269
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
and me.

270
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,600
Jade.

271
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Hey.

272
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,200
Sapphy, let me in.

273
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Oh.

274
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,400
Come on.

275
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
Are you okay?

276
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,840
You were a big part of my life, Joe.

277
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,960
And I think I depended on you

278
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,840
too much.

279
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,720
Even after you left,

280
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,400
you never really left my life.

281
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,160
I allowed myself to be defined by you

282
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,440
and your rejection.

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
I didn't reject...

284
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I know that.

285
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,720
I know that now.

286
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,240
And I can finally...

287
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,080
breathe.

288
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,000
Knowing that you want me
feels like vindication.

289
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,640
And that's how I know this isn't love.

290
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,040
I can't...

291
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,680
I can't allow myself
to be defined by this anymore.

292
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,160
I need to let you go,

293
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,960
once and for all.

294
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,840
You should go.

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
I heard you gave your approval?

296
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,560
For?

297
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,720
Eros and that girl!

298
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,760
"Approval" is a strong word.

299
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,320
Are you okay with it?

300
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,680
With her becoming a part of our family?

301
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,640
Who told you anyway?

302
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,360
I have my sources.

303
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,920
Yeah, Donovan.

304
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,120
You think she's a good fit?

305
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,880
Well, like you said,
it's been a different Eros

306
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,480
ever since she came into the picture.

307
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,960
-If that's what it takes, so be it.
-Tell me something.

308
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,720
If you really want Chloe to take over,
then why are you pushing him so hard?

309
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,880
It's just like your father pushed me.

310
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,200
He didn't just hand all of this to me.

311
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,080
I had to fight for it.
I had to earn his trust.

312
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,280
Now, it's time for your son
to earn mine.

313
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
What?

314
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,880
Well, it looks like he already has.

315
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
Eros, I need to talk to you.

316
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,480
It's about Jade.

317
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,440
We will talk in the ring.

318
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,120
Eros is Zion's father?

319
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,720
Oh dear.

320
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,560
I thought these things
only happen in the movies.

321
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,000
I wish someone would write me
a happy ending.

322
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,480
And what would that look like?

323
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,840
Me, the co-owner of a successful cafe,
reunited with the father of my child,

324
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,480
and we all live happily ever after?

325
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,360
Happily ever after?

326
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,360
Do you also believe in Santa Claus?

327
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,600
I thought you were supposed
to make me feel better.

328
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,920
Who has time for that?

329
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,840
Besides, you didn't
just unload all this on me

330
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,360
so I can make you feel better.

331
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,280
You did it

332
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,720
so that I can say
that you made the right decision.

333
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,240
Which I did, right?

334
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,040
You are a smart girl
with good instincts.

335
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,480
But?

336
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
But you took the easy way out,
and you pushed everybody away.

337
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
What's your hold on Jade?

338
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,600
What do you mean?

339
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,720
I don't think that
the two of you are in love.

340
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,440
Or rather, that she loves you.

341
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Why?

342
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,800
-I know her.
-And?

343
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,920
I kissed her.

344
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,880
You don't love him?

345
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
No, I don't.

346
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,920
Not anymore,
and that's what I don't get.

347
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,960
You are not the same Jade anymore.

348
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,040
You have evolved.
Feelings change.

349
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,880
You may care about him,
but that's not the same as being in love.

350
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,400
This Jade loves somebody else.

351
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,040
Should she love you,
she won't even allow me near her.

352
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
Really?

353
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,960
Do you really think
that you know Jade so well?

354
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Did you know that I love Jade?

355
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Did you know that Zion is my son?

356
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,520
It's all just so complicated.

357
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,600
No, it's not.
Steady the heart.

358
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,320
Pay attention
to one feeling at a time,

359
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,880
and also know that feelings
are not facts.

360
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,440
You need to weigh both.

361
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,520
Then you will truly know yourself.

362
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,800
You were punched in your face?

363
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,040
Yeah.

364
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,600
You should see the other guy.

365
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
What's so urgent?

366
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,640
I'm grateful for the opportunity
that you've given me here, Uncle...

367
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,160
Mr Markos.

368
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
Thank you for doing this for my dad,

369
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
but I need to step down.

370
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,800
I can't continue working here.

371
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Why?

372
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,280
I can't work with Eros.

373
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,720
I was expecting this sooner or earlier.

374
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,920
But

375
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,480
it's up to you.

376
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,080
If this is what you want,

377
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
so be it.

378
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,600
There's something else
that I think you should know.

379
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I owe you this, at least.

380
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,680
Jade's child is your grandson.

381
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I have to go get Zion.
I'll see you tomorrow.

382
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,160
Can I say one more thing, though?

383
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,800
As much as I love
your fierce independence,

384
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
it's okay to need someone.

385
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,680
I was exactly like you at your age.

386
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,000
I was so proud
to do everything on my own

387
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,320
till I met my husband.

388
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,280
He taught me that loving someone

389
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,680
doesn't mean I have
to give up my independence.

390
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,040
You must miss him a lot.

391
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,520
Every day.

392
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
I love you, Mrs Changley.

393
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
I love you too.

394
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
Now go. Go get Zion.

395
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,080
But make time to sit alone
with your heart,

396
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,960
and pay attention.

397
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,400
And weigh the facts and feelings.

398
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,720
Yes.

399
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,080
Eros.

400
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,520
Something happened at the cafe.

401
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,760
We should tell him about our arrangement.

402
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,080
I love you, Jade.

403
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
Eros Petrakis,

404
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
we need to bring you in for questioning.

405
