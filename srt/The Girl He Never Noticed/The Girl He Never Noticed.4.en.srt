1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you ready to meet the family?

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,160
Yes?

3
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,200
Eros.

4
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,040
Joseph.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,880
Jade, this is Joseph.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,520
This is my fiancee.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,000
So, Joseph here is a family friend,

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,760
and he recently just joined our company,
and I'm not quite sure why.

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm kidding.

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,280
What do you have for me?

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,040
Oh, I just need your signature.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,400
My signature.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,560
All right.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,720
All right, we'll chat tomorrow.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,800
Sure.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,000
So, shall we?

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,920
What? Are you nervous?

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,280
No.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm ready to meet your parents.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
Just give me a minute, okay?

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,360
Hey.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
Are you ready for the big lunch?

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,040
Your chariot awaits, my lady.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Jade,

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,520
are you enjoying the food?

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Yes.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
So, Jade,

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,480
what do you do?

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
-Actually, I'm...
-She's an entrepreneur.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,320
She runs her own coffee house,
and she plans on expanding her business.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,160
Yes, it's my passion.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,760
And what about your parents?
What do they do?

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,000
My parents are no longer around.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,960
How did you two meet?

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
At work?

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,920
You were the girl
at Takashi's meeting, right?

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Yes, I... We...

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,080
We met before that.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
Years ago, actually.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,480
At a party.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,760
She called me out

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
because I look so bored
in the room full of people,

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,960
and then we started talking.

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,760
And that went on for hours.

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
It was just an instant connection.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
An instant connection.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,440
Even though we're poles apart.

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,040
Two very different worlds.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,520
But it just made sense.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,760
So much sense.

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,960
I didn't agree at first.

53
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,480
He had to convince me a lot.

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
Poor boy got wet in the rain and all.

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,840
Wow, this didn't sound
anything like my son.

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,440
I haven't seen him open up
like this before.

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,320
Eros, this is a nice look on you.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,280
Well, what can I say, Mum?

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
She brings out the best in me.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,440
Where is my son, Eros,
and what have you done with him?

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,480
I still don't get it.

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
It was years ago.

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
So, when did you get engaged?

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,600
Was it before or after
you came to work with us?

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,480
No, because Jade wanted
to get the hang of the business,

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,440
so she worked with us
for a very short while.

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,360
But now, she's back to focus
on building her own business.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
So, yeah.

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
And did you?

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
-Sorry?
-Did you?

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Did you get the hang of the business
from being with him?

72
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,680
I did.

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,040
There are people
who don't believe in him at first,

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,480
but he wins them over,

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,920
by showing up every day.

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,400
And I think that's an important quality
in business.

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,320
He probably learnt that
from you, Mr Petrakis.

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
When is the wedding?

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,560
-Not yet.
-Why not?

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Dear.

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,640
What? It's a valid question, right?

82
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,960
No, it's okay, Mum.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,560
Well, first of all, I want to focus
on our family business first

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,440
before we start our own family.

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I don't think
you need to worry about that.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
Yes, I do.

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,200
And for Chloe,
she can run our European front.

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,760
But I am here,

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,160
and I am confident
that I can lead on our home ground.

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Okay, boys, we have a guest.

91
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,360
So, enough of the shop talk, please,
and more of the passing of the salt.

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
-Eros, can you pass me the salt?
-I have made my decision.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,880
I'm going to sleep like a baby
knowing it's the right one,

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
especially after what I've seen today.

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,960
What do you mean after today?

96
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,480
Let the board vote.

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,840
I'll present for my stand,
and you'll present for Chloe.

98
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,040
I am here.

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
I've been here all this time.

100
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,920
And I am sure

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
that the board will appreciate the CEO
who knows the names

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
-of all of the workers.
-Enough!

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
Our family matters
remain within these four walls.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
I will name my successor.
That's final!

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
You haven't said a word at all.

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,960
It's really okay.

108
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
No, that was a bad idea.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,320
But thank you so much
for still agreeing,

110
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,080
and everything remains the same.

111
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
The investment.

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
The agreement.

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,680
All of that.

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Don't worry.

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,280
You don't have to worry about me.

116
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,960
I had a warm-up today.

117
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,080
I'll be prepared for anything else.

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,640
Earlier today,

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,080
I sensed a weird vibe
between you and Joseph.

120
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,880
Do you guys know each other?

121
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
No.

122
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
Oh.

123
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,080
Okay.

124
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,440
It just seemed like that.

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
All right, thank you so much for today.

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
Rest well, Dad.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Come, let me do it.

128
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,720
Remember when I told you
about the possible military posting?

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,560
The medical relief mission?

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,320
I got it.

131
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
You did?

132
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
To where?

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
The US.

134
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,960
Oh my god, that's exactly
where you wanted to go.

135
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm so happy for you!

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
I should clear this.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,440
I leave in two weeks.

138
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,680
That's...

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
soon.

140
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,320
How long will you be gone?

141
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
Three years.

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,640
Will you come back after three years?

143
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
-Yeah.
-Will you come back to me

144
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
after three years?

145
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,280
Jade, I don't want
you to wait for me.

146
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Why?

147
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,040
You are only 19.

148
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,560
Live your life.

149
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,600
So, you can live yours?

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
That's not fair.

151
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,840
I'm 28.

152
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,880
Opportunities like this
might not come around for me anymore.

153
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,280
What's not fair is
you haven't said anything until now.

154
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,120
You haven't said that you love me.

155
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,000
It's just me,

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,200
with all of these thoughts
in my head.

157
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,160
So, you're right. It's not fair.

158
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,760
You have your whole life ahead of you.

159
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,920
Yeah, I have a sick father,
a non-existent school life,

160
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,320
an imagined love life
and a whole damn life!

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
You're not alone.

162
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,560
Trust me.

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,640
You're going to be okay.

164
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
Don't go.

165
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,120
Please don't go.

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
No.

167
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
Thanks.

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,360
You remembered.

169
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,400
I always did.

170
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm sorry that
I didn't acknowledge you yesterday.

171
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,120
I was in shock,
and given the last time we spoke...

172
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,480
I have to ask before anything else.

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,160
My head's been exploding.

174
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,960
The shipping company?

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,160
Petrakis?

176
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
That's life.

177
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,520
What happened to the medical posting?

178
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,280
You're a trained military doctor.

179
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
Yeah, I am, but...

180
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,160
two months ago,
my dad had a health scare.

181
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,080
And he needs help
with the company now.

182
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,600
I finished everything I set out to do.

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,440
So, it's only right
that I come back and help.

184
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,680
So, now you are...

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm starting from scratch

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,520
and learning from the best.

187
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,400
They are actually doing us a favour
because Markos and my dad were buddies.

188
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,360
So, here I am,

189
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
back in Singapore.

190
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Yeah.

191
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,560
Here you are.

192
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,760
When did you and...

193
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
Eros?

194
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Yeah.

195
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,560
That's life.

196
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,680
Are you happy?

197
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Yes, I am.

198
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,400
That's good.

199
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,800
I've been in touch with Sapphy
here and there, and...

200
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,440
she told me about your dad.

201
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

202
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
It's okay.

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,320
Jade, I need to talk to you about...

204
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,160
I think I need to go.

205
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
-It was good seeing you, Joe.
-Mummy.

206
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,080
Mummy.

207
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
Joseph!

208
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,560
She's not in yet.

209
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Oh, that's all right.
I'll just come back later.

210
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,480
Coffee?

211
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,560
Oh, come on.

212
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,280
You're paying for the cow,
so you might as well have the milk.

213
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,560
I never got to thank you properly
for the investment.

214
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
That's all right.

215
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,880
How are things coming up?

216
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,120
It's all on Jade.

217
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,360
She has big plans.

218
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,520
She has a whole list
of renovations and ideas.

219
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,000
The funds from you really helped.

220
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
What are you getting out of it?

221
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,040
As in?

222
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,400
Why a coffee house?

223
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,160
The ROI surely wouldn't mean
anything to you.

224
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,400
Well, first of all,

225
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,760
I believe in Jade.

226
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,480
And

227
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
I just wanted to help.

228
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,720
Yeah,

229
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,760
Jade has that effect.

230
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,360
She makes you believe,

231
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,200
because she believes with all her heart.

232
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
You see,

233
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
that's the thing with heart, people.

234
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
Quixotic hope

235
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,840
can destroy them.

236
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,560
Well,

237
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,960
Don't worry about me, Mrs Changley,

238
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
because I...

239
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,160
I don't think with my heart.

240
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
I have a business brain.

241
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, sweetheart,
after all these years,

242
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
I can spot a member from Team Heart,

243
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,200
Team Brain, Team No Brain

244
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,960
or Team No Heart.

245
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
A refill?

246
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
No, it's okay,
I don't want to hold you up.

247
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,720
Don't worry, my children are ingrates.

248
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,360
My husband is dead,
and my plants are plastic.

249
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
I have all the time in the world.

250
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,920
-Hey, Zion, let's go get you changed.
-Go ahead.

251
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,200
Is he your son?

252
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,440
How old is he?

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
Seven.

254
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,120
Is he Eros's?

255
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,280
-No!
-Yes!

256
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I doubt it.

257
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh, come on, Mrs Changley.
How hard could this be?

258
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm sure that
I can make better coffee than you.

259
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
See?

260
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm able to bring it
out of the machine.

261
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,240
You know what? I'm going to
give you a run for your money.

262
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,120
All right. So, how do you do this?

263
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,800
Why do I get the sense
that you've been searching for something?

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,360
Well,

265
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
aren't we all?

266
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,720
Have you found it?

267
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
Maybe.

268
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,520
Team Heart,

269
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,920
you, my boy,
are the captain of Team Heart.

270
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,480
You just don't know it yet.

271
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,160
We are making
a three-beans coffee blend.

272
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,880
Maybe let's do, like,
a three-two-one ratio.

273
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,920
Just by myself.

274
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
Hey!

275
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
You are the worst helper.

276
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
Stop it.

277
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm going to demonstrate one time,

278
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,040
and then you have to repeat it perfectly.

279
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Open this up,

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
and then flip this.

281
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,320
-I feel like it's going to fall.
-Open this.

282
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
I don't think it's secured.

283
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,280
I think a little bit more.

284
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,400
-More.
-Yeah.

285
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
You could be a barista.

286
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,920
So, why all these dates?

287
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,640
Well, how else
are we going to convince them?

288
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,120
Seeing is believing, right?

289
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,200
Here.

290
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,320
Try this.

291
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
It's called a coffee blend.

292
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,760
You know what?
You are the coffee whisperer.

293
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,960
Not yet.

294
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,960
There is this blend
that I've been working on for years,

295
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,280
but I can't seem to find the beans.

296
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,480
Till I get that done,
I'm just your average barista.

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,560
So, this is your happy place?

298
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,440
So, this is your happy place?

299
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,920
Yes.

300
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,520
I can see why.

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,760
Thank you.

302
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,960
What for?

303
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,000
Can you hear it?

304
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,920
If you listen to the waves carefully,

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,160
you can actually hear
what it's trying to tell you.

306
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,160
Come.

307
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,720
And listen.

308
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,360
It's here.

309
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,640
Is it exactly what I wanted?

310
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,680
Yes.

311
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,280
Burundi beans,
all the way from East Africa.

312
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,000
All right, great. Thank you.

313
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,040
Oh, Catrina,

314
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,960
could you wrap it up
like a gift or something?

315
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,800
Great. Thanks.

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
What?

317
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
I had this thing.

318
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,960
I left it here.
It was this bottle cap thing.

319
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,920
It must be here somewhere.

320
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,440
Can I just get you another bottle cap?

321
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,600
No, it's okay.

322
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,280
What is it?

323
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,440
It's just this thing.
It's this silly thing that Eros gave me.

324
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,920
So, Eros got you a bottle cap?

325
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Why is it so important, may I ask?

326
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,640
It's our engagement ring.

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,320
What?

328
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,200
Oh, I mean our fake engagement ring.

329
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,640
It's not my birthday.

330
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,640
Yeah, I know it's not.

331
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,360
I've never seen you buy anything
for anyone in your life, ever.

332
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Jade?

333
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,440
I'm guessing you won't be bringing her
over for dinner anymore.

334
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,000
Come on, Mum.

335
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,480
What do you think?

336
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,680
What the heck.
He's just worried about you.

337
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, he has a terrible way
of showing it, then.

338
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
I know, but that's just him
looking out for you.

339
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,120
Are you sure about this girl?

340
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,040
Mum,

341
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,360
what kind of question is that?

342
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,640
No, I'm just asking.

343
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Here.

344
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,720
And if you are sure

345
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,320
that she is "the one",

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,480
then give her this.

347
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Yeah, it was your grandmother's.

348
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,120
Mum,

349
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,680
this is beautiful.

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,440
So, that's from me,

351
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,320
and this

352
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
is from your father.

353
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,640
Now just remember that this is him
looking out for you.

354
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,400
That's all.

355
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,480
Okay.

356
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,320
I'll take a look.

357
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,640
What the hell is this?

358
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,280
He had her followed?

359
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,040
She has a son.

360
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
Did you know that?

361
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,600
Look, Eros,

362
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,160
there is nothing wrong
with her having a child,

363
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,440
but all I'm saying is
you have to think.

364
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,720
Do you know her well enough?

365
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,000
If you do,

366
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,800
then

367
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
you have the ring.

368
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,520
So,

369
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,840
your fake husband

370
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,440
and your real ex,
but not your ex-boyfriend,

371
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
are working together?

372
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,200
Does your fake husband
know about your very real son?

373
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I...

374
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
I mean, I don't...

375
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,840
It's never come up.

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,240
Okay, I'm not meddling.

377
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,720
I'm not a meddler,

378
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,640
but don't you think that
maybe you should bring it up?

379
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
Zion is the most important person
in your life.

380
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,520
If Eros is becoming your friend,
maybe he should know that.

381
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
That's a fair point.

382
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,560
I found your ring!

383
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
I have a son.

384
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,480
Hey, Eros, did you know I have a son?

385
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,280
I have a son.

386
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,720
Hey, Eros, did I tell you I have a son?

387
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
I have a son.
I have a...

388
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,000
-Make sure...
-Hi.

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,520
that all shipments are on time,
all right?

390
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Jade,

391
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,880
I know we haven't known
each other for that long.

392
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,440
So, I think it's best
that we do this the proper way.

393
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
Read this,

394
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,480
and sign this.

395
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,600
A contract?

396
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,080
It's just for safety.

397
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,840
You mean,

398
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,120
in case I take advantage of this deal?

399
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,720
Where is this coming from?

400
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,480
Nowhere.

401
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
This is how business deals work.

402
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,320
So, this is a business deal now.

403
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Why? Isn't it one?

404
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,640
Or did you just get carried away
thinking there was something more?

405
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,240
I'll take a look at it.

406
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
I'll be right back.

407
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,680
Hey.

408
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
Not now, Joseph.

409
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,000
-What's wrong?
-Please just go.

410
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,440
What the hell?

411
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,600
It's okay.

412
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,800
It's over.

413
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,360
You don't get to say it's over.

414
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,280
I do!

415
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,520
I was the one doing you a favour.

416
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,200
I never lied to you.

417
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,480
Joseph is my past.

418
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,120
It's something
I don't like to talk about.

419
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
When you asked me,
I wasn't ready to talk about it.

420
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,280
What about your son?

421
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,200
Is he something that
you are not ready to talk about too?

422
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,640
How did you know about my son?

423
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
It doesn't matter
how I know about your son.

424
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
What matters is, you lied to me!

425
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,080
I have never lied about my son.

426
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,880
Donovan has been to my house.
Donovan's met my son.

427
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
Why do I need to lie about him?

428
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,360
Can you not argue with me
on a technicality?

429
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,640
Why does it matter to you?

430
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,680
Because it matters!

431
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,560
Why?

432
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,000
Is Joseph your...

433
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
Is Joseph his dad?

434
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,840
-What?
-Is Joseph his dad?

435
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,000
No.

436
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,680
God.

437
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,920
This is all so messed up.

438
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,400
It's way too complicated.

439
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,120
I never should have agreed to...

440
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,200
Do you want me to stop?

441
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,640
Do you want me to stop?

442
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,480
No. Hold me tight.

443
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,880
This is a mistake, okay?

444
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
A really bad mistake.

445
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,320
I really missed you, Joe.

446
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,080
No matter what happens between us,

447
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm not going anywhere this time.

448
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,840
Does that mean
you're in love with the real Jade?

449
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,120
I love her.

450
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
Does she love you?

451
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,360
You should ask her.
