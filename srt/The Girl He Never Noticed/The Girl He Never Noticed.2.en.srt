1
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
What are you doing up so early?

2
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,960
I...

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,360
wanted to wish you good luck
on your first day of work.

4
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,240
You purposely woke up at 4.30 am
to wish me luck?

5
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,520
Yeah.

6
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,280
Wait.

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
Did you just get home?

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,320
Yes.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,400
You're supposed to be taking Zion
to his physio at 10.

10
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,840
Oh, it's a good thing
that I'm up already.

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,360
Hey, good luck on your...

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,200
first day of work.

13
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Hi.

14
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,440
Who tells someone to report for work
at 5.30 in the morning

15
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
and not be awake themselves?

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,480
Didn't you have blonde hair last night?

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
I wasn't here last night.

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Then how did you get in here?

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,720
Your housekeeper let me in.

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,320
And I'm Jade, your new PA.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
So, what are you
still standing there for?

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,880
Go make me some coffee
and clean up that mess.

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,080
Why are you here?
Isn't it your first day with the devil?

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Yeah.

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm taking a break
before I head to the office.

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,360
I was at his penthouse
at 5.30 this morning.

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,640
Oh.

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,400
No. No "oh".

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
It was bad!

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,240
He-was-in-his-boxers bad!

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,680
Oh my.

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,760
Mrs Changley,

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
this is not what I want to be doing.

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,240
Okay, listen.

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,800
This is not a permanent solution, right?

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,400
I've been thinking about what you said
about giving the cafe a makeover.

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
You're going to do it?

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,320
Yes, but since I'm not getting
a sugar daddy anytime soon,

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,200
I need to find another way
to get the money.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,520
You're not that old.

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,200
You need a sugar granddaddy.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,040
At my age, I'll need
a sugar great-granddaddy.

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,280
So,

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,120
what's the plan?

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,880
Well, I'll just do it
the old-fashioned way.

47
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,280
Go to the bank and beg for money.

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,880
So, I've been working
on a business plan,

49
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,800
but it's missing something.

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,880
What?

51
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
So, I thought, and I thought,
and it finally hit me.

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,040
The thing that will make the bank say,
"Take all our money!"

53
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,160
What is it?

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,520
You.

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
-Me?
-Yes, you're my secret weapon.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,200
You're like the "Coffee Whisperer".

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,680
I don't think you should say that
in your business plan.

58
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,400
I need you to come with me
to meet the bank employees.

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,240
You can tell them
all about how you make all your coffee,

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,880
and we should just bring
all your equipment

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,600
and let them try your coffee.

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm a genius!

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
Slow down.
What does that mean?

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,400
I'll make you a partner in the cafe.

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,720
You don't have to put in any money.

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,480
Your investment will be the talent!

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
Really?

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
But...

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,920
No, I need a steady pay cheque
every month,

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,640
and we both know
you can't afford that right now.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,040
That will all change
when the cafe's a hit.

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
But I just started this new job.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,480
All right. I'm not asking you to quit.

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,000
What I'm saying is,
you should explore the opportunity

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,800
which potentially
could let you be your own boss.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
Okay, I'm going to make an appointment
with the bank.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
I have to go.

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,240
All right, I'll let you know
when I set it up.

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
-Go...
-Okay.

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,120
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,640
Hi.

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm Jade.

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm new here.

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
Welcome, I guess.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,720
And you are?

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
Busy.

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Oh, thank god.

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,840
I'm sorry. I stepped out
for, like, five minutes before...

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,800
Jade.

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,200
I have a meeting at 3 this afternoon,
so make sure that the boardroom is ready.

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
What does that mean?

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,280
It means that
I have a very important meeting later

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
with a Japanese CEO.

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
So, make sure
that the boardroom is ready!

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,400
How clear can I be?

96
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
Ready?

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,600
Yeah.

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,880
I'll be back by 2.45,

99
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
and Japanese people
hate people being late.

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
So, be on time.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
Where do you get your clothes?

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Wait, let me guess.

103
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,720
The thrift store.

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
Or...

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,320
the charity shop.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,520
Yeah, thrift store it is.

107
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,760
I think you look nice.

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
Hi again.

109
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
I'm still busy.

110
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,280
Yeah, but I was wondering

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,040
if you knew
how to get the boardroom ready

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,840
for a meeting
with a Japanese CEO?

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,520
He told you to do that?

114
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,160
It's my first day, and I...

115
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Yes. You said that.

116
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Look, it's not my job
to tell you how to do yours.

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
Okay, but maybe you could...

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,320
Just make the boardroom
look welcoming to a Japanese person.

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,520
Mr Takashi and his associates are here.

120
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Hello, Mr Takashi.

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,200
You're early.

122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
No, we are not.

123
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,600
Our appointment is at 2.

124
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,280
Is this how you're getting ready
to meet the Japanese CEO?

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,040
Yeah, to shut up those board members

126
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,160
who keep saying that
I'm just my father's puppet.

127
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,880
They've been trying to book a meeting
with him for months,

128
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,320
and guess who convinced them
to come to our office this afternoon?

129
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,640
I think the board
had better start taking you seriously.

130
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah, and dear old dad too!

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Okay, I'm done.

132
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,680
And you're late.

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
No, I'm not.

134
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,960
Hello?

135
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,800
What?

136
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,000
What the hell happened?
What did you do?

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
I didn't do anything.

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,360
Mr Takashi said
the meeting was at 2 pm,

139
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
not 3!

140
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Mr Takashi! How are you?

141
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened, sir.

142
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,760
We had been waiting for almost one hour.

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,520
Well, let's get started then.

144
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
We have another appointment
to attend to.

145
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Oh, come on, Mr Takashi.

146
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,000
It was all a miscommunication.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,160
Weren't you ever late
for a meeting before?

148
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Good afternoon.

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,680
What the hell?

150
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,400
The Japanese are very sensitive
about business etiquette.

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,040
Oh, so now you're giving me a talk
about business etiquette?

152
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,080
No. Of course not.

153
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,360
-I'm just trying to say that...
-What happened?

154
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,760
I just got a call from Mr Takashi.

155
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

156
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh, you're going to fix it?

157
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,920
You're always fixing everything.

158
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,120
Here's an idea.
Get it right to start with!

159
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,800
It wasn't my fault.

160
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh, it's never your fault.

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm sorry, I can...

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,920
Get out.

163
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,960
Just get out.

164
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
Are you okay?

165
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,800
It's not exactly
the best first day at work.

166
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,480
This is a job that I didn't even want
in the first place.

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,680
Nobody wants to work, do they?

168
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
But they need to.

169
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
Couldn't be more true in my case.

170
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,520
Come.

171
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,680
Let me give you a ride home.

172
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,200
I should quit.

173
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,240
And do what?

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,480
Go back to the cafe?

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
You need this job.

176
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Right?

177
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Look.

178
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Whatever happened will blow over.

179
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,400
Why is he like that?

180
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
Eros?

181
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,360
He has everything and more,

182
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,000
but he's always so angry
and mean to people.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,200
And it wasn't my fault!

184
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,760
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

185
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,280
That makes me feel
so much better about him.

186
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,520
You've met Petrakis Senior, right?

187
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah, but just because
your father's scary

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,720
doesn't mean that
you need to be like that too.

189
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,920
It's more complicated than that.

190
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,280
It's not easy
being the son of a billionaire.

191
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
Surely, those with no money
have bigger problems.

192
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,200
Jade,

193
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,600
I need you to come to the house.

194
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
Now.

195
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,400
Well, if I could,
I wouldn't be calling you, would I?

196
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
Well, it's about time.

197
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,600
I got here as fast as I could.

198
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,760
All right.

199
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,600
So, how do we fix your screw-up?

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,920
Well, I didn't screw up.

201
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,840
So, who did?

202
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,600
Me?

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,800
Well, I tried calling you many times
to let you know the meeting was earlier,

204
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,960
but you weren't picking up, and...

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,840
And you know how important
that meeting was.

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
Look,

207
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,840
I really need this job.

208
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,240
So, whatever you need me to do...

209
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,960
"Whatever" is a big, big promise,

210
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
darling.

211
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,440
Are you sure?

212
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,600
You know what?

213
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,440
You remind me of someone so much.

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
I mean,

215
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,440
the hair,

216
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,080
the same style,

217
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,560
and the way you talk.

218
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,520
What are you talking about?

219
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

220
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
Yes.

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
Huh?

222
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,400
Yes.

223
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,160
It's not easy
being the son of a billionaire.

224
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,440
So, is "His Highness" happy now?

225
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,640
We didn't get anything done.

226
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,040
He was just rambling.

227
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,200
What?

228
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,080
He was drunk.
He was being a jerk.

229
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,920
And in the end,
he just passed out.

230
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,400
So, he called you over
to wallow in self-pity?

231
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,760
I guess.

232
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,640
Doesn't he have any friends for that?

233
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,800
What a waste of your time.
You really shouldn't have gone.

234
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,120
I went because I need this job.

235
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
What are you doing?

236
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,360
What?

237
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,160
You're friends with him?

238
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
Is it a crime?

239
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,680
No.

240
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,040
Look, Joseph sent me a request
some time back.

241
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,560
I accepted it.
We chatted a little.

242
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,760
That's all.

243
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
What, you don't want me to?

244
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,800
I don't know, Saph.

245
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
After what he did to me?

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,520
I don't know.

247
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,560
Don't you think it's time
that you guys talk things out?

248
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
And, I don't know, reconnect

249
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,840
with whatever that's been happening
in your life right now?

250
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,000
Maybe, it might help.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,440
Does he even know about Zion?

252
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,760
You know it's complicated.

253
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,640
And besides, he's the one who left.

254
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,360
-Yes, but...
-I don't want to talk about it.

255
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
It's in the past,
and I want it to stay that way.

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
Is it really?

257
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,280
I need to do some work.

258
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
It's late. Go get some sleep.

259
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,640
I can't.

260
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,680
My job may be on the line.

261
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
Mr Petrakis!

262
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
Mr Takashi's here for your meeting.

263
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
Mr Takashi.

264
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,040
Thank you so much for your time,

265
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,920
and I'm really sorry
for what happened in our last meeting.

266
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I hope that you can forgive me.

267
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,400
Your assistant told me
how sorry you were,

268
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
and that I would not regret
giving you another chance.

269
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
You have a bright girl working for you.

270
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,280
She even knows my home town in Japan.

271
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm just fascinated
with its history and culture.

272
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,520
She is certainly
full of surprises, sir.

273
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,200
Here's a gift from Mr Petrakis.

274
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,880
Here. This is for you.

275
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,160
Please open it.

276
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,480
Is this...

277
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Sumiyaki coffee.

278
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes!

279
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,680
It's roasted using binchotan charcoals.

280
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,560
This is from
the Surada Shimada plantation in Brazil

281
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,960
-made by the...
-The Japanese descendants in Brazil.

282
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,680
Exactly!

283
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,040
Mr Petrakis knew you were looking
for this blend here in Singapore.

284
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Oh.

285
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
Thank you.

286
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
You have made my heart truly smile.

287
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,040
Sir, it is my pleasure.

288
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,000
So,

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,840
shall we get started?

290
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,920
Dad?

291
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,360
Oh, don't mind me.

292
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,760
I'm just here to observe.

293
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,000
All right then.

294
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,960
Sir, let's go to the boardroom.

295
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,520
Excuse me.

296
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,080
So, what does the future
of green shipping look like?

297
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Well, Mr Takashi,

298
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,360
with the partnership
of Petrakis Shipping Company

299
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,000
and, of course,
Golden Steel Corporation,

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,080
I believe that we...

301
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,160
We are the future.

302
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Maybe I can try my best
to explain the business plan to you.

303
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,320
So...

304
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,720
I will speak to my board soon
and let you know.

305
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,600
Thank you for today.

306
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,880
I appreciate the initiative and care
that you show for your potential partners.

307
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,880
Thank you so much, Mr Takashi.

308
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,320
And this is what you can always expect
when you do business with the Petrakis.

309
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,800
I'll be in touch.

310
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm looking forward to it, sir.

311
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,840
Jade will see you out.

312
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,680
Well, Dad,

313
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,000
I think that went very well.

314
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,880
It only went well

315
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,720
because you were lucky
and hired a capable assistant.

316
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,080
You had no idea
about this meeting, did you?

317
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,320
Of course I did.

318
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,640
You might have fooled Mr Takashi,
but I know you.

319
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,920
You're clueless.

320
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,200
Don't ever
pull a stunt like that again.

321
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,920
Are you sad, Mummy?

322
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,080
No, sweetheart.

323
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm just tired.

324
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
From work?

325
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,120
I had a rough day.

326
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
What happened?

327
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,800
My boss wasn't very nice to me.

328
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,080
Why?

329
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,640
I have no idea.

330
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,360
Were you naughty?

331
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,520
No!

332
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
I was very good.

333
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,920
Did you tell him that he was wrong?

334
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,400
Why not?

335
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,800
What are you doing here?

336
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,880
I don't understand
why you're angry with me.

337
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,680
So, this couldn't wait until morning?

338
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
No.

339
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480
All right, so why didn't you tell me
what you were going to do?

340
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,880
Well, at the meeting,
it all happened so fast.

341
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,760
I didn't know that
Mr Takashi was going off to Tokyo tonight.

342
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,800
So, when he agreed to the meeting,
I was scrambling to get everything ready.

343
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,480
You made me look like a fool.

344
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,840
In front of my father!

345
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,200
I thought the whole point
was to save the deal as a team.

346
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,040
You are such a simple girl.

347
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,400
With a simple mind!

348
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,680
Excuse me?

349
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,760
You have no idea about anything, do you?

350
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I was trying to help you.

351
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,560
Well, isn't that
the job of a personal assistant?

352
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,960
Do you want a medal or something?

353
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,560
Well, a "thank you" would be nice.

354
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,400
So, now you want me to thank you.

355
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,880
You know what? You are so funny.

356
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
You wouldn't have to thank me

357
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,920
if you thought about
doing what I did yourself.

358
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,560
That's your job!

359
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,120
Excuse me?

360
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,960
I said, do your damn job!

361
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
No wonder
your father doesn't respect you,

362
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
and stop taking it out on me!

363
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
Enough!

364
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,760
You're fired!

365
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,840
You don't get to fire me.

366
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,200
I quit.

367
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,800
Unfortunately,

368
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
it's only going to get worse from here on.

369
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,720
Chloe's getting married.

370
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,040
In every way,
she is saving this company's legacy.

371
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,160
Well, I'm going to get married too.

372
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,800
You don't even have a girlfriend.

373
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,160
No, it's easy.

374
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,480
There are lots of girls.

375
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you doing out here

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,080
in the rain?

377
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,320
Can we talk?

378
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
