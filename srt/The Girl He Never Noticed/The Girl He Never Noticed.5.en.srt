1
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,040
I love you.

2
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,720
Love happens.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Oh my god.
How cliche can you get?

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,480
You have tears, ice cream
and a romantic movie?

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,240
Leave me alone.

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
Has Joe left?

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,000
His plane departed two hours ago.

8
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,600
He's gone.

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,800
You won't find him in there, you know.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,040
That's it.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
You are coming with me.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,640
To get more ice cream?

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,480
We are going to a party.

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,040
-No, I don't want to go.
-Yes!

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,760
-Yes, you're coming.
-No. Please don't.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,200
-Come.
-No!

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,760
You're so mean.

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
You'll thank me later.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,560
You've been crying
in that room for two weeks.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm surprised it hasn't flooded.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,120
My heart is broken.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,360
I should be allowed to flood
the whole city if I want to.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,600
You need a distraction.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,240
Let's have some fun,
and meet some new boys.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,600
-I'm going home.
-Hey.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,680
Don't you dare.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
Do you want me to tackle you
to the floor again?

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Give me your mask.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,880
I'm going to put this on.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
We're going to go in there.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,960
And you will forget

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,080
-Joseph ever existed.
-I can't wait.

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
Come on, let's go!

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
Yo, Max.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,560
The party is going to be over
before we even get in.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,240
Hey.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,800
Excuse me?

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,960
What?

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,440
An apology would be nice.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Yeah.

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,840
How about I save you
from queuing with all the peasants here?

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
No, thank you.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
She means yes, thank you.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,080
-No, I'm staying here.
-Just go.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,480
Yes, thank you.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
Hello!

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm thirsty!

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,920
Hello, my good man!

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,680
Am I "invincible"?

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,960
Please. Hi.

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
I just need a...

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,520
A bottle of champagne, please.

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Great. It's you again.

54
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,040
I was here first.

55
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,640
And your point is?

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Well, you're rude.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,160
And you...

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,400
are pretty.

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Oh.

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,320
Well...

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
You'll never find out

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,200
because I'm not taking
this mask off for you.

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,160
I didn't ask you to.

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,160
You must be rich.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,920
That's why you think
you can just be rude to people.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,080
Oh, take it easy, pretty eyes.

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,240
Do you want a drink?

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,440
Okay.

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
Hey,

70
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,240
you could be a distraction, right?

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,920
I'm supposed to find one.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,160
What?

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,240
Yes.

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,520
Cheers.

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,920
Why do I get the feeling
that you don't belong here?

76
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, I have an invite, okay?

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,480
It's my sister's invite,
but it still counts.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,200
Yeah, well, this isn't
normally your scene, right?

79
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
What gave it away?

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,560
Is it the off-the-rack clothes?

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,120
That's effortless beauty there.

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,960
Shouldn't you be getting back
to your girlfriends?

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,040
Something tells me
that it'll be more interesting

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,560
if I stick around.

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,720
Is that your way of telling me

86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,520
that I should start saying things
to impress you now?

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
Don't worry.

88
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
You already have.

89
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,760
You must think girls just fall
all over you all the time.

90
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,800
You know what?

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
-Why can't you just take a compliment...
-Kiss me.

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Do you want me to stop?

93
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,600
No. Hold me tight.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,160
You know what?

95
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,840
You never told me your name.

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,400
And I kind of like your hair like this.

97
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,160
I need to go.

98
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,600
What?

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
Come on, don't tell me
you're going to leave me again?

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
I should never have...

101
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Wait.

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't tell me
you've known all this time too.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
What do you mean by "too"?

104
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
You knew?

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,520
Well, I suspected it
the first time we saw each other,

106
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
and then as time went by
and the more time we spent together,

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
the more convinced I was,

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,400
especially after this night.

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Oh my god.

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,640
Look, I was trying to look for you
after that night, okay?

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
But I couldn't.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,560
I cannot talk about this right now.
I need to get home to my son.

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,880
Yeah, but you never
answered my question.

114
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,760
-Did you know all this time too?
-No, of course not!

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,120
If I knew, I never would have...

116
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,400
Would never have what?

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,160
This was a mistake, okay?

118
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,400
A really bad mistake.

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
Put it here.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Mummy.

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm so happy to see you.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
Are you okay?

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,120
What are you doing here?

124
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,120
I happened
to be in the neighbourhood,

125
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
so I thought I'd drop by and say hi.

126
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
-Hi.
-Hi.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,040
Yeah, you were
right in the neighbourhood.

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
Uncle Joseph brought me
this cool jigsaw puzzle.

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,760
We are almost halfway done.

130
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,760
That's nice.

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,800
Come play with us, Mummy.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,880
Okay.

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,040
Look at you guys.

134
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,720
Thanks for letting me stay for dinner.

135
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,920
Zion wanted you to.

136
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,640
He's a great kid.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,640
You've done a great job raising him.

138
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,920
I can't imagine how hard it's been for you
to raise him by yourself,

139
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,280
especially with his health condition.

140
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,920
Sapphy helps out.

141
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,560
Well,

143
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,040
you left.

144
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm here now.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
What do you want from me?

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,320
Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

147
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, it's too late for that.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
You broke my heart.

149
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,920
I thought I was doing the right thing.

150
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,240
How could that be the right thing?

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
I promised your dad
that I would take care of you.

152
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,280
Getting into a relationship with you
when I wasn't even going to be around

153
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,840
doesn't seem like taking care of you.

154
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,520
I had to go out
and make something of myself

155
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,400
before I could be anything to anyone,

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
especially you.

157
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,320
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

158
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,240
I really missed you, Joe.

159
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,760
I really missed you too.

160
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,320
Is Uncle Joseph coming?

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,400
You like him, huh?

162
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,160
He's fun.

163
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,880
He told me how to fold an airplane.

164
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
Is that what
you guys were doing last night

165
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,520
when I was making dinner?

166
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,120
Is this what it's like?

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
What's what like?

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,520
To have a daddy.

169
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,920
Oh, please. I'm sorry.

170
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,040
-I didn't think that was going to hit.
-I'm fine.

171
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,080
Oh. Okay.

172
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
-Let's go.
-Okay.

173
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Okay. That's it.

174
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't want to lose my bonus
for the year.

175
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,480
What's wrong with you today?

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
Is it Jade?

177
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,360
You know what?
I don't understand her.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,560
What did you do now?

179
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Okay, what did she do now?

180
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,560
Do you remember
that night from years ago?

181
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
There was that girl that I met
at this masquerade ball?

182
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
You were driving that whole night,
just trying to look for her.

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,040
That, I remember.

184
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,800
You said you fell in love.

185
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,160
That was a drunk and babbling Eros.

186
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,520
But, of course,

187
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,120
the drunk and babbling Eros
never said those words again.

188
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,800
Well, yeah. Guess what?

189
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,120
I found her.

190
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,440
What? The girl in the mask?

191
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,320
Yeah.

192
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Who?

193
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,560
Jade.

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,640
But you said you never saw her face.

195
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Does she know?

196
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
Well, now she does.

197
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,120
Well, if you blabbered
that you were in love with...

198
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,200
the masked Jade,

199
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,320
does that mean
you're in love with the real Jade?

200
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,080
This should be enough to get you
through the afternoon at least.

201
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,520
You're the best, Jade.

202
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
The baby kept me up all night,

203
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,960
and I have a presentation
to do in an hour.

204
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Good luck.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
Thanks.

206
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Hi.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Don't you have to be at work?

208
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,640
I'm "latte", but it's okay.

209
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,040
What are you and Zion doing
for dinner tonight?

210
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,720
I wish you just texted.

211
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't think it's a good idea

212
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,400
for you to be spending
so much time with Zion.

213
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
Why not?

214
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,520
I don't want him to get too attached,

215
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
in case...

216
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,480
I thought we were good
after our talk last night.

217
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,960
We are.

218
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
It's just...

219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,640
It's just really complicated
at the moment.

220
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm not pressuring you
for anything you're not ready for.

221
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,800
I just want to be there
for you and Zion.

222
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm engaged, Joe.

223
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,040
I know, but is he really the one?

224
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
Jade.

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,680
Wait.

226
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm back,

227
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,640
and I'm not going to let you go
without a fight.

228
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,600
No matter what happens between us,

229
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm not going anywhere this time.

230
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,680
Are you okay?

231
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm not sure.

232
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,280
If you were me,

233
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,320
would you tell Zion's father about Zion?

234
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,400
I have so many questions,
but the answer is yes.

235
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,880
It's complicated.

236
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,000
You should tell him.
I've been saying that from the beginning.

237
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,760
You know I couldn't
even if I wanted to back then.

238
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,360
I didn't even know who he was.

239
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
Now that you know, tell him.

240
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,080
No matter what,
he deserves to know.

241
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,560
And he can help
with Zion's medical bills.

242
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,440
I can take care of that myself.

243
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Okay, fine.

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,000
But think of Zion.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,720
Doesn't he deserve to know
who his father is?

246
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,400
You know,

247
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,680
I don't even know your name.

248
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,840
We are just two strangers
who happen to find each other one night.

249
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,440
We'll probably
never see each other again.

250
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
Wait, what?

251
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
Why?

252
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,160
I mean, come on,

253
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
it was just more than
just some fun, right?

254
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,640
Come on, let me take you out on a date.

255
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,800
I know your type.

256
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
You probably have
girls lining up for you.

257
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,840
You probably
won't remember me tomorrow.

258
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
Slow down.

259
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Please don't follow me.

260
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,520
You are not what I need
right now, okay?

261
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,760
Wait.

262
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520
I can't see you again.

263
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,920
Hey, where have you been?

264
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,200
I want to go home, please.

265
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,280
Oh.

266
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,400
Okay.

267
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh, hey.

268
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,080
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

269
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,480
Come join us.
Let's have a drink.

270
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,880
Eros.

271
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,000
Joseph,

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,160
I need you to cover for me
for the Henderson meeting.

273
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,320
But I haven't prepped anything for it yet.

274
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,760
Prep now, then.

275
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,840
Sure.

276
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,080
By the way,

277
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,520
how did you know Jade?

278
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,640
I've known her since we were young.

279
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,600
She's very special to me.

280
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200
And you didn't think
that you had to mention that to me

281
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,720
the moment
I introduced the both of you?

282
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,400
It wasn't my place to say.

283
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,160
You said "special".

284
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,800
How is she special?

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
I love her.

286
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,440
Does she love you?

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,000
You should ask her.

288
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,080
The meeting is in one hour.

289
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,440
Make sure
that the deal goes through.

290
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,680
You're dismissed.

291
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,400
Yes.

292
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Why did you freak out last night?

293
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,720
I guess I was in shock or something.

294
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,200
But you reacted
like it was such a bad thing.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,680
Hey, look.

296
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm really glad
to have found you again.

297
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,760
This is so messed up.

298
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
What?

299
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,880
Do you think
I'm just good enough for a fling?

300
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,800
And not anything more?

301
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
No, that's not it.

302
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,280
Then what?

303
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm a good pay cheque?

304
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,360
No! I...

305
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,720
We have a son.

306
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,440
Say something.

307
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,120
What's going on?

308
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Look, I was wondering if he was mine.

309
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,800
I mean, the timing...

310
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,440
The timing is perfect.

311
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,760
But then, when you said it out loud,

312
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,440
it just became real.

313
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,880
So, you're panicking now?

314
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,800
Honestly, no, but...

315
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,600
I kind of feel bad because
you went through everything on your own.

316
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,480
But now, you don't have to.

317
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,800
Now, we can be a family.

318
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,880
Just like that?

319
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,920
Yeah. Why not?

320
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,280
You think that we can just
instantly become a happy family?

321
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,600
He has no idea about you.

322
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Look, Jade.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,160
We have all the time in the world now
for him to get to know me.

324
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,760
Is this about impressing your father
and the board of directors?

325
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
I cannot believe you think that.

326
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,560
Well, you had me be your fake fiancee
for that exact reason.

327
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,800
Is this because of Joseph?

328
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
No.

329
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,920
Do you love him?

330
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
No...

331
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,800
I don't know.

332
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,720
But I do know
that I don't need this in my life.

333
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,400
Look, Jade, it's not just your life, okay?

334
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,680
It is Zion's too.

335
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
And I am his father.

336
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,960
Exactly.

337
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,280
What do you mean?

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,360
You don't think
I can be a good father to Zion.

339
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
I'm just...

341
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm not going to risk making his life
any harder than it already is.

342
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,120
And you're not even going to give me
a chance to prove myself?

343
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,200
Then,

344
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
let me out of our agreement.

345
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,960
We should just go our separate ways.

346
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,160
Maybe...

347
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,680
Maybe when Zion is older,
we can tell him about you.

348
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm just...

350
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm not going to risk making his life
any harder than it already is.

351
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,320
We should just go our separate ways.

352
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,200
Maybe...

353
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,640
Maybe when Zion is older,
we can tell him about you.

354
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,040
I kind of feel bad because
you went through everything on your own.

355
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,720
But now, you don't have to.

356
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,120
Now, we can be a family.

357
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,080
I just have to convince her
that I love her.

358
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, if all else fails,
just get on your knees and grovel.

359
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,400
You know what?

360
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,120
It's a good thing that I'm wearing
my least expensive pants right now.

361
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,200
Wish me luck.

362
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,560
I really do.

363
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Maybe it is not what it looks like.

364
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,480
Don't you think that
they look like one little happy family?

365
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
Let's go.

366
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,480
Hi.

367
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Chloe's coming next week.

368
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,600
If you want Chloe to take over,

369
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
then let her.

370
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,280
Don't you dare walk into my house

371
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
and start talking to my son.

372
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
It's all about business for him.

373
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,880
He just needs us

374
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,320
to be a picture-perfect family.

375
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,400
You don't love him.

376
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
I kissed her.
