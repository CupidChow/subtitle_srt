1
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,880
If you're going to apologise,
don't bother.

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760
Just get back to work.

3
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,120
Last night,

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,160
I said some things that I regret.

5
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,600
You made me angry, annoyed

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
and helpless.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,840
You made me feel small,
and I lashed out.

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
That was no way to speak to my boss.

9
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,000
But you bring out the worst in me.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,960
This toxic work environment?

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,320
I left a safe job to come work here,
and yes, I came for the money,

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,400
but that doesn't mean
that I will give up my dignity.

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,680
So, you don't get to fire me.

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
I quit.

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,560
And you can either be a boss or a leader,

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
but I suggest you learn
to be a human being first.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
Hey, Sapphy, guess what?

18
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Hey, Zion had a fall.
We're on the way to the clinic.

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
What happened?

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
Nothing.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay, I may have made her angry.

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,880
About?

23
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,960
Well...

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,040
I may have fired her.

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
What?

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,120
Look, Donovan.

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,400
Words were said. Tempers flared.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,800
It wasn't pretty at all, all right?

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
But

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I think I made the right decision.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
She doesn't get me, okay?

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,760
And we don't work well together.

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Maybe she's the only one who does.

34
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,360
I haven't seen anyone stand up to you.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,560
Hell, even I don't.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,080
That was quite a sight.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Yeah, okay, I'll get you your coffee.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,480
Mr Petrakis wants
you to take a look at this.

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
A new PA?

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,200
Yes.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,360
He wants you to take him
under your wing

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
and to show him the ropes.

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait, it's a "he"?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
It's your Uncle Steven's son.

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,080
He will report here next week.

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,120
Look,

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,080
I get to choose who my PA is,
all right?

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,040
Apparently not.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,280
How are you feeling, baby?

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,680
It's okay, Mummy.
It's not that painful anymore.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,080
Zion, why don't you take a seat outside
while I talk to your mother?

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
Let's go. Okay.

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,240
His legs gave way,
and he lost balance.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,680
Gave way?

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,680
He lost sensation in his leg,
and it might have made him feel weak.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
Is that normal?

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
It's one of the rarer symptoms.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
What?

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,920
His muscles are degenerating
at a faster rate.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,320
He's going to need specialist care.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,520
And if he doesn't get it?

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,560
Unfortunately,
it's only going to get worse from now on.

63
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,480
We can get you
financial assistance to help you.

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,160
-Jade?
-Yes.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
Okay.

66
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,600
I'll figure it out.

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Thank you, Dr Fauziah.

68
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,360
-Mrs...
-Sorry, ma'am.

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,080
Your card has been declined.

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,920
Here. Try this one.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Are you all right, Mrs Changley?

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,560
Why were you
at the medical centre earlier?

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
No, I wasn't.

76
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,240
What were you doing there?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,680
Let me make us
a cup of coffee first.

78
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,520
So, here I am now,
without a job,

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,680
and I have to find a way
to put Zion in specialist care.

80
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
I'm going to spit
in that man-child's coffee

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,600
the next time he dares to come in here.

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,560
What's on your mind?

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,640
I missed our meeting.

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,200
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,520
Well, I did have to
put on the extra charm,

86
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,920
but it's okay.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
I might have an idea
for the business plan.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
I think I can make it work,
if you let me come back here?

89
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Of course, you're always welcomed back.

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
But are you sure you can handle it?

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,760
Yeah!

92
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Well then, let's get us a bank loan.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,760
Eros Petrakis.

94
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,880
I mean, what kind of a name
is that anyway?

95
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,200
I was told

96
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
it's the Greek God of...

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,640
of erotic love.

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,920
You still haven't told me
what you're doing there.

99
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,840
Oh.

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
Here's your pay cheque.

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Okay, thanks.

102
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,160
Don't you guys
normally just mail these?

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,120
How have you been?

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,200
Do you want to try some coffee?

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,040
Yes, of course, young man.

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
Did you make this yourself?

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,240
My mummy did.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,880
This tastes like a hug in a cup.

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,360
Thank you, Zion.

111
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,560
It's a new blend that I'm working on,
with Mexican and Ethiopian coffee beans.

112
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,440
Why aren't you running
your own coffee house?

113
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,720
Actually, I've been helping
Mrs Changley rebrand her cafe.

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
I have a whole new business plan.

115
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
If everything goes well,

116
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,480
I might actually be running
the whole place myself.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,760
Wow.

118
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,680
Congrats.

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,120
You'd make a great boss.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,560
A leader!

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,240
I heard you on that day.

122
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
You know, you're right.

123
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,880
And the truth is, deep down,
Eros knows that too.

124
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,760
How long have you known Eros?

125
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
How long have you been working
for the company?

126
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,040
Oh, it has been...

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
10?

128
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,040
18 years.

129
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,560
I used to work in their shipyard.

130
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,280
An accident happened and...

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,600
instead of paying me off
and letting me go,

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,320
his father gave me another job.

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,080
So, you've known Eros
since he was a boy?

134
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,560
Have you been to their house?

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,640
Wait, what am I saying?
Of course you haven't.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,480
It's...

137
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,280
huge.

138
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,960
So, I would drop them off
at the porch,

139
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
park the car
and come in from the side entrance.

140
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
Eros was 12.

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
He saw me eating
in the kitchen once,

142
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,240
and he dragged me out
to the main dining hall

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,840
so that I could eat
at the "fancy place".

144
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,560
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,120
We became friends.

146
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
He's still that boy.

147
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
But maybe...

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
I don't know.

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,400
Imagine being told
that you're not good enough

150
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
all the time.

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
Your dad's here.

152
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
He may have asked, and I...

153
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
may have told him.

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,480
What? No more fight left in you?

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
We were expecting you for dinner.

156
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,200
Your mother was waiting.

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
-I had plans.
-Oh yeah?

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,480
What about finishing
what you started?

159
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Going down to the shipyard
and the workers?

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,120
You ever get down there?

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
I was going to.

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,680
Oh yeah.

163
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,080
And your PA's going to
keep you in check, huh?

164
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,360
The board called for a meeting.

165
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,800
They want me to name the next in line.

166
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,040
I'm going to go with Chloe.

167
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,480
She has Fillian's KPI back on track.

168
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,680
She got three new shipyards in Europe.

169
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,920
Forbes just named her
on a "30 under 30" list.

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
Do I need to go on?

171
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
I've done just as much.

172
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,400
It's not enough!

173
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,560
Chloe's getting married.

174
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,080
She is continuing the lineage.

175
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't see any of that from you.

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,720
In every way,
she is saving this company's legacy.

177
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm going to get married too.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Dr Mabel?

179
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,440
Yes.

180
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,640
Yes, I'm aware.

181
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,120
I understand.

182
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
Yes, they spoke about cancer care.

183
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
Thanks, doctor.

184
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
Cancer?

185
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
When were you going to tell me?

186
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,320
I found out just two months ago,
during my health check-up.

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,720
How bad is it?

188
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,160
There isn't much they can do
at this stage,

189
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,680
so I'm choosing
to live each day as it is.

190
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,680
Is this why you wanted
to make me a partner here?

191
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
You have so much potential, Jade.

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,320
I'd hate to let you waste it away.

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
But what about your children?

194
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
Please, if this place
was left in their hands,

195
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,760
everything I worked for
would just go down the drain within a day.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,160
Yeah.

197
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,280
I built this place from scratch,

198
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,640
and I don't want to...

199
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,240
You don't have to.

200
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,200
You won't.

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm here.

202
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,880
Why would you even say that?

203
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,920
Wait.

204
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
Are you getting married?

205
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
I don't know, okay?

206
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
I mean,

207
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,520
no, I'm not.

208
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,160
I don't know why I said that.

209
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,280
You don't even have a girlfriend.

210
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,040
Do you?

211
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,440
He kept saying this "30 under 30",

212
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,800
KPI, marriage, lineage
and all that stuff.

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,160
Yeah, but you don't even
have a girlfriend.

214
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,440
Well, I can get a fake girlfriend, right?

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
It's that easy!

216
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
A fake girlfriend?

217
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Look.

218
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,120
I just need to show my dad
that I am committed.

219
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,120
And I just need this to last until
he trusts me to take over his company.

220
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,080
That's all.

221
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
And after that?

222
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
After that, then...

223
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll call off the engagement.

224
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,120
Get a divorce if I have to.

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,920
And where are you
going to find someone

226
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,560
who is going to agree
to this brilliant idea?

227
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,960
Look, it's easy, okay?

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,720
There are lots of girls.

229
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,360
Samantha.

230
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,400
She stalked you.

231
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,120
Rachel.

232
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,800
She maxed out your credit card!

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
Your track record of women

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,960
is all about your money,
your status,

235
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
-your...
-Wait.

236
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,200
What about Jade?

237
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,360
You just leave that girl alone, okay?

238
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,120
Hi.

239
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,640
What are you doing out here
in the rain?

240
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,560
Well, if I weren't,

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,480
would you have let me in?

242
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,880
Can we talk?

243
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,760
Thank you.

244
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,200
Sorry about the mess.

245
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
It's fine.

246
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

247
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,280
It's a draft agreement

248
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,920
for an investment.

249
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,200
For what?

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,440
For...

251
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,960
this coffee house.

252
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
From me to you.

253
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Huh?

254
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,920
Okay, look.

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,320
I didn't like how things ended
the previous time.

256
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,080
And, to be honest,

257
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,040
I felt pretty bad.

258
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,840
And you did do a good job
with Mr Takashi,

259
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,920
and this is me believing in you

260
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
and wanting to invest in you.

261
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,440
Yeah.

262
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,600
I don't buy that.

263
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,080
What do you want?

264
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,400
Sharp.

265
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,280
See?

266
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,760
You'll be a great businesswoman.

267
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
Okay, fine.

268
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,680
Look,

269
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,520
I want something from you.

270
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,960
I need something, actually.

271
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,800
I need you.

272
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,080
I mean,

273
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,840
I need us...

274
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,360
I need us to be engaged.

275
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
Okay, engaged in what?

276
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Engaged to be...

277
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
married?

278
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,840
What?

279
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
It's a simple job, okay?

280
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,120
And I'm sure you could use some money.

281
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,320
I don't need your charity.

282
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,880
I meant for the coffee house,
as an investment.

283
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,240
Look, I can take care of myself,

284
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,680
and I'm not going to help you
lie to your father.

285
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,240
I've worked so hard for this,

286
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,320
and I deserve to be CEO.

287
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,160
And you deserve
to achieve your dreams.

288
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,040
It's a win-win situation for both of us.

289
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,560
No, thank you.

290
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,640
Jade.

291
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,880
The sheer audacity of that man-child.

292
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,760
Oh my gosh,
what did you even say?

293
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
I told him to get out and get lost.

294
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,720
Who would even come up
with something like that?

295
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,920
A fake engagement.

296
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,720
He has too much money in life,
so his brain became fuzzy.

297
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,960
But...

298
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,320
But what?

299
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,200
What?

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Are you sure there's nothing going on
between you two?

301
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,560
What the hell.

302
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,240
I mean, from what you said,
he knows a lot of women.

303
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,680
He could have gone to anyone else.

304
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,640
Why you?

305
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,840
A fake engagement needs
some sort of fake intimacy, right?

306
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,880
He would have to spend some time
with the person.

307
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
Why would he spend it
with someone whom he doesn't like?

308
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,360
There is nothing going on between us.

309
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,800
Okay.

310
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,480
What?

311
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,800
It really sounds like a movie!

312
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
Who would you want to play you
if it gets made?

313
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,840
Oh my gosh, I'm irate!

314
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,320
What are you doing out there
in the rain?

315
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,040
You must be rich.

316
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,120
You must be rich.

317
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,800
The ingrates.

318
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,160
I knew it!
I knew this day would come.

319
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,400
-What's wrong, Mrs Changley?
-They're selling this place.

320
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
They sold it!

321
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,040
I didn't want to.

322
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,560
Your children?

323
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,000
What am I going to do, Jade?

324
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
We have to vacate this place
in less than a week.

325
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm so sorry.

326
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,840
I'm so sorry.

327
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
Want to come in?

328
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,720
So,

329
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm guessing
that you had a change of heart.

330
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,920
That's why you're here.

331
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,960
I will accept your proposal
with some non-negotiable terms.

332
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,040
Okay.

333
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,280
Let's hear it, then.

334
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,080
I agree to be your fake fiancee,

335
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,960
but instead of just your investment
in the business,

336
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,160
I need more.

337
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,200
I need you to buy over
the current space.

338
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,160
We'll keep the name
of the coffee shop,

339
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,880
but I'll need shares
in the business,

340
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,120
obviously.

341
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,560
Obviously.

342
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,000
And since I will be spending time with you
during this engagement period,

343
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,600
it will take me away
from my responsibilities at this business.

344
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,760
So, I expect
proper financial remuneration,

345
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,160
just like a job.

346
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,320
Okay.

347
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,520
Fair enough.

348
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,240
Oh, and about this fiancee thing.

349
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
Do I have to sleep with you?

350
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,960
You know what?

351
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,840
That's a very good question.

352
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,560
Let me think about it.

353
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
No. Like, seriously.

354
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,440
No. Come on.

355
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
Of course you don't have to.

356
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
Okay.

357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,720
Then what about intimacy and stuff?

358
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,040
Well, maybe some holding of hands,
and maybe a peck on the cheek,

359
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,480
especially if there are other people
in front of us.

360
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,880
It's purely for optics. Don't worry.

361
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,080
I'm doing this because I have to,
not because I want to.

362
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,640
All right.

363
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,600
Deal.

364
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,640
So, yeah,

365
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,080
free up your schedule tomorrow

366
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,480
because Donovan
will be picking you up, okay?

367
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Why?

368
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,880
Well, if you're going
to be my fiancee, darling,

369
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,600
you'll have to look the part.

370
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Yeah.

371
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
No.

372
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm not a big fan of floral stuff.

373
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,160
Maybe?

374
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Maybe that.

375
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,040
Donovan, I am a mother, please.

376
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,240
This is like a champagne flute.

377
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
What?

378
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
It looks good, right?

379
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,920
Can I see the back again?

380
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,880
No, I think I'll feel like a present.

381
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,440
Hey, I am a gift to your son.

382
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,120
Oh.

383
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,880
Okay, yeah.

384
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
-Yeah?
-Let's wear this one.

385
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,280
I like this.

386
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
Yes?

387
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,960
This is the dress
that Donovan picked out for me.

388
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,160
But this is more me.

389
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,120
I know you would have wanted
something more...

390
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
I don't know,

391
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,640
like, elegant.

392
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,520
I thought this was more me.

393
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,760
-No.
-Classy...

394
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,040
No, you're perfect.

395
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,800
You're beautiful.

396
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
So,

397
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
we are doing this.

398
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,920
I guess we are.

399
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,120
Are you ready?

400
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Why me?

401
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
I know your type.

402
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,040
You probably have girls
lining up for you.

403
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,280
I know your type.

404
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,800
You probably have girls
lining up for you.

405
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
Eros?

406
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,120
Maybe because you're the only woman

407
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,040
who can make me look like an honest man.

408
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,480
In that case,

409
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,560
you've forgotten
the most important thing.

410
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,640
Which is what?

411
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,480
Where is my ring?

412
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,360
Well, of course, the ring.

413
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,840
Wait.

414
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,000
Let me check.

415
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,320
Here. I have the perfect one.

416
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,280
Here we go.

417
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,280
This one, but I think it's perfect.

418
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
So, Jade,

419
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
what is your full name?

420
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
Jade Aquino Ong.

421
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,480
Jade Aquino Ong.

422
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
Will you...

423
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,880
fake-marry me?

424
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,440
Yes,

425
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,240
I fake-will.

426
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
All right.

427
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
All right.

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
So,

429
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,320
are you ready
to meet the family?

430
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,480
-Yes?
-Eros.

431
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,400
Are you ready to meet the family?

432
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,600
When is the wedding?

433
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,200
-It was good seeing you, Joe.
-Mummy.

434
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,080
Is he your son?

435
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,240
Does your fake husband

436
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,960
know about your very real son?

437
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,520
Do you know her well enough?

438
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,760
Why does it matter to you?

439
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,800
Because it matters!

440
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,960
Why?

441
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
