1
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,880
Why didn't you wake me up?

2
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,480
I could've made breakfast for you.

3
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,480
It's okay, Mummy.
You looked tired.

4
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,720
Okay. Well,
let's get you ready for school.

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,360
You don't want to be late.

6
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,160
What's wrong?

7
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,240
Miss Lee told me
to remind you about school fees.

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,960
My classmate asked if we were poor.

9
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,400
We're not poor.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,240
Maybe I should go to a cheaper school.

11
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,880
You're the kid,
and I'm the parent.

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,800
It's my job to take care of this.

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Your job is to go learn
and have fun, okay?

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,760
I love you.

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
Now go get ready.

16
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Zion, baby, are you okay?

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,720
Does it hurt again?

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
No, Mummy, I'm okay.

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,520
Now you go get ready too.

20
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,840
This is my favourite thing every morning.

21
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,680
I like this blend, Jade.

22
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,160
I knew you would.

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,640
You always do.

24
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,520
If not for your little gift,
this place would be doing a lot worse.

25
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Oh, don't worry, Mrs Changley.

26
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Business will pick up.

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920
How do we compete these days

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,480
with all these different and hip cafes
popping up left, right and centre?

29
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,520
Think of it this way.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,400
The more these cafes open up,

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,920
pretty soon,
they're all going to look the same.

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,840
And then yours will be the hip one.

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
But...

34
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,200
this place could do
with a little makeover.

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
How can I afford it
when business is so bad?

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
Jade!

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,080
Thank god you're here.

38
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,960
I have an important job interview,
and I'm super nervous.

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
Look at my hands.

40
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,040
That is a severe case of "jittery-noma".

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,160
And I have just the right blend for you.

42
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,880
It's a perfect mix of sea salt
and roasted coffee beans.

43
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,160
You'll get the kick you need
to kick some...

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,400
Coming right up.

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,000
She's a gem, isn't she?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
Yes.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,600
Do you have any single friends?

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,720
Yes.

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Where are you?

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,360
I'll be there soon.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,120
The meeting starts in five minutes,

52
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,000
but I'm guessing you need
slightly more time than that.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
I'll be there.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,320
No, you won't,

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
and I don't need you to be.

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
Come back to bed.

57
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,880
I need both of you gone
by the time I get back here,

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,960
okay?

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,680
Where's your mother?

60
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
Mummy said I can play.

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,400
Have you done your school work?

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,240
Yes.

63
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,280
You might be able
to fool your mother, but not me.

64
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,640
So, tell me again,

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,080
are you done?

66
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
And yet here you are.

67
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,520
Any excuse to get out of doing the work
that needs to be done?

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
I just wanted to play with the ships.

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,040
If you don't do the work
that needs to be done,

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
you'll only ever play with them.

71
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,040
You're not going to rule them,
do you understand?

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,400
Hey, look at me.

73
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,160
Just because you're a Petrakis
does not mean you get a free pass.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,160
Earn it!

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
Daddy!

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Hey, baby.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Let's go. It's time.

78
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,600
There you go.

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,760
Enough.

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,960
Just get the car ready.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,080
Coffee?

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, sure.

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,640
Are you sure this place is good?

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,080
You can let go now.

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,040
Sorry.

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,480
You know what?
You should watch where you're going.

87
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,840
You bumped into me.

88
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,440
Well, I broke your fall,
so maybe you should thank me.

89
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,080
What?

90
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
I...

91
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,000
One of the secretaries told me
that your father's still in the meeting.

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,720
Did you even drop in at all?

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,800
Nope.

94
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,960
He told me not to.

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
What would you like to order?

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Coffee.

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
And you?

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,360
I said, "Coffee!"

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
you two were one person.

100
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,720
Espresso.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
She's going to spit
in my coffee, isn't she?

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,320
Oh my god.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Who does that guy think he is?

104
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
I don't know,
but he's very yummy.

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,600
What? Don't you think so?

106
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
That's not the point.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,280
He's super rude!

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Well then, you know what you need to do.

109
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,360
Spit in his coffee.

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,320
My dear girl,

111
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,960
the way to deal with people like that
is by killing them with kindness.

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,120
Go and make him
one of your special blends.

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,760
Go on!

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
You know what your old man is like.

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,760
-He says that...
-Oh, come on, Don.

116
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,040
Then why was he in my meeting?

117
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,360
He always tells me that
I don't take control enough.

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,120
And then he takes over,
then breathes down my neck.

119
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
You were late.

120
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Look, your father
just wants to run the company

121
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,480
the way he wants to run it.

122
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,440
So, what am I? His puppet?

123
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,840
Just give him some time.

124
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
Look, Donovan.

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,320
I didn't just start working
for him yesterday.

126
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Look.

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
This happens a lot.

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,080
Your father gets angry,
then you get angry,

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,000
and nothing changes!

130
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
It's a vicious cycle.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,960
Maybe you should start
reacting differently to him.

132
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,600
Okay, you know what?

133
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
Thank you

134
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
for the unsolicited life lesson.

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
Okay, so...

136
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm going over the agenda
for the meeting.

137
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,880
Mandatory breaks?

138
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,000
More food options in the cafeteria?

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,880
I mean,

140
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,440
it's ridiculous!

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,600
Not to everyone, evidently.

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,520
Well, if something so basic
is going to be a problem,

143
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,840
what more if we have
bigger problems coming in?

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
You must be rich.

145
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,400
Excuse me?

146
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,000
That's how the French Revolution
started, you know?

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Like when Marie Antoinette was told
her people had no food to eat,

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
she said, "Let them eat cake."

149
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,960
The rich

150
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
have no understanding
of how the rest of the world lives.

151
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,920
And evidently, they're also not well read.

152
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I did not see that coming.

153
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,120
Are you okay?

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah, I mean,
why wouldn't I be?

155
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
Is it that bad?

156
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
Wow.

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Let's go back to the office.

158
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,120
I have an idea.

159
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
What's next on the agenda?

160
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,880
There's the matter
of the workers at the shipyard.

161
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,800
The supervisor can't seem
to get control of the situation.

162
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,880
What have I missed?

163
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,280
What exactly is happening down there?

164
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,400
The workers show up,
but not much is done.

165
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,040
They're unmotivated because...

166
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,360
they're not satisfied
with their working conditions.

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,760
Well, suddenly,
they feel short-changed?

168
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,280
I suspect it's the new hires
that are riling up the rest.

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,200
Well,

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
get rid of the troublemakers then.

171
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,320
There's a manpower crunch
at the shipyard this period.

172
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,560
We don't want a walkout.

173
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
You know what?

174
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Why don't I just go down there
and talk with them myself?

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
When Marie Antoinette was told
that her people had no bread to eat,

176
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
do you know what she said?

177
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,240
She said, "Let them eat cake."

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,600
And that is how
the French Revolution started.

179
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,560
You know what?

180
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,000
If I go down there personally
and talk to them,

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,640
then they would know that
we take their concerns seriously.

182
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,920
We cannot have issues with manpower.

183
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,400
Plus, we have the Japanese deal coming up.

184
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
I didn't know you had time to read,

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,680
especially with
all your extra-curricular activities.

186
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,080
I think you going to the shipyard
might work, Mr Petrakis.

187
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
Well,

188
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,680
let's get to it then, shall we?

189
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,280
It must be about the school fees.

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,880
Haven't you paid?

191
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,960
Zion ran out of his medication.

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
Hello?

193
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
Is he okay?

194
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
Hey! How did it go?

195
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,080
Killed it.

196
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,960
Come on.

197
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,040
I used that whole...

198
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,720
"the rich not understanding
the rest of the world" thing.

199
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
And it worked.

200
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,800
What the waitress said?

201
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,560
Yeah.

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,640
You must be rich.

203
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,520
Right,

204
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,880
I forgot about that.

205
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,480
Hey, by the way,
offer her a job here, okay?

206
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,560
Wait, what?

207
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Yeah, we could use some good coffee
anytime we want.

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,480
Okay, usually,
I get your impulsive decisions,

209
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,320
but...

210
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,720
what makes you think
she would even consider it?

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Oh, Donovan,

212
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,040
you forget the number one motivator
for people to do something for you.

213
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
Money.

214
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Let me know how Zion is
and if you need anything, okay?

215
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
-Promise?
-Promise.

216
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
Hi. Sorry.

217
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
Can I talk to you?

218
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,040
There's a suggestion box over there
if you're here to make a complaint.

219
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,640
No, I'm not here to complain.

220
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,720
In fact,

221
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,600
you should be complimented
on your coffee.

222
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,360
Oh.

223
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,920
Thanks.

224
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm here on behalf of my boss.

225
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,360
The obnoxious snob who probably thinks
he's god's gift to women.

226
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,880
Yeah, that one.

227
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,560
Does he work out a lot?

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What does he want?

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
He would like to offer you a job.

230
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you joking?

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,640
Fortunately for you,

232
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,360
no.

233
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,920
What kind of a job is this?

234
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,400
His personal assistant.

235
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,480
I mean, who goes around
offering strangers jobs out of nowhere?

236
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,360
Well, he was impressed by your coffee

237
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,000
and what you said.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,600
That he doesn't read enough.

239
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,520
He's willing to offer you
three times what you get here.

240
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,400
This is crazy.

241
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,280
-I have no time for this right now.
-Just...

242
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,640
think about it.

243
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,720
Ridiculous.

244
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,360
Any job offers for me?

245
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,120
Jade, shall we talk outside?

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,280
I'll be right back, okay?

247
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,640
I'll need to take a look
at his blood test results just to be sure,

248
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,520
but I don't think
his medication is working for him.

249
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,360
He had a weak knee this morning,

250
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
and his teacher was saying

251
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,160
that he has trouble
getting out of his chair,

252
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,200
and he developed a rash
on his knees.

253
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
They are signs of
his juvenile dermatomyositis

254
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,160
acting up again.

255
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
We will need to monitor him closely
before an extreme flare-up.

256
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,840
We wouldn't want any damage to his bones,
lungs or other internal organs.

257
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,400
What do we do now?

258
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,320
We will be putting him
on stronger steroids

259
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,520
and hope that we can get it
back under control.

260
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
Try not to worry too much.

261
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,600
It is a rare disease,
but there are measures that we can take.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,840
Children are resilient.

263
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,000
He'll get through it.

264
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
His medication isn't working.

265
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
What does that mean?

266
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
It means

267
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,720
he has to start taking a different one,

268
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,080
a more expensive one.

269
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,240
I know you don't like to talk about it,

270
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
but maybe it's time
you spoke to his father about this?

271
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,720
You're right.

272
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
I don't want to talk about that.

273
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,480
Okay, then don't be so stubborn
and let me help you.

274
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,440
I can't depend on you forever.

275
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,840
I know, but let me help you for now.

276
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,120
I'll find a way.

277
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,480
I'll get a second job.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,520
Maybe you should consider that job offer.

279
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,600
What? With that stuck-up spoilt brat?

280
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
No way!

281
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,240
I mean, who goes around
offering jobs to strangers

282
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,200
just because they like the coffee?

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,320
Yeah.

284
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,040
What coffee did you give him?

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Monkey-spit Coffee,

286
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,880
vanilla-flavoured.

287
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,680
It's a special coffee that
these monkeys sucked on and spat out.

288
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,960
I've been saving it for a long time.

289
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
You did not.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,080
Yes, I did.

291
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,800
You know,

292
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,680
I'd work for the devil
with the money he's offering.

293
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,240
Okay, maybe not the devil himself.

294
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,240
Maybe one of his fallen angels?

295
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Mummy, I miss dancing with you.

296
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,680
Come here, baby.

297
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,760
I will always dance with you.

298
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,280
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,680
For what?

300
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
For being expensive.

301
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not your fault.

302
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,840
Look at me.

303
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,680
I still can't get this move right.

304
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,920
Is it like this?

305
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,000
Like this?

306
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,640
It's not that funny.

307
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Come here!

308
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,840
You have to show me.

309
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
You're supposed to teach me, right?

310
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,920
You're supposed to teach me?

311
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,600
Where's my dance teacher?

312
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
She accepted your job offer.

313
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,320
She'd be a fool to reject it.

314
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,640
From what I've seen,
she's anything but a fool.

315
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,440
She's not like the other girls, you know?

316
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,520
The ones that lap up every word you say.

317
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,760
Donovan,

318
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,320
I'm hiring her as an assistant,

319
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,360
not as a girlfriend.

320
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,760
Whatever.

321
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,960
I have a feeling that
things are going to get interesting.

322
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,400
Me too.

323
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,320
This way, Miss Ong.

324
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
Just call me Jade.

325
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,720
Okay.

326
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Jade.

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
So, what exactly does my job entail?

328
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,120
I'll let the boss tell you himself.

329
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,400
Wow.

330
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,360
It's all the way at the top?

331
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,480
Does he own the building or something?

332
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah.

333
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
Eros,

334
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
Jade's here.

335
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,240
Did you always have black hair?

336
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,040
Yes?

337
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,520
No, wait.

338
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Sorry. What?

339
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,000
Go to HR,

340
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
and finish all the paperwork.

341
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,800
Okay.

342
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,360
You want me to stop?

343
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,680
I have a meeting at 3 this afternoon,

344
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,080
so make sure that the boardroom is ready.

345
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,840
And Japanese people
hate people being late.

346
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,760
So, be on time.

347
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
What the hell happened?

348
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,440
What did you do?

349
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,360
I didn't do anything.

350
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,680
We have been waiting for almost one hour.

351
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Get it right to start with!

352
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,960
So, how do we fix this screw-up?

353
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,640
You remind me of someone.

354
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,880
I said, do your damn job!

355
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,960
Enough!

356
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,360
You're fired!

357
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
