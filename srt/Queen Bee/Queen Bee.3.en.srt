1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,713
No...

2
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,590
If you called someone, you should talk

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,342
Huh?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,135
What's gonna be solved by just drinking like that?

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,347
You don't understand

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,266
So tell me

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,309
What is it?

8
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,731
What are you hiding between us?

9
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:24,858
Hm?

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,987
No!

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,072
I can't lose you too

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,452
Tell me

13
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,498
I'm really leaving, I really am

14
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,585
Promise

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,923
Listen to what I have to say

16
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,715
Don't cut me off

17
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,177
Don't spit at me

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,806
Promise

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,143
Tell me

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,112
You're such a bitch

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,114
Am I that much of a bitch?

22
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,534
A tremendous bitch

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,702
And that for a whole year?

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:18,869
At the same time?

25
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:19,579
Hey!

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,208
Keep it down

27
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,670
I mean...

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,048
Well, two-timing aside

29
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,760
Both people

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,349
You're saying you truly love them?

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,688
How is that even possible?

32
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,565
You who can't even

33
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,690
Say a word while driving

34
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,485
Can't even multitask...

35
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,485
You?

36
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,947
So

37
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,867
I also think I'm really weird

38
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,827
I don't understand it at all

39
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,704
No...

40
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,331
I didn't start this to backstab anyone

41
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,125
Really

42
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,251
Really

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,086
I just fell in love with both at the same time

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,007
It sounds so sincere it gives me chills

45
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:19,222
Geez, do you think of me that way too?

46
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,893
No, no

47
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,481
I'll believe you for now

48
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,322
I'm your friend

49
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,201
You say it's true love with both

50
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:54,465
That you can't give up

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,092
Or choose either one

52
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,594
Then there's only one way

53
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,391
To see which one loves you more

54
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:08,230
Confirm that

55
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,815
How?

56
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,818
Just do what I tell you

57
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,862
First

58
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,005
You need to attack that man's most vulnerable point

59
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,548
And test him

60
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,800
Why is that happening?

61
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,135
I have something to tell you

62
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,264
What?

63
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,014
I don't think I can do it anymore

64
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,228
What?

65
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,438
I got baptized at church yesterday

66
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,693
I also received the baptismal name Christina

67
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,864
So?

68
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,115
From now on...

69
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,786
I think I should keep chastity before marriage

70
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,248
Huh?

71
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,501
I didn't even know you went to church

72
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:16,130
And

73
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,423
What does getting baptized have to do with this?

74
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,759
We've been doing fine so far

75
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,302
Anyway, I've decided

76
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,806
Wait

77
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,934
Can't you think about it one more time?

78
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,400
I've already decided

79
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,905
Is that okay?

80
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,210
So we can't do it anymore?

81
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,505
Yeah, probably

82
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,469
Won't it be hard between us?

83
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:11,644
If you test their vulnerable points

84
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,815
You have to give them time to think first

85
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,025
That man too

86
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,693
Needs to reflect on his feelings

87
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:21,905
Why are you smiling?

88
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,664
I've been thinking

89
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,630
I'll hold back too, for you

90
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,759
Huh?

91
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,300
Really?

92
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:44,802
Yeah

93
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,596
You like it as much as I do

94
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,599
But

95
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,432
How hard it must be to hold back

96
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,686
So

97
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:53,728
I want to do that together with you

98
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,813
Will it be okay?

99
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,233
No

100
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,652
But I'll try

101
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:06,824
Ah!

102
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,119
Then I'll go work out

103
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,954
Now?

104
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,206
Yeah

105
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,248
Park Seo-yeon

106
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,793
I love you

107
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,003
Hyung

108
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,612
Men are first of all

109
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,949
Goal-oriented animals

110
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,701
So it's important to shake that foundation

111
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,786
Why are you so pretty today?

112
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,748
Did someone ask for your number?

113
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,295
What are you saying, really

114
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,005
You get prettier every time I see you

115
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,257
How's the preparation for the promotion exam going?

116
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,677
Well, I'm preparing hard

117
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,972
Since I had good results last year

118
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,224
If I do well on the exam, there shouldn't be any problem

119
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,311
Then our wedding too...

120
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,438
Seo-yeon, however you want

121
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,981
Let's prepare step by step

122
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,190
If we get the apartment at the right timing

123
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,108
It'll be perfect, right?

124
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,318
But hyung

125
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,280
Yeah

126
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,949
What that man considers

127
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,371
Most important in life

128
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,539
That's what you need to shake

129
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,751
There's something I haven't told you

130
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,170
What?

131
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,047
Actually...

132
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,467
I have some debt

133
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,096
How much?

134
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,099
Quite a bit

135
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:56,643
It's from a third-tier financial company

136
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,269
With interest, it's about 8 million, a bit less

137
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,690
8 million?

138
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,150
Hyung, you're someone who dreams of

139
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,953
Getting married and living stably

140
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,622
That's why I'm telling you now

141
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,291
After hearing about marriage last time

142
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,128
I thought about it a lot

143
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,963
Does someone like me suit hyung?

144
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,177
I thought about that a lot too

145
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,264
Seo-yeon

146
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,141
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I didn't know anything

147
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,523
Sorry for telling you late

148
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,904
Even if hyung leaves me, I understand

149
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,118
Why would I leave you?

150
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,836
I'm not in a very comfortable situation either

151
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,881
So I don't know what to do, I'm lost

152
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,509
But I'm glad you told me

153
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,304
Hyung

154
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,431
Now we can solve it together

155
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,935
It doesn't matter if we postpone the wedding a bit

156
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,313
Don't worry alone anymore

157
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,189
Let's solve it together

158
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,608
Okay?

159
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,442
You must have suffered alone, our Seo-yeon

160
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,574
Okay?

161
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,533
Hyung, is it okay even though I'm poor and have debt?

162
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,331
Really?

163
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,998
I don't have debt and I'm not poor, so it's okay

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,461
Don't cry

165
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,755
What happened? How did it go?

166
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,980
I just want to keep seeing both

167
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,193
What?

168
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,360
You really...

169
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,445
Yeah, I'm a total bitch!
