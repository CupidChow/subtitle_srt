00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,043
Seo Yeon

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:04,338
Noona

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,715
Seo Yeon

4
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:10,344
Noona

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:16,557
Aah!

6
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,608
Seo Yeon

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,402
What the hell is going on here?

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,862
Well, this is...

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,322
Noona

10
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:33,074
Who is this person?

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,784
Ji Hwan

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,208
Well, what happened was...!

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,677
[One week ago]

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,222
[First anniversary]

15
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,724
Oppa, here

16
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,106
What's this?

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,777
Today is our first anniversary

18
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,278
It's small, but I wanted to celebrate

19
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,114
Oppa...

20
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,074
I didn't prepare anything

21
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,367
Aw...

22
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,286
To me, you're already my gift

23
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,164
You just need to stay by my side

24
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:23,583
Oppa

25
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,795
Seo Yeon

26
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,713
Do you...

27
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,882
Believe in fate?

28
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,472
It's funny to say this now

29
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,807
But from the first time I saw you

30
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,601
I knew we'd end up like this

31
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,978
You know what they say

32
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,438
That the person you'll marry

33
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,773
You feel it from the first moment you see them

34
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,568
Oppa, are you...

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,985
Proposing to me right now?

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,947
You already know

37
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,867
I'm dating you very seriously

38
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,911
For the rest of my life, there won't be another woman

39
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,164
You're my last

40
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,586
Ah, of course...

41
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,963
The proposal will be formal

42
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,425
But today I wanted to convey

43
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,677
My sincerity and gratitude

44
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,268
You...

45
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,728
Even if you had met another man

46
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,813
You would have been an amazing person

47
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,065
So I think I was lucky

48
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,235
And that's why I'll give my best

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,655
When I pass my promotion exam

50
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:37,865
Let's get married

51
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,871
Oppa

52
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,664
I can't even imagine a world without oppa anymore

53
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,751
A world without you anymore

54
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,003
Me neither

55
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,925
Honestly, I get a little scared sometimes

56
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,469
Why?

57
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,849
Because this time with oppa is so happy

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,143
I'm afraid this happiness might end someday

59
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,603
Aw...

60
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,230
That's never going to happen

61
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,690
I know...

62
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,360
That oppa will always be by my side

63
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,195
But...

64
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,907
Someday we might hurt each other

65
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,742
Or there might be times when we hate each other

66
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,454
What if then all my sincerity

67
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,206
Feels like a lie?

68
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,460
I get sad when I think about that

69
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,338
Oh no...

70
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,048
You're having negative thoughts again

71
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,634
Just look at what's in front of you

72
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,677
I'm right here

73
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,760
Right?

74
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,887
I'll always be in front of you

75
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,431
Promise me

76
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,724
Yes

77
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,192
Seo Yeon

78
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,820
Today...

79
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,030
Should we stay together?

80
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,577
Don't you have to work tomorrow oppa?

81
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,331
Still...

82
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:10,916
I want to be with you

83
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,753
Next time

84
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,130
I have to work early tomorrow morning too

85
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,632
Okay

86
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,222
Then I'll go to the bathroom for a bit

87
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,150
[When are you coming?]

88
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,697
[Going in soon]

89
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,836
Damn, did the smell stick to me?

90
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,391
Okay

91
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,271
Babe

92
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,275
I'm out

93
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,277
Ta-da!

94
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,110
You scared me

95
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,284
What's this?

96
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:29,204
Our first anniversary gift

97
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,791
You're hopeless, it's cold, put on clothes

98
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,460
I haven't gotten paid yet

99
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,211
So today I thought I'd pay with my body

100
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,673
Oh~

101
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,548
How much are you going to pay with your body?

102
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,927
As much as my master wants?

103
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,349
I think I'm going to be rough today...

104
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,143
Will that be okay?

105
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:56,146
Then be as rough as you love me

106
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,083
I'll shower first

107
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,001
Yeah

108
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,152
[What I said today is sincere.
Wait for me a little longer. I love you, Seo Yeon. Good night]

109
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:53,288
[I love you too, oppa]

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,751
Should we shower together?
