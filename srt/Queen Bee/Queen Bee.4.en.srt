1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,807
Does it tickle?

2
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:17,601
Yeah

3
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:19,769
But I like it

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,280
You can do well today, right?

5
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,490
Yeah

6
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,661
Yes

7
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,039
Hyung, if you do well today

8
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,208
I'll give you a reward

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,887
You shouldn't answer the phone, should you?

10
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,472
No, it's just...

11
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,472
It's my manager

12
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,518
Oh, sorry

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,898
Answer it and come back, I'll wait

14
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:08,652
Yes, manager

15
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,871
[Tomorrow JS Hotel at 3. You know, right?]

16
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,878
[I've been so busy we couldn't even go on vacation this year.]

17
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,213
[The rooms there are really nice? The breakfast is amazing too.]

18
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:33,092
[Huh?? Have you been there??]

19
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:37,264
[No~ I saw photos and it looked great~~]

20
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,934
[Oh me too~haha If noona likes it, I like everything]

21
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,978
[Yeah. I like it too.]

22
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,447
Seo-yeon, I'm too...

23
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,759
Mr. Choi Ji-hwan?

24
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,431
So?

25
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,309
You deceived us for a year

26
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,144
because you didn't want to lose either of us?

27
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:12,358
Does that make sense now?

28
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,739
No...

29
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,326
How could you do this to me, noona?

30
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,829
I'm sorry

31
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,958
Even if people point fingers calling me crazy, I have nothing to say

32
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,961
But I really...

33
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,463
Sincerely...

34
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,507
Love both of you

35
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,675
No, Seo-yeon

36
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,552
This person and I

37
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,594
Don't have anything in common

38
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,054
How can you love us the same way?

39
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,141
What do you want?

40
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,976
I'm confident I can give it to you

41
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,436
I'm getting promoted soon

42
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,521
Noona

43
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,608
You said, noona

44
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,695
That you absolutely hate boring and dull things

45
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,362
That with me every day is exciting

46
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:00,197
And fun, that you liked it, right?

47
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,907
No, honestly fun is also

48
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,702
Something you feel when ordinary and stable

49
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,704
Daily life is guaranteed

50
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:06,746
Isn't that right?

51
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,125
An anxious and unstable future

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,501
Gets tiring quickly

53
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,585
Excuse me

54
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,088
Strictly speaking

55
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,590
I met her before you did

56
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,134
So I have priority

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,179
You seem to think

58
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,471
That love can be won by quantity

59
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,556
Seo-yeon and I

60
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,601
Are in a relationship where we've promised each other a serious future

61
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,228
Not just a one-night fun relationship

62
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,271
One-night fun?

63
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,483
You really don't know what you're talking about

64
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,068
Do you know this?

65
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:40,780
That feeling of fitting perfectly like puzzle pieces from the beginning?

66
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,657
Noona and I are like that

67
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,034
Two times, three times, we never get tired of each other

68
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:45,952
Three times?

69
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,661
Don't imagine things

70
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,996
You'll only get hurt

71
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:50,373
No, you

72
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,833
How much do you make annually?

73
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,458
Excuse me?

74
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,418
Never mind

75
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,753
Freelance models don't have annual salaries?

76
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,005
Have you done year-end tax settlement or anything?

77
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,507
What year-end tax settlement?

78
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,800
There are such things

79
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,510
You don't need to know

80
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,427
Now or ever

81
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,679
What the hell

82
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,597
What the hell?

83
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,724
Hey

84
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:10,351
How old are you?

85
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,269
Can't you tell by looking? You're fucking young

86
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,146
If you're young, you should date someone younger than you

87
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,106
Why are you dating Seo-yeon who caught the last train for marriage!

88
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,983
What... last train?

89
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,320
I get along well with older women

90
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you know how difficult it is

91
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,782
To find someone you have good chemistry with?

92
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,577
Chemistry when you're just meeting for lust?

93
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,163
Then should I guess why a gentleman like you

94
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,123
Is dating a woman like noona?

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,583
To marry a woman who's

96
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,168
Moderately pretty and earns moderately

97
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,253
And make her a trophy wife

98
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:37,963
Right?

99
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:42,634
Hey

100
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,927
Do you think anyone can be a trophy wife?

101
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,097
To be meaningful, you need to be at least like me

102
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,807
Someone like you can't even dream of it, asshole

103
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,934
I'm not interested at all

104
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,976
Do you think I'm dating noona

105
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,894
To marry her?

106
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,478
Ah! Both of you stop!

107
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,737
It's all my fault

108
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,074
I hurt both of you because of my greed

109
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,742
I'm really sorry

110
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,577
I'm sorry

111
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,956
And just here...

112
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,083
Let's end it

113
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,418
No

114
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:19,545
I'll end it!

115
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,802
Seo-yeon

116
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,472
Noona

117
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,021
[Noona. Please answer the phone.]

118
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,565
[Noona? You didn't block me, did you?]

119
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,065
[Let's talk a bit.]

120
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,693
[Seo-yeon, we were good together. Think about it again.]

121
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,235
[Seo-yeon, I really love you.]

122
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,070
[Seo-yeon?]

123
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,940
Who is this?

124
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,195
Oh, I'm from the apartment next door

125
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:27,489
This is yours, right?

126
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,077
Oh, yes it is

127
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,456
Oh, that...

128
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,626
I think mine is at your place

129
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,668
Could you look for my package?

130
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,255
Oh, just a moment

131
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,565
Where was it? Just a moment

132
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,287
Oh, thank you

133
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,498
It's really strange

134
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,085
Packages rarely get mixed up like this

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,921
That's right

136
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,341
Oh, then see you later

137
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,385
Excuse me

138
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:31,970
Yes?

139
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,097
By any chance...

140
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,932
Do you have time?

141
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,726
Time?

142
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,148
I have time

143
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,484
Would you like to have a quick coffee?

144
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,445
Uh...

145
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,532
Yes
