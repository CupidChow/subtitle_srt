1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,797
Great, Jihwan

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:09,592
Let's move a little more

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,469
to the right, shall we?

4
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,059
Wait a moment

5
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,791
This position looks good

6
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,934
Let's do three more takes

7
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,059
Yes

8
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:11,028
Good work

9
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,742
Writer

10
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,369
Yes?

11
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:30,590
Hey

12
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,134
What if someone sees us?

13
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:32,842
Shh

14
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,262
Everyone's busy, so it's fine

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,764
How...?

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,184
Are you satisfied with the result?

17
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,063
Well...

18
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,818
Have you been working out a lot lately?

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,112
I noticed your body looked bigger earlier

20
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,824
I work out regularly

21
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:57,784
Because of someone

22
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,702
Ah~

23
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,371
Thanks to that someone, today's photos

24
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,164
are going to turn out really well, right?

25
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,876
When you touched me earlier

26
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,003
I almost died holding it in

27
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,545
That's not true?

28
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,130
I was just directing

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,884
I don't think about other things when I work

30
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:14,800
Unlike someone

31
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,389
No doing that in the studio

32
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,724
Don't you remember?

33
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,516
Just once

34
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:37,949
Who asked for it?

35
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,744
Wasn't it the writer who asked?

36
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,204
No, it wasn't

37
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,418
[Fighting with the shoot!! From Hyunwoo oppa]

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,172
Fighting with the shoot

39
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,423
Hyunwoo oppa?

40
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,512
Ah, Hyunwoo oppa

41
00:02:59,179 --> 00:02:59,929
Who is that?

42
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,056
My cousin

43
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,891
His company is near here

44
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,940
Oh, Hyunwoo oppa

45
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,983
Did you send coffee?

46
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,195
Oh, I got the coffee well

47
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,280
I'll enjoy it

48
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,494
The writer seems close with her cousin

49
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,538
That's interesting

50
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,916
When I was young, I lived at my uncle's house for a while

51
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,503
We grew up almost like siblings

52
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:06,996
No way

53
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,831
Let's work

54
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,800
Hello?

55
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,802
Wow, you answer right away?

56
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,387
Oh, right

57
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,472
You were thinking about me, weren't you?

58
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,391
How did you know?

59
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,019
Right now you're looking at my photo

60
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,436
and drooling, aren't you?

61
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,146
Yeah, you're right

62
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,983
I'm looking at it zoomed in, every corner

63
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,152
There's nothing to retouch

64
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,862
Ah, I'm getting off the subway now

65
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,239
Huh? No

66
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,909
You must be tired from today's shoot

67
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,202
You should go home and rest

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,161
I already got off

69
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,413
What?

70
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,000
I bought beer and chicken, wait, I'll be right there

71
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,293
Huh? Hey!

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,637
Huh? You're already here?

73
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,565
Ta-da!

74
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,822
What are you doing here? What about work?

75
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,451
I took the day off for a health checkup today

76
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:27,744
When I heard your voice earlier

77
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,411
I wanted to see you

78
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,746
So I didn't go home, I came straight to work

79
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:31,831
Ah...

80
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,882
Were you working?

81
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:42,384
Huh?

82
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,467
Yeah

83
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,721
But why do you have this so zoomed in?

84
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,181
Ah, because I need to retouch it

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,724
Did you do a shoot with such a handsome model

86
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:51,851
today?

87
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,186
I'm jealous

88
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,356
Come on, jealous of what?

89
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:58,817
We just work together

90
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,985
We barely even talk

91
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:00,610
Really?

92
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:04,572
Huh?

93
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,032
Seoyeon

94
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,041
But what is this...?

95
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,041
It's mine!

96
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,922
You don't know

97
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,423
It's trendy these days

98
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,425
Women wearing boxer briefs

99
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:26,885
Really?

100
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,472
Well, you wouldn't know about these things

101
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,516
Look

102
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:36,980
It's totally my size, right?

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,606
It's really cool, good ventilation too

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,235
Ah, I thought it was someone else's

105
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:48,992
Who is it?

106
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,452
Huh?

107
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,244
Delivery

108
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:52,954
Wait a moment

109
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,552
Wait a moment

110
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,764
You missed me, didn't you?

111
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,855
What's this? Is this your concept today?

112
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,525
I'm so turned on

113
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,485
No, no

114
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,487
Not today

115
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,699
It's just...

116
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,826
I mean...

117
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,536
I'm...

118
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,748
It's that day

119
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,123
So I feel completely sensitive

120
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,376
Ah...

121
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,336
Is it already that time?

122
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,590
That's why I keep having strange thoughts

123
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,675
and keep doing weird things

124
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,967
Look

125
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,427
You wouldn't know

126
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,346
what I did today

127
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,889
wearing this

128
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,434
Don't tell me...

129
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,684
Alone?

130
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,478
Huh?

131
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:00,980
Wait, go in...

132
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,737
Jihwan

133
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,989
I really want to be alone today

134
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,742
I don't want you to see me

135
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,411
like this

136
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:17,997
You understand how I feel, right?

137
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,337
I understand, then this?

138
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,338
I'll eat it well

139
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,425
I was really craving chicken because of hormones

140
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,427
Oh, yeah, okay

141
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,386
Go in

142
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,055
Go quickly

143
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,182
I understand, then

144
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,309
rest

145
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,644
Take care, honey

146
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,561
Call me, sis
