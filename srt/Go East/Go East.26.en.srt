00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,960
[Go East]

2
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,930
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,990
Sorry.

4
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,150
Deputy Envoy Kang.

5
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,840
Oh, it's you.

6
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,360
Deputy Envoy Kang, why did you come here

7
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,290
instead of staying at the embassy?

8
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,669
I like to collect ancient chess manuals.

9
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,919
I heard there's a collector here,

10
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,510
so I came to take a look.

11
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,510
I'm looking for

12
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,570
the criminal wanted by Viceroy Long,

13
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,540
and you just showed up.

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Criminal?

15
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,630
What criminal?

16
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,870
Years ago, someone colluded with Yuan Hanjing

17
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,220
to release Princess Yanle without permission

18
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,310
and raised her secretly.

19
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,829
Over the years,

20
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,510
Viceroy Long has been trying to catch this person.

21
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,310
Recently, he finally got a lead.

22
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,730
Deputy Envoy Kang,

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,120
did you see anyone suspicious just now?

24
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,950
Anyone suspicious?

25
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,880
Do I look suspicious to you?

26
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,480
Deputy Envoy Kang, that's a good joke.

27
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,670
By the way,

28
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,140
I have a big gift for you.

29
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,710
I wanted to send it to the Yanle Embassy myself,

30
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,910
but since we ran into each other here,

31
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,780
please accept it now.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,860
Deputy Envoy Kang,

33
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,230
come in and have a seat.

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,190
Isn't this Ah Shu from the Sifang Pavilion?

35
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,880
Yes.

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,670
She is Princess Yanle.

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,370
Then what about Ah Shilan?

38
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,579
To tell you the truth,

39
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,060
Ah Shilan was sent by me.

40
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,150
Does Viceroy Long know about this?

41
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,579
Viceroy Long has given me a free hand in handling this matter.

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,410
So, Deputy Envoy Kang,

43
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,730
are you satisfied with this gift?

44
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,210
I'm more than satisfied.

45
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,000
If Viceroy Long knows this,

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,670
he will be very pleased.

47
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,280
By the way,

48
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,590
when we found her,

49
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,630
she was wearing this cloak.

50
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,200
Nice fabric.

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,430
Let's go.

52
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,880
Oil-paper umbrellas.

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,010
Come and take a look.

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,409
Come and take a look.

55
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,070
Stop the coach.

56
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,760
Why did you ask the coachman to stop?

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,220
Yong State has many spies.

58
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,270
I'm worried that we'll be in trouble

59
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,910
if we bring Princess Yanle to the embassy

60
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,390
in front of everyone.

61
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,710
Are you suggesting we don't enter the embassy?

62
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,670
We must enter.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,880
However, we need to act separately.

64
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,630
I'll enter through the front gate

65
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,270
to attract the attention of the spies of Yong State.

66
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,820
You take the opportunity to enter through the back door.

67
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
What do you think?

68
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,110
Deputy Envoy Kang, your plan is well-considered.

69
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,730
Then... I'll go first.

70
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,070
My Lord,

71
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,600
do you trust him?

72
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,860
Let's go.

73
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,990
Watch where you're going!

74
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,950
You should watch where you're going!

75
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,010
Deputy Envoy Kang.

76
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,210
Give it back to me.

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,750
Please apologize first.

78
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,080
Who do you think you are?

79
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,720
You're not worthy of my apology.

80
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Then don't blame me for being impolite.

81
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,690
I'll take it.

82
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,200
Wait.

83
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,290
This is Yuan Mo's prized possession.

84
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,520
This is Yuan Mo's chess manual?

85
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,370
Why do you have it?

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,240
I have more than just one of Yuan Mo's possessions.

87
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,360
I have work to do at the embassy.

88
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,390
If he wants it,

89
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,990
tell him to come and get it himself.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,550
Miss,

91
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,050
can you return the chess manual to me now?

92
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,910
Yuan.

93
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,910
What's wrong?

94
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,750
Where is Ah Shu?

95
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,590
I don't know where Ah Shu is.

96
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,590
Let me ask you again. Where is Ah Shu?

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,880
What happened?

98
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,580
You don't know that uncle.

99
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,780
You must have something to do with Ah Shu's disappearance.

100
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,920
Where is she?

101
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,010
I've been locked up here all the time.

102
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,750
How can I possibly know where she is?

103
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,610
I'll kill you if you don't tell me!

104
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,140
Kill me.

105
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,909
I don't want to live anyway.

106
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,310
You...

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Yuan Mo.

108
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,300
If you still consider her your friend,

109
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,070
tell me

110
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,570
who sent you.

111
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,510
Don't act rashly!

112
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,950
Yuan Mo!

113
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,110
Are you going to tell me or not?

114
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,570
Yuan Mo!

115
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,510
I met Deputy Envoy Kang on the street.

116
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,640
Let's talk outside.

117
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
Ah Shilan,

118
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,800
if you still have a conscience,

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
think about how she treated you.

120
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,470
Have you recovered? Why did you come out?

121
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm fine.

122
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,480
How did Ah Shu treat me?

123
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,180
I met Deputy Envoy Kang on the street just now.

124
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,860
He had your chess manual with him.

125
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,660
So, it was him.

126
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,720
What do you mean?

127
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,490
Go on.

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,990
He said the chess manual is your prized possession,

129
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,870
but he has more than one

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,030
of your prized possessions with him.

131
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,190
I thought he was hinting at something,

132
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,150
so I rushed here to tell you.

133
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,390
He was referring to Ah Shu.

134
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,030
Ah Shu?

135
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,650
Ah Shu disappeared this morning.

136
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,970
She must be in danger now.

137
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,610
Let's get in the coach first.

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,549
What?

139
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,850
Deputy Envoy Kang is that mysterious uncle?

140
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,460
So, he deliberately drew my attention

141
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,270
so that I'd tell Yuan Mo the news about Ah Shu.

142
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,770
What else did he say?

143
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,090
He said he had to return to the Yanle Embassy to work,

144
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,560
and that Yuan Mo should

145
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,030
go get his prized possession back if he can.

146
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,250
Ah Shu is at the Yanle Embassy.

147
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,750
The Yanle Embassy?

148
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:05,970
Well,

149
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,450
with Deputy Envoy Kang at the Yanle Embassy,

150
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,020
how can Ah Shu be in danger?

151
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,970
I'm afraid it was someone else who caught Ah Shu.

152
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,200
The Man in White?

153
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,600
The biggest problem now

154
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,740
is how we can enter the Yanle Embassy.

155
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,680
According to the agreement between Yong and other states,

156
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
the Yong people must submit a visiting card in advance

157
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,490
if they want to enter a state's embassy,

158
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,240
or the embassy has the right to refuse entry.

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,670
We don't have time to do that.

160
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,800
Even if we have time,

161
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,790
they won't let us in.

162
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,590
Then...

163
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,050
The Yanle Embassy has a secret door.

164
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,710
After we went there last time,

165
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,700
the Man in White must have posted guards there.

166
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,940
The Yanle Embassy

167
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,550
must be heavily guarded now.

168
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,630
Our chances of sneaking in are slim.

169
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,350
You didn't agree to any of our plans.

170
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,350
Are we going to let Ah Shu get killed?

171
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,420
Calm down.

172
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,110
Kunwu,

173
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,810
how would the Mingwei Prefecture respond

174
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,850
when faced with such a tough battle?

175
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,110
If the enemy had strong fortifications,

176
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,020
we'd go up to the sky and go underground.

177
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,610
Going up to the sky and going underground?

178
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,280
We'd build an embrasured watchtower and shoot arrows from there.

179
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,180
That's going up to the sky.

180
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,730
We'd also dig a tunnel and launch a surprise attack on the enemy's camp.

181
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,260
That's going underground.

182
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,760
Okay.

183
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,370
To save Ah Shu,

184
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,560
we'll go underground.

185
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,150
We don't have time to dig a tunnel.

186
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,050
Who said we have to dig a tunnel ourselves?

187
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,450
There are tunnels ready.

188
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,550
Where are the tunnels?

189
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,640
The drainage channels.

190
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,780
There are drainage channels everywhere underneath Changle City.

191
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,640
The wastewater from every household

192
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,610
is discharged into the river outside the city

193
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,030
through the drainage channels.

194
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,110
Therefore, there must be drainage channels

195
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,950
underneath the Yanle Embassy, too.

196
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,990
As long as we find the nearest entrance,

197
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,390
we can enter the embassy.

198
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,650
But how do we find the entrance?

199
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
I have an idea.

200
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,150
Turn around.

201
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,480
Deputy Envoy Kang,

202
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,220
I've been waiting for you.

203
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,100
What are you going to do with that maid?

204
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,430
What?

205
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,950
You don't know this token?

206
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,560
May God bless Viceroy Long.

207
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,590
It's good that you know it.

208
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,390
I'd like to ask you to do something.

209
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,330
I want you to execute Ah Shu in public.

210
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,020
[The Huos' Tiangong Workshop]

211
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,310
This is the entrance.

212
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,310
After you get in there, head east.

213
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,470
Turn south at the second fork.

214
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,330
Exit from here.

215
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,430
That's great.

216
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,150
Thank you, Young Master Huo.

217
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,720
I knew you were clear about all constructions

218
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,800
in Changle City.

219
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:44,710
Hua,

220
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,680
are you really going to sneak into the Yanle Embassy?

221
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,910
By the way,

222
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
don't tell my father.

223
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,610
I won't.

224
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,480
I was going to say I can help you.

225
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,490
How are you going to help us?

226
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,000
Young Master Huo, we appreciate your kindness.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,550
But what we're doing is dangerous and involves many things.

228
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,230
We'd better not get others involved.

229
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,290
What are you doing?

230
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,230
There's strength in numbers.

231
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,430
Yuan, you misunderstand.

232
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm not going with you.

233
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,920
Please come with me.

234
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,250
Then how is he going to help us?

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,920
Look.

236
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,980
Young Master Huo.

237
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,790
Forgive me for asking.

238
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,670
Are you planning a rebellion?

239
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,500
Yuan, you must be kidding.

240
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,100
All weapons made by Tiangong Workshop

241
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,160
are registered with the government.

242
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,070
What's this?

243
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,090
This is the soft armor I designed.

244
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,540
No weapon can pierce it.

245
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,010
The fine steel used to make the armor

246
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,850
is made from a special kind of ore,

247
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,680
which is rare in our state.

248
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,420
So, this is the only piece in the world.

249
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm giving it to you.

250
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,200
Really?

251
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,400
This kind of thing seems safe

252
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,470
but is actually the most dangerous.

253
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,900
The person who wears it will think they're invulnerable,

254
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,550
and then they'll act recklessly

255
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,680
and die for nothing.

256
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,030
Say whatever you want.

257
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,560
I'm wearing it anyway.

258
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,020
Well, we should hurry up.

259
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,200
Ah Shu is waiting for us to save her.

260
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,250
Young Master Huo,

261
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,730
which of these weapons

262
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,030
can we choose?

263
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,590
Choose whatever you want

264
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,710
as long as you think it will be useful.

265
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,590
Just return it to me when you're done.

266
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,050
Really?

267
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,390
That's great.

268
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,670
Then I'll just pick a few of them.

269
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,390
Please.

270
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,080
This... this one is good.

271
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,880
This... this one will be useful.

272
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,220
Come on. Open it.

273
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,550
This...

274
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
It's inevitable.

275
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,580
It's been raining a lot. There's floodwater from the mountains.

276
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,060
Well,

277
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,880
I'm afraid we'll only get ourselves killed if we jump down.

278
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,410
This is indeed the only way.

279
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,750
Can you swim?

280
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,030
Looks like we can't go underground

281
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,830
but have to go up to the sky.

282
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,150
We can go up to the sky.

283
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,630
It's just that I think

284
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,190
we should stick to the original plan.

285
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,550
Okay.

286
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,490
You follow the original plan.

287
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,900
Let's go.

288
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,430
Let's go.

289
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,520
Well.

290
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,610
Am I the only one who's going to follow the original plan?

291
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,760
Pick a handy weapon.

292
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,130
Don't take too many weapons with you.

293
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,350
[Yanle Embassy]

294
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,350
Look. Who's that?

295
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,610
Right. Why did they take this person to the gallows?

296
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,320
Is Deputy Envoy Kang going to execute this person at the embassy?

297
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,570
-That's impossible.
-No way.

298
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,580
Deputy Envoy Kang is here.

299
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,970
Greetings, Deputy Envoy Kang.

300
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,150
Rise.

301
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,080
Deputy Envoy Kang,

302
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,540
except for the guards,

303
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,200
all other members of the Yanle Embassy are here.

304
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:22,550
Very well.

305
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,520
I'm sure everyone wants to know

306
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,550
why I summoned you here in the middle of the night.

307
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,240
As you all know,

308
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,310
since our late king passed away,

309
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,620
Viceroy Long has been serving Yanle tirelessly

310
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,460
for over a decade.

311
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,960
However, there's still a treacherous official
bearing ill intent towards Viceroy Long.

312
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,110
He got a commoner's daughter to pose as the late king's daughter

313
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,550
and wanted to rebel and cause chaos
in the name of the false princess.

314
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,510
Really?

315
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,070
Posing as a princess is a capital offense.

316
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,690
Viceroy Long is blessed by God.

317
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,710
Tonight,

318
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,740
I'm going to offer this commoner's blood as a sacrifice to heaven.

320
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,630

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,470
Very well.

326
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,420
it'd be so hard to go underground,

327
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,680
I'd have chosen to go up to the sky no matter how scared I was.

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,850
The magistrate of Jingzhao is here to investigate a case.

377
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,050
Don't move!

378
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,470
I received a report

379
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,690
that there was a fight at the Yanle Embassy,

380
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,740
and the sounds of fighting kept coming out.

381
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,140
It is my duty

382
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,870
to come here to maintain order and find out the truth.

383
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,390
The Yanle Embassy is an important place for Yanle.

384
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,050
You can't enter without a diplomatic document.

385
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
If you don't make way,

386
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,940
don't blame me for being impolite.

387
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,550
My Lord,

388
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,750
the men from the Jingzhao Prefecture have surrounded this place.

389
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,980
It seems luck is not on our side today.

390
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,860
Let's have a quick fight.

391
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,800
We are also inside the embassy.

392
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,090
If the men from the Jingzhao Prefecture see us,
we'll be found guilty of trespassing,

393
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,300
and it will be hard to explain.

394
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,950
It's not good to cause a dispute between them and us.

395
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,430
Guards.

396
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,480
Yes.

397
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,890
Enter the Yanle Embassy.

398
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,630
Yes.

399
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,880
Let's leave now.

400
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,350
I'll let you off the hook today,

401
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,320
but I'll catch you sooner or later.

402
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,580
Ah Shu.

403
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,870
Just try.

404
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,700
I'll be waiting for you.

405
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,040
Who said there was a fight at the Yanle Embassy?

406
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,590
[Yanle Embassy]

407
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,470
Magistrate Lin.

408
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,980
Who said there was a fight at the Yanle Embassy?

409
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,140
Listen.

410
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,390
Do you hear any sounds of fighting

411
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,360
coming from inside?

412
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,990
Since I received a report, I must investigate.

413
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,440
There's no small foreign affair, Deputy Envoy Kang.

414
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
If you insist on barging in,

415
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

416
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,980
I will tell all states tomorrow

417
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,800
that Yong State bullied my embassy with its power.

418
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Deputy Envoy Kang, don't twist the facts.

419
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,660
Although the Yanle Embassy is Yanle's territory,

420
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,790
it's still on the land of Yong's Changle City.

421
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,920
The Jingzhao Prefecture has the responsibility to maintain order here.

422
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,790
Deputy Envoy Kang, you keep stopping us.

423
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,400
Did something dirty happen inside the embassy?

424
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,690
Magistrate Lin, what are you talking about?

425
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,750
Are you deliberately trying to frame me

426
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,220
and insult Yanle?

427
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,490
Magistrate Lin.

428
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,730
Why make things so tense?

429
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,290
How about this?

430
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,240
Let's compromise.

431
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,970
We'll accompany you as you investigate inside by yourself

432
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,580
while the others wait outside.

433
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,770
What do you think?

434
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,260
Put your knives away.

435
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,110
Please.

436
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,560
Magistrate Lin.

437
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,640
Did you find anything strange?

438
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,230
Didn't you say there was no fighting?

439
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,380
What is this?

440
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,110
This is an arrowhead

441
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,110
left by our soldiers during a drill.

442
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,920
Right?

443
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,370
Magistrate Lin,

444
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,000
do you want to keep looking?

445
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,790
Alright.

446
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,500
If anyone trespasses into the Yanle Embassy

447
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,150
and causes chaos in the future,

448
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,150
please report it to me immediately.

449
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,630
It's my duty.

450
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,270
Things got out of hand.

451
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,130
How am I supposed to clean up the mess?

452
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,990
If word gets out,

453
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,140
Yanle will be denounced by all states.

454
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,220
When that happens,

455
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,070
how am I supposed to explain to Viceroy Long?

456
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,470
I've planned a meritorious deed for you.

457
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,830
Not only will Viceroy Long not punish you,

458
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,860
but also he will reward you.

459
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,480
Enough!

460
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,510
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

461
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,630
This is just the beginning.

462
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,520
What a pity!

463
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,790
We almost caught the Man in White.

464
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,990
I acted impulsively just now.

465
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,760
Now that I think about it,

466
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,110
if the soldiers from the Jingzhao Prefecture

467
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,370
had barged in just now,

468
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,230
we'd have had difficulty explaining

469
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,110
and even implicated Deputy Envoy Kang.

470
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,550
Moreover, Yong and Yanle

471
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,490
might be at war.

472
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,660
That makes sense.

473
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,750
However, this time,

474
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,210
we got a clear look at the face

475
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,740
of the female assassin working for the Man in White.

476
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,400
I'll have the Jingzhao Prefecture make a wanted poster tomorrow.

477
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,080
Yuan Mo.

478
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,550
What's wrong? You've been quiet.

479
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,810
What are you thinking?

480
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,940
What have I done?

481
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,340
If I had known Deputy Envoy Kang

482
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,290
was the uncle who raised Ah Shu,

483
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,020
I wouldn't have been

484
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,560
so antagonistic to him.

485
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,550
I was so foolish!

486
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,380
I should have been more tolerant!

487
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,820
This is bad.

488
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,120
How can I face him in the future?

489
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,510
If I want to marry Ah Shu in the future,

490
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,440
do I have to ask for his permission?

491
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,230
I've screwed it up!

492
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,370
What are you talking about?

493
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,000
I didn't agree to marry you.

494
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,750
But don't worry.

495
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,800
In your previous confrontations,

496
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,510
you were both representing the interests

497
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,830
of your own side.

498
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,580
Uncle Kang will understand.

499
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,550
Although Deputy Envoy Kang wasn't exposed this time,

500
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,280
the Man in White won't let it go.

501
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,170
Let's not

502
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,100
contact Deputy Envoy Kang for the time being.

503
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,720
Also, we must keep this strictly confidential

504
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
and not let anyone else know.

505
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,820
However, we can't

506
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,900
hide everything from Yu and the others anymore.

507
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,130
I'm sure Ah Shilan

508
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,820
is working for the Man in White.

509
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,910
Otherwise, she wouldn't have tricked Ah Shu

510
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,420
into seeing Deputy Envoy Kang.

511
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,950
Right?

512
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,630
Right?

513
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,860
I just don't understand.

514
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,270
Why did Ah Shilan do that?

515
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,310
Why did she turn to the Man in White?

516
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,110
Don't worry.

517
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
You still have us.

518
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,170
No matter how dangerous the future may be,

519
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,300
we will definitely find out the truth.

520
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,940
[Huaiyuan Hall]

521
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,400
As expected of the members of the West Court,

522
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,260
you began yawning in the morning.

523
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,050
How many times have I told you?

524
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,080
Don't stay up late.

525
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,110
If you keep staying up late, your health will break down.

526
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,310
Look, you've been a bad influence on Ah Shu.

527
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,310
You should learn from Retainer Wang.

528
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,420
He used to be a soldier.

529
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,020
He gets up early every day...

530
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,800
What are you doing?

531
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,920
Tell me.

532
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,950
What did you four do last night?

533
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,480
We went to the Yanle Embassy.

534
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,010
Yanle...

535
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,910
Who got you a visiting card?

536
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,130
We didn't have one.

537
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,170
Ah Shu was abducted by the Man in White.

538
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,570
We went there to save her.

539
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,380
Ah Shilan is an impostor.

540
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,370
She's working for the Man in White.

541
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,860
Actually, I am the real Princess Yanle.

542
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,120
Do you think this joke

543
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,970
is funny?

544
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,830
What a ridiculous lie!

545
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,320
Princess Yanle?

546
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,310
Oh, come on.

547
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,620
No more of this nonsense in the future.

548
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,180
Mr. Yu.

549
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,840
What?

550
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,130
Why do I feel like...

551
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,230
what they said is true?

552
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,290
Why were you influenced by them?

553
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,030
Does any one of them seem reliable...

554
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,380
Retainer Wang is alright.

555
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,100
You never lie. You tell me.

556
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,250
You said it yourself

557
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,390
that I never lie.

558
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,980
Yes.

559
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,360
You never lie.

560
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:26,980
So...

561
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,900
So, it's true?

562
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,270
Give me a hand.

563
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,620
Can someone tell me

564
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,110
what's going on here?

565
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,580
Since Ah Shu is the real Princess Yanle,

566
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,470
we can't let Ah Shilan continue to impersonate her.

567
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,870
We should immediately reveal Ah Shu's identity

568
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,680
to the public

569
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,590
to prevent anyone from making a big deal about Ah Shilan.

570
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,160
An Xiuyi.

571
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,990
Ah Shu came all the way from Yanle to Changle

572
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,920
just to live a normal life.

573
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,870
Now, you want to put her in the spotlight again,

574
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,390
right?

575
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,190
How can you have the heart to do that?

576
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,440
Have you forgotten how Ah Shu treated you

577
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
during the naturalization ceremony?

578
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,280
Don't you have a conscience?

579
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,050
Ah Shu is my friend, too.

580
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,190
However, as a retainer of the Sifang Pavilion,

581
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,550
I can't be swayed by personal feelings

582
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,550
when facing major foreign affairs.

583
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,580
Hua,

584
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,540
you understand me, right?

585
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,950
That's the difference between you and me.

586
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,350
I...

587
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,060
Wang Kunwu.

588
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,000
I understand your dedication to public duty,

589
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,680
but I can't let you

590
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,060
reveal Ah Shu's identity to the public

591
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,500
before exhausting all other options.

592
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,030
Fine.

593
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,750
You're all good people.

594
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,990
I'm the only bad guy.

595
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
Let me remind you.

596
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,330
Time waits for no one.

597
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,280
If you don't act, the Man in White will.

598
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,880
By then, it will be too late.

599
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,430
Mr. Yu,

600
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,350
I think we should at least transfer Ah Shilan

601
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,640
to the Jingzhao Prefecture's prison

602
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,700
and keep her under strict guard

603
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,160
in case anything happens.

604
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,430
Ah Shu,

605
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,110
what do you think?

606
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,550
I think

607
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,220
Retainer An has a point.

608
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,170
The Man in White will surely make a comeback.

609
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,140
Ah Shilan is his most useful pawn.

610
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,780
We must be prepared.

611
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,030
Okay.

612
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,450
I was waiting for you to say that.

613
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,650
I'll go to the Ministry of Rites now

614
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,270
to have Vice Minister An approve Xiuyi's suggestion

615
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,680
to put Ah Shilan under strict guard.

616
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,210
[Jing Mansion]

617
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,010
By order of the magistrate of Jingzhao,

618
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,420
we're escorting Ah Shilan

619
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,350
to the Jingzhao Prefecture's prison for detention.

620
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,250
Sir.

621
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,200
Sir...

622
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,390
W-What's going on?

623
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,130
Is there some mistake?

624
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,930
I-I'm from the Sifang Pavilion.

625
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,790
That's good.

626
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,820
Come with us to the Jingzhao Prefecture for the handover.

627
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,350
Let's go.

628
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,450
Wait, sir.

629
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,350
Is there some misunderstanding?

630
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,090
Sir.

631
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,850
-What are you doing? Why the mystery?
-Raise your foot.

632
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,440
Okay.

633
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,230
You'll know when we get there.

634
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,730
Are we there yet?

635
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,560
No peeking.

636
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,590
Alright.

637
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,410
Where are we?

638
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,320
This

639
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,650
is going to be our home.

640
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,030
Home?

641
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,210
I've already bought it.

642
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,040
Where did you get the money?

643
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,830
By saving.

644
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,110
Although it looks a bit shabby,

645
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,770
the courtyard

646
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,270
is much bigger than our current one,

647
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,430
and the rooms are more spacious than our current rooms.

648
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,470
Most importantly,

649
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,060
you can fill this courtyard

650
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,650
with plants.

651
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,190
What do you think of this place?

652
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,230
I've got it all planned out.

653
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,150
In summer,

654
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,000
we can swing together here,

655
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,940
looking at the stars and enjoying the cool breeze.

656
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,260
We can do these things

657
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
at our current home, too.

658
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,280
Right.

659
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,450
But that's not good enough to be our future.

660
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,320
Come with me.

661
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,500
Let me show you our real future.

662
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,400
Look.

663
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,900
Is it spacious?

664
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,780
It's so big.

665
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,040
Look at here.

666
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,300
Let's

667
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,140
put a huge bed here.

668
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,060
You can lie on it

669
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,410
and toss and turn however you like.

670
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,330
You're the one who likes to toss and turn.

671
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,000
And here.

672
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,040
Guess what

673
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,130
I want to put here.

674
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,870
What do you want to put here?

675
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,240
I want to put a big bathtub here.

676
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,900
Forget about your big bathtub.

677
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,920
But these aren't the most important.

678
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,190
The most important thing is to show you

679
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,230
our real future.

680
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,320
Let's go.

681
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,300
Please.

682
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,480
Listen.

683
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,040
A school?

684
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,370
There are four or five schools nearby.

685
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,320
They call this area the "school district."

686
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,530
So, the houses here

687
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,020
are called the "school-district houses."

688
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
When we have children in the future,

689
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,690
it will be convenient for us

690
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,420
to take them to and from school.

691
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,590
The twilight is dim.

692
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,560
There are rosy clouds at dawn.

693
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,679
Good day, sir.

694
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,620
School's over.

695
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,630
-Come.
-Father. Mother.

696
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,990
Why are you laughing?

697
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,520
I didn't say I want to have children with you.

698
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,990
Buying a house is such a big deal.

699
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,480
Yet you bought the house

700
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,790
without discussing it with me.

701
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,510
Do you have any idea

702
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,170
how much we spend every month?

703
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,270
Daily necessities,

704
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,510
clothes for all seasons, ice for summer, coal for winter,

705
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,790
two meals at Inebriation Restaurant every month,

706
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,310
gifts for holidays and festivals,

707
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,440
and the good wines you like to collect.

708
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,400
So, you've thought that far ahead.

709
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:27,900
Ah Shu,

710
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,130
we'll live here in the future.

711
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,160
Not just us,

712
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,760
but our children

713
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,770
and grandchildren.

714
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,410
Together, we'll celebrate every birthday

715
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,660
and hold their coming-of-age ceremonies.

716
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,190
We'll watch the children grow up day by day

717
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,860
as we grow old.

718
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,220
But we won't feel sad.

719
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,350
Because we'll always be by each other's side

720
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,560
in the future

721
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,400
and never be apart.

722
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,550
Ah Shu,

723
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,100
will you live this life with me?

724
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,970
Yes.

725
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,120
What's wrong?

726
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,760
Save the kissing for later.

727
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,730
Something happened to Ah Shilan.

728
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,680
So many people died.

729
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,280
There's someone alive here.

730
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:57,950
Hurry.

731
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,330
Here.

732
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,490
Come here. Quick.

733
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,310
Qing.

734
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Qing. Qing. Qing.

735
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,080
Qing.

736
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,270
He was drugged with Black Wind Powder.

737
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,230
The Man in White?

738
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,000
Qing.

739
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,840
What happened here?

740
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,910
The Faceless...

741
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,740
The Faceless took Ah Shilan away.

742
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,660
Make way.

743
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,760
Get up first.

744
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,310
Take everyone to the hospital.

745
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:31,820
Yes.

746
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,690
Go to the hospital first.

747
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,410
-Slowly.
-Be careful.

748
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,730
Yuan Mo.

749
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,090
I know you want to protect Ah Shu.

750
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,750
But now that Ah Shilan has been taken away,

751
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,680
the Yanle people will surely make a big deal about her.

752
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,460
If we don't reveal Ah Shu's identity in advance,

753
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,690
we'll easily be put on the defensive.

754
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,220
By then, it will be too late.

755
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,410
He's right.

756
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,180
The Man in White has taken Ah Shilan away.

757
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,140
Next, Long Tuqi

758
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,890
will surely use her as a puppet.

759
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,110
He'll use her identity as the princess

760
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,390
to suppress the people of Yanle.

761
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,420
I can only turn the tables by revealing my identity.

762
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,100
Ah Shu.

763
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,070
If you reveal your identity,

764
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,630
you'll never live free again.

765
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,130
How can you still be thinking about that at a time like this?

766
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,930
Shut up.

767
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Look around here.

768
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,760
We should let Ah Shu make her own decision on this.

769
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,420
It's not open for discussion.

770
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,080
Ah Shu.

771
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,690
You must think it through.

772
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,030
Don't act on impulse.

773
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,100
What's going on over there?

774
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,230
Let's go take a look.

775
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,440
Yuan Mo.

776
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,120
Why are there suddenly so many people?

777
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,480
We find it strange, too.

778
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,470
Excuse me, sir.

779
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,600
Where are you going?

780
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,790
We're going to collect the money and food for Yanle people.

781
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,610
Money and food?

782
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,850
Yes. Don't you know?

783
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,110
The people from the Yanle Embassy said

784
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,350
Deputy Envoy Kang is distributing money and food to the Yanle people in the West Market.

785
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,190
As long as you're from Yanle,

786
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,860
regardless of age and gender, you can receive money and food.

787
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,830
I have to go.

788
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,310
Why is Deputy Envoy Kang

789
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,430
suddenly distributing money and food to the Yanle people?

790
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,830
Something bad is coming.

791
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,740
Let's go.

792
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,710
Greetings, Princess Ah Shilan.

793
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,830
Greetings, Princess Ah Shilan.

794
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,110
-My subjects,
-We're late.

795
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,950
please rise.

796
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

797
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,380
My subjects,

798
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,220
I'm sorry

799
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,470
for not meeting you earlier.

800
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,390
I know you're living a hard life

801
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,060
away from your homeland.

802
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,770
Therefore, I've prepared money and food

803
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,030
to bail you out and ease your worries.

804
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,790
Great!

805
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,750
I hereby swear

806
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,610
I will make your lives better and better

807
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,390
with each passing day.

808
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,090
Apart from the money and food

809
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,890
to address your pressing needs,

810
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,070
one day,

811
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
I will take you all back

812
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,080
to our homeland

813
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,220
and back to the peaceful life we once had.

814
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,480
Please believe in me.

815
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,030
May God bless the princess.

816
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,920
May God bless the princess.

817
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,590
May God bless the princess.

818
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,440
May God bless the princess.

819
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,430
Now we'll start distributing money and food.

820
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,770
Okay.

821
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,330
Collect food here.

822
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,750
Then come to me for money.

823
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,700
Form a line.

824
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,470
One at a time. There's enough for everyone.

825
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,310
Thank you, Your Highness.

826
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,550
One at a time.

827
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,030
Take this.

828
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

829
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,150
Be careful.

830
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

831
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,080
Ah Shilan.

832
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,740
Don't worry.

833
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,880
There must be a way.

834
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:13,680
Remember.

835
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,660
It's the princess who improved your lives.

836
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,770
Thank you, Your Highness.

837
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,650
Princess Ah Shilan is truly kind.

838
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,390
She gave us money and food.

839
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,430
What makes you so sure she's the real princess?

840
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,450
What if she's a fake?

841
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,160
Whoever treats us well is the real princess.

842
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,350
At least she gave us money and food.

843
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,390
You said she's not the real princess.

844
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,170
Let me ask you.

845
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,090
Has the real princess ever cared for us all these years?

846
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,350
What's wrong with him?

847
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,950
Kang Yunhai is so cunning.

848
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,470
He actually came up with the idea

849
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,350
of using money and food to win the hearts of the Yanle people

850
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,430
and make them acknowledge

851
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,500
that Ah Shilan is Princess Yanle.

852
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,790
What's the attitude of the envoys of the other states?

853
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,790
Vice Minister An,

854
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,470
not a single state objected.

855
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,830
The people of Yanle have acknowledged it.

856
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,630
What objections can they raise?

857
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,630
They're just standing by and watching.

858
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,690
Yanle is trying

859
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,300
to turn Ah Shilan's identity as the princess

860
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,820
into a fait accompli

861
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,920
and force Yong to acknowledge her legitimacy.

862
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,750
I think the Yanle people are only guided by money and food.

863
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,820
Whoever offers them benefits is their princess.

864
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,730
In that case,

865
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,070
we might as well let Ah Shu go to Sweet Spring Square

866
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,280
to distribute more money and food than Ah Shilan did.

867
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,660
Let's see who will be acknowledged by the Yanle people as their princess.

868
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,460
Nonsense!

869
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,510
Do you think this is a children's game

870
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,110
in which who gives more wins?

871
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,350
Besides, Ah Shilan has already used this method

872
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,150
to win a round.

873
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,860
If you try to imitate her,

874
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,750
it will disgrace our state

875
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
and draw ridicule from Yanle and the other states.

876
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,190
Xiuyi,

877
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,180
Vice Minister An is right.

878
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,120
Even if some people accept the money and food given by Ah Shu

879
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,070
and acknowledge her as the princess,

880
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,070
it won't help.

881
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,110
They'll just keep arguing,

882
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,720
with neither side being able to convince the other.

883
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,400
Besides,

884
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,800
after Kang Yunhai claimed Ah Shilan to be the princess,

885
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,330
no envoys of the five states objected, right?

886
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,500
That means they've accepted it.

887
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,940
If we claim Ah Shu to be the real princess at this point,

888
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,080
I'm afraid the envoys of the five states won't agree.

889
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,940
Yong has formed an alliance with the five states.

890
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,930
Will they believe Yanle

891
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,040
instead of Yong?

892
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,100
That they're our allies doesn't mean they're dependent on us.

893
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,960
Each state has its own interests.

894
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,680
They won't always follow Yong's lead.

895
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,560
Ah Shu has a Vanessa tattoo on her foot,

896
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,900
and so does Ah Shilan.

897
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,850
We have no way to prove

898
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,540
that Ah Shilan is a fake.

899
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,310
Besides, we failed to get a head start.

900
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,170
How are you going to make the five states believe us?

901
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,710
Vice Minister An,

902
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,480
the envoy of Yanle has taken Ah Shilan here to see you.

903
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,280
So soon?

904
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,480
They didn't give us

905
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,510
any breathing room at all.
