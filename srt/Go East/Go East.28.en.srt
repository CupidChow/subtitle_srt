[Episode 28]

3
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,650
Sister.

4
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,420
Hey,

5
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,830
you're taking everything?

6
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,560
You might as well pack me up too.

7
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,990
Princess.

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,630
Do you want to take this as well?

9
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,130
Stop!

10
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,660
You won't even spare a little snake?

11
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,669
At least leave Poppet behind.

12
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,020
If you take everything, what am I supposed to do?

13
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,480
What will I do if I miss you?

14
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,570
Alright, alright.

15
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,840
You can keep Poppet.

16
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,930
Pack up those things over there.

17
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,450
Okay.

18
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,790
Oh, Poppet.

19
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,900
They're so cruel.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,440
From now on, it's just you and me.

21
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,620
Listen to yourself.

22
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,560
It's not like I'm never coming back.

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,710
I'm just temporarily staying at the Princess's Mansion.

24
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,390
How can it be temporary, Princess?

25
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,760
Now that you've been bestowed the title,

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,190
if you don't live in the Princess's Mansion,

27
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,310
are you going to stay with this outsider man,

28
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,760
crammed in this rundown house?

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,250
What?

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,530
You're calling me an outsider?

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,650
Did you hear that?

32
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,550
This newcomer called me an outsider.

33
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,460
I'm wholeheartedly looking out for our Princess.

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,860
Why can't I call you that?

35
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,680
Sharp-tongued, aren't you?

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,620
Look at your little sister, will you?

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,590
Learn from your little sister. She's so quiet.

38
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,250
Big sister.

39
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,290
Hello, Big Sister.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,050
Alright.

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,300
I know you'll miss me.

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,160
I'll miss you too.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,480
But I've just been bestowed the title

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,830
and I have to receive envoys from the various states.

45
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,030
It's indeed inconvenient to stay here.

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,070
Today it's an audience, tomorrow it's a congratulations.

47
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,620
The day after that, they'll find some other excuse.

48
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,480
Will you ever be able to come back?

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't worry.

50
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,700
I promise you.

51
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,370
After this period,

52
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,550
I'll move back.

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,490
I still want to move into our new home with you.

54
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,480
Really?

55
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,579
Then you better keep your word.

56
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,780
They're so annoying.

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,210
I guarantee you.

58
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,650
Even though I've become a princess,

59
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,460
nothing will change,

60
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,600
especially what's between us.

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,250
Okay.

62
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,630
Then let's hug one more time.

63
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,079
Back off.

64
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,060
Back off, back off, back off.

65
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,329
Back off, back off.

66
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:54,860
Back off?

67
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,210
Where am I supposed to back off to?

68
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,760
My sister is a woman of few words.

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,960
Mr. Yuan, you just have to get used to it.

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,910
If anyone should back off, it's you two, understand?

71
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,860
This is my house.

72
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,090
Listen up.

73
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,450
I want to spend some time alone with the Princess now.

74
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,510
You two, back off, back off, back off.

75
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,630
What are you doing, brandishing weapons like that?

76
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,800
Your big sister is better.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,260
You should learn from her.

78
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,920
At least she is a bit gentler.

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,180
I'm the little sister.

80
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,750
Deputy Envoy Kang ordered us

81
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,390
to ensure the Princess's safety here.

82
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,510
We absolutely won't allow anyone with ill intentions

83
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,910
to get close to the princess.

84
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,620
Mr. Yuan.

85
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,590
Don't blame me.

86
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,850
I have ill intentions?

87
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,360
Wait, Ah Shu.

88
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,380
She says I have ill intentions.

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,830
Am I really someone with ill intentions?

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,430
Aren't you?

91
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,180
I... I...

92
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,710
This is my home.

93
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,490
Where are you taking me?

94
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,150
Ouch, be gentle!

95
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,710
My sister is being polite.

96
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,140
Otherwise, she would have sent you to see a doctor already.

97
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,060
Can you dismiss these two?

98
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,900
There are plenty of good maids in Changle City.

99
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,909
Keep packing.

Rise.

109
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,350
Thank you, Princess.

I humbly represent the Yueying Embassy

111
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,540
to congratulate Princess Long Shuang on your investiture.

112
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,850
We have prepared a modest gift.

113
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,850
Please accept it.

114
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,930
The Yueying Envoy is too kind.

In the sky...

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,260
shines bright as the moon.

125

that I wish to forge a friendly bond with your state.

126
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,330
May it endure for ages to come.

127

I shall certainly relay

128

your words.

129
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,310
Princess, you are very busy.

130
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,970
I fear I have imposed too much.

131

Your Highness.

154
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,030
All the envoys from various states have been sent off.

155
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,370
Isn't the princess supposed to have a spoiled life?

156
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,330
Why is this more exhausting than being a commoner?

157
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,790
It's only the first day and you already feel tired.

158
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,590
There are still many days ahead.

159
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,770
What?

160
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,220
Do I have to do this every day from now on?

161
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,910
As long as there are outsiders present,

162
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,480
you must mind your manners.

163
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,710
During the day,

164
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,520
you must not sit like this.

165
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,830
Tell them I'm sick.

166
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,040
I won't see

167
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,370
any outsiders.

168
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,280
You can't hide forever, Your Highness.

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,200
Are you saying you will never go out again?

170
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,350
As long as you're outside,

171
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,500
whether you receive guests or not,

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
you must mind your manners.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,790
After all, there are so many eyes watching.

174
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,510
If you're not careful, rumors will spread in town

175
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,430
about the princess being discourteous and ill-mannered.

176
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,070
Indeed.

177
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,270
I'm not a princess.

178
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,230
You've got the wrong person.

179
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,760
No, no.

180
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,170
Your Highness.

181
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,770
I painted the red butterfly.

182
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,150
I also had someone carve the golden seal.

183
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,870
Let me go back.

184
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,870
Your Highness.

185
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,630
Your Highness.

186
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,770
You can't back out now.

187
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,550
That's right.

188
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,260
It's already been announced to the world.

189
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,710
Please bear with it.

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,160
You'll get used to it.

191
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,950
The princess has had a tiring day.

192
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,110
You two, take good care of her.

193
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,730
We'll take our leave now.

194
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,470
Farewell.

195
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,630
Let me in.

196
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,710
No, let me in.

197
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,510
It's not allowed.

198
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,460
Yuan Mo?

199
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,130
No, let me in.

200
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,470
[Princess's Mansion]

201
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,230
Let me in.

202
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,980
Not allowed.

203
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,390
The princess said no outsiders are allowed.

204
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm not an outsider.

205
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,170
I'm an insider.

206
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,430
No, that's not right.

207
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
I'm the princess's personal guard.

208
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,780
Personal guard!

209
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,180
Not allowed.

210
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,230
The princess's personal guard, you hear me?

211
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,690
San Niang is the princess's personal guard.

212
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,740
Our princess said no, so it's a no.

213
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,910
What's wrong with you?

214
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,510
Sister.

215
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,950
What are you doing?

216
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,310
San Niang.

217
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,240
You're so scary.

218
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,270
Don't be rude.

219
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,240
Ah Shu.

220
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,390
Ah Shu, you're finally here.

221
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,190
Quick, let me in.

222
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,550
Make them leave.

223
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,370
The princess can take our lives,

224
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,220
but she can never let us leave our posts.

225
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,190
Otherwise, we won't be able to answer to Deputy Envoy Kang.

226
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,840
Have some decency, will you?

227
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,350
Ah Shu and I are in love with each other.

228
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,750
Do you know what it means

229
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,670
for seconds to drag on like years when you're apart?

230
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,850
Being in love is fine,

231
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,200
but for a meeting, you need a formal visitation card.

232
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,530
If it's about marriage,

233
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,480
then both parties need to exchange formal documents.

234
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,320
There are no small matters in foreign affairs.

235
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,510
If you casually break these rules,

236
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,750
my sister and I will have to kill ourselves right here

237
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,220
to atone for our failure.

238
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,470
Hey.

239
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,710
Alright, alright. There's no need for that.

240
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,770
Put the knife down.

241
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,320
You two...

242
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,020
are amazing.

243
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,310
Princess.

244
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
We'll meet again.

245
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,190
Ah Shu!

246
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,310
Ah Shu!

247
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,110
Yuan Mo!

248
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,200
Come in quickly.

249
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,240
Be careful.

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Ah Shu.

251
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,240
It's so hard to see you.

252
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,430
Thank you for your efforts.

254
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,230
It's nothing.

255
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,050
As long as I can see you,

256
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,730
all the effort is worth it.

257
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,510
How was it?

258
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,790
You met so many envoys in a row today.

259
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,960
How did it feel?

260
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,330
Don't even mention it.

261
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,320
I sat all day.

262
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,540
I wasn't allowed to smile or move.

263
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,250
I had to expressionlessly say

264
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,230
a bunch of things that I didn't even understand.

265
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,430
Thankfully, Shen was there.

266
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,030
Otherwise, I would've become a laughingstock.

267
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,920
I knew it.

268
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,700
I had Shen prepare in advance

269
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
to give you hints.

270
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,270
Ah Shu.

271
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,670
I missed you so much.

272
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,830
I missed you too.

273
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,270
Princess.

274
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,770
Deputy Envoy Kang requests an audience.

275
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,430
K-Kang... I-I-I…

276
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,390
I'll hide.

277
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,270
No need.

278
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,890
No need.

279
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,230
Princess.

280
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,470
Uncle Kang.

281
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,050
Deputy Envoy Kang.

282
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,170
It seems no wall is high enough to keep you out.

283
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,190
Don't just stand here.

284
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,390
Please, come inside.

285
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,580
After you, Princess.

286
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,710
Please have a seat, Deputy Envoy Kang.

287
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,440
Sit, sit, sit.

288
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,580
Deputy Envoy Kang,

289
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,380
have some tea.

290
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,590
Uncle Kang.

291
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,030
The Man in White didn't catch you last time.

292
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,590
He won't let you off easily.

293
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,130
You coming here to see me

294
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,150
might arouse his suspicion.

295
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,140
It doesn't matter.

296
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,430
As the envoy,

297
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,550
there's nothing wrong with caring about the princess.

298
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,000
If I deliberately avoid contact,

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,530
it will be more suspicious.

300
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,970
But it's night now.

301
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,970
Did something urgent happen?

302
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,390
Indeed.

303
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,820
I just received news that

304
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,590
the puppet king supported by Long Tuqi is seriously ill.

305
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,380
Now, Long Tuqi is the regent king.

306
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,110
He's only one step away from usurping the throne.

307
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,990
Actually,

308
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,870
this was to be expected.

309
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,320
That puppet king is from a distant branch of the royal family.

310
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,310
He has no talent, no virtue, and no heir.

311
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,120
It's natural for Long Tuqi to discard him like an old shoe.

312
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,850
I'm just worried he might harm the Princess next.

313
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,680
Dream on!

314
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,770
I'll report to Mr. Yu tomorrow.

315
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,580
We must strengthen the security at the Princess's Mansion.

316
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,970
I'll have Yuchi Hua come over

317
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,100
to keep you company.

318
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,130
Uncle Kang.

319
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,000
The Man in White is cunning and paranoid.

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,330
Please be very careful.

321
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,620
Don't worry, Princess.

322
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,020
I've already made Ma Zhiwen the scapegoat.

323
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,730
No wonder.

324
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,430
I was wondering why he hasn't been around these days.

325
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,690
So, Deputy Envoy Kang,

326
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,910
do you know the true identity of the Man in White?

327
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,950
The Man in White

328
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,480
never shows his true face.

329
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,820
Moreover, Long Tuqi trusts him completely,

330
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,110
bypassing me to entrust him with full authority on many matters.

331
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,610
So I can only respond to his moves as they come.

332
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,740
If I'm not mistaken,

333
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,560
Duomi's rescue was also your clever work, wasn't it?

334
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,370
And that day when San Niang and Si Niang

335
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,300
followed Ah Shu into the shoe shop,

336
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,120
that was also your arrangement, wasn't it?

337
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,050
That's correct.

338
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,950
I instructed San Niang to secretly protect Duomi

339
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,950
to prevent him from falling victim to the Man in White.

340
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,050
San Niang knocked out Duan underwater,

341
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,190
then dragged both of them ashore,

342
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,010
and switched their identities.

343
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,040
Previously,

344
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,490
the one who delivered intelligence to Duomi on that rainy night

345
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,550
was also San Niang.

346
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,270
You've done so much for me.

347
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,270
Deputy Envoy Kang,

348
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,230
I was unaware of your true identity before.

349
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,910
I apologize for any disrespect.

350
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,110
Please accept my bow.

351
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,750
No need for formalities.

352
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,480
Actually, to avoid suspicion,

353
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,840
I've caused quite a bit of trouble for Sifang Pavilion too.

354
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,760
Then, we're equal here.

355
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,910
Come, have some tea.

356
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,110
I didn't discuss it with you in advance

357
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,390
and revealed my identity

358
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,390
on my own.

359
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm sorry.

360
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,040
I went against your wishes.

361
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,910
That's not true, Princess.

362
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,240
Regarding this matter,

363
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,350
it was I who failed to consider things thoroughly.

364
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:54,990
Before,

365
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,230
I hoped you could be free forever,

366
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,470
so I actively cooperated with Ah Shilan

367
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,950
in the plan to impersonate the Princess.

368
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,790
But when I saw you

369
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,730
bravely step forward to take responsibility,

370
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,420
I felt deeply gratified.

371
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,510
My little Princess has grown up.

372
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,890
You know,

373
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,550
we haven't seen each other for ten years.

374
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,110
When I saw you outside the Yanle Embassy,

375
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,460
killing Long Ge with your bare hands,

376
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,590
I knew you must have your own difficulties and position.

377
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,540
You must have also hoped for me to live safely in Changle.

378
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,870
Because of your presence in Changle City,

379
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,370
I was no longer lonely.

380
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,640
Although we couldn't meet due to our identities,

381
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,970
I felt much more at ease.

382
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,910
Now, it's all good.

383
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,100
Yong State has officially recognized you as a princess.

384
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,070
From now on, you can

385
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,430
stay in Changle legitimately

386
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,710
and be under the protection of Yong State.

387
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,610
This is actually the best possible outcome.

388
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,430
That's right.

389
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,590
This is the best.

390
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,020
Ah Shu doesn't have to return to Yanle.

391
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,620
She can stay in Yong forever.

392
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,680
To be honest,

393
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,070
I've already bought a house.

394
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,280
What did you say?

395
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,240
You want the Princess to live in your private residence in the future?

396
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,089
It's not entirely my private residence.

397
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,230
It's ours.

398
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,150
Without Ah Shu,

399
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,750
buying this house

400
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,030
would have no meaning at all.

401
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,750
Yuan Mo,

402
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,160
besides buying a house,

403
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,040
what other plans do you have for the future?

404
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,030
I... I...

405
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,750
I can't say

406
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,460
that I've even found a school for the children, can I?

407
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,300
I... I have...

408
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,400
Well,

409
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,860
Uncle Kang, please have some tea first.

410
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,390
I'll explain to you slowly.

411
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,400
If the Man in White intends to harm the Princess,

412
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
how will you protect her?

413
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,560
Then I...

414
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,070
Do you have any ambition to improve yourself?

415
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,590
I... I... I...

416
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,360
When can you be officially appointed as Supervisory Sifang Envoy?

417
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,830
I should...

418
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,960
How do you plan to assist the Princess?

419
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,230
Perhaps...

420
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,670
And...

421
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,730
Uncle Kang,

422
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,480
I know you don't have many chances to meet,

423
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,290
but you don't have to ask so many questions at once.

424
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,280
You can rest assured about us.

425
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,790
Don't you know me well enough?

426
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,950
I never misjudge.

427
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,310
I've watched you grow up since you were little.

428
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,090
Of course I know you well.

429
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,390
But I don't know him.

430
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,950
Yuan Mo, listen to me.

431
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,900
Your father represented Yong State in his travels,

432
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,870
spreading kindness and earning respect.

433
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,400
But in my opinion, you're still far from that.

434
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,090
You need to keep working hard.

435
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,190
Yes.

436
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,700
I, Yuan Mo,

437
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,550
will remember

438
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,830
your wise words.

439
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
By the way, Princess,

440
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,340
are you satisfied with San Niang and Si Niang?

441
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,640
They...

442
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,620
They are my trusted confidants.

443
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,250
They are quick and careful in their work.

444
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,510
They're absolutely trustworthy.

445
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,600
If you need anything in the future,

446
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
you can ask them to relay the message to the Yanle Embassy.

447
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,960
Uncle Kang, you've arranged everything so thoughtfully.

448
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,160
I am deeply grateful.

449
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,430
It's just that they...

450
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,360
They're really too much, you know?

451
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,920
What did you say?

452
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,230
They're too serious.

453
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,740
Too responsible.

454
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,530
Really.

455
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,230
Not even a fly can get into

456
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,320
this huge Princess's Mansion.

457
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,050
Then how did you get in?

458
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,480
I...

459
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,540
Have some tea.

460
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,270
The tea is overflowing.

461
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,150
You're so clumsy,

462
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,950
you rascal.

463
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,210
My thoughts are all in the tea.

464
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,150
Princess,

465
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,630
those two can indeed be overly meticulous at times.

466
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,090
I'll remind them about it.

467
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,870
That'll be great, Deputy Envoy Kang.

468
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,030
You...

469
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,830
I'll be keeping an eye on you too.

470
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,890
Young man,

471
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,430
you better behave yourself from now on.

472
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,160
Take good care of the Princess.

473
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,240
Yes, sir.

474
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,790
Princess,

475
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,170
it's getting late.

476
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,590
People might get suspicious.

477
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,990
I shall take my leave now.

478
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,230
Leaving so soon?

479
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,110
Be careful on your way back.

480
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,710
What's wrong?

481
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,250
Am I really that bad?

482
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,980
Of course not.

483
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,390
You are the only one in the world

484
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,190
who I find interesting.

485
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,790
I'm very happy when I'm with you,

486
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,180
and very content too.

487
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,270
I'm that amazing?

488
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,150
Of course.

489
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,320
Alright.

490
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,150
Then I'll stay here tonight.

491
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,270
No, no.

492
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,630
It's only the second day. I can't let a man stay over.

493
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,470
What if we're discovered?

494
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,350
Didn't Deputy Envoy Kang say

495
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,680
he would instruct them?

496
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,530
No.

497
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,580
I still have to meet with envoys tomorrow.

498
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,450
Let me tell you.

499
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,510
When I climbed over the wall just now,

500
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,790
I pulled a muscle in my back.

501
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,790
It really hurts now.

502
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,830
I've been enduring it for a while.

503
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,630
I haven't said anything about it.

504
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,710
I can't take it anymore. I need to lie down.

505
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,170
Why didn't it hurt earlier?

506
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,700
I was holding it in earlier.

507
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,310
I can't bear it any longer.

508
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,870
Yuan Mo, this won't do. Get up.

509
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,950
It's fine.

510
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,870
I told you to get up.

511
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,430
Deputy Envoy Kang has already drunk my tea.

512
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,090
He won't do anything about it.

513
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,980
[Changle City]

514
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,390
Bathtub.

515
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,810
Put it on the left side as you enter.

516
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,470
Be careful on the steps.

517
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,310
Don't chip it.

518
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,590
Where should I put this?

519
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,830
Put the chair over there.

520
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,110
Okay.

521
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,140
Put it in that pavilion.

522
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,340
Take this inside too.

523
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,910
Hurry up.

524
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,670
Be careful, don't bump into anything.

525
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,490
Handle it gently.

526
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,490
Handle it gently.

527
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,470
Put the parasol here, right here.

528
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,760
Yes, saw this off.

529
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,330
Make sure to smooth out that side.

530
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:25,870
Will do.

531
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,720
What are you looking at?

532
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,550
I feel like something's still missing.

533
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,010
Still missing something?

534
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,910
We've got the rattan chair and the parasol,

535
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,770
and all these flowers and plants.

536
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,970
It's lacking here.

537
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,630
Here?

538
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,480
Oh, Poppet,

539
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,870
what do you think Ah Shu is doing now?

540
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,870
Is she also stargazing like us?

541
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,470
She's been so busy lately.

542
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
She's probably gone to bed already.

543
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,950
What brings you here?

544
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,120
I knew you'd be bored alone,

545
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,690
so I came to drink with you.

546
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,390
You're the one who's bored,

547
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,250
looking for company, aren't you?

548
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,950
You've done a nice job with this courtyard.

549
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,150
It's much better than the previous one.

550
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,790
Drink up.

551
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,370
Thanks.

552
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,630
Wang Kunwu,

553
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,910
you're poisoning me.

554
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,590
It's liquor from the frontier.

555
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,990
Three wen for a large jug.

556
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,270
This is too strong.

557
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,070
Just like you.

558
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,270
Sit.

559
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,710
I didn't expect Deputy Envoy Kang

560
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,800
did so many things secretly.

561
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,150
Yes.

562
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,360
He even insisted on letting Ah Shu stay in Yong

563
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,460
so that she won't be harmed by Long Tuqi.

564
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,480
Coincidentally, he helped our relationship.

565
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,640
Ah Shu is a princess now.

566
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,220
Then you...

567
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,230
Don't worry.

568
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,090
Ah Shu promised me

569
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,580
nothing will change.

570
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,670
We'll wait for things to settle down.

571
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,400
Once we get this place in order,

572
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,440
we'll move in.

573
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,470
Wang Kunwu.

574
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,300
I've figured out my future with Ah Shu.

575
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,510
What about you?

576
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,340
What are you going to do

577
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,260
about your future with Yuchi Hua?

578
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,070
Our future?

579
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,490
I'm afraid there's no future

580
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,220
with Wang Kunwu.

581
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,920
What's wrong?

582
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,710
Did Wang upset you?

583
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,620
He's straightforward.

584
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Try to be more understanding of him.

585
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,510
Ah Shu,

586
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,560
it's not about being understanding or not.

587
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,730
You know what?

588
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,500
When I was unconscious,

589
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,230
he whispered in my ear

590
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,930
that he loves me.

591
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,670
Really?

592
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,600
But no matter how I asked him afterwards,

593
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,490
he just wouldn't admit it.

594
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,700
Could it be that you misheard?

595
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,030
He's not like Yuan Mo,

596
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,160
who's so shameless.

597
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,820
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

598
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,110
I'm going to ignore him from now on.

599
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,310
Let's see how he deals with that.

600
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,570
No, no, Hua.

601
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,230
If you do this, Wang will take it seriously.

602
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,150
Is there some misunderstanding here?

603
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,280
Misunderstanding?

604
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,550
What misunderstanding could there be?

605
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,150
Ah Shu,

606
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,530
he said it himself.

607
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,670
I heard it with my own ears.

608
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,350
There was no third party involved.

609
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,350
How could there be a misunderstanding?

610
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,700
No third party?

611
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,670
Are you sure there's no third party?

612
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,050
I've heard that

613
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,070
Young Master Huo from Huo Workshop is quite nice to you.

614
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,930
Brother Zi'an?

615
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,470
Listen to yourself.

616
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,470
"Brother Zi'an?"

617
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,600
What are you thinking?

618
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,150
That's because

619
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,810
I really see him as my brother.

620
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,740
But I'm afraid Brother Zi'an doesn't think that way.

621
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,680
Wait, Ah Shu.

622
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,270
I noticed that you've become naughty recently.

623
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,630
Is it because you've been spending too much time with Yuan Mo?

624
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,830
You're a princess now.

625
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,510
You need to be more proper, you know?

626
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,790
You can't act like a child anymore.

627
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,350
I understand, Hua.

628
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,510
Now, you are both Princess Yanle

629
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,030
and the Princess Long Shuang of Yong.

630
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,550
Do you know what this means?

631
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,950
What else could it mean?

632
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,990
No matter which princess I am,

633
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,430
I'm still the same Ah Shu.

634
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,710
Ah Shu,

635
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,810
let me tell you something.

636
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,560
In a gambling house, the bigger the bet,

637
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,350
the more one hopes to gain.

638
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,390
In the future, it won't just be people like An Xiuyi

639
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,320
from Yong who talk about the bigger picture.

640
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,230
There will also be those

641
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,490
from Yanle who support or hate Long Tuqi,

642
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,740
and people from Mobei who want to profit from the situation.

643
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,350
In short, all kinds of people you can't even imagine

644
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,780
will try every possible way

645
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,620
to get what they want from you.

646
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,750
I know.

647
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,750
Those people all see me as a tool for their own gain.

648
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,870
Don't worry, Hua.

649
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,560
I won't let them control me.

650
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,790
Besides,

651
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,350
I still have all of you,

652
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,010
friends who truly care for me.

653
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,490
I'm content with that.

654
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,870
Ah Shu,

655
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,480
you call me your sister,

656
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,930
so let's be good sisters for life.

657
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,630
We'll get married together,

658
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,270
become mothers together,

659
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,230
and our children

660
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
will be as close as we are.

661
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,940
Oh, right.

662
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,780
Do you want a Yong-style wedding dress

663
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,830
or a Yanle-style one?

664
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,960
I'll make it for you.

665
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,270
Which one is more expensive?

666
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,030
Hey!

667
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,150
You've learned bad habits from Yuan Mo.

668
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,550
I'll like anything you make.

669
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:56,990
Alright,

670
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,240
then I'll make you one of each.

671
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,830
Great!

672
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,810
I'll pay for it.

673
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,950
You're rich.

674
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,030
I'm rich!

675
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,690
I'll go ask my father for more.

676
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,470
Thank you, Hua.

677
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,660
Don't drink too much.

678
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,610
I'm telling you, drowning your sorrows in alcohol is useless.

679
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,850
Listen to my advice.

680
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,590
Yuchi Hua is the best girl

681
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,520
you could ever cherish in this world.

682
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,610
Do you understand?

683
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,970
That An Xiuyi is no good.

684
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,590
And that Huo... Huo Zi'an...

685
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,060
He's someone to be wary of.

686
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,720
Be wary of him.

687
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,800
The flowers this year

688
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,900
are blooming beautifully.

689
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,510
When flowers bloom, one should pluck them promptly.

690
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,450
Don't wait until someone else takes her before you start regretting it.

691
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,170
Do you understand?

692
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:06,920
Alright.

693
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,950
I don't think you should go back tonight.

694
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,270
Just sleep here.

695
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,300
Come on.

696
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,110
Come, come.

697
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,290
It's more reassuring to have someone sleeping next to you.

698
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,530
Take it easy.

699
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,680
[Enjoy Yourself]

700
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,770
You're up so early.

701
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,990
I'm talking to you.

702
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,940
What are you thinking about?

703
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,550
Still feeling unwell, aren't you?

704
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,270
I'm telling you,

705
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,230
don't buy that kind of retail baijiu in the future.

706
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,550
A lot of it is fake.

707
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,310
Right now,

708
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,710
my head is killing me too.

709
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,710
You're actually right.

710
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,090
Good that you understand.

711
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,590
Life is unpredictable.

712
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,040
It's not that bad.

713
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,570
We're lucky we didn't go blind from drinking.

714
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,840
Let's go. Are we clocking in or not?

715
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,360
Thanks.

716
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,350
Thanks?

717
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,950
Thanks?

718
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,200
We really can't drink too much of this fake alcohol.

719
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,510
[Rising Wings]

720
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,210
Retainer Wang.

721
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,900
Our Lady is entertaining guests. You can't go in.

722
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,070
I have an urgent matter to discuss with your Lady.

723
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,770
Retainer Wang, you really can't go in.

724
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,390
Hua.

725
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,580
I've been thinking a lot these past few days.

726
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,230
There are some things I need to say to you in person.

727
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,090
Brother Zi'an,

728
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,480
I made my feelings clear the last time we met.

729
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,860
It's not something that can be changed by what you say.

730
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,190
It's not what you think.

731
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,840
I'm here to bid farewell.

732
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,590
Bid farewell?

733
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,850
Where are you going?

734
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,610
Mobei.

735
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,710
Why are you going

736
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,620
to such a distant place so suddenly?

737
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,970
The Suohe Mountains at the border of Mobei and Yanle

738
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,770
has ores used for forging armor.

739
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,710
Your wish is for all the soldiers of Yong

740
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,420
to wear impenetrable armor.

741
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,510
I'm willing to do my utmost

742
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,710
to fulfill this wish.

743
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,950
Being able to see you during this time,

744
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,430
take care of you,

745
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,160
and watch you get better, I'm content.

746
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,110
I've also come to fully understand your feelings.

747
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,310
I'm not in your heart.

748
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,610
I know you love Wang Kunwu.

749
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,870
I've repaired this soft armor.

750
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,200
I can only give it to you.

751
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,830
And Wang Kunwu

752
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,140
can protect the places that it can't.

753
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,390
So,

754
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,400
I wish you both the best.

755
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,170
Thank you, Brother Zi'an.

756
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,950
Retainer Wang.

757
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,610
You've come at the right time.

758
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,910
I've made an extra piece of this soft armor.

759
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,710
You're right.

760
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,370
With this soft armor,

761
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,060
people sometimes become reckless,

762
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,830
because they gain

763
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,060
the courage and boldness to take a step forward.

764
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,260
I hope this soft armor

765
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,420
will also give you some courage.

766
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,270
When are you leaving?

767
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,990
We'll set off in a moment.

768
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,910
I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

769
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,590
But now,

770
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,730
I don't need it anymore.

771
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,920
You should wear it.

772
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,910
The journey west is long.

773
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,540
Please be careful.

774
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,620
Brother Zi'an,

775
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,700
have a safe journey

776
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,810
and come back safely.

777
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,470
I will.

778
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,440
What are you doing here?

779
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,040
I have something to tell you.

780
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,560
Let's talk another day.

781
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm a bit tired today.

782
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,310
I love you.

783
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,050
I've loved you for a long time.

784
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,750
You didn't mishear that day.

785
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,780
The person who whispered those words in your ear

786
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,550
was me.

787
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,470
At first, I felt very guilty.

788
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,360
I failed Duke Er's instructions.

789
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,330
I didn't take good care of you.

790
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,990
I got hurt willingly.

791
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,040
You don't need to feel guilty.

792
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,330
Actually, I was afraid.

793
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,230
I was really afraid.

794
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,190
I couldn't lose

795
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,590
the most important person in my life again.

796
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,390
Yes.

797
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,500
I've realized that you, Yuchi Hua,

798
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,100
are now the most important person in my life.

799
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,469
Here, the princess is truly a kind person.

800
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,360
Come back when you've finished eating.

801
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,469
Now we don't have to worry about food anymore.

802
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,400
Here, take this.

803
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,219
Thank you, Princess.

804
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,500
Princess, it's heavy.

805
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:26,750
Here.

806
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,860
We're so grateful to the princess.

807
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,460
Thank you.

808
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,770
Thank you, thank you.

809
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,570
Wait a moment.

810
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:33,820
Take this.

811
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:34,350
This...

812
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,280
Quick, thank the Princess.

813
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,940
Thank you, Princess.

814
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:41,670
Here.

815
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,350
Thank you, Princess.

816
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,920
Let's go.

817
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,070
San Niang.

818
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,510
Please spare our lives, Your Honors.

819
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,520
We are all refugees.

820
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,650
We are all refugees.

821
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,270
Have mercy, Your Honor.

822
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,390
Why have you been following me all this way?

823
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:35,910
Speak.

824
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,020
Who sent you here?

825
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,630
Forgive us, Princess.

826
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,800
We mean no harm.

827
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,730
You're from Yanle?

828
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,290
Yes, Princess.

829
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,540
What's your name?

830
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:50,990
Princess,

831
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,130
I don't have a name.

832
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,980
My mother calls me Stone.

833
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,640
We are all lowly people from Yanle.

834
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,230
We fled to Yong to escape the hardships of forced labor.

835
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,110
We heard that the Princess has appeared,

836
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,430
so we came to beg for your blessing.

837
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,910
Please save us and our families.

838
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,150
Princess, please save us.

839
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,710
Please save us.

840
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,510
What happened to your families?

841
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,320
Princess,

842
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,720
please look.

843
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,850
If you're sick, you should go to a hospital.

844
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,180
Coming to me won't help.

845
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,110
Princess,

846
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,770
the poor people of Yanle

847
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,030
believe that the Yanle royal family are reincarnated immortals

848
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,630
who can save them from suffering and hardship.

849
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,040
I'm not an immortal.

850
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,630
I'm just an ordinary person too.

851
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,070
From your condition, it seems you've contracted smallpox.

852
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,190
You need to immediately soak your body in honeysuckle to kill the virus.

853
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,670
Also,

854
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,860
this disease is easily transmitted to the elderly and weak.

855
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,020
Are there others who are sick besides you?

856
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,880
Yes, there are.

857
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,290
But everyone else is very afraid.

858
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,740
They drive us away wherever we go.

859
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,290
So we can only live together

860
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,310
and look after each other.

861
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,110
That won't do.

862
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,880
If you pass the illness to each other,

863
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,430
not only will those infected not recover,

864
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,270
but those who aren't infected will also gradually fall ill too.

865
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,850
San Niang,

866
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,750
find a secluded courtyard immediately.

867
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,150
Yes.

868
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:07,880
Si Niang,

869
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,120
take some soldiers and follow Stone.

870
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,090
Bring all the infected refugees here.

871
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,060
Yes, Princess.

872
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,030
Thank you, Princess.

873
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,320
Thank you, Princess.

874
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,330
Please lead the way.

875
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,330
Please, this way.

876
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,860
Please.

877
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,670
Hold on!

878
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,560
Fellow villagers!

879
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,420
Hurry, keep up!

880
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:27,930
San Niang!

881
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
San Niang, quick!

882
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,760
This child is very sick.

883
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,020
This is a new group of refugees.

884
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,930
Please make arrangements for them.

885
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,530
Come here.

886
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,360
Come.

887
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,430
Si Niang.

888
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,590
Princess.

889
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,040
Are all the rooms inside full?

890
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,690
They're all full, Princess.

891
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,830
For those with milder symptoms,

892
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,750
we can only let them

893
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,150
stay in the sheds for now.

894
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,990
Princess,

895
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,560
why don't you return to the mansion first?

896
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,020
We can handle things here.

897
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,790
Princess, you have a royal body.

898
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,040
What if you were to catch this disease?

899
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,400
I'll be fine.

900
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,660
Go and get all the straw mats, blankets,

901
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,030
and quilts from the Yanle Embassy, and distribute them to everyone.

902
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,300
Then report to the Ministry of Rites

903
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,590
and ask them to send some doctors here.

904
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:05,920
Okay.

905
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,710
Did you get all that?

906
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,770
I got it, Princess.

907
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,600
Don't worry.

908
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,320
We're here.

909
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,430
Ji?

910
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,180
Why are you here?

911
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,670
Mr. Yuan learned that the refugees here have fallen ill.

912
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,790
He specifically asked me to bring a doctor

913
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,520
to treat everyone's illness.

914
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,920
Yubin.

915
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,110
Go boil some water.

916
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,310
Steep this medicine bag in it.

917
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,670
Okay.

918
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,240
Thank you all.

919
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,070
Here.

920
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,220
San Niang.

921
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,820
Honeysuckle.

922
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,820
That's right.

923
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,230
Princess, you should rest.

924
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,520
Let us handle these matters.

925
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,720
Let's do it together.

926
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,340
Quickly fetch water.

927
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:50,670
Okay.

928
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,500
[Half a month later]

929
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,940
Cheers!

930
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,670
Cheers!

931
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,170
You know,

932
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,670
as soon as the news of the epidemic's retreat spread,

933
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,590
all the merchants in Changle City rushed to celebrate.

934
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,990
They say this year's Lantern Festival will be a grand affair.

935
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,810
Lantern Festival?

936
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,270
She doesn't know.

937
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,270
Tell her about it.

938
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,660
It's like Valentine's Day in Yong.

939
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,910
Unmarried men and women

940
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,990
can take to the streets with their handmade lanterns.

941
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,720
If they meet someone they like,

942
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,180
they can give their lantern to that person.

943
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,670
So, we have to make the lanterns ourselves?

944
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,110
Of course.

945
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,950
Yuchi,

946
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,050
you grew up in Changle and don't know about this?

947
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,970
I didn't have the leisure for such things before.

948
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,520
But now...

949
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,360
Come on, let's drink!

950
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,480
Drink, drink, drink! Come on!

951
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,830
Let's not overdo it. Come on.

952
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,630
Let's drink!

953
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,690
Drink up, drink up!

954
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,150
Ever since these merchants

955
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,670
started their Lantern Festival sales events,

956
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,460
the Lantern Festival has lost its original meaning.

957
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,980
All these merchants, big and small,

958
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,440
rely on this day to make their year's profit.

959
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,940
Who cares if they make money or not?

960
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,690
We're just buying into the festive atmosphere, right?

961
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,950
Right, the festivity.

962
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,390
Let's join in the fun when the time comes.

963
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,090
We're short of many things at home anyway,

964
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,150
so we can buy them all at once.

965
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,190
Ah Shu now has her own mansion.

966
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,890
Does she still need to worry about these things?

967
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,270
Neither a gold nor a silver nest...

968
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,590
Is better than our own nest!

969
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,350
Come on, come on.

970
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,290
Isn't it funny?

971
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Ah Shu, over here.

972
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,590
What are you doing?

973
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,330
What are you doing?

974
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,110
I...

975
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,650
I'm going to the mansion.

976
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,650
That's our princess's mansion.

977
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,690
It's not yours.

978
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,520
We've talked about this before.

979
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,050
Where's your request card?

980
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,900
That's enough, Si Niang.

981
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,380
Yuan Mo and I don't need such formalities between us.

982
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,320
Princess,

983
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,460
you haven't even taken him as your royal consort yet.

984
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,740
Even if that day comes,

985
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,000
you'll still be more noble than him.

986
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,220
Etiquette must not be abandoned.

987
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,510
We just want to see each other often.

988
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,340
Exactly.

989
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,680
Hasn't anyone instructed you?

990
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,190
You should relax the requirements when needed.

991
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,830
Deputy Envoy Kang did seem to mention that.

992
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,150
But that's only allowed during the day.

993
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,210
It's absolutely forbidden at night.

994
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,750
-Back off!
-Let's go.

995
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,310
Back off.

996
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,550
Yuan... Yuan Mo.

997
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,810
Didn't you say nothing would change?

998
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,310
Everything has changed!

999
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,470
[Yuchi's Mansion]

1000
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,590
I'm sorry.

1001
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,470
-I'm sorry.
-It hurts so much.

1002
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:08,950
Seriously.

1003
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,870
Where did you get hit?

1004
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,350
My head.

1005
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,310
Where are we?

1006
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,400
We're home.

1007
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,840
Here, let me rub it for you.

1008
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,180
Rub my head? What are you thinking?

1009
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,390
Yeah.

1010
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,050
I mean to rub your head.

1011
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,760
It's all your fault.

1012
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,540
Father.

1013
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,550
Greetings, Duke Er.

1014
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,150
Why are you back so late?

1015
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,550
Go and get some rest.

1016
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,080
It's alright.

1017
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,710
I've truly underestimated you.

1018
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,750
I originally wanted to scold you a bit

1019
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,520
to make you know to back off.

1020
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,050
But I didn't expect you to be so persistent, young man.

1021
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,440
I have already reflected deeply on my mistakes

1022
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,250
and expressed my true feelings to Hua.

1023
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,310
From now on, nothing can separate us.

1024
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,430
Including me?

1025
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,490
Yes, including you, Duke Er.

1026
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,230
I can sense it.

1027
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,460
You two are very much in love.

1028
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,020
I...

1029
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,270
I'll give in to your wishes.

1030
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,640
But remember this,

1031
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,510
you must treat Hua well

1032
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,550
for a lifetime.

1033
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,350
Otherwise...

1034
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,090
There's something I don't understand.

1035
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:24,630
Go on.

1036
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,260
Why is My Lord going to such great lengths?

1037
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,630
Since we already know Ah Shu's identity,

1038
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,740
why don't we just kill her and be done with it?

1039
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,250
The people of Yanle value bloodline above all else.

1040
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,810
Princess Yanle has royal blood flowing through her veins.

1041
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,920
Long Tuqi wants it

1042
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:43,880
and so do I.

1043
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:46,760
You could say

1044
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,710
that whoever controls Princess Yanle

1045
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,500
will possess Yanle,

1046
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,740
and even control the entire desert.

1047
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,300
So,

1048
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,560
what's our next move?

1049
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,050
The Lantern Festival in Yong State is coming up soon, isn't it?

1050
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,000
Then let's give Changle City a grand gift.
