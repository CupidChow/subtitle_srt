Are you all right now?

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,430
Wait for me!

7
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,590
I need your help.

8
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,229
I can't help you.

9
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,110
Stay away from me.

10
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,310
Why are you so angry?

11
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,030
Who pissed you off?

12
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,590
You.

13
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,390
Me?

14
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,670
When did I piss you off?

15
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,830
You're so angry for no reason.

16
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,690
Remember to drink more hot water.

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,010

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,949
have you seen this whip?

21
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,360
Stay away from me a whip long from now on.

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,870
If you dare to get any closer,

23
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,430
I'll whip you.

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,070
Whip me?

25
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:17,860
Come on.

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,150
it seems today is the day.

We are leaving today!

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,390
What should we do in the future, Ji?

39
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,940
I have my family to take care of.

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,180
What should I do?

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,070
Sirs.

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,230
What's the matter?

43
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,590
Retainer Wang told us to register at the West Court today.

44
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,600
So it's you guys.

Alright, alright, stay here then.

so we're leaving.

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,470
We were just replacing your rug with a new one.

57

Isn't your desk still over there?

58
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,090
Well...

59
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,810
We don't have to go?

60
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,520
You said it yourselves

61
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,990
that the West Court is a family

62
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,590
and no one should be left out.

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,310
You two are the seniors in the West Court,

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,810
so make sure to guide the newcomers regularly.

65

66
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,480
you guys can sit over here.

67
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,870
We'll start the meeting shortly.

68
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,720
Qing, you should join us too.

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,050
Okay.

70
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,950
Okay.

71
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,350
We don't have to go!

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,000
Come on. Sit down.

73
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,590
This way.

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,270
Let's change our seats.

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,070
I'm sure you've all heard that

76
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,829
the Five States Conference is about to be reopened.

77
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,590
The person who achieves the first merit will be rewarded with 50 taels of silver

78
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,850
and promoted to the position of Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

79
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,350
What is Sifang Envoy?

80
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,760
Senior Yuan Hanjing

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,060
was the youngest Sifang Envoy in Yong.

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,790
Will there really be 50 taels of silver?

83
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,909
Money is the most practical thing.

84
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,570
As for the so-called Supervisory Sifang Envoy,

85
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm not interested.

86
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,760
Our West Court's task this time

87
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,110
is to facilitate Mobei and Yueying

88
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,570
in reopening the conference with us.

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,130
Yueying is small, with a sparse population,

90
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,860
and has a matriarchal society.

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,590
It borders Mobei

92
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,590
but has very different customs,

93
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,650
so they often look down on each other.

94
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,630
In the last conference, Mobei was rude to us.

95
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,670
I cannot tolerate that insult.

96
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,270
We will never ally with those barbaric Mobei people

97
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,110
again.

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,030
However,

99
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,680
we must be cautious of public sentiment.

100
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,790
Moreover,

101
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,400
we can use this opportunity

102
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,230
to ease our relationship with Mobei

103
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,680
and improve the situation for the Princess there.

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,220
The people of Mobei are fierce and nomadic,

105
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,640
moving with the water and grass.

106
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,860
They often clash with Yanle due to the desert encroaching on the grasslands.

107
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,090
The people harbor a deep resentment toward Yanle.

108
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,500
However, the Mobei Khan and the nobility have a complicated relationship

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,470
with Yanle, marked by both favor and grudge.

110
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,870
They are sometimes at war and sometimes at peace, making their relationship unpredictable.

111
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,800
What did you say?

112
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,590
Deputy Envoy Kang of Yanle wants to see me?

113
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,110
No.

114
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,540
Let's keep them waiting for now.

115
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,140
I believe Yong's people will be arriving soon.

116
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,230
Let's wait for the best offer.

117
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,870
You are wise.

118
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,840
Go back and thoroughly study these files,

119
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,590
including the royal family, annual population,

120
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,620
food supplies, and trade conditions.

121
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,880
We'll do it right away.

122
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,430
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

123
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,350
To win the war,

124
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,000
we must always keep a close watch on the enemy's every move.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,870
You mean Yanle?

126
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,790
I think we need to send someone to the Yanle Embassy

127
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,070
to keep an eye

128
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,350
on who they've been interacting with within the five states.

129
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,360
Leave this to me.

130
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,910
However, with so many states in the desert,

131
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,150
I still have trouble

132
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,820
distinguishing between them.

133
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,620
How about this? I'll go with you.

134
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,630
No need.

135
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Stay as far away from me as possible.

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,310
What do you mean?

137
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,860
How did I offend you?

138
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,470
Did you see that?

139
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,950
Don't force it.

140
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,330
What do you mean by "force?"

141
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
Wait, what did I force?

142
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,880
That's baffling.

143
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,130
I'm going to find my Ah Shu.

144
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,950
Watch your step.

146
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,750
Take care, sir.

147
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,350
Take care.

148
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,150
This set meal is quite special.

149
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,740
Shall we order one?

150
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,060
Bird's... side?

151
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,600
It's not "bird's side."

152
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,390
It's "In the sky, we wish to be two birds flying side by side."

153
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,050
This is a line from a love poem.

154
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,440
It's just two pigeons.

155
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,930
Are they trying to rob us?

156
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,370
This is a creative dish.

157
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,390
Who cares?

158
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,430
It's like putting lipstick on a pig.

159
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,050
Yuan Mo,

160
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,310
did you strike it rich or lose your mind?

161
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:37,750
Don't young ladies care about sense of ceremony the most?

162
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,790
This is

163
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,700
our first date after all.

164
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,590
First date?

165
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,670
We see each other many times every day.

166
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,100
What are you talking about?

167
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,909
Yuan Mo,

168
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,190
you've been acting weird since the naturalization ceremony.

169
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,510
So has Yuchi.

170
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,790
She was also off that day when she left.

171
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,370
Sir, Miss,

172
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,480
have you decided what to order?

173
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,170
Just two bowls of lamb soup with pepper flatbreads.

174
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,100
No way.

175
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,190
There's no lamb soup or pepper flatbreads.

176
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,310
Well, listen to me.

177
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,270
Bring me a pot of the finest Lingxi wine.

178
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,270
And your signature dish,

179
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,430
Bailong Stew, one serving.

180
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,310
Also, two lamb legs.

181
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,750
Oh,

182
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,760
and a serving of cherry cheese.

183
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,070
It must be sweet.

184
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,150
It's her favorite.

185
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,390
Okay.

186
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,110
You are trying to please a girl,

187
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,840
but you don't understand food.

188
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,690
You don't even know how to order.

189
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,710
Who are you?

190
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,049
Mind your own business.

191
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,570
Ah Shu, ignore him.

192
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,179
I'm just trying to give you a helpful tip.

193
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,130
[Duomi, Prince of Mobei]

194
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,910
Please come in.

195
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,370
Bailong Stew should be made with mandarin fish.

196
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,590
However, mandarin fish in this season is no longer fat,

197
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,590
so the dish's flavor

198
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,900
is naturally reduced.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,310
The roast lamb legs are acceptable,

200
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,150
but they pair best with grape wine

201
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,120
from Yueying.

202
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,140
Yet you ordered Lingxi wine.

203
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,420
And the cherry cheese is the worst—

204
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,030
it's made from stale cherries

205
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,350
soaked in honey water.

206
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,940
It tastes nothing but sweet.

207
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,910
Enough.

208
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,970
We can order whatever we like.

209
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,540
It's none of your business.

210
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,870
But he did have a point.

211
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,620
These cherries are a bit stale.

212
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,500
When it comes to the world's finest cuisines,

213
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,760
I, Duomi, am qualified to say a few words.

214
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,450
You must be either from Yueying or Mobei, right?

215
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,070
So?

216
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,670
Just because I'm from Mobei,

217
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm not qualified to critique food in Changle?

218
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,140
You can critique the food,

219
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,280
but not other people's choices.

220
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,740
How does that saying go?

221
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,630
One man's... another man's...

222
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,870
One man's meat is another man's poison.

223
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,400
Exactly.

224
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,350
Just like this cherry cheese—

225
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,830
everyone finds it too sweet,

226
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,990
but it was the first delicacy

227
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,790
I tasted in Changle City.

228
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,450
I order it every time I come.

229
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,510
After tasting garbage for a while,

230
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,830
I guess even that could start to seem sweet.

231
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,430
By the way,

232
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,010
that small diner on the corner may look unassuming,

233
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,560
but their cheese is a hundred times better.

234
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,750
What about this Lingxi wine?

235
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,070
You've never had the finest Lingxi wine,

236
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,270
yet you said it's not as good as grape wine.

237
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,270
Let me tell you,

238
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,930
there's no one in Changle City who knows more about wine than him.

239
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,640
I stand corrected.

240
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,460
I retract my comment about Lingxi wine.

241
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,890
May I know your name?

242
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,270
Would you like to join me one day

243
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,150
to appreciate good food

244
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,280
and have a good chat?

245
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,970
What are you doing?

246
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,740
My girl has nothing to talk about with you.

247
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,980
Your girl?

248
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,030
I'm not your maid anymore.

249
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,470
My name is Ah Shu.

250
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,160
Although I'm not with him,

251
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,350
I'm not that interested in food.

252
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,070
Thanks for the invitation,

253
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,030
but we're going to continue our meal.

254
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,790
I see.

255
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,990
See you.

256
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,990
Prince Duomi.

257
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,750
I apologize for not welcoming you properly.

258
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,490
[Duan, the Chief]

259
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,710
I'm Duan, the chef of Inebriation Restaurant.

260
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,470
Is today's food to your liking?

261
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,190
Inebriation Restaurant

262
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,230
is a top-tier long-established restaurant in Changle.

263
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,830
Yes.

264
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,510
Unfortunately, the old flavors haven't been preserved.

265
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,670
I won't recommend it this time.

266
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,790
Prince Duomi, I beg you.

267
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,990
If this continues,

268
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,270
the manager will certainly fire me.

269
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,510
If the taste is off, it's off.

270
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,380
My mouth never lies.

271
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,430
Prince Duomi!

272
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,550
Prince?

273
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,620
My mouth never lies.

274
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,840
Sir, Miss.

275
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,350
That Duo-something person just now

276
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,710
is so annoying.

277
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,080
He is Prince Duomi from Mobei.

278
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,390
He is the most famous

279
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,190
food critic in Changle City.

280
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,070
Now Duan is in trouble.

281
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,640
The manager will surely kick him out.

282
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,190
What did you say?

283
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,590
A critic for food?

284
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,230
Yes.

285
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
The young people in Changle City now

286
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,980
all like to choose their dining places

287
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,710
based on his recommendations.

288
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,270
But he wasn't wrong.

289
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,740
The quality of the dishes at your Inebriation Restaurant

290
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,150
has indeed been declining.

291
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,940
It's okay.

292
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:31,950
When you go back,

293
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,750
report this to your manager.

294
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,390
Got it?

295
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,910
What?

296
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
You actually admire him?

297
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,140
Yes.

298
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,190
Think about it.

299
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,780
Mobei is lacking in resources

300
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,110
and has few delicacies.

301
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,760
For the recommendations from a food critic from Mobei

302
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,540
to be so highly regarded by all the young people in Changle City,

303
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,340
don't you think that's impressive?

304
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,800
Anyone can talk nonsense.

305
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,600
But this Prince Duomi...

306
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,080
This name sounds familiar.

307
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,190
I remember now.

308
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,120
His mother is Princess Yueying,

309
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,980
who married the old Khan of Mobei.

310
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,660
After the old Khan died,

311
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,210
his half-brother

312
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,800
took her as his wife.

313
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,290
Really?

314
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,500
So how would he address his brother

315
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,790
and face his mother?

316
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,630
No wonder he escaped to Changle City

317
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,030
to become a food critic.

318
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,430
I feel sorry for him.

319
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,810
But stay away from him.

320
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,660
[Sifang Pavilion]

321
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,680
What are you looking at?

322
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,960
Information about Mobei.

323
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,010
It's rare to see you working so hard.

324
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,590
You came at the right time.

325
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,530
Help me look up a prince

326
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,220
named…

327
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,310
named Duomi.

328
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,270
Prince Duomi?

329
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,610
Why are you looking him up?

330
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,680
You have no idea.

331
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,050
Last night,

332
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,240
Ah Shu and I were dining at Inebriation Restaurant,

333
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,570
and we ran into this guy.

334
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,920
Just because of his good looks,

335
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,380
he dared...

336
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,950
he dared to say "until we meet again"

337
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,430
to my Ah Shu.

338
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,080
The most critical part was the way he looked at Ah Shu.

339
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,390
What kind of look?

340
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,110
The...

341
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,730
The kind of look

342
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,750
that would make even you want to see him again.

343
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,550
Yuan Mo,

344
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,950
tell me the truth.

345
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,210
Who do you really like?

346
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,710
What do you mean?

347
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,570
Retainer Wang,

348
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,070
the carriage to the Mobei Embassy is ready.

349
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,710
You,

350
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,660
come with me.

351
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,350
Go by yourself.

352
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,010
I need to look up information.

353
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,590
Let's go to the Mobei Embassy,

354
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,350
and you can ask me if you have any questions.

355
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,910
Wait.

356
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,790
Let me turn around.

357
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,140
Come on.

358
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,370
[Yuluo Embassy]

359
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,230
Our Yuluo and Yanle have deep-seated enmity.

360
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,280
Now the Dragon Cavalry is stirring,

361
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,230
and Yanle covets domination of the oasis.

362
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,670
This matter concerns the very survival of Yuluo.

363
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,480
After forming an alliance,

364
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,920
if Yanle takes any action against Yuluo,

365
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,420
our Yong will certainly not stand idly by.

366
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,350
In that case,

367
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
our Yuluo will have no fear of Yanle.

368
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,570
However, the desert is vast,

369
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,300
so all states must unite to resist Yanle.

370
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,920
During the alliance,

371
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,030
can Yuluo temporarily set aside

372
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,650
its border disputes with Dongyuan and Xiyuan?

373
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,110
It was Dongyuan and Xiyuan

374
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,630
that repeatedly detained Yuluo's fishing boats,

375
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,230
acting unreasonably first.

376
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,890
[Mobei Embassy]

377
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,190
Yong wishes to form an alliance with Mobei,

378
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,930
but Yanle is also seeking the same alliance.

379
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,780
Our Khan

380
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,380
is truly troubled.

381
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,710
Yanle seeks to dominate the desert.

382
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,750
But Yong wants to treat all desert states

383
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,230
with mutual respect and equality,

384
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,300
ensuring the smooth flow of trade routes

385
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,270
so that the people can live and work in peace and prosperity.

386
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,530
It's just empty words.

387
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,710
You want the hawks to soar in the sky,

388
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,110
watching over the sheepfold for your Yong.

389
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,710
But how many sheep will our Mobei get in return?

390
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,320
The disputes between Yuluo and Dongyuan and Xiyuan

391
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,110
occur in these three locations.

392
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,230
I've investigated.

393
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,810
Here,

394
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,750
the residents on both sides are relatives by blood for generations.

395
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,990
They cross the border, ignoring the laws,

396
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,870
only to visit their family,

397
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,770
not to provoke intentionally.

398
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,710
If Yuluo could reach an agreement with the Xiyuan Envoy

399
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,990
to build a customs post and a bridge here,

400
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,860
the issue of illegal crossings could be resolved.

401
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,970
Now, look here.

402
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,680
The water conditions are complicated.

403
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,190
I don't think all of Yuluo's fishing boats

404
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,390
that crossed the border did it intentionally.

405
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,510
I can explain it to the Dongyuan Envoy on your behalf

406
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,110
so that past grievances can be settled.

407
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,440
And here.

408
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,910
Merchants from Yuluo and Xiyuan

409
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,230
both prefer shortcuts.

410
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,390
They bypass the designated trading posts,

411
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,070
landing here for trade,

412
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,910
which leads to a mutual misunderstanding,

413
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,670
with each state thinking the other is smuggling.

414
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,550
In that case,

415
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,670
why not relocate the trading post here,

416
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,990
making it more convenient for both states?

417
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,670
The climate in Mobei has become increasingly harsh in recent years.

418
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,470
If Mobei allies with our Yong,

419
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,020
we will offer you a 15 percent discount

420
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,700
on the salt and iron you need the most each year.

421
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,609
Make it 25 percent.

422
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,790
What do you think?

423
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,730
This is already the bottom line for Yong.

424
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,190
But what you're offering,

425
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,170
Yanle can provide as well—

426
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,610
perhaps even more.

427
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,620
Retainer An, you are truly meticulous.

428
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,650
You've even thought of solutions for us.

429
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,980
Lord Li, Madam Li,

430
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,400
while Yuluo, Dongyuan, and Xiyuan are locked in a struggle,

431
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,670
Yanle will seize the opportunity to profit.

432
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,550
Why not let Yong act as the mediator,

433
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,590
so the three parties can sit down and talk things out,

434
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,150
and put past grievances to rest?

435
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,150
What do you think?

436
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,590
Good.

437
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,320
I heard that back then, the old Khan

438
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,370
passed away coughing up blood

439
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,420
because Yanle pressured him relentlessly.

440
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,480
Now that you're planning to cooperate with your enemy,

441
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,290
aren't you afraid your family will despise you?

442
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,030
Why are you laughing?

443
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,590
I'm hungry.

444
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm going to eat something.

445
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,300
What?

446
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,710
Lord Ao.

447
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,630
Think about it. A 15 percent discount.

448
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,700
[Endless Clouds]

449
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,550
I forgot to ask about Duomi.

450
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,930
That old fox is truly cunning.

451
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,510
Let me ask you,

452
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,070
when Yu told us to draw lots,

453
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,470
did he let you pick first?

454
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,140
How did you know?

455
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,650
You were tricked.

456
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,850
Among the five states, Yuluo holds a deep grudge against Yanle,

457
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,750
so it's the easiest to persuade.

458
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,250
Mobei, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.

459
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,430
They always side with whoever benefits them the most.

460
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,830
They're known for being tough to deal with.

461
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,290
I've never been afraid of any war.

462
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,210
You may not lose the war,

463
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,490
but the chance for the first merit is probably out of reach.

464
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,350
Lord Ao has a nickname—

465
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,310
the Greedy Wolf of Mobei.

466
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,390
There's a good chance that once we leave,

467
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,110
he'll run straight to the Yanle Embassy.

468
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,570
He's comparing offers between us and Yanle?

469
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,250
So that he can secure the best deal for Mobei.

470
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,970
Yuan Mo said

471
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,920
[The back door of the Yanle Embassy]

472
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,420
that among the five states in the desert,

473
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,680
if any one is colluding with Yanle in secret,

474
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,460
they'll definitely take the back door.

475
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,240
We've been watching for a long time.

476
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
They're coming. A carriage.

477
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,620
Get down! Get down!

478
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,120
Lord Ao?

479
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,790
Yuan Mo was actually right.

480
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,340
Hua,

481
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,200
what should we do

482
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,460
when Lord Ao comes out?

483
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,810
Didn't Yuan Mo give you any other instructions?

484
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,160
He just told us to keep watch

485
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,510
and not to act rashly.

486
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,820
Won't that be too easy for this guy?

487
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,910
Leave it to me.

488
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,230
Hua,

489
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,360
where are you going?

490
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,810
The name card was sent to you days ago.

491
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,840
Lord Ao, you have finally graced

492
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,150
our Yanle Embassy with your presence today.

493
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,430
It's truly an honor.

494
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,800
You flatter me.

495
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,870
I've been tied up with affairs at the embassy,

496
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,190
which caused a delay.

497
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,610
It seems you haven't left the embassy recently.

498
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,220
I know our Yanle has been a bit too eager lately.

499
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,950
Lord Ao, you've been deliberately keeping me waiting.

500
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,150
Not at all.

501
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,710
It's a misunderstanding.

502
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,880
It's a misunderstanding.

503
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,030
So, Lord Ao, why don't you just be straightforward?

504
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,760
What will it take for Mobei to abandon its alliance with Yong State?

505
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,430
Our Khan is well aware of Viceroy Long's plans

506
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,710
for that oasis.

507
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,910
If Yanle is willing to share that oasis,

508
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,950
that treasure of a land, with us,

509
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,870
Mobei will not ally with Yong State.

510
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,240
Sharing the oasis with you?

511
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,070
Lord Ao, you can barely hold on to your position,

512
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,710
yet you still dare to make such outrageous demands?

513
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,230
Deputy Envoy Kang, don't make baseless claims.

514
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,550
Please, speak clearly.

515
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,810
I heard that recently,

516
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,750
your Khan's beloved concubine gave birth to a son,

517
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,480
and you, Lord Ao, have become the Prince's uncle.

518
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,750
So what?

519
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,330
Don't forget,

520
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,950
there is more than one prince in Mobei.

521
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,050
There's still Duomi,

522
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,250
alive and well, living in Changle City.

523
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,560
The succession of the throne in Mobei follows a set order.

524
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,050
Duomi ranks ahead of the little prince.

525
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,670
If one day Duomi ascends to the throne,

526
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,070
will there still be a future for the little prince's lineage?

527
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,510
Will you still be able to sit here comfortably

528
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,990
as the Mobei Envoy?

529
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,510
But Lord Ao,

530
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,910
I have an idea.

531
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,920
Lord Ao,

532
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,850
as long as Mobei promises not to ally with Yong State,

533
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,550
Yanle will present you with a generous gift

534
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,800
when the time comes.

535
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,980
Don't think about the oasis.

536
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,320
A generous gift.

537
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,470
It's him!

538
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,050
Go!

539
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,230
It's him! It's him!

540
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,720
Lapdog! Traitor!

541
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,310
Lapdog!

542
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,310
Lapdog! Traitor!

543
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,590
Traitor! Lapdog!

544
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,240
Traitor!

545
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,070
Shut up!

546
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,230
What are you doing here?

547
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,710
I'm warning you.

548
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,750
I, the Mobei Envoy...

549
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,400
We're looking for the Mobei Envoy!

550
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,070
We petitioned at the Mobei Embassy for three days,

551
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,190
but you ignored us.

552
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,950
And today, you came to the Yanle Embassy?

553
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,220
Yanle has driven our Khan to his death.

554
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,670
It's Mobei's enemy.

555
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,430
You are colluding with the enemy!

556
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,760
Stop talking nonsense!

557
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,660
Stop talking nonsense!

558
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,780
If you don't clarify things today, don't even think about leaving!

559
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Don't think about leaving!

560
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,310
Don't think about leaving!

561
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,310
Let go!

562
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,740
How dare you, a group of unruly people, offend an envoy!

563
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,030
You know you are an envoy?

564
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,430
You're colluding with Yanle!

565
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,070
If we don't teach him a lesson today,

566
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,110
there's no justice!

567
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,000
There's no justice!

568
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,830
Let go!

569
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,690
Let go!

570
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,190
You can't leave until you clarify things!

571
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,830
They are crazy!

572
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,890
They're all crazy!

573
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,670
Go!

574
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,920
Let's go!

575
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,070
The people of Mobei won't let you go!

576
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,960
Yuchi,

577
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,230
good job.

578
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,840
I can only say that Yanle really is hated in the desert.

579
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,510
It was Long Tuqi.

580
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,950
He was the one who turned Yanle into everyone's enemy.

581
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,550
I almost forgot

582
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,070
that you also escaped from Yanle.

583
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,260
You actually brought people to block Lord Ao?

584
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,090
He was just negotiating with Yong,

585
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,820
and one second later, he was colluding with Yanle.

586
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,190
I can't just accept it.

587
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,880
I...

588
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,080
This Lord Ao,

589
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
his face is thicker than a city wall.

590
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,360
He might even make a big deal out of this.

591
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,870
Bad news!

592
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,560
The Mobei Envoy, Lord Ao, he...

593
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
What happened to him?

594
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,320
It's said that he was attacked by Yanle spies.

595
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,430
These Yanle spies disguised themselves as Mobei refugees

596
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,250
and brutally beat Lord Ao.

597
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,750
-Beat?
-But Lord Ao

598
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,950
remained unyielding,

599
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,070
insisting on cooperating with our Yong.

600
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,310
He has issued a stern statement to Yong,

601
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,590
demanding that we severely punish the Yanle spy

602
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,180
and provide Mobei with appropriate compensation

603
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,550
in future negotiations.

604
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,230
Bah!

605
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,910
Shameless!

606
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,670
The refugees just pulled him.

607
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,070
They didn't beat him.

608
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,790
This is the blood-stained clothing sent by Lord Ao.

609
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,590
Look at the blood.

610
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,590
Those Yanle people were too brutal.

611
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,670
Let me see.

612
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,240
Look.

613
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,300
Come.

614
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,030
Look.

615
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,760
It's just chicken blood and duck blood.

616
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,060
Ji,

617
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,670
did Lord Ao use the excuse

618
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,300
of needing to recover at home

619
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,790
to delay the alliance negotiations?

620
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,180
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

621
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,830
He's shutting the door and rejecting guests.

622
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,590
Did the people from Yanle agree to his condition,

623
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,400
so he wants to wait and see?

624
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,850
No, if this goes on,

625
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,510
the alliance will change.

626
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
What should we do?

627
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,920
There might be someone who can help.

628
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,390
But...

629
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,510
But what?

630
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,900
He's really annoying.

631
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
Is he more annoying than you?

632
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
How am I annoying?

633
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,840
I was just suspecting it before,

634
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,120
but now I'm sure.

635
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,100
You're targeting me.

636
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,050
Did I offend you or something?

637
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,030
Don't you know?

638
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,470
I...

639
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,630
Okay, okay.

640
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,540
Cut the crap.

641
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,310
Come on, let's go.

642
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,420
Let's go find him now.

643
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,070
Let's go.

644
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,220
She's so fierce.

645
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,850
Why is she doing that?

[Mobei Embassy]

647
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,750
My lord,

648
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,790
a famous physician from Sifang Pavilion

649
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,890
is here to treat you.

650
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,670
Send him away.

651
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,150
Yes.

652
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,910
Has Duomi been acting strange lately?

653
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,180
As usual,

654
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,470
he's going around enjoying himself.

655
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,000
Prince Duomi has no position or power.

656
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,270
I don't think he would threaten

657
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,280
the newly-born prince in any way.

658
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,250
Besides, he has been living in Changle City for years.

659
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,010
Everyone thinks it's a waste of time

660
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,790
to keep an eye on him.

661
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,940
Duomi's mother,

662
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,100
that bitch from Yueying,

663
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,030
is still the legitimate Khatun.

664
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,480
As long as they are alive,

665
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,400
the small prince won't be safe.

666
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,410
My lord,

667
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,070
do you think we should contact Yanle's people

668
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,530
and ask them to kill Duomi?

669
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,290
That depends on the attitude of Yong.

670
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,280
Did they agree to our price?

671
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,020
Not yet.

672
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,180

We will fight against Yanle with Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

676
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,860
Great.

677

In that case,

00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,760

- Wait.
- Wait.

No.

The East Court has it so good.

686

Why did our West Court get the misfortune

687
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
of dealing with the stubborn Mobei?

00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,900
Not at all.

745
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,630
Just dip it in leek flower sauce after it's cooked.

746
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,290
It'll be very delicious.

747
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,890
All right.

748
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,230
Try it.

749
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,480
I'll get you another piece.

750
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,190
No need.

751
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,050
I can do it myself.

752
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,850
You don't have to be so formal.

753
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,160
I just want to be friends with you.

754
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,320
All right, try it.

755
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,640
No, thanks.

756
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,260
She said

757
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,680
no need.

758
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,950
I'm sorry.

759
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,710
I only booked two seats today.

760
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,220
Prince Duomi.

761
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,660
We waited a long time for you at the Literature Hall.

762
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,250
So you came here instead.

763
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,510
You're even eating with our Ah Shu.

764
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,040
What's the meaning of this?

765
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,390
Ms. Ah Shu is not married yet.

766
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,590
What? You can treat her,

767
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,390
but I can't?

768
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,230
Stop eating.

769
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,880
What's so good about this?

770
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,280
I'll cook for you at home.

771
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,980
Wait.

772
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,230
Is this the guy who can force the Mobei Envy's hand?

773
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,910
Really? A foodie?

774
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,350
Unfortunately,

775
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,980
it's him.

776
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,610
Let's go.

777
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,790
Don't forget your business.

778
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,790
Sit down and talk.

779
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,470
Lend me a chair.

780
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,550
Have you heard of

781
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,550
our alliance with the Five States of the Great Desert?

782
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,950
Nothing can beat

783
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,340
the delicacies of the world.

784
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,350
I don't want to know anything else.

785
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,790
Your brother treats you as a threat.

786
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,520
He can't tolerate you anymore.

787
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,350
Yes.

788
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,750
You can use traveling as an excuse

789
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,680
to flee to Yong for refuge,

790
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,150
but have you ever thought about

791
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,350
your mother, who is far away in Mobei?

792
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,790
Are you just going to abandon her like this?

793
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,350
My mother is the Khatun of Mobei,

794
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,470
and she is protected by the Khan.

795
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,450
Don't scare me.

796
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,160
Besides,

797
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,570
what does the alliance of the various states of the Great Desert

798
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,520
have to do with us?

799
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,420
Have you heard

800
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,810
you have recently become an uncle?

801
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,390
Recently, the beloved concubine of Mobei's Khan

802
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,050
gave birth to a little prince.

803
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,430
Khan loves him very much.

804
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,830
Then you and your mother

805
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,310
will become a thorn in the Khan's eyes.

806
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,790
Since I came to Yong,

807
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,510
I have let go of my obsession.

808
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,740
I don't care who becomes

809
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,390
the next khan.

810
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,910
If Yong allies with Mobei,

811
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,790
you can lead a comfortable life here.

812
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,470
Khan will also treat your mother well

813
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,220
for the sake of Yong.

814
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,590
But if Mobei allies with Yanle,

815
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,230
it means that Mobei insists on becoming enemies with Yong

816
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,800
and other desert states.

817
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,300
By then,

818
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,139
your presence in Yong will be considered as being exiled.

819
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,449
If you're exiled,

820
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,270
imagine what will happen to your mother.

821
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,500
Back then, it was Yanle that forced

822
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,690
the late Khan to pass away with regret.

823
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,320
If you can't avenge your father

824
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,219
or protect your mother,

825
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,570
what right do you have to live?

826
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,469
Can you still eat?

827
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,620
You may have misunderstood.

828
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,989
I have no power or position,

829
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,070
I'm like a wanderer,

830
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,150
traveling in Yong.

831
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,659
I can’t help you.

832
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,139
Goodbye.

833
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,320
The place where the mother makes milk wine

834
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,120
is the home of a wanderer.

835
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,490
How do you know Mobei's herdsmen proverb?

836
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,550
Duomi.

837
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,750
Your mother is still alive.

838
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,970
How can you be a wanderer?

839
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,870
Your Highness, you're the nephew of the lord of Yueying

840
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,870
and the son of the late Khan of Mobei.

841
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,800
You're the royal bloodline of Mobei and Yueying.

842
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,070
With such status,

843
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,270
you need not belittle yourself.

844
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,670
Lord Ao.

845
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,630
Something happened.

846
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,390
Lord Ao?

847
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,430
Lord Ao.

848
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,380
Lord Ao!

849
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,790
What are you doing?

850
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,910
Can you let me sleep?

851
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,940
Prince Duomi is the one saying no to that.

852
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,670
Why don't you take a look?

853
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:26,030
Nice!

854
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,380
Okay!

855
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,190
Come on! Come on!

856
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,950
Come on!

857
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,510
Nice! Come on!

858
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,660
Come on!

859
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:41,860
Come on.

860
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,690
Prince Duomi.

861
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,760
What are you doing?

862
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,280
When Mobei allies with Yong,

863
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,340
we will disperse.

864
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,030
No.

865
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,030
How can you threaten state affairs?

866
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,790
How can you delay state affairs?

867
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,590
By the way,

868
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,960
someone saw Lord Ao

869
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,720
sneak out from the back door of the Yanle Embassy.

870
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,790
Were you negotiating with Yanle?

871
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,000
Nonsense!

872
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,710
It's all rumors!

873
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,650
That's great.

874
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,540
Since Lord Ao didn't surrender to the enemy,

875
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,260
we won't urge you.

876
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,880
We will wait here

877
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,750
for you to reestablish the alliance with Yong.

878
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,690
You...

879
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,290
My lord.

880
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,030
Let's continue.

881
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,910
Bravo! Bravo!

882
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,390
Bravo! Bravo!

883
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,210
Keep it up.

884
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,300
Let's see how long they can continue.

885
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,430
Close the gate.

886
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,310
Ignore the matters outside.

887
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

888
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,850
Bravo! Bravo!

889
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,800
Come on!

890
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,250
[Mobei Embassy]

891
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,860
Bravo! Bravo!

892
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,390
Bravo! Bravo!

893
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,960
My lord.

894
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,210
Judging from the situation,

895
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,120
they won't be leaving for a while.

896
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,970
You're right.

897
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,280
They're dancing so happily.

898
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,110
Isn't that too much?

899
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,670
Right?

900
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,830
Lord Ao.

901
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,490
Close it.

902
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,160
Lord Ao.

903
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,150
What's wrong with you two?

904
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,630
This is bad.

905
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,230
Speak.

906
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,780
Hurry, see it for yourself.

907
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,090
Are they partying outside the back door too?

908
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,910
No way.

909
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,910
I don't think so.

910
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,450
What's that smell?

911
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,000
My lord, this smell...

912
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,990
It smells like...

913
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,990
Like what?

914
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,390
Close it!

915
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,920
Close it!

916
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,580
What's going on?

917
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,190
The whole street's chamber pots

918
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,690
are outside blocking our door.

919
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,110
Get someone to clean it up!

920
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,750
That's right!

921
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,150
My lord, you have no idea.

922
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,670
Most chamber pot cleaners in Changle City

923
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,910
are refugees.

924
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,870
But now they...

925
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,930
They are all at the front door,

926
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,080
joining the strike with Prince Duomi.

927
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,260
Duomi, how dare you?

928
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,990
Duomi!

929
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,630
They're neither fighting nor wreaking havoc,

930
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,800
so we can't ask the Jingzhao Prefecture to arrest them.

931
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,680
But now,

932
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,250
other embassies are also affected

933
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,040
and urging us to solve it.

934
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,110
My lord,

935
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,470
The Yueying Envoy sent a letter saying that

936
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,320
Duomi is the son of Princess Yueying.

937
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,260
Therefore, Yueying is also on Duomi's side

938
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,470
and supports Mobei's alliance with Yong as soon as possible.

939
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,200
Yueying...

940
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,710
Those opportunists...

941
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,890
Tell... Tell Kang Yunhai

942
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,750
I want

943
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,470
his gift.

944
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,790
The Mobei Embassy is open!

945
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,250
The Mobei Embassy is open!

946
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,030
Retainer Wang.

947
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,430
Lord Ao has agreed to

948
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,710
Prince Duomi's request.

949
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,750
Tomorrow, he's bringing the Yueying Envoy

950
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,940
to the Sifang Pavilion tomorrow to discuss the alliance.

951
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,540
Duomi took extreme measures

952
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,130
and actually succeeded.

953
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:05,930
Exactly.

954
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,510
You should get ready.

955
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,590
Although Lord Ao agreed to return to negotiation,

956
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,490
he must be full of resentment.

957
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,560
He must be looking for a fight.

958
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,040
Don't worry. I'm here.

959
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,710
I didn't expect things to get better.

960
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,050
Even without the credit this time,

961
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,870
can we still make some money?

962
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,920
More or less.

963
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,380
What do you want to do with the money?

964
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,630
I just want to get a gold necklace

965
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,600
for my wife.

966
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,350
Also,

967
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,110
I want to hire a teacher for my son.

968
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,440
I don't know how many of them left in anger.

969
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,710
I'll get back to work.

970
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,000
What gift should I get?

971
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,190
Boots from the West Market,

972
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,910
bridle from the South Market.

973
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,050
And in the North Market...

974
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,820
[Yuchi's Mansion]

975
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,280
Yuchi Hua.

976
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,420
You again?

977
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:03,990
What are you doing?

978
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,470
Stop!

979
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,550
Stop!

980
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,270
I said stop!

981
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,700
If you don't stop, I'll whip you!

982
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,000
Yes.

983
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,990
Whip me.

984
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,200
Are you crazy?

985
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,270
I don't know what offended you,

986
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,760
but I know you have a grudge against me.

987
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,550
Whatever grudge you have,

988
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,990
just lash out at me.

989
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,640
Whip me.

990
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,780
Is something wrong with your brain?

991
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,670
It doesn't matter if there's something wrong with my brain,

992
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,130
what matters is that you can vent your anger.

993
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,730
Whip me.

994
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,350
Screw you!

995
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,510
Get lost as far as you can.

996
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,230
Close the door.

997
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,030
Yuchi Hua!

998
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,670
I gave you a chance!

999
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,150
You're the one who didn't cherish it!

1000
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,370
Don't blame me anymore

1001
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,770
and stop targetting me!

1002
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,620
I won't leave unless you give me an answer today!

1003
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,550
My Lady, you're back.

1004
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,510
What's wrong?

1005
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,310
It's...

1006
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,950
Forget it.

1007
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,880
I won't say it.

1008
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,470
Tell me.

1009
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,910
I will help you.

1010
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,720
The trouble is at the door.

1011
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,530
You can ask him.

1012
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,510
What are you doing?

1013
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,410
[Zhen'an Hall]

1014
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,100
Duke Er?

1015
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,710
Greetings, Duke Er.

1016
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,810
Come on.

1017
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,110
What?

1018
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,210
Don't you want to marry my daughter?

1019
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,390
Pick up the metal whip on the ground

1020
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,310
and have a few rounds with me!

1021
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,870
What?

1022
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,070
How could I...

1023
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,670
Pick it up!

1024
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,070
I won't take it.

1025
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,670
No, I can't. I...

1026
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,920
You won't do it? I will!

1027
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,350
No, no, no!

1028
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,310
I’ll leave.

1029
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,510
Brother, no, Duke Er.

1030
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,850
I'll leave. I'll leave.

1031
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,350
Kunwu.

1032
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,510
Come and help me.

1033
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,040
What happened to you?

1034
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,200
I've spent all my energy

1035
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,070
to make my way here.

1036
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,510
Come, sit down.

1037
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,110
Come.

1038
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,740
I can't. If I sit, it'll crack open.

1039
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,920
Then lie down on your stomach.

1040
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,880
Come on, let me help you.

1041
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,700
Slowly.

1042
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,270
What happened to you?

1043
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:35,950
Susu.

1044
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,590
Ah Shu.

1045
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,110
Remember.

1046
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:38,670
Okay.

1047
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,550
Here for Yuan Mo?

1048
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,830
I recently developed a new rouge formula

1049
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,230
and made some money.

1050
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,160
I bought him some delicious food to improve his life.

1051
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,430
But why are you so nice to him?

1052
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,750
What's wrong?

1053
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,980
Don't you know Yuan Mo and Yuchi Hua...

1054
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,550
I spoke out of turn.

1055
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,950
But you're right.

1056
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,820
Yuan Mo is a scumbag.

1057
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,750
I was just kidding.

1058
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,320
Actually, Yuan Mo is not bad at all.

1059
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,950
What happened between Yuan Mo and Yuchi?

1060
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,960
Don't you know

1061
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,640
Yuan Mo is pursuing Yuchi Hua?

1062
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,760
What did you say?

1063
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,750
Yuan Mo is pursuing Yuchi?

1064
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,180
This matter has become a big deal.

1065
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,110
Everyone in Sifang Pavilion knows it.
