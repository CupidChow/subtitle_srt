00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,640
If I apply with Ministry of Rites,

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,750
I'll need to submit a letter.

5
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,270
That'll take half a month.

6
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,460
Then I can only meet Ah Shu

7
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,020
once every half a month.

8
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,460
Are you kidding me?

9
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,730
That's right.

10
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,590
You...

11

We'll...

14
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,470
throw him out.

15
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,070
That's too rough...

16
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,310
Wait! Wait!

17
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,030
Let him come in.

Your Highness!

19
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,030
He's an outsider who sneaked in at night.

20
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,650
He even wants to be under the same roof with you.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,120
If word gets out,

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,870
it'll tarnish your reputation.

23
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,110
That's too harsh.

24
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,150
But I'd been living with him

25
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,570
for quite some time now.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,550
That's different.

27
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,560
You weren't ennobled then,

I'm tired of hearing that.

31
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,590
Yes.

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,010
So we can't be under the same roof, right?

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,620

I think the Lantern Festival's soon.

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,210
What nice gift are you planning to give me?

39
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,920
You've got some nerve.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,890
You're a princess now.

41
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,630
If I were to marry you,

42

wouldn't I be the prince consort of Yanle?

Prince Duomi of Mobei.

46
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,290
How could I forget him?

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,930
In that case,

48
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,480
I can only accept the engagement back home

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,079

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,120
Prince Duomi and our princess

51
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,810

However, previously,

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,430
everyone thought the princess had long passed away,

56
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,310
so people gradually stopped mentioning it.

57
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,870
Exactly.

I reckon Mobei's proposal squad

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,220
is likely on their way here.

How could you keep such an outrageous thing from me?

77

That's Prince Duomi we're talking about.

He knows I'm barely literate,

110
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,380
yet he writes in Mobei's squiggly script.

111
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,480
It's obvious he had someone else write it.

112

So many every month.

113
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,909

I'll have to criticize you for this.

Duke Er does like playing with whips,

181

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,789
Stingy.

194
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,950
By Ministry of Rites' order,

195
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,730
the Sifang Envoy selection will be held on the tenth of next month.

196
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,110
It's not just you two.

197
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,230
Ministry of Rites

198
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,690
has recommended many outstanding talents.

199
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,340
So you must work hard

200
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,940
to keep the title of Sifang Envoy

201
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,540
in Sifang Pavilion.

202
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,490
-Yes.
-Yes.

203
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,620
You may go.

204
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,320
What is it now?

205
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,040
Yu.

206
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,090
Is there any reward for becoming a Sifang Envoy?

207
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,710
What kind of reward do you want?

208
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,750
Money!

209
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,960
Is there no raise

210
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,310
or bonus?

211
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,250
Did you buy expensive wine again?

212
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,830
Why are you so tight on money?

213
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,510
No.

214
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,390
Isn't the Lantern Festival soon?

215
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,620
I want to give someone a gift.

216
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,310
Like ginseng.

217
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,520
Ginseng?

218
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,090
Fifty-year-old ginseng.

219
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,050
It's nourishing for sure.

220
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,820
How much would that cost?

221
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,250
Don't bother.

222
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,620
Although I'm getting old,

223
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,590
my health is still pretty good.

224
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,950
You rascal.

225
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,710
I appreciate the thought.

226
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,760
It's not for you.

227
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,870
Get out.

228
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,960
What about a raise?

229
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,900
Get out!

230
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,720
G-Get...

231
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,710
-Wait.
-Get out!

232
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,110
Or you can lend me some.

233
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,950
Lend you?

234
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,190
Who are you buying it for then?

235
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,270
Ungrateful brat.

236
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,590
Why is it still so hot?

237
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,630
What's wrong, Young Master?

238
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,350
What did Mr. Yu want from you?

239
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,990
Ministry of Rites is about to select the Sifang Envoy soon.

240
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,050
That's great news!

241
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,790
I've already investigated.

242
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,750
Only a dozen or so Supervisory Sifang Envoys from various departments

243
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,670
are applying.

244
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,830
None of them can match your experience and qualifications.

245
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,380
I believe you'd secure the position.

246
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,190
It's been my lifelong aspiration after all.

247
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,850
I won't easily lose to anyone.

248
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,430
Oh, right.

249
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,550
Tomorrow's the Lantern Festival.

250
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,520
I've already drafted the night duty list.

251
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,750
But those not on the list will also need to patrol the streets.

252
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,750
It's mainly to prevent conflicts in foreign affairs.

253
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,640
Everyone has been working hard lately.

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,540
Let's allow everyone to relax and enjoy the Lantern Festival.

255
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,560
What's wrong?

256
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,840
Nothing.

257
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,020
I just feel like you've changed.

258
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,590
What gift would you like for the Lantern Festival?

259
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,650
I'll buy it for you.

260
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,430
A princess is different, huh?

261
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,640
You even speak with more confidence.

262
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Of course.

263
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,670
Actually, this one is quite nice.

264
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,510
The color is vibrant.

265
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,690
I'd look spirited in it.

266
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,770
What kind of fabric is this?

267
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,430
Come here.

268
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
Ah Shu.

269
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,170
I didn't even dare touch this one.

270
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,380
You're the best to me.

271
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,170
This fox fur collar...

272
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,160
This texture...

273
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,790
Luxurious yet bold.

274
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,900
Bold yet elegant.

275
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,480
It's just...

276
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,310
A bit warm.

277
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,670
But it's fine.

278
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,360
I handle the heat well.

279
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,660
And I like this warm feeling.

280
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,340
Uncle Kang always coughs when winter comes.

281
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,350
With this coat,

282
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,120
he'd have an easier time.

283
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,610
D-Deputy Envoy Kang?

284
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,650
Well, yeah... this...

285
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,470
Deputy Envoy Kang will recover if he wears this.

286
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,300
What's wrong?

287
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,230
Jealous?

288
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,860
Of course not.

289
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,420
I just think if it's for Deputy Envoy Kang,

290
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,640
these aren't enough.

291
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,590
Shopkeeper.

292
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,080
Yes.

293
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,480
Bring out your best brocade robes.

294
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,230
Alright.

295
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,170
I ordered a ginseng for Kang.

296
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,610
By then, he'd be wearing the brocade robe from you

297
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,600
and drinking the ginseng from me.

298
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,630
Kang, Kang.

299
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,360
You sound so close to him.

300
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,380
Kang isn't even that fond of you.

301
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,430
Well, father-in-laws are always

302
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,890
finding fault with son-in-laws.

303
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,630
I don't take these things to heart.

304
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,290
What father-in-law and son-in-law?

305
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,820
What are you going on about?

306
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,360
Here they are.

307
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,030
Here, here.

308
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,810
Sir, Madam.

309
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,890
How about this one?

310
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
Nice.

311
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,660
This one's nice.

312
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,830
Let's go with this.

313
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,100
The key is it matches with his son-in-law.

314
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,620
Look.

315
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,990
Add this pair of boots.

316
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,520
Si Niang.

317
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,410
Your Highness.

318
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,190
Quickly take these to Uncle Kang.

319
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,390
Yes, Your Highness.

320
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,620
The princess prepared these just for you

321
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,730
to prepare for the cold weather.

322
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,590
How is it?

323
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,390
Now that you've put it on,

324
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,680
you instantly look ten years younger.

325
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,150
Don't tease me now.

326
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,140
The princess chose this brocade robe

327
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,750
after much deliberation.

328
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,270
And these leather boots.

329
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,700
Aren't you delighted to wear them?

330
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,170
Naturally, you'd feel ten years younger.

331
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,080
Si Niang, you're so glib.

332
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,250
What is this?

333
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,990
This one? That Yuan Mo picked it out for you.

334
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,740
How thoughtful.

335
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,890
He's obviously currying favor with you.

336
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,590
Actually,

337
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,650
he's just interested in the princess.

338
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,050
How could I not know that?

339
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,460
You don't seem to like Yuan Mo very much.

340
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,590
What good does it do if I dislike him?

341
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,590
The princess is so smitten with him.

342
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,300
I know you're perceptive.

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
I'll try on the boots.

344
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,690
Okay.

345
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,420
Come on.

346
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,590
Stand up and walk around.

347
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,870
It's as if they were custom-made.

348
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,230
How did Ah Shu know

349
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,030
my size?

350
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,950
Let him in.

351
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,120
Deputy Envoy Kang.

352
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,320
What have you found?

353
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,480
The Faceless have been secretly collecting belladonna.

354
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,350
Belladonna?

355
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,690
It's a poisonous flower unique to Yanle.

356
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,100
How did it appear in Yong?

357
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,680
From what I know,

358
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,440
batches of belladonna seeds were transported

359
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,470
into Changle by different Yanle merchants six months ago.

360
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,510
Six months ago?

361
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,910
If they were planted then,

362
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,470
they'd be in full bloom now.

363
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,820
Keep investigating.

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,070
Report at once about unusual activity from The Faceless.

365
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,470
Yes.

366
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,010
Go now.

367
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,450
Many of Yanle's old ministers who support the late king

368
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,150
have written a joint blood letter

369
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,350
to urge the princess to raise their flag

370
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,990
to avenge the late king.

371
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,720
Long Tuqi must've got wind of it

372
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,820
and ordered the Man in White to plot something.

373
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,080
We must be on our guard.

374
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:24,960
Si Niang.

375
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,790
I have something to entrust to you.

376
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,480
Remember this.

377
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,150
Lins' Depository is where Changle's nobles and officials

378
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,630
store their valuables.

379
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,600

The princess...

757
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:54,960
Speak up!

758
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,160
She said she was going to the Yanle refugees' resettlement site.

759
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,220
She drugged me when I tried to stop her.

760
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,390
But don't worry.

761
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,070
Chief Secretary Yuchi and my sister

762
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,220
are watching over her.

763
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,950
Listen.

764
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,710
Go tell Magistrate Lin at Jingzhao Prefecture

765
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,030
the Man in White will use poison bombs

766
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,470
to cause panic in Changle.

767
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,270
Poison bombs?

768
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,570
Okay.

769
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:10,970
Wait.

770
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,750
Also,

771
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,130
notify Sifang Pavilion

772
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,840
to be prepared in case of emergency

773
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,190
since many foreigners are at the festival.

774
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,740
Got it?

775
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,370
Yes.

776
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,930
This way!

777
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,670
Bad news!

778
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,250
Retainer An!

779
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,430
Why are you so flustered?

780
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,160
Retainer An.

781
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,770
Man in White will detonate

782
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,760
self-made poison bombs in Changle to cause panic.

783
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,470
What?

784
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,360
Where's this intel from?

785
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,850
Someone reported it to the princess's mansion.

786
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,470
I've notified Jingzhao Prefecture.

787
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,840
The streets are filled with people.

788
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,900
If those poison bombs go off,

789
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,030
it'd be disastrous.

790
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,620
Ji.

791
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,950
Notify all Sifang Pavilion staff now

792
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,970
to cancel their leave and evacuate the people at the market.

793
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,470
Yes.

794
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,950
Young Master.

795
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,750
I want to go too.

796
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,170
No.

797
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,530
Sifang Pavilion can't be unguarded.

798
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,250
Stay here.

799
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:15,750
Young Master.

800
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,790
It's an order!

801
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,270
Are you really not going to Ah Shu?

802
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,780
Yes.

803
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,470
She's already Yanle's Ah Shu.

804
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,290
What's the point of looking for her?

805
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:05,870
Fine.

806
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,420
Let's head back.

807
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,080
The dock is behind us.

808
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,710
We might really miss the pleasure boat night cruise.

809
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,430
What's the rush?

810
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,030
Let's walk around a bit more.

811
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,330
Look how bright that lantern is.

812
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,040
If you keep dawdling,

813
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,260
we'll really end up at where Ah Shu is.

814
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,930
Really?

815
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,790
I'm not trying to get to her.

816
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,550
I just thought that bright lantern looked nice.

817
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,860
Come on.

818
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,810
What?

819
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:31,990
Excuse me.

820
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,750
These pleasure boat night cruise's tickets

821
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,710
are for you. Enjoy.

822
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,870
Thank you so much!

823
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,350
Wait.

824
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,070
Do you know how expensive those tickets are?

825
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,000
You weren't planning to go anyway.

826
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,790
Don't hesitate anymore.

827
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,300
Alright, let's go find Ah Shu.

828
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,760
Come on.

829
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,860
Fine, Wang Kunwu.

830
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
You're the one forcing me to go.

831
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,030
I didn't want to go, but you're forcing me to.

832
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,670
Fine.

833
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,840
Let's say I forced you.

834
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,970
Yuan Mo! Wang Kunwu!

835
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,880
Retainer An.

836
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,030
Listen.

837
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,480
Man in White will detonate poison bombs nearby tonight.

838
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,210
-Poison bombs?
-Poison bombs?

839
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,890
Have you seen any suspicious people?

840
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,880
Making a delivery?

841
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,830
Yes.

842
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,530
My employer asked me to deliver wine to a restaurant.

843
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,530
Let's go, driver.

844
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,650
I'm off, Yuan.

845
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,530
Stone.

846
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,080
Stone's carriage was off.

847
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,340
I'll go to him.

848
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,280
Don't go.

849
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,020
Leave the carriage to us.

850
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,100
Go get Ah Shu to a safe place.

851
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,950
Man in White must have a backup plan.

852
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,470
Alright, be careful.

853
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,180
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

854
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:56,960
Over there!

855
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,830
Excuse me!

856
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,550
S-Sorry.

857
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,350
Excuse me.

858
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,880
Stop!

859
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,750
Stop!

860
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,680
Stone, get off!

862
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,380
Where's the escort?

863
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,650
He got off midway.

864
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,480
What's wrong?

865
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,940
What are you really transporting?

866
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,190
It's just wine my employer asked me to deliver.

867
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,320
You two, step aside.

868
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,770
What...

869
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,050
What's...

870
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,300
It's gunpowder.

871
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,890
Poison bombs made from belladonna.

872
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,560
Are you sure?

873
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,320
Belladonna's a poisonous flower unique to Yanle.

874
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm certain about this scent.

875
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,350
Poison bombs?

876
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,170
Retainer Wang.

877
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,270
I really had no idea!

878
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,510
I'm just a wine deliveryman.

879
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,370
I deliver whatever my employer tells me to.

880
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,080
Princess Longshuang saved my life.

881
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,810
I'd never commit a capital crime.

882
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,420
Where were half of the poison bombs

883
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,100
unloaded?

884
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,530
The escort did unload some cargo midway.

885
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,410
I know where.

886
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,060
I'll take you there.

887
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,460
Wait.

888
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,350
Half of the poison bombs

889
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,690
must be among the crowds.

890
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,420
Retainer An.

891
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,120
You must drive this carriage to Jingzhao.

892
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,100
Have Magistrate Lin notify the Jingzhao troops.

893
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,050
Anyone seen on the streets with wine jars

894
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,800
must be detained.

895
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,530
Understood.

896
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,140
You.

897
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,890
Come with me.

Si Niang.

899
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,230
Rush back to Princess's Mansion.

900
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,310
Release green smoke signals once you see her.

901
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:21,920
Yes.

902
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,980
I trust you.

903
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,270
But you must help us turn this around.

904
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,190
Take me to find that escort.

905
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,690
This way.

906
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,330
Follow me.

907
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,680
Here.

[Jingzhao Prefecture]

909
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,310
Tonight's streets are filled with people from various states and backgrounds.

910
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,700
If there really is an explosion spreading toxic fumes,

911
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,460
it'll affect people of all states.

912
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,210
Can we end the festival

913
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,420
and evacuate them?

914
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,230
Yes, yes.

915
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,350
Human lives are at stake.

916
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,660
We should evacuate quickly.

917
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,890
Evacuation is also dangerous.

918
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,860
If it sparks mass panic,

919
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,350
what if people get trampled to death?

920
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,550
What if other related disasters occur?

921
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,810
For now, we can only reduce panic

922
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,080
and play it by ear.

923
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,370

Yong would be humiliated.

946
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,320
Other states would also lose trust in Yong.

947
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,220
The consequences would be unimaginable.

948
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,150
Magistrate Lin, I hope you'll send people there.

949
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,060
No need.

950
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
I'll go myself.

951
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,620
Magistrate Lin.

952
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,190
Why are you here?

953
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,440
We intercepted the poison bombs in the carriage outside.

954
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,110
Poison powder's hidden in wine jars.

955
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,110
Please scour the streets for anyone with wine jars

956
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,550
and detain them immediately.

957
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,720
How many poison bombs are there?

958
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,300
We've intercepted half a carriage.

959
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,390
But there are still over 20 jars left.

960
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,490
Still so many?

961
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,110
If these spread into Changle's market,

962
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,820
we clearly lack manpower.

963
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,730
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

964
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,730
Vice Minister An.

965
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,170
I've to prioritize the people in the city.

966
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,880
All Jingzhao troops are to be mobilized.

967
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,930
Scour the streets one by one.

968
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,540
If you see anyone with wine jars, forget about questioning.

969
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,660
Arrest them immediately.

970
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,350
-Yes!
-Yes!
