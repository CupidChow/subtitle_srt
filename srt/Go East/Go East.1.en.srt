Is there a misunderstanding?

191
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,310
I found someone suspicious.

192
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,510
There was a little...

193
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,230
Where is he?

194
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,570
-No...
-Quit spouting nonsense.

195
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,300
He was there just now.
Let’s go.

196
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,070
No.

197
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,720
You're so strong,

198
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
you must be a heroic person.

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,550
Do you like drinking?

200
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,050
I have an impressive private collection.

201
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,070
Why don't we have a drink

202
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,890
and make friends?

203
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,350
Shut up.

204
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,230
The foreign merchant called Kudel

205
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,070
has been frequenting Changle City for the last three months.

206
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,470
He changes his residence

207
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,160
in the city every half a month.

208
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,450
The goods on the declaration form

209
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,110
are only fresh fruits that yield small profits.

210
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,190
It's so unusual.

211
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,390
There must be a big secret deal behind it.

212
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,670
Retainer An.

213
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,400
A letter for you.

214
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,710
No wonder no one was allowed to leave the city today.

215
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,310
What's wrong, Young Master?

216
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,520
The Ministry of Rites sent a letter.

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,590
Hundreds of crossbows are missing from the armory.

218
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,750
Something bad may be happening in Changle City.

219
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,550
We can't wait.

220
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,070
Come here.

221
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,620
Inform all members of the East Court

222
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,030
to check

223
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,630
the origins and goods of the foreign merchants.

224
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,190
Go.

225
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,310
Yes.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,530
Let's go.

227
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,120
We must find Kudel today.

228
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,750
Yes.

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,870
It hurts. Let go of me.

230
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,400
It hurts!

231
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,390
Pretty face! Ji! Save me!

232
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,440
It hurts!

233
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,910
Yu!

234
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,640
Help!

235
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,420
Help!

236
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,150
Help...

237
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,590
Retainer Wang.

238
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,960
I...

239
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,510
This is not the military after all.

240
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,190
Let's not resort to violence, okay?

241
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,910
Let go of him.

242
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,460
Why is the official seal of the West Court

243
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,790
in the hands of this scammer?

244
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,650
I think this guy

245
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,230
should be interrogated by the Jingzhao Prefecture.

246
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,550
Don't. Be gentle.

247
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,410
You'll break his arm at this rate.

248
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,150
Are you okay?

249
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,510
Let me introduce you two.

250
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,740
This is Yuan Mo.

251
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,870
He's the special consultant of our Sifang Pavilion.

252
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,600
As for this official seal...

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,780
I gave it to him.

254
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,020
The Sifang Pavilion is closed today.

255
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,130
But we still have to issue licenses.

256
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,650
So we sent Yuan Mo to the city gate

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,930
for the convenience of the people.

258
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,930
But he took payment without permission.

259
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,060
That's ridiculous.

260
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,710
How much did you receive?

261
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,250
All confiscated!

262
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,410
Yu.

263
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,670
What about your share?

264
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,550
Nonsense!

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,830
How about this?

266
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,630
Treat Retainer Wang to a drink at the Ruyi Pavilion

267
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,670
and clear up the misunderstanding.

268
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,120
Mr. Yu.

269
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,790
Stop calling me.

270
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,880
Working hours are over.

271
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,480
I have no obligation to stay here.

272
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,800
And you were a soldier.

273
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,090
What's your duty as a soldier?

274
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,790
It's to obey your superior.

275
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,350
I am your superior now.

276
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,290
I order you!

277
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,210
You must drink this wine.

278
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,830
Other business can wait till tomorrow.

279
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,620
We agreed to meet at 5.45 p.m today.

280
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,880
You're late.

281
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,210
I lost my travel pass

[Kudeller, Yanle businessman]

283
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,230
and took the water route.

284
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,890
My master has a note for you

285
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,250
to receive in person.

286
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,520
The goods must be shipped out of the city as soon as possible.

287
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,280
I need to check the goods first.

288
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,760
It's so delicate.

289
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,160
The latest model of crossbows.

290
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,670
They can be hidden in the sleeve

291
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,800
and triggered for consecutive shots.

292
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,520
I wonder

293
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,690
how powerful it is.

294
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,150
Well...

295
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,910
Be alert and hide the goods well.

296
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,230
Get them out of the city as soon as possible.

297
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,790
Brother.

298
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,510
Changle City only allows entry today.

299
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,460
I’m afraid it won't be an easy task.

300
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,480
I have my own way.

I miss you so much.

All right.

Let me introduce him.

310
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,600
This is our newcomer, Retainer Wang.

311
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,560
There's no new or old.

312
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,410
Men become all the same here.

313
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,320
Enough, stop clinging.

Are you really here for dinner?

318
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:53,770
Fine.

319

Go up by yourself. Same place.

320
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,750
You...

321
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,580
How can there be a consultant like you in Sifang Pavilion?

322

You don't understand.

The Sifang Pavilion is in charge of everything.

324
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,870

What a pity.

345

Nice! That's great.

378
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,829
Becoming friends is a separate matter.

379
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,829
Don’t let such fine

380
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,160
Lingxi wine go to waste.

381
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,470
Don't drag me.

382
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,510
Young Master.

383
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,120
Come with me.

384
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,150
Wait, wait, wait.

385
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,470
What are you waiting for?

386
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,600
Is it really okay if I don't have a travel pass?

387
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,000
If you're elsewhere without a travel pass,

388
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,470
not only can't you stay,

389
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,650
but you'll also be investigated

390
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,270
and get kicked out of Changle City.

391
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,040
But in Ruyi Pavilion,

392
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,550
you just need to drink and have fun.

393
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,900
As long as you have money,

394
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,760
we won't ask about anything else.

395
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,270
So much food!

396
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,510
Can I eat all of these?

397
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,270
Of course, you need food to go with blossom wine.

398
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,200
Young master, don't just eat.

399
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,210
Have a drink.

400
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,630
What kind of flower wine is this?

401
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,350
Flower?

402
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,110
It's not made from flowers?

403
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,990
Then why is it called blossom wine?

404
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,750
Young master, you're so funny.

405
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,490
What are you doing?

406
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,500
Since you're here to drink blossom wine,

407
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,550
why are you so reserved?

408
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,740
What does this have to do with drinking blossom wine?

409
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,370
Is this your first time here?

410
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,020
Drinking blossom wine means

411
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,780
listening to music, admiring dance,

412
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,290
and having fun.

413
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,430
Have fun?

414
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,950
How?

415
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,750
However you wish.

416
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,140
Young master, you look so decorated.

417
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,670
You must have earned a lot of money.

418
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,790
Your wallet came from Mobei.

419
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,750
The scarf came from Yueying.

420
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,680
The skirt

421
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,040
is made from Dongyuan State's rosy cloth.

422
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,650
I've never seen such a mix before.

423
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,590
Really?

424
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,790
Really.

425
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,450
Take off your clothes.

426
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,660
Isn't that a little too fast?

427
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,100
Why don't we drink more first?

428
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,980
You said I can do whatever I want.

429
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,610
Strip.

430
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,930
Young master, what are you doing?

431
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,850
Young master...

432
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,790
Young master!

433
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,820
I'm going to the toilet.

434
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,550
You guys drink.

435
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,590
Yuan.

436
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,710
We heard you love wine.

437
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,350
My master specially prepared two jars of

438
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,590
good wine from Yanle for you.

439
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,720
Please accept them.

440
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,890
You're too polite.

441
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,550
You're good pals.

442
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,580
The sealing mud smells familiar.

443
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,410
What's wrong?

444
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,610
Nothing.

445
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,420
This is obviously fine wine from Yanle.

446
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,150
I can smell the wine even without opening the jar.

447
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,760
Thanks.

448
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,520
That place seems to be in the west of the city.

449
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,350
Stop!

450
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,790
Miss Ku.

451
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,120
You've changed back into women's clothes.

452
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,200
I didn't expect

453
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
you to be working for Ruyi Pavilion.

454
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,760
But you look much better in women's clothes.

455
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,490
Give it to me.

456
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,220
What?

457
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,710
Playing dumb, are you?

458
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,030
Okay.

459
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,470
What are you doing?

460
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,150
Isn't this a robbery?

461
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
Who's robbing you?

462
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,430
I want my travel pass.

463
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,310
Calm down.

464
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
The travel pass, yes.

465
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,230
I remember now.

466
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,160
The travel pass.

467
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,310
Unfortunately, I didn't bring it with me.

468
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,730
You...

469
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,840
Don't worry. Come with me to get it.

470
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,950
What are you waiting for?

471
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,520
Let's go.

472
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,190
This wine...

473
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,710
This is good wine.

474
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,790
Take them.

475
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,270
Let me think. Over there.

476
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,190
It's not far. It's over there.

477
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,870
Come with me.

478
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,710
No.

479
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,810
This way.

480
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,490
No.

481
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,520
Where was it?

482
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,690
This way.
Here.

483
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,270
You're no good.

484
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,630
Drink, drink.

485
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,550
I'll drink.

486
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,390
Look, I'll show you.

487
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,830
Watch me.

488
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,150
Watch me.

489
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
See that? See that accuracy?

490
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,220
You're from the army?

491
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,870
You're not good.

492
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,990
I'm no good?

493
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,110
Watch me.

494
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,790
Try again.

495
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,100
I'm no good?

496
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,310
I'm no good?

497
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,820
I...

498
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,830
You shot it out of the door!

499
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,830
Don't hurt the...

500
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,450
Retainer.

501
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,240
Are you okay?

502
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,610
Retainer?

503
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,150
The new retainer of Sifang Pavilion?

504
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,230
About the goods I mentioned...

505
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,790
Look.

506
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,550
We are pals now.

507
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,000
Do you have to do this?

508
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,740
You’re a good pal.

509
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,380
Since we are pals,

510
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,040
I can't let my pals go without benefits.

511
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,870
If you don't accept it,

512
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,200
you're not treating me as your pal.

513
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,870
Fine, I'll take the money.

514
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,350
Taking bribery right after you take office?

515
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,830
I'll catch you red-handed.

516
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,790
Let's drink.

517
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,280
Drink.

518
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,190
Wang?

519
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,990
Wang?

520
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,270
Retainer.

521
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,170
Retainer Wang?

522
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,670
Retainer?

523
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,510
Surrender the money!

524
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,000
How dare a mere retainer like you

525
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,310
accept bribes?

526
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,470
Shameless!

527
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,840
I don't care who you are.

528
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,640
I have no time to argue with you.

529
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,860
Take the money!

530
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,030
Don't delay my important task.

531
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,790
Advisor Yuchi.

532
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,510
Shall we go after him?

533
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,210
He doesn't want the money,

534
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,850
and he has an important task to do?

535
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,950
Wang Kunwu?

536
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,540
Yes.

537
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,850
The new retainer of Sifang Pavilion.

538
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,140
Off you go.

539
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,250
Okay, thank you.

540
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,360
Let's go.

541
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,910
Faster!

542
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,630
Stop.

543
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,330
Sifang Pavilion's routine inspection.

544
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,680
Gentlemen,

545
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,070
we are just humble businessmen.

546
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,400
Besides,

547
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,030
we have special signed papers from Sifang Pavilion.

548
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,710
Take a look if you don't believe me.

549
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,440
Cut the crap.

550
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,630
We'll let you go if everything's fine.

551
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,490
Be careful!

552
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:22,800
Kudel.

553
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,490
Why are you fighting so early in the morning?

554
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,350
Kill him!

555
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,640
Who are you?

556
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,790
That's my horse!

557
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,210
[Mountain God Temple]

558
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,160
Slow down.

559
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,830
Why did you bring me here?

560
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,900
I haven't slept all night.

561
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,470
Miss Ku,

562
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,950
are you really called Kudel?

563
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,910
My wine!

564
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,890
Give it to me.

565
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,210
Where's my travel pass?

566
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,870
If you don't surrender it today,

567
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,530
I'll let you taste the power of my tickle powder.

568
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,690
Tickle powder?

569
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,380
If that's not enough for you,

570
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,910
I have something stronger.

571
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,830
This is colorless, scentless, and tasteless.

572
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,630
Just a nail-size portion of it...

573
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,630
Isn't this black?

574
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,990
Whatever!

575
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,310
It can make you bleed from your 7 orifices

576
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,270
and die mystery.

577
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,910
You mean die miserably.

578
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,070
What nonsense are you learning at such a young age?

579
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,670
Follow me.

580
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,790
What tricks are you playing?
Stop talking.

581
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,630
What?

582
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,630
Did you see him?

583
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,720
What about him?

584
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,830
Something's wrong with him.

585
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,030
Indeed.

586
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,220
Seems like he's running away from someone.

587
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,640
What makes you think so?

588
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,910
He was in a hurry and his steps were unsteady.

589
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,170
He looked nervous too.

590
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,330
Good eyesight.

591
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,630
Wasn't that how you realized it too?

592
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,040
No, I know him.

593
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,690
He's a big bad guy.

594
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,760
Unfortunately, I'm weak and can't fight.

595
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,620
It seems I have to report to the government.

596
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,630
No!

597
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,840
Do you want to catch him?

598
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,830
I'll help if you give me the travel pass.

599
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,500
Okay.

600
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,240
Did he really die miserably?

601
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,620
It's just knockout powder.

602
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,070
He's only unconscious.

603
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,340
You're so cruel.

604
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,530
My travel pass.

605
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,040
Miss Ku,

606
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,270
this travel pass will only bring you trouble.

607
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,430
How dare you fool me?

608
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,990
Fine.

609
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,520
[Travel Pass]

610
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,260
What if he wakes up later?

611
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,830
I...

612
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,790
Retainer Wang! Here!

613
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,670
Yuan Mo?

614
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,040
The person you want is here.

615
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,320
He burnt most of the things.

616
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,880
Why didn't you stop him?

617
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,500
Why didn't you come earlier?

618
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,710
The two of us

619
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,720
already did our best.

620
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,140
Why are you here?

621
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,750
My maid and I came here to burn incense and pray.

622
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,680
Can't we do that?

623
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,840
See?

624
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,790
I just bought her. She doesn't know manners yet.

625
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,020
You came to this shabby temple to burn incense?

626
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,150
What a coincidence.

627
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,800
You knew something was wrong with him, right?

628
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,370
You didn't let me down either.

629
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,760
You pretended to be drunk

630
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,510
and let Kudel go.

631
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,540
Then you followed him in secret

632
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,390
to find out

633
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,750
what he was up to.

634
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,160
Am I right?

635
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,110
How did you find out he was suspicious?

636
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,000
I've been keeping an eye on them

637
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,250
since they arrived at the city gate.

638
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,460
They were proper merchants from Yanle,

639
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,420
but kept quiet about losing his travel pass

640
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,660
and even ran away.

641
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,110
Isn't that strange?

642
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,170
What are you doing?

643
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,570
Where's your manners?

644
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,120
So you used me to investigate him

645
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,540
and also test if I was a scumbag.

646
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,470
I didn't say that.

647
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,040
How did you know he would come here?

648
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,090
This is indeed a good wine.

649
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,190
But the sealing mud is made of incense ash.

650
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,640
In Changle City,

651
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,390
almost all the temples use sandalwood.

652
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,200
Only this shabby temple

653
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,360
is surrounded by elm trees.

654
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,100
So they use elm bark to make incense instead.

655
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,470
Aren't I amazing?

656
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,310
You know about these things too?

657
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,690
I'm more knowledgeable about wine.

658
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,220
How about a drink together?

659
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,710
What are you doing?

660
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,870
I'll pass on the wine.

661
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,660
I'm taking him with me.

662
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,560
Let's go.

663
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,830
Don't you want to know

664
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,200
what they were transporting out of the city?

665
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,410
I just run errands for Sifang Pavilion

666
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,620
and make some pocket money.

667
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,550
I don't plan to involve myself

668
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,950
in unnecessary trouble.

669
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,870
If you were really afraid of trouble,

670
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,670
you wouldn't have interfered from the beginning.

671
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,510
See you.

672
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,750
The Jingzhao Prefecture is on the case!

673
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:41,950
Keep quiet.

674
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,260
Or you'll die miserably.

675
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,100
Calm down.

676
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,690
I'm keeping watch for you.

677
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,460
I finally found you.

678
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,550
Guards! Arrest them all!

679
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,200
Wait!

680
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,150
I'm Wang Kunwu, the retainer of Sifang Pavilion.

681
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,210
I was going to hand the culprit to Jingzhao Prefecture.

682
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,760
Assistant Advisor of the Jingzhao Prefecture?

683
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,280
Arrest them!

684
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,650
He is the head of the bandits who smuggled weapons!

685
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,790
I followed him here.

686
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,310
Why are you arresting me?

687
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,950
Who knows if you had a falling out among yourselves?

688
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,170
No matter what secret deal

689
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,890
you have with this foreign merchant,

690
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,010
you can explain yourself after we arrest you.

691
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,730
Take them away!

692
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,390
Don't use a blade!

693
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,270
Take him away.

694
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,200
Let's go.

695
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,600
They're gone.

696
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,030
I saved you again.

697
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,190
Miss, how will you thank me?

698
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,270
What is this?

699
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,389
You confiscated my travel pass.

700
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,750
I have to show you my gratitude.

701
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,330
What are you talking about?

702
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,290
What is it?

703
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,460
So? Enjoying the tickle powder?

704
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,830
I can't take it anymore, give me the antidote.

705
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,489
I can't take it anymore.

706
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,889
If you want the antidote,

707
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,130
you'll have to listen to me.

708
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:52,989
Okay.

709
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,469
Listen carefully.

710
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,510
First,

711
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,330
stop calling me Miss Ku.

712
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,750
I won't.

713
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,610
My name is A Shu.

714
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,630
A Shu! A Shu!

715
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,150
Second,

716
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,270
go to Changle’s most expensive garment shop

717
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,830
and get me two sets of clothes.

718
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,830
I want the best.

719
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,550
Okay.

720
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,710
Third,

721
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,790
I want to stay in Changle forever.

722
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,320
Think about how to make me

723
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,140
a citizen of Yong State.

724
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,270
That's not possible.

725
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,310
I can’t help you with that.

726
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,110
Then just scratch your skin off.

727
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,630
You are so vicious!

728
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,030
I... Fine, I promise you.

729
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,750
I promise you everything.

730
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,470
Give me the antidote.

731
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,870
I can't stand it anymore!

732
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,390
Hurry up.

733
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,030
Miss A Shu.

734
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,110
What are you doing in Changle City?

735
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,750
Everyone wants to come to Changle.

736
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,050
I just want to live here permanently.

737
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,170
I don’t believe you.

738
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,150
That's not my problem.

739
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,250
Forget it.

740
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,350
I admit defeat, okay?

741
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,710
Come on.

742
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,620
What are you doing?

743
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Pay me.

744
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,110
Without money, I can't help you

745
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,570
even if I die from the itch.

746
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,590
Hurry.

747
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,750
This is all I have. Do what you must.

748
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,750
That's all?

749
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,850
It's all I have, quit complaining!

750
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,950
I'll give you three days.

751
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,680
If you dare to play tricks again,

752
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,360
you'll bleed next time.

753
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,740
[One day later]

754
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,110
Hua.

755
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,210
Why are you here?

756
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,500
It's been a while since we last met.

757
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,650
What's the point of meeting?

758
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,980
I've already seen you wearing open pants.

759
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,200
There are other people here.

760
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Can you save me some face?

761
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,280
You're always pulling a long face.

762
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,670
Come on, since you’re here,

763
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,670
let’s have some tea in the East Court.

764
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,840
What tea?

765
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,910
Can't you see I'm busy?

766
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,770
Out of my way. You're so annoying.

767
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,110
Hurry!

768
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,650
Advisor Yuchi.

769
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,830
Don't catch the wrong person again.

770
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,270
I have nothing to say this time.

771
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,870
It won't be so easy next time.

772
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,150
Stop!

773
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,950
You're the new retainer of West Court,

774
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,670
Wang Kunwu, right?

775
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,350
I'm talking to you, you hear me?

776
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,830
You don't have to thank me.

777
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,840
Thank you?

778
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,790
The East Court has been following clues for a month.

779
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,710
You intervened once

780
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,610
and he died.

781
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,970
You want me to thank you?

782
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,920
If I hadn't interfered,

783
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,270
you would have died instead, Retainer An.

784
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:24,870
Stop!

785
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,970
How can you be justified when the culprit is dead?

786
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,210
At least I caught him.

787
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,100
What did you do?

788
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,470
You...

789
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,600
Both of you, stop it!

790
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,320
Why are you yelling so early in the morning?

791
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,120
About this matter,

792
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,320
both courts are no longer allowed to look into it.

793
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,550
It's normal for you

794
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,380
young folks to be

795
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,810
so passionate.

796
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,710
But smuggling arms is a big deal.

797
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,260
The Sifang Pavilion

798
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,600
can only help with foreign affairs.

799
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,930
Do you understand?

800
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,920
Now someone is dead.

801
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,710
I don't know how to answer to the Ministry of Rites,

802
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,910
and the two of you are arguing here?

803
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,910
Mr. Yu.

804
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:02,800
What's wrong, Susu?

805
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,840
Vice Minister An of the Ministry of Rites

806
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,700
is almost here.

807
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,470
See? He's here.

808
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,450
The magistrate of Jingzhao

809
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,110
came to the Ministry of Rites to hold me responsible.

810
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,310
Do you know why?

811
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,740
The Ministry of Rites is in charge of the Sifang Pavilion.

812
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,710
But the Sifang Pavilion is in charge of

813
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,550
the hundreds and thousands of foreigners in Changle City.

814
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,150
[An Yuandao, Vice Minister of Ministry of Rites]

815
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,830
If these people cause any trouble,

816
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,440
your Sifang Pavilion will be implicated.

817
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,880
Yes.

818
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,240
Please calm down, Vice Minister An.

819
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,710
But we did our best.

820
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,130
Especially your son, Xiuyi.

821
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,300
As the retainer of East Court,

822
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,080
he checked several places

823
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,690
and gathered a lot of evidence.

824
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,690
Enough of that.

825
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,990
I want results.

826
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,670
Currently, the culprit is dead

827
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,730
and the number of crossbows we retrieved didn't match.

828
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,550
Do you know what that means?

829
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,490
The numbers didn't match?

830
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,770
If the missing batch of crossbows

831
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,010
causes another bloodshed or mishap,

832
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,270
how do you expect me to answer the court?

833
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,150
With your head, Yu Deshui?

834
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,230
An, my friend,

835
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,430
I...

836
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,180
Don't you try to get close to me.

837
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,780
I'll only give you three days.

838
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,830
Do your best to cooperate with the magistrate's investigations.

839
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,430
Yes, sir.

840
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,720
Three days.

841
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,480
I'll only give you three days, East Court.

842
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,110
Do your best to cooperate with the magistrate's investigations.

843
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,590
If the missing batch of crossbows

844
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,470
causes another bloodshed or mishap,

845
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,000
how will I answer to your...

846
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,390
Vice Minister An?

847
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,910
Half an hour ago,

848
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,030
you told us to stay out of this.

849
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,910
Look...

850
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,630
The East Court will complete the task.

851
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,960
Go.

852
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,550
Wait!

853
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,350
The culprit died while I was in charge.

854
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,310
I have to be responsible for this.

855
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,170
Retainer Wang.

856
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,390
I advise you to focus on your West Court matters

857
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,250
and stamp those papers properly.

858
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,310
That's right.

859
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,550
The East and West Courts each have their duties.

860
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,900
External affairs for the East Court, internal affairs for the West Court.

861
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,950
Although tasks in the West Court are complicated,

862
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,070
responsibilities are all the same.

863
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,070
Then there shouldn't be a difference in power either.

864
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,400
[Rules of Sifang Pavilion]

865
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,960
This is the original charter of the Sifang Pavilion.

866
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,950
It says here that

867
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,960
both courts have similar duties.

868
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,740
There's nothing here about splitting the duties

869
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,270
into internal and external.

870
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,270
So what?

871
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,710
You want to be equal with the East Court

872
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,590
with your bunch of losers in the West Court?

873
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Since I, Wang Kunwu, am here,

874
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,110
there will be no cowards among my men,

875
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,230
let alone losers!

876
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,230
Alright.

877
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,470
I know you want to make contributions

878
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,590
and return to the army soon, right?

879
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,430
Xiuyi,

880
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,700
the East and West Courts used to be one.

881
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,030
What Retainer Wang said earlier

882
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,350
does make sense.

883
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,970
How about this?

884
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,570
Let's investigate together this time.

885
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,670
We'll work together earnestly.

886
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,030
We're family.

887
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,660
But I need to emphasize that

888
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,210
our Sifang Pavilion is cooperating with the Jingzhao Prefecture.

889
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,590
Remember.

890
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,110
Cooperate!

891
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,350
It hurts!

892
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,470
Be gentle.

893
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,550
Comfortable.

894
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,080
Yes, right there. That's good.

895
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,010
That's the spot.

896
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,710
Nice.

897
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,930
Don't stop.

898
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,750
Use more force.

899
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,530
Do you know how to do...

900
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,020
A Shu.

901
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,710
How have you been?

902
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,280
How's the task going?

903
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,870
I...

904
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,510
Calm down.

905
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,180
The more you rush, the more you'll be pushed back.

906
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,430
I don't care about that!

907
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,590
I'm not a pushover.

908
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,390
It's a misunderstanding!

909
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,390
Look at you, your Yong language

910
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,720
hasn't improved at all.

911
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,350
Many things can't be rushed.

912
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,400
We need time to work things out, got it?

913
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,000
What?

914
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,550
You went to the theater, drank wine, and got a massage.

915
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,160
It's been three days. Isn't it slow enough?

916
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,280
You followed me?

917
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,310
If I hadn't followed you,

918
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,950
how would I have known where all the money

919
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,310
you scammed me out of went?

920
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,390
Let me explain. Let me explain.

921
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,440
Don't point your weapon at me.

922
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,640
This is dangerous...

923
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,770
I hit the bed this time.

924
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,600
Next time, it'll be your head.

925
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,040
I'll go now.

926
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,790
I won't waste any time.

927
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:36,990
I'll go now.
