If Yuan Mo hadn't used this method to muddle through,

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,680
If everyone in the Yanle Embassy were loyal to Viceroy Long,

192
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,540
I naturally wouldn't interfere.

193
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,270
But if there is a spy,

194
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,910
I can't turn a blind eye.

195
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,990
Deputy Envoy Kang, I want to ask you…

196
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,530
Have you found the spy?

197
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,450
Do you know who I am?

198
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:06,780
Move!

199
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm Ma Zhiwen from Yanle.

200
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,560
I-I-I'm Ma...

201
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,360
T-The Man in White?

202
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,780
Deputy Envoy Kang, w-what is the meaning of this?

203
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,970
Immortal Lady…

204
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,920
She has already confessed.

205
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,900
Every ten days, under the pretext of fortune-telling,

206
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,300
you meet with that witch,

207
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,930
leaking Yanle's secrets.

208
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,750
Before the two failed assassination attempts on Duomi,

209
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,790
you went to see her.

210
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,350
That's not true.

211
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,010
Deputy Envoy Kang, I'm innocent.

212
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,870
I-I-I admit,

213
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,520
I did go to see that witch,

214
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,990
b-but about the assassination of Duomi,

215
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,870
I really didn't know anything about it!

216
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,950
Then why did you appear

217
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,430
in the warehouse storing wormwood?

218
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,310
Wormwood?

219
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,670
What wormwood?

220
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,740
That was luffa!

221
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,670
I-I-I...

222
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,990
I did go there to buy luffa that day.

223
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,670
Somehow

224
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,000
they started fighting.

225
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,490
Yeah.

226
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,840
A-And that Ah Shu,

227
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,670
she knocked me out with poison.

228
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,070
I really didn't know anything!

229
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,440
I…

230
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,110
Deputy Envoy Kang.

231
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,060
Deputy Envoy Kang, you know me.

232
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,740
How could I possibly be a spy?

233
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,410
Ma Zhiwen.

234
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,570
Yes.

235
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,730
You've worked for me for so many years.

236
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,660
I'm so disappointed in you.

237
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,720
Get lost!

238
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,560
Why don't you explain things to Viceroy Long yourself?

239
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,700
Man in White…

240
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,500
Man in White…

241
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,060
Deputy Envoy Kang, let me take him.

242
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,150
From now on,

243
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,320
we can work together

244
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,160
to serve Viceroy Long again.

245
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,310
Be careful with this.

246
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,070
It can make you pass out.

247
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,070
Where should I put this?

248
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,830
Give it to me.

249
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,620
Here. Put it here.

250
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,110
Thank you.

251
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,750
Alright.

252
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,350
Poppet.

253
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,680
Put it here, right here.

254
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,830
Okay, just leave it here.

255
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
Let me give you a hand.

256
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,900
Thank you so much.

257
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,910
Alright.

258
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,790
Yuan Mo.

259
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,290
Everything's here.

260
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,150
We're leaving.

261
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,030
Thank you, guys.

262
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,890
I'll buy you drinks another time.

263
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,350
Bye.

264
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:13,870
We're leaving.

265
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,180
-Thank you, guys.
-Take care.

266
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,140
Take care.

267
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,420
-Take care.
-See you.

268
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,040
With Ah Shilan here,

269
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,430
the Man in White won't bother you anymore.

270
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,080
It's great to have you back.

271
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,340
This home is only complete with you in it.

272
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,470
Yuan Mo. Ah Shu.

273
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,910
Wang?

274
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,630
What are you doing here?

275
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,030
I heard that Ah Shu moved back.

276
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,670
I came to say congratulations.

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,790
Thank you, Wang.

278
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,960
Do you want to eat with us?

279
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,950
Yeah. Join us.

280
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,230
Give me a moment. I'll be right back.

281
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,300
This pigeon is quite fat.

282
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,440
Kunwu.

283
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,630
It's so kind of you.

284
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,750
You're a guest.

285
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,550
You don't need to cook yourself.

286
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,230
Where are the scallion and ginger?

287
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,190
Here.

288
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,760
Salt.

289
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,830
Salt? It's…

290
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,290
What else do you need?

291
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,850
Goji berries. Dates.

292
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,210
Goji berries. Dates.

293
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,830
Here.

294
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,720
Alright. You're not needed here anymore.

295
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,360
Get out.

296
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,710
I didn't know Wang was good at cooking.

297
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,620
Me neither.

298
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,990
Back in the army, we had to cook for ourselves.

299
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,170
So,

300
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,000
where's the pigeon?

301
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, where's the pigeon?

302
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,390
We should be eating it!

303
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,270
Leave it alone!

304
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,370
Ah Shu, sorry.

305
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,090
If you want to have pigeon soup, I'll make some for you another time.

306
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,220
Then who is this for?

307
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,490
Yuchi Hua has woken up.

308
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,260
-Really?
-Really?

309
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,990
That's great!

310
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,630
She's finally awake after being unconscious for so many days.

311
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,190
Why didn't you say it, Wang?

312
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,070
So you made the soup for Yuchi.

313
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,690
So you came here just to borrow our kitchen.

314
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,750
It makes sense now.

315
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,950
You're so sly,

316
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,830
becoming more and more like me.

317
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,670
Stop eating.

318
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,240
Take it to Yuchi now.

319
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,950
-Yeah. Why are you dawdling here?
-What if the soup gets cold?

320
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,430
Hurry. Go.

321
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,630
Wait. I'm not done eating yet.

322
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,790
Forget about eating.

323
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,470
This soup is your future, you know?

324
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,750
I only have one meal a day.

325
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,430
You have to send the soup to her before it gets cold.

326
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,310
What if she faints again?

327
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,910
Then the soup will be wasted.

328
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,050
What a surprise.

329
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,910
Indeed, what a surprise.

330
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,710
What's in your hand?

331
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,530
What's in your hand?

332
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,650
Nothing special.

333
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,930
Just pigeon soup that I simmered for several hours

334
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,010
with top-notch nourishing ingredients added.

335
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,500
Likewise.

336
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,870
But I used a plump wild pigeon that I just caught,

337
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,540
which is slightly better than your so-called premium

338
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,060
farm-raised one.

339
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,950
Nonsense!

340
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,150
I made this pigeon soup myself.

341
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,270
I killed this pigeon with my own hands.

342
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,150
In my pigeon soup,

343
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,120
there are premium spices from Xiyuan!

344
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,180
My soup is filled with the love of the West Court family.

345
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,590
You want a piece of me?

346
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,800
You've been a thorn in my side for a long time.

347
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,390
Bring it on!

348
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,070
Bring it on!

349
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,230
Sirs, Miss Yuchi asks to see you.

350
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,780
Please, Retainer Wang.

351
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,980
Please, Retainer An.

352
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,910
Sirs, please wait here.

353
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,440
Be careful. It's hot.

354
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:52,870
Thank you.

355
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,470
It took me a long time to make this soup.

356
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,270
Do you like it?

357
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,530
Careful.

358
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,400
Careful.

359
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,230
Sirs, please come in.

360
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,680
[Big Wings]

361
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,040
I can do it myself.

362
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,370
Let me help you.

363
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,420
Hey.

364
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,760
[Huo Zi'an, the eldest son of the Huo family]

365
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,630
I'm Huo Zi'an.

366
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,060
You guys are

367
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,550
Retainer Wang and Retainer An from the Sifang Pavilion, right?

368
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,480
Nice to meet you.

369
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,870
Pleasure to meet you.

370
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,330
Are you from the Huo family

371
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,190
that runs the Tiangong Workshop?

372
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,590
You've heard about my family's workshop?

373
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,910
The Mo swords and crossbows used in the army

374
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,570
are all made by the Huo family.

375
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,150
Everyone who serves in the army

376
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,810
knows that.

377
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,070
Not just that.

378
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,870
The astronomical instruments used by the Directorate of Astronomy of Yong

379
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,310
are also made by the talented craftsmen

380
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,970
in the Huo family's workshop.

381
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,070
Let me introduce you.

382
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,110
This is Huo Zi'an, my old classmate.

383
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,160
Be careful, Hua.

384
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,369
Your injury hasn't fully healed yet.

385
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,150
Retainers, please have a seat for a moment.

386
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,750
Give Hua some time to finish the bird's nest soup with snow lotus.

387
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,300
The snow lotus is from the peak of Tianshan Mountain.

388
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,280
It's said that only one snow lotus can fully grow in 500 years.

389
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,339
It's still hot after such a long time.

390
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,470
This is a self-heating pot I designed myself.

391
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,740
You can put quicklime

392
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,079
and cold water inside it

393
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,710
to heat and keep food warm.

394
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,730
This self-heating pot can be improved

395
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,260
for military use

396
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,450
so that the soldiers at the border

397
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,850
can have hot meals

398
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,390
and hot drinks

399
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,940
during their winter patrols.

400
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,710
Retainer Wang, your concern for the border troops

401
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,670
is admirable.

402
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
I'll improve this pot after I go back

403
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,110
and supply them to the military.

404
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,310
That's great, Zi'an!

405
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,590
Zi'an?

406
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,390
Hua,

407
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,430
it's getting late.

408
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,720
You should get some rest.

409
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,980
I'll come to see you again tomorrow.

410
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,100
Take care, Zi'an.

411
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,770
He'll come again tomorrow?

412
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,090
Go. Walk him out.

413
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,980
Why should I?

414
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,380
Go feel him out.

415
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,870
Young Master Huo.

416
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,740
Wait for me!

417
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,460
Wang Kunwu.

418
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,530
What did you bring?

419
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,370
Bring it to me.

420
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,670
I made some pigeon soup.

421
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,970
But it's already cold.

422
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,400
Bring it here.

423
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,550
I like it cold.

424
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,070
I've had a lot of snow lotus soup and chicken soup

425
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,390
since I was little.

426
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm fed up with them.

427
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,160
I just want to try your pigeon soup.

428
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,300
Pour some out for me.

429
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,950
It's delicious.

430
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,210
I didn't know you were so good at cooking.

431
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,950
It's very delicious.

432
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,440
Wang Kunwu.

433
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,750
Did you mean

434
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,900
what you said that day?

435
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,310
When I was in a coma,

436
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,480
I vaguely heard someone tell me

437
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,200
that he liked me.

438
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,160
He also said

439
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,270
he was serious about it.

440
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,920
Good lad, you're strong.

441
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,250
Come often.

442
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,990
Sure.

443
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll take my leave.

444
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,520
Okay.

445
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,320
What are you looking at?

446
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,720
I'm asking you. Did you mean it?

447
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,680
It wasn't me.

448
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,840
Perhaps you were dreaming.

449
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,910
Oh, right.

450
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,270
When you were unconscious,

451
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,630
a lot of things happened.

452
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,560
Ah Shu is actually Princess Yanle,

453
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,670
and someone is pretending to be her.

454
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,940
Things have been hectic in the Sifang Pavilion.

455
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,670
I've been busy running around.

456
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,620
I couldn't have made time to come here

457
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,800
and say those things to you.

458
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,190
Yeah.

459
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,190
Perhaps I just had a dream.

460
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,740
Don't worry.

461
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,540
I'll recover soon

462
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,890
and go back to the Sifang Pavilion.

463
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,540
I hope you get better soon.

464
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,730
Wang Kunwu.

465
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,340
You can't even protect the girl who loves you.

466
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,290
How dare you talk about avenging your men?

467
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,540
What are you doing?

468
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,830
I'm reading.

469
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,240
I'm going to bed.

470
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,990
Alright. Go ahead.

471
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,350
I'm so sleepy.

472
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,160
This house is much more expensive than that one.

473
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,060
Well,

474
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,650
are houses in the south cheaper?

475
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,020
[Jing Mansion]

476
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,590
Ah Shilan.

477
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,360
Ah Shu.

478
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,470
What are you doing here?

479
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,410
I came to see you.

480
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,990
Are you alright?

481
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,320
I'm fine.

482
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,420
They offer me the best of everything.

483
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,030
I can get whatever I want.

484
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,250
I've never lived like this before.

485
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,730
You don't like the food?

486
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,210
It's not like that.

487
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,550
I'm not hungry now.

488
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,650
So I haven't eaten.

489
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,740
This loom…

490
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,940
I asked Qing to move it here.

491
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,840
Did you weave all the cloth yourself?

492
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,110
I have plenty of free time now.

493
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,750
It's a good pastime.

494
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,100
Ah Shilan, tell me the truth.

495
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,210
Are you not happy here?

496
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,990
This kind of life

497
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,390
is not what you want,

498
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,060
right?

499
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,850
If that's the case…

500
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,950
I'll tell Uncle to let you leave.

501
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,700
No!

502
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,630
You can't go to Uncle.

503
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,550
You'll get him in trouble if you go to him now.

504
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,790
If anyone finds out,

505
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,650
all these years of hard work will be in vain.

506
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,830
But I can't just stand by

507
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,300
and watch you suffer.

508
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,830
This is only temporary.

509
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,220
I think what I'm doing is meaningful.

510
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,080
For you,

511
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,670
I'm willing to do anything.

512
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,450
Ah Shilan.

513
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm no longer the Ah Shilan I used to be.

514
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,580
Now, I'm a pawn in the game

515
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,100
between Yong and Yanle.

516
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,270
So many eyes are watching me.

517
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,480
I'm the key to the relationship of the two states.

518
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,150
So Ah Shu, listen to me.

519
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,910
You must not go to Uncle.

520
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,550
Don't worry. I'm fine.

521
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,900
Everything will be alright.

522
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,940
Ah Shilan is confined behind high walls,

523
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,240
while I'm enjoying freedom outside.

524
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,940
Yuan Mo,

525
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,980
am I being too selfish?

526
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,140
Ah Shu.

527
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,410
It may not be what it looks like.

528
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,230
I shouldn't say this,

529
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,310
but I feel we can't…

530
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,470
we can't completely trust the girl

531
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,990
called Ah Shilan who appeared out of nowhere.

532
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,590
Why?

533
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,790
She's sacrificed so much for me.

534
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,980
How can you still doubt her?

535
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,170
Because the timing of her appearance is too convenient.

536
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,230
Do you understand?

537
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,590
Think about it.

538
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,110
The Man in White has tried so many times

539
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,990
to find out your identity,

540
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,160
but we've thwarted all his attempts.

541
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,290
Yet she appeared at this exact moment,

542
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,970
claiming she's doing everything for you.

543
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,380
We can't know if she's lying.

544
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,420
Enough.

545
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,150
She's Uncle's pawn.

546
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,120
Uncle would never harm me.

547
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
He's the person who cares for me the most in this world.

548
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,390
You don't know what we've been through.

549
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,920
So don't make assumptions.

550
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,410
Sorry.

551
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,310
I shouldn't have doubted her for no reason.

552
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,320
It's alright.

553
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,110
I'm just a bit upset.

554
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,820
Since you trust her so much,

555
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,240
there's no need to worry anymore.

556
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,040
Everything

557
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,580
is Ah Shilan and Uncle's choice.

558
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,900
Don't let them down.

559
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,550
Boys,

560
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,950
don't doze off.

561
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,990
Stay sharp.

562
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,840

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,670
Uncle Kang.

752
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,510
You suddenly left the Yanle Embassy.

753
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,770
Will it arouse suspicion?

754
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,090
You had this chess manual delivered to me.

755
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,480
Everyone at the Yanle Embassy knows

756
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,740
I love collecting ancient chess manuals.

757
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
It should be fine.

758
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,050
Let's go inside first.

759
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,250
This place has been sealed off by the government.

760
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,780
It's relatively safe here.

761
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,470
My Lord.

762
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,670
They entered the Wispy Pavilion.

763
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,030
I couldn't see that person's face clearly.

764
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,950
But I'm sure

765
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,340
that person is from the Yanle Embassy.

766
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,670
Our men saw that boy

767
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,800
send Ah Shu's bag to the Yanle Embassy.

768
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,530
Bring them to me alive.

769
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,590
Yes.

770
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,430
Please tell Deputy Envoy Kang that

771
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,030
Wang Kunwu and Yuan Mo from the Sifang Pavilion ask to see him.

772
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,430
Deputy Envoy Kang is out today.

773
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,310
He's not in the embassy.

774
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,470
Come back another day.

775
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,330
Where did he go?

776
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,630
We don't get to ask about

777
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,560
Deputy Envoy Kang's whereabouts.

778
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,180
Uncle Kang.

779
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,430
I haven't contacted you in so many years.

780
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,540
I didn't expect that when we met again,

781
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,240
you'd be the Deputy Envoy of Yanle.

782
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,830
And you've grown up.

783
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,860
You suddenly asked to meet me.

784
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,870
It must be about something very important, right?

785
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,070
It's about Ah Shilan.

786
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,410
I've been looking into

787
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,550
Ah Shilan secretly.

788
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,250
But unfortunately,

789
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,600
I still haven't found out why she's pretending to be you.

790
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,470
Ah Shu?

791
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,070
You mean

792
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,300
she wasn't sent by you?

793
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,770
How is that possible?

794
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,150
I don't even know her.

795
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,450
What's wrong?

796
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,190
Yuan Mo was right.

797
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,740
I've been deceived.

798
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,060
What's going on?

799
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,130
Ah Shilan mentioned you to me again and again,

800
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,350
saying it was all your plan.

801
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,670
To give me freedom,

802
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,870
you made her pretend to be the princess.

803
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,510
I get it now.

804
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,310
Their target isn't me.

805
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,190
It's you.

806
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,960
Let's go!

807
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,040
After them!

808
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,030
After them!

809
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,880
They're over there. This way.

810
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,100
Ah Shu, listen to me.

811
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,590
You go first. I'll cover for you.

812
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,510
I can't leave without you.

813
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:24,970
Ah Shu.

814
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,230
Neither of us can make it out like that.

815
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,410
I'm the Yanle Envoy.

816
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,950
The Faceless take orders from Long Tuqi.

817
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,210
Even if I was caught by them,

818
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,680
they wouldn't dare to harm me.

819
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,910
But they might kill you.

820
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,200
You're wrong, Uncle.

821
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,070
You've been secretly protecting me for so many years.

822
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,230
You're the one Long Tuqi wants to find the most.

823
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,030
Ah Shilan already knows who I am.

824
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,250
There's no point for me to hide anymore.

825
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,600
Over there! Go get them!

826
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,660
You're so good at hiding. I'm impressed.

827
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,160
Why don't you show me your face?

828
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,070
You're so clever.

829
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,850
I'm starting to like you.

830
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,540
My Lord.

831
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,210
What about that person?

832
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,530
Now that we've got her,

833
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,450
it's only a matter of time before that man shows up.
