00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,150
This is the house I lived in when I was young.

5
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,990
I want to spend some time alone.

6
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,990
Yes.

7
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,540
Be careful.

8
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
Call me if you need anything.

9
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,160
What's wrong?

10
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,320
Nothing.

11
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,690
Let's go over there.

12
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,730
Ah Shu.

13
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,940
That door is locked.

14
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,500
Let's go.

15
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,960
Ah Shu.

16
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,159

Move!

20
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,950
Hurry! Get in!

21
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,940
The gas is poisonous!

22
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,750
Let us out!

Mutu.

27
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,840
What?

28
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,810
Ah Shilan told me

29
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,530
the one who led the Dragon Cavalry to slaughter the village

30
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,460
was called Mutu.

31
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,910
I've seen that name

32
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,640
in documents related to Yanle.

33
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,880
Long Tuqi made him the General of the Dragon Cavalry

34
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,200
to eliminate his dissidents.

35
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,590
I want him to pay with his life.

36
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,470
I'll help you.

37
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,810
This is between me and him.

38
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,060
You're the Sifang Envoy.

39
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,490
You represent Yong no matter what you do.

40
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,080
I can't get you involved.

41
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,550
Don't worry.

42
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,180
I won't do anything stupid.

43
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,730
We want Mutu dead,

44
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,290
but we don't need to kill him ourselves.

[Mutu, the commander of Yanle's Dragon Cavalry]

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,730
Yes.

54
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,140
Viceroy Long sent me to receive you.

55
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,360
Form up!

56
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,070
Distinguished envoy, you've come a long way.

57
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,540
You and your delegation are very welcome here.

58
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,000
You knew we had come a long way,

59
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,400
but instead of letting us in the city,

60
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,040
you surrounded us with soldiers brandishing swords

61
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,440
in front of the city gate.

62
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,650
Do you want to start a war?

63
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,580
Sifang Envoy, don't get me wrong.

64
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,760
The swords

65
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,970
are just a way to show respect.

66
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,210

Commander Mu, what do you want this time?

75
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,930
Since the princess has entered the city,

76
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,060
she should go to the Princess's Mansion for a rest first.

77
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,600
Escort the princess's carriage to the Princess's Mansion.

78
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,560

I don't remember it at all.

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,470
Greetings, Viceroy Long.

116
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Don't stand on ceremony.

117
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,410
Sifang Envoy,

118
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm surprised that you're so young

119
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,240
yet have assumed your father's mantle.

120
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,340
When your father came to Yanle as Yong's envoy back then,

121
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,930
it was such a magnificent sight.

122
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,650
I admired your father very much

123
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,450
and wanted to make friends with him.

124
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,770
But unfortunately,

125
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,200
your father died in the desert.

126
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,240
It was such a tragedy.

127
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,740
There are all sorts of rumors about how my parents died.

128
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,640
This time, I came here

129
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,100
to get to the bottom of it

130
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,790
and find the murderer.

131
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,170
Great!

132
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,020
You're a filial son.

133
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,490
You're the Sifang Envoy

134
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,950
and the son of my old friend.

135
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,190
I have a gift for you.

136
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,130
Guards.

137
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,160
I've kept this robe for many years.

138
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,980
It represents my respect

139
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,030
for the previous Sifang Envoy.

140
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,360
Back then, after your father went missing,

141
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,600
I sent out the Dragon Cavalry

142
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,620
to look for him for five days.

143
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,510
In the end, they found him

144
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,420
on the back of a hill.

145
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,510
His body had been devoured by vultures.

146
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,860
I had no choice but to bring back his blood-soaked robe,

147
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,820
hoping that one day

148
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,160
I could send it back to Yong

149
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,240
and return it to you.

150
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,960
But I didn't expect

151
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,510
to meet you here today.

152
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,320
Good.

153
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,840
I'll return it to you

154
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,990
as a gift.

155
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,370
Viceroy Long, you returned my father's robe,

156
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,780
so I should give you a gift

157
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,010
to show my sincerity too.

158
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,240

159
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,820
where is your gift?

160
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,580
Listen carefully.

161
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,720
We want to meet Princess Longshuang!

162
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:14,819
Princess Longshuang! We want to meet Princess Longshuang!

163
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,680
Long live Princess Longshuang!

164
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,089
Princess Longshuang, please bless us!

165
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,329

Long live…

174
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,730
How dare they!

175
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,860
Who's making all that noise outside the Royal Court?

176
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,840
Report!

177
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,450
Viceroy Long,

178
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,910
many commoners came out of nowhere

179
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,560
and gathered outside the Royal Court,

180
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,690
calling Princess Longshuang's name.

181
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,330
No.

182
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,450
They can't just meet her.

183
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,450
Ridiculous.

184
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,360
Your people's request speaks volumes.

185
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,900
My father, Yuan Hanjing, protected the princess back then.

186
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,760
Now that I've completed his unfinished task

187
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,590
and safely escorted the princess back to her hometown,

188
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,450
the royal bloodline of Yanle can continue,

189
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,190
and my father can finally rest in peace.

190
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,070
No matter what is awaiting me,

191
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,310
I won't regret it.

192
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,500
This…

193
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,580
is my gift in return.

194
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,200
Where did those pariahs

195
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,210
come from?

196
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,790
How dare they challenge me outside the Royal Court?

197
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,800
Viceroy, calm down.

198
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,030
This matter was odd.

199
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,220
Yuan Mo must have planned it beforehand.

200
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,290
He's very cunning.

201
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,360
We must be careful with him.

202
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,970
All he can take advantage of

203
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,440
is that pariah's title as the princess.

204
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,530
If I kill her,

205
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,910
what can he do?

206
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,260
You must not do that.

207
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,170
You just announced that

208
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,510
you would welcome the princess back.

209
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,170
If you killed Longshuang Yueshu now,

210
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,370
it'd trigger civil turmoil

211
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,300
and make other states despise you.

212
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,320
It's not a smart choice.

213
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,650
Then tell me.

214
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,720
What should I do?

215
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,010
It's a long game.

216
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,850
But don't worry, Viceroy.

217
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,130
She's just a small stone in your way.

218
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,370
In the end, you'll still be the one who rules Yanle.

219
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,220
After all, my son, Long Beina, couldn't have died for nothing.

220
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,550
I'm Wang Kunwu, the retainer of foreign affairs from the Sifang Pavilion of Yong.

221
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,550
A small gift. Please accept it.

222
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,520
It's so kind of you, Envoy Wang.

223
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,130
I've long heard about you.

224
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,220
The Sifang Envoy was supposed to visit you in person,

225
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,520
but Long Tuqi suddenly asked to meet him,

226
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,050
so I came on his behalf.

227
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,120
Yong's delegation has no support in Yanle.

228
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,610
It doesn't look good for you.

229
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,930
You must proceed with caution.

230
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,400
Madam, you've stayed in Yanle for many years.

231
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,570
In your eyes, what kind of person

232
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,840
is Long Tuqi?

233
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,220
Long Tuqi is violent and brutal.

234
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,190
He often intimidates people by killing.

235
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,890
But in terms of strategy,

236
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,170
he's not good at it.

237
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,600
As he gets older,

238
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,930
he can't do everything himself,

239
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,600
so he relies on his henchman and advisor

240
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,990
to control the court.

241
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,610
His henchman is Commander Mutu.

242
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,530
He commands the Dragon Cavalry

243
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,730
to eliminate dissidents for Long Tuqi.

244
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,790
As for his advisor,

245
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,060
he never shows himself in public

246
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,710
but is sinister and cunning.

247
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,130
Many of Long Tuqi's vicious tricks

248
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,120
were his ideas.

249
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,650
It's said that

250
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,410
he's the Man in White, the head of The Faceless,

251
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,880
an assassin organization in the desert.

252
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,240
The Man in White?

253
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,120
You know that guy?

254
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,840
I don't just know him.

255
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,300
He and The Faceless

256
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,730
killed a lot of people in Yong.

257
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,950
They did that in other states too.

258
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,650
That's why

259
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,490
Mutu advised Long Tuqi

260
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,680
to forbid the Man in White to show his face in public

261
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,450
and ban The Faceless from entering the city

262
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,450
to avoid infuriating other states.

263
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,850
The Man in White just agreed?

264
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,620
Of course not.

265
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,000
That's the reason why he and Mutu

266
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,600
are on bad terms.

267
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,820
[Yong Embassy]

268
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,210
Chief Secretary Yuchi.

269
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,300
Everything's in place.

270
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,040
Okay. Go take a rest.

271
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:04,930
Yes.

272
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,000
You're back.

273
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,450
Have you done what Yuan Mo asked?

274
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,580
Yanle's people all hate Long Tuqi's guts.

275
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,440
After I told them Princess Longshuang was back,

276
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,150
they all hurried to the entrance of the Royal Court to welcome her.

277
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,230
Long Tuqi can't

278
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,520
bully around anymore.

279
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,850
Where is Yuan Mo?

280
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,770
He's been staying in his room

281
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,010
since he came back from the Royal Court.

282
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,950
Yuan Mo.

283
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,940
You're back.

284
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,290
Have you met the Yueying Envoy?

285
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,200
Yes.

286
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,410
She knows you love drinking

287
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,110
and asked me to bring you two jars of Yueying Spring.

288
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,420
Are you in a bad mood?

289
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,900
Did Long Tuqi give you a hard time?

290
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,840
What is this?

291
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,480
My father's blood-soaked robe.

292
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,120
Long Tuqi is so sinister.

293
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,180
Yuan Mo,

294
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,800
he's using this to upset you.

295
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,900
Don't fall for it.

296
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,050
Thanks to you,

297
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,650
I got even with Long Tuqi in his court.

298
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,950
Without you,

299
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,100
I'd have lost my cool.

300
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,290
Don't worry.

301
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,520
You always have our support.

302
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,810
Thank you.

303
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,600
How's everything?

304
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,800
Any news?

305
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,950
It's said that

306
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,430
the Man in White has returned to Yanle

307
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,180
and is serving Long Tuqi as his advisor.

308
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,250
Now, he and Mutu

309
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,140
are Long Tuqi's right-hand men.

310
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Long Tuqi and Mutu

311
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,290
are already hard to deal with.

312
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,690
Now we have to deal with the Man in White too.

313
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,840
Luckily,

314
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,910
the Man in White and Mutu don't get along.

315
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,570
Tell me more about it.

316
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,560
Princess Longshuang is here.

317
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,840
Princess,

318
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,400
please forgive me

319
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,130
for not going out to receive you.

320
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,240
Viceroy Long, you're busy

321
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,760
with state affairs.

322
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,500
Why would I blame you?

323
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,990
I don't remember

324
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,730
summoning the Yong Envoy today.

325
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,420
Please forgive me, Viceroy Long.

326
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,750
Princess Longshuang is Yanle's princess

327
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,960
and also a princess conferred by Yong.

328
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,460
It's my duty to accompany and protect her.

329
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,400
Good.

330
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,960
Princess, you came from afar.

331
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,620
You're a distinguished guest of Yanle.

332
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,350
Guest?

333
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,060
Viceroy Long, have you forgotten that

334
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,590
this is my home?

335
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,610
Okay.

336
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,800
Princess,

337
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,570
please take the seat up there.

338
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,570
No, Viceroy Long!

339
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,850
Ruling the state is a serious matter.

340
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,070
Please think twice, Viceroy Long.

341
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,190
Please think twice, Viceroy Long.

342
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,080
Don't be nervous.

343
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm not here to take someone's seat.

344
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,260
I have something important to discuss with Viceroy Long.

345
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,350
Rise.

346
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,250
Princess, what can I do for you?

347
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,370
Since you're so polite,

348
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,310
I'll be frank with you.

349
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,190
Open the granary immediately

350
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,910
to provide food to the people.

351
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,990
No way.

352
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,330
It's feasible.

353
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,570
We can do that.

354
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,920
Open the granary?

355
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,160
Princess,

356
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,500
food concerns the survival of Yanle.

357
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,480
It's not something we can decide with just a word or two.

358
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,940
You've never handled state affairs before.

359
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,860
I'm afraid you don't know how hard it is.

360
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,550
Hard?

361
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,050
Can it be harder than the lives of the people?

362
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,720
Shouldn't food be used to keep people fed?

363
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,890
Go out and take a look.

364
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,020
What is Yanle like

365
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,380
under your leadership?

366
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,410
People are living in misery

367
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,820
and selling their children for food.

368
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,720
Those who could afford to move to other states have all left.

369
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,130
Those who can't leave

370
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,450
are already struggling to get food on the table,

371
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,450
yet they have to endure your incessant exploitation.

372
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,530
I can't bear to see the people of Yanle

373
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,920
live like this anymore.

374
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,930
Now is the time

375
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,760
to open the granary.

376
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,130
Okay.

377
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,540
Since you want to do that,

378
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,630
let's discuss it in the Royal Court.

379
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,450
Officials,

380
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,020
what do you think of opening the granary and giving out food?

381
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,260
I don't agree.

382
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,730
I think

383
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,780
if people think they can get food for free,

384
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,260
they will be lazier next year.

385
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,500
In the long run, it'll definitely be detrimental to production.

386
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,820
Exactly.

387
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,240
The grains in the state granary

388
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,810
were bought from the people

389
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,780
in case of emergency.

390
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,190
If there was another drought next year

391
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,530
and the harvest failed again,

392
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,970
the granary would be empty,

393
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,830
and the situation would be more challenging for us.

394
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,730
Alright.

395
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,110
Princess, did you hear that?

396
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,490
Opening the granary is not playing house.

397
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,270
Don't be childish.

398
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,690
No one in your court dares

399
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,170
to disobey you.

400
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,160
It's not because you're respectful,

401
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,450
but because you're brutal

402
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,590
and black-hearted.

403
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,300
Princess,

404
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,540
when I found out you were alive,

405
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,210
I wrote to Yong immediately and asked

406
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,570
to take you back so we could rule together!

407
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,210
While you were away,

408
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,580
it was me who kept Yanle from falling

409
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,170
and maintained peace with neighboring states.

410
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,900
It was also me

411
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,000
who made every effort to make Yanle survive

412
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,300
when Yong formed an alliance with the other five states!

413
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,370
What you saw today

414
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,320
is the result of the hard work

415
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,300
of everyone in the Royal Court.

416
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,560
But right after you came back,

417
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,310
you humiliated me in front of all the officials.

418
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,660
You deeply hurt me.

419
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,580
It's not easy for Viceroy Long.

420
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,980
No.

421
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,730
I'm the only living member of Yanle's royal family.

422
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,250
Although I haven't done much

423
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,130
for Yanle these years,

424
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,450
now that I'm back,

425
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,260
I won't let Yanle become worse.

426
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,730
I'll end everything unjust.

427
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,130
Viceroy Long, you've been working so hard these years.

428
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,480
If you're tired,

429
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,950
let me handle everything.

430
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,630
I'll fulfill my duty as the princess

431
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,250
for Yanle and its people.

432
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,000
Enough.

433
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,410
Princess,

434
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,970
I'm tired today.

435
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,470
I'll consider your advice

436
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,870
about opening the granary.

437
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,570
Mutu.

438
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,580
Send the princess back.

439
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,330
Wait.

440
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,020
Opening the granary is a serious matter.

441
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,790
I can give you time to think about it.

442
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,320
But I have another request.

443
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,070
Go ahead.

444
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,070
I want him

445
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,770
to be my servant.

446
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,560
What is she talking about?

447
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,860
Ridiculous.

448
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,000
How is that possible?

449
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,210
What did you say?

450
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,520
You want the commander of the Dragon Cavalry to be your servant?

451
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,160
Are you crazy?

452
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,960
Don't be rude!

453
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,130
Princess.

454
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,160
Commander Mu has his duties

455
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,090
and is very busy.

456
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,650
Can I get you someone else?

457
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,280
No.

458
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,020
I want no one but him.

459
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,490
If you refuse

460
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,060
both of my requests,

461
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,270
I'll starve to death in the Princess's Mansion.

462
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,130
Mutu.

463
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,770
Mutu!

464
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,720
It's your honor that the princess

465
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,530
has chosen you to be her servant.

466
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,400
Remember.

467
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,990
You must serve her well

468
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,360
in the Princess's Mansion.

469
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,130
Viceroy Long…

470
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,130
It's decided.

471
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,010
Serve her well.

472
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,660
Understand?

473
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,910
[Princess's Mansion]

474
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,330
Princess.

475
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,530
You must be tired.

476
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,650
Have a foot bath.

477
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,310
Wait.

478
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,330
In this room,

479
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,260
we're all masters.

480
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,060
He's the only servant.

481
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,360
Let him do it.

482
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,010
Be gentle. Mind your attitude.

483
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,310
Bring it to me.

484
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,790
Take off my shoes.

485
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,310
Princess,

486
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,040
the commander shall leave if there's nothing else.

487
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,410
Wait.

488
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,970
Call yourself whatever you want when you're not here.

489
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,320
But in front of me,

490
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,950
you can't call yourself the commander.

491
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,460
Always remember that

492
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,780
you're a servant.

493
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,330
I'm done.

494
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,630
Wipe my feet.

495
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,600
Wait.

496
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,990
Take the water out.

497
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,490
Didn't you hear her?

498
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,090
The princess said...

499
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,620
Get lost!

500
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,090
Si Niang!

501
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,330
Who do you think you are?

502
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,230
How dare you order me around?

503
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,970
Mutu!

504
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,010
How dare you disobey Viceroy Long's order?

505
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,130
I didn't!

506
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,420
Viceroy Long ordered you to be my servant,

507
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,620
yet you still see yourself as a commander

508
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,500
and even beat up my maid.

509
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,640
Do you have any respect for Viceroy Long?

510
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,440
You've been the powerful commander of the Dragon Cavalry for too long.

511
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,610
It's easy for me to convince Viceroy Long

512
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,540
that you've become a threat to him.

513
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,739
I didn't mean it.

514
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
Please forgive me.

515
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:26,610
Si Niang.

516
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,130
Beat him back!

517
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,550
All right. You're even now.

518
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,920
Take the water out.

519
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,060
I can't stand that pariah anymore!

520
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,820
Please take back your order, Viceroy Long.

521
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,820
I don't want to be her servant!

522
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,610
How dare you laugh at me?

523
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,230
You misunderstood, Commander Mu.

524
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,560
I'm not laughing at you.

525
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,010
I'm just surprised that Longshuang Yueshu

526
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,370
is actually able

527
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,710
to back you into a corner.

528
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,370
Since Commander Mu can't stand such grievances,

529
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,690
why don't we do as he asked?

530
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,590
Remove the Dragon Cavalry from the Princess's Mansion

531
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,450
and let The Faceless in the city to keep an eye on her.

532
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,040
Who do you think you are?

533
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,400
How dare you laugh at me?

534
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,720
The Faceless are just a bunch of bandits in the desert

535
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,250
that everyone hates.

536
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,810
How dare you try to replace the Dragon Cavalry with it?

537
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,280
If it weren't for the sake of Viceroy Long,

538
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,290
I would have torn you into pieces to feed dogs!

539
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,000
Stop.

540
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,690
Mutu.

541
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,250
Are you trying to disobey me?

542
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,830
I dare not.

543
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,310
Apologize.

544
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,130
No need.

545
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,380
Commander Mu must feel unwell too.

546
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,110
Commander Mu.

547
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,480
Is your hand alright?

548
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,190
You…

549
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,750
You poisoned me?

550
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,930
Didn't you want to kill me too?

551
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,750
Commander Mu! Commander Mu!

552
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,420
Get lost!

553
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,120
Enough.

554
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,860
We have enough soldiers in the capital.

555
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,410
The Faceless should stay outside the city on standby.

556
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,270
No need for them to enter the city.

557
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,440
I was just joking.

558
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,290
My men listen to you, Viceroy.

559
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,480
Without your permission,

560
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,690
The Faceless wouldn't dare take any action.

561
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,200
Mutu.

562
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,140
You should learn to control your temper.

563
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,400
Don't

564
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,720
feel aggrieved just because I made you

565
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,050
that pariah's servant.

566
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,710
Remember your mission.

567
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,970
Monitor her every move.

568
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,170
Yes.

569
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,810
Man in White.

570
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,210
Commander Mu.

571
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,990
You may not get the antidote next time.

572
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,510
You may leave.

573
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,590
Commander Mu, how are you?

574
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,770
Go away!

575
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,590
You're so clueless.

576
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,370
You're of no use to me!

577
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,390
[Ah Bili]

578
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,830
Even a dog is better than you!

579
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,390
Sorry. It's all my fault.

580
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,020
Anything unusual about the Yong Embassy?

581
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,010
Nothing unusual for now.

582
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,730
Wang Kunwu and Yuchi Hua…

583
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,920
Have you looked into them?

584
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,980
Yuan Mo is smart

585
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,970
but can't fight.

586
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,530
He relies on the two of them

587
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,580
to handle the affairs in the Yong Embassy.

588
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,770
To deal with them,

589
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,260
we have to separate them first.

590
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,920
Figure a way out.

591
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,770
I can't stand them anymore.

592
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,900
Don't worry, Viceroy.

593
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,430
I got a plan.

594
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:31,060
[Yong Embassy]

595
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,140
Wake up.

596
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,820
What's wrong with you?

597
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,190
Wake up. Wake up.

598
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,800
Have you checked his identity?

599
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,630
Yes.

600
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,740
He's indeed from Yong.

601
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,080
[Travel Pass]

602
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,410
How did he end up here?

603
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
According to him,

604
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,670
he came to Yanle with a caravan.

605
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,380
He planned to bring some of Yanle's specialties back to Yong to sell,

606
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,350
but before he left Yanle's territory,

607
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,480
he ran into bandits.

608
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,190
They not only took all his money

609
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,360
but also beat him up.

610
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,710
Under tyranny,

611
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,850
it's normal for commoners

612
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,350
to become robbers.

613
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,830
He also said

614
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,530
he's sure they were The Faceless.

615
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
Thank you, Sifang Envoy.

616
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,610
You're welcome.

617
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,780
Your name is Qi Sanlang?

618
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:26,490
Yes.

619
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,960
I know what happened to you.

620
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,080
I'll negotiate with Yanle.

621
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,900
Any other requests?

622
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,010
I want nothing else.

623
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,770
I just want to return to Yong as soon as possible

624
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,700
and go back to my wife and children.

625
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,250
Please help me, Sifang Envoy.

626
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Sir,

627
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,440
please get up.

628
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,440
Your family must be waiting for you day and night

629
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
to reunite with you.

630
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,950
Go back and have a good rest.

631
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,580
I'll seek justice for you.

632
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,150
Thank you, sir.

633
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,010
It's my duty to escort expatriates

634
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,140
back to Yong safely.

635
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,420
Kunwu.

636
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,990
Could you send him back to Yong for me?

637
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,220
Can't you see

638
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,680
it's the Man in White's trick?

639
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,300
The Faceless never leave behind any traces.

640
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,160
How could he have come back alive?

641
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,740
The Man in White wants to get rid of me,

642
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,000
so he can deal with you.

643
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,670
I know.

644
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
But I also know the pain

645
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,740
of being apart from one's family.

646
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,060
Whether it's the Man in White's trick or not,

647
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,980
I have to fulfill my duty as the Sifang Envoy.

648
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,270
Besides, all this time,

649
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,470
our enemies have been hiding in the shadows.

650
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,770
Now we finally have a chance

651
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
to hide you in the dark.

652
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,290
If you insist,

653
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,890
you can arrange for someone else

654
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,280
to escort that man back.

655
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,540
It's a long journey.

656
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,700
There will inevitably be accidents.

657
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,870
I can only trust you with it.

658
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,490
But I have to look out for you here.

659
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,290
Stop arguing!

660
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,170
I'll go.

661
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,460
You must take the official roads.

662
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,720
Don't take shortcuts.

663
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,960
It's dangerous.

664
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,150
And this water bag…

665
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,200
Check it regularly to see if it's leaking.

666
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,770
Got it.

667
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,760
You're nagging again.
