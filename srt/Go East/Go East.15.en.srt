00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,530
I learned fast.

193
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,950
He taught me more and more.

194
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,530
Ventriloquism, mechanisms, poison;

195
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,420
I learned everything.

196
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,200
Finally, one day,

197
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,060
he brought me

198
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,470
in front of a very beautiful vase.

199
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,670
Master.

200
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,770
What is this?

201
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,340
Crawl in.

202
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,500
I thought after I mastered it,

203
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,830
Master would take me to the outside world.

204
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,310
But from that day on,

205
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,030
the vase became my world.

206
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,510
Show me everything you've learned.

207
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,100
I am the Red Lotus Immortal.

208
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,910
Why aren't you kowtowing?

209
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,080
Those who are unfaithful

210
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,320
will be punished by me.

211
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,360
I'm trapped in the vase every day,

212
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,330
working with my master to defraud people and make money.

213
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm like a monster who never sees the light of day

214
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,710
and lives in eternal darkness.

215
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,370
Master.

216
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,900
I don't want to enter the vase anymore.

217
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,230
I want to live a good life outside.

218
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,950
Okay, Xiao'e.

219
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,520
You've grown up.

220
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,120
Sit.

221
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,910
Master!

222
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
What did you feed me?

223
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,650
From then on,

224
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,830
the excruciating pain tormented me.

225
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,350
It's never-ending

226
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,750
and unbearable.

227
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,720
Master.

228
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,550
Master.

229
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,600
I was wrong.

230
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,110
I... I'll listen to you from now on.

231
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,620
Save me.

232
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,000
Save me.

233
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,090
Eat it and you'll be fine.

234
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,620
This is a gift from Red Lotus Immortal.

235
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,600
Without the Immortal, there won't be this pill.

236
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,830
Understand?

237
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,950
From that moment, I knew

238
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,610
I'd be imprisoned in that vase forever.

239
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,830
Only by helping him defraud others

240
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,090
can I get the antidote.

241
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,120
All these years, I've always wanted to escape.

242
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,650
So I secretly accumulated many antidote pills.

243
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,530
But Chen Xinliang is very cunning.

244
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,730
He'd only be relieved if I swallowed it.

245
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,710
The poison in my body has penetrated into my bone marrow.

246
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,240
It's hopeless.

247
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,200
The antidote only alleviates my pain.

248
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,740
But I can't accept it.

249
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,770
I don't want to die like this.

250
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,870
Xiao'e, tell us

251
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,550
where Yuan Mo and the refugees were taken to.

252
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,580
Green Wave Villa in Lantian County.

253
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,340
Where is that?

254
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,360
A place to trade slaves.

255
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,250
From time to time,

256
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,380
Master would lure the refugees,

257
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,470
especially the young and healthy ones, to the villa

258
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,270
and sell them to buyers.

259
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,170
Since they're undocumented,

260
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,490
once the deal succeeds,

261
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,690
they'll be registered as lowly slaves.

262
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,970
The government won't question it.

263
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,270
Hua, we've to save them right away.

264
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,330
It's useless.

265
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,580
The villa's terrain is dangerous.

266
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,910
There's only one way up.

267
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,570
Even if you sneak in,

268
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,720
they'd have already run away.

269
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,080
Refugees are human too.

270
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,860
They're also protected by Yong.

271
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,960
Yuan Mo and Wang Kunwu

272
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,790
were kidnapped

273
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,250
while trying to save them.

274
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,250
Xiao'e.

275
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,089
Since you know the details of Green Wave Villa,

276
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,950
you must know how to break into it.

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,300
Today, a buyer will come stay at Ruyi Pavilion.

278
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,349
I stayed here

279
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,380
to take him to the villa.

280
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,810
When I can move,

281
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,710
I'll kill you.

282
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,980
Yuan Mo.

283
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,120
Wait and see.

284
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,910
Alright, I was just kidding.

285
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,740
I'll put them back.

286
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,950
Can't you take a joke?

287
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,210
I'll put them back.

288
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,000
Why are you

289
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,840
always so serious?

290
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,510
What if we can't get out?

291
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
Can't we laugh a bit before we die?

292
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,720
You can die even if you don't laugh.

293
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,850
Aren't you afraid of death?

294
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,670
I'm not.

295
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,480
I can see my buddies then.

296
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,130
Unfortunately,

297
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,230
I haven't had time to avenge them.

298
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,530
Are you scared?

299
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,380
Me?

300
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,500
I'm thinking about my dear Ah Shu.

301
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,180
If anything happens to me,

302
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,150
she'd have to send me off.

303
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,310
She might feel freer.

304
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,040
You have no idea.

305
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,940
Although she seems smart,

306
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,950
actually, she doesn't know how to manage finances.

307
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,830
She always gets hurt easily.

308
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,380
She never says when she's hungry,

309
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,650
and she's not good at cooking.

310
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,810
But I guess she's used to

311
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,910
living alone in the desert.

312
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,400
If you don't take her to eat something delicious,

313
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,240
she will become thinner

314
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,120
and thinner.

315
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,790
Gosh.

316
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,880
When I think about it, I...

317
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,280
I can't die in peace.

318
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,030
Shut up!

319
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,050
I think someone is here.

320
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,040
How is my mother?

321
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,660
If you could go back earlier,

322
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,360
your mother would be fine.

323
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Gosh, Qing.

324
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,840
Are you stupid?

325
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
How did you become...

326
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,710
Chen Xinliang's servant?

327
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,130
He saw that I was agile

328
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
and smart enough.

329
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
So he kept me by his side to serve him.

330
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,310
Sir.

331
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,950
How can I help you?

332
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I want to help you.

333
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,370
How can I help?

334
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,810
Aren't you afraid?

335
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,450
No.

336
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,870
As long as I can see my mother,

337
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,820
I'll do anything.

338
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,420
Okay.

339
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,330
Just one thing.

340
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,280
Get me the antidote.

341
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,830
Okay, wait for me.

342
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,520
Looks like you've won the bet.

343
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,770
[Sifang Pavilion]

344
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,160
Yu, don't worry.

345
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,190
We'll find him.

346
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,140
Calm down.

347
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,940
Ah Shu.

348
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,310
How was it, Hua?

349
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,110
They're back.

350
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,380
The foreign merchants and Green Wave Villa's owner have agreed

351
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,880
to meet in the villa tomorrow morning to trade slaves.

352
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,030
We can use this chance to sneak into the villa

353
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,760
to save Yuan Mo and the rest.

354
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,000
The villa must be heavily guarded.

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,160
How can we get in?

356
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,540
The foreign merchants said

357
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,670
the buyers and sellers must wear masks

358
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,950
to prevent divulging their identities.

359
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,860
Do you mean masquerading as someone else?

360
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,230
This is the only way.

361
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,140
Who will go?

362
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,160
I'll go.

363
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,850
With a cartful of silver ingots,

364
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,110
I'll buy them all back!

365
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,310
But the buyers are all foreigners.

366
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,630
If they speak in foreign languages during the deal,

367
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,270
you must know how to speak it.

368
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,290
Can you do it?

369
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,330
I...

370
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,070
I only learned from books.

371
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,980
I can only read and not speak.

372
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,540
I know foreign languages,

373
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,640
but my accent is too strong.

374
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,840
I'll be exposed in a word.

375
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,400
You...

376
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,650
I'll go.

377
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,860
Xiuyi.

378
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,550
You don't...

379
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,210
You don’t have to persuade me.

380
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,110
My East Court people were unfamiliar with the terrain

381
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,150
and made a mistake.

382
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,100
I’m obliged to save him.

383
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,500
But it's too dangerous for you to go alone.

384
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,020
You need someone to assist you.

385
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,280
I'll go with him.

386
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,790
No.

387
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,150
I'll go.

388
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,820
Ah Shu.

389
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,250
I'm from Yanle.

390
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,790
Before I came to Changle,

391
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,440
I was wandering the desert.

392
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,140
I know the languages and customs of different regions.

393
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,730
If anyone makes things difficult for Retainer An,

394
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,930
I can assist him.

395
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,040
Thank you, Ms. Ah Shu.

396
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,790
But how can I put you in danger?

397
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,650
After all, you're not from Sifang Pavilion.

398
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,450
Mr. Yu.

399
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,040
I’m half a Changle citizen since I'm here.

400
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,410
I’m willing to contribute to Changle.

401
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,020
Besides, Yuan Mo helped me

402
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,130
and saved me.

403
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,100
Now it's my turn to save him.

404
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,300
[Green Wave Villa]

405
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,850
Did you get it?

406
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,540
Yes.

407
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,390
Eat it now.

408
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,330
I have to go now.

409
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
Okay. Great.

410
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,550
Here.

411
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,400
Aren't you in a hurry to go back?

412
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,060
Why are you still here?

413
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,170
I-I... I'm leaving now.

414
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,120
Wait.

415
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,270
Must you witness me giving him the medicine

416
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,560
and see him swallow it?

417
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,230
I-I-I... No.

418
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,030
I-I-I didn't... m-mean that.

419
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,980
This is not the antidote.

420
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,400
It's poison.

421
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,560
You two are really smart.

422
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,940
Big fat liar.

423
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
Black Wind Powder is a very rare poison,

424
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,590
and its antidote is extremely precious.

425
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,000
Even if he wanted to steal it,

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,460
how could he get it so soon?

427
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,470
I'd really miss you two.

428
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,120
But unfortunately,

429
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,870
you're of no use to me.

430
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,970
After the deal tomorrow,

431
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,050
I'll send you off.

432
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
He was controlled by Chen Xinliang.

433
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,260
He did that to protect himself.

434
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,790
I didn't expect

435
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,590
I would die with you in the end.

436
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,090
You came as promised.

437
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,730
Thank you.

438
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,600
Please.

439
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,790
These buyers don't seem to know each other.

440
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,840
It must be for safety reasons.

441
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,450
The four buyers were contacted separately.

442
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,910
After we go in,

443
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,850
find Wang Kunwu and Yuan Mo first.

444
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,170
Everyone,

445
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,430
the highest bidder will get the goods.

446
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,950
For the same bid,

447
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,020
the one who bids the most overall will get it.

448
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,350
Please check the goods.

449
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,080
My baby!

450
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,500
Let go of my baby!

451
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,440
Or you can buy me too.

452
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,760
Don't separate us.

453
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Scram!

454
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,780
Son! Son!

455
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,790
Please let go of my son!

456
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,030
Let go of my son!

457
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,940
Father!

458
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,840
Father! Father!

459
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,740
You want to die?

460
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
Father!

461
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,750
Wait.

462
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,700
Father!

463
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,920
This child looks quite smart.

464
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,470
My master happens to need a personal servant.

465
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,460
You all want it?

466
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,250
Good.

467
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,120
The highest bidder gets it.

468
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,310
I offer 500 wens.

469
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,250
800 wens.

470
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
1,000 wens.

471
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,690
I offer 100 strings.

472
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,930
Did I hear it right?

473
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,830
100 strings for one person?

474
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,440
Of course not.

475
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,030
What's the point of all this bidding?

476
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm tired.

477
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,510
I want all of them.

478
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,980
Your offer seems

479
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,760
to be against the rules.

480
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,330
You just said

481
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,420
the highest bidder gets it.

482
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,170
You are so rich and generous.

483
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,930
What business are you in?

484
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,210
My master manages maritime trade on Bulu River.

485
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,560
Since it's an upright business,

486
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,600
why did you come here to privately buy slaves?

487
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,920
Because of the many shoals on Bulu River,

488
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
the ships can't pass.

489
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,850
Only by purchasing a large number of slaves to pull the ships ashore

490
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,990
can we ensure the trade routes are smooth.

491
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,900
You should know

492
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,630
these are not all I want.

493
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,870
In the future,

494
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,420
we have big deals to do.

495
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,200
So you're a big buyer.

496
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Sorry for the inhospitality.

497
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,110
I have a batch of top-tier goods.

498
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,030
Are you interested?

499
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,440
You have more goods?

500
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,310
Naturally, treasures aren't easily revealed to others.

501
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,440
Please come with me.

502
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,240
Watch these slaves.

503
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes.

504
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,840
Red Lotus Society members are cunning.

505
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,910
Young Master An didn't even wear his armor

506
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,830
or bring any detoxifying weapons.

507
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,000
If something happens to him,

508
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,130
what should we do?

509
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,700
If he's all suited up, won't it be obvious he's looking for trouble?

510
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,030
It'll be more dangerous if he's searched.

511
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,770
He should've brought me along.

512
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,170
How can he do it alone...

513
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,630
Is Ah Shu not with him?

514
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,850
Can you stop buzzing?

515
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,990
Ms. Yuchi.

516
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,850
Hasn't my young master been treating you well?

517
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,910
How are you not worried about him?

518
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,470
Would I be here if I weren't?

519
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,310
I've been the legal advisor for so many years.

520
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,230
As long as everything

521
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,460
goes according to our plan,

522
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,700
they'll be safe.

523
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,930
I've known Retainer An for over 20 years.

524
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,930
I'm impressed by him just this time.

525
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,880
I'll wait for another hour.

526
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,390
If there's still no movement,

527
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,920
I'll charge in and destroy this shabby place!

528
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,340
I'll lend you the whip.

529
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,180
Charge in now.

530
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,950
Go.

531
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,170
Here.

532
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,580
What do you mean?

533
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,120
You can only enter alone here.

534
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,180
This is my servant.

535
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,540
Rules are rules.

536
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,230
Wait for me here.

537
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,350
Since you're doing business on Bulu River,

538
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,610
you must be from Yanle.

539
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,670
Yanle people aren't good at sailing ships.

540
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,350
What does Bulu River have to do with them?

541
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm from Xiyuan.

542
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,400
There is a saying in Xiyuan.

543
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,020
Jade-colored pine mushrooms are the most expensive...

544
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,950
And the yellow-colored chicken fat are better.

545
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,170
Aren't you taking me to see the top-tier goods?

546
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,690
What you want to see... are your buddies, right?

547
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,850
Ah Shu!

548
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,260
Ah Shu, run!

549
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,700
Run!

550
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,230
An Xiuyi?

551
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,540
Why are you here?

552
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,670
Who else could it be?

553
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,480
Great.

554
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,220
One of you can't move.

555
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,270
The other has walked into the trap.

556
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,960
To think the three talents of Sifang Pavilion

557
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,210
would be gathered in my villa's prison today.

558
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,720
You knew who I was?

559
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,500
My master is omniscient and omnipotent.

560
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,380
He already knew

561
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,470
everything about you.

562
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,840
Who is your master?

563
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,150
The Faceless is behind Red Lotus Society.

564
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,170
His master is the Man in White.

565
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,920
Man in White?

566
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,560
Then Ah Shu...

567
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,850
Ah Shu?

568
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,430
My girl came with you?

569
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,490
Where is she?

570
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,020
Don't worry. She can't escape.

571
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,630
You'll meet Red Lotus Immortal

572
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,970
together soon.

573
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,890
Bastard!

574
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,130
Where's my Ah Shu?

575
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:17,930
After her!

576
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,130
The plan failed.

577
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,110
Soldiers, listen up!

578
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,880
-Yes!
-Yes!

579
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,980
Follow me to attack the villa!

580
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,700
-Yes!
-Yes!

581
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:39,910
Report!

582
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,390
Master.

583
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,560
A large number of soldiers

584
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,850
are charging toward the villa.

585
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,280
Order everyone to retreat immediately.

586
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,810
Take these two who can move.

587
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,210
With them as hostages,

588
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,310
we're fine even if the soldiers barge in.

589
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,370
What are you doing?

590
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,120
I'm not going! Wang Kunwu!

591
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,480
Why are you keeping Wang Kunwu?

592
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,020
Wang Kunwu!

593
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,350
-Hurry up!
-Wang Kunwu!

594
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,900
Wang Kunwu!

595
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,100
-Save us! Save us!
-Save us! Save us!

596
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,420
Don't be afraid.

597
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm here to save you.

598
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,490
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

599
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,830
Spare no one!

600
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,110
Kill them all!

601
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,220
Follow me!

602
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,210
-Run!
-Run!

603
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,460
Get in!

604
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,640
Get in, everyone!

605
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,200
How dare you run?

606
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,160
Attack!

607
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,170
Close the door.

608
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,700
Why is it silent?

609
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,360
What is this?

610
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,680
What is this?

611
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,030
Oh no. It's tung oil.

612
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,550
They want to burn us to death!

613
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,270
What should we do?

614
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,150
Do something!

615
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,710
They want to burn us to death!

616
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,040
We'll be burnt to death!

617
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,430
Put out the fire!

618
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,440
It's useless to keep this loser.

619
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,050
Qing, send him off.

620
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,490
What are you afraid of?

621
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,890
Useless!

622
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,890
You weren't poisoned!

623
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Wang, this way.

624
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,520
Lead the way.

625
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,140
Yuan Mo.

626
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,000
-Wang Kunwu?
-Wang Kunwu?

627
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,710
Tell them to release them.

628
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,510
Release them!

629
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,510
Give me the cane.

630
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,720
You can move now?

631
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,130
You weren't poisoned?

632
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,390
Let them open the door.

633
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,430
Open the door!

634
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,430
Open the door now!

635
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,710
Wang.

636
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,630
I know where the refugees are.

637
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,340
Lead the way.

638
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,900
-This way.
-Let’s go.

639
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,250
Stop!

640
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,500
Drop your weapons!

641
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,219
Hurry!

642
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Drop them!

643
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,080
Arrest him!

644
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,880
Where's Ah Shu?

645
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,840
Ah Shu?

646
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,739
Ah Shu!

647
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,590
Ah Shu!

648
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,040
Ah Shu!

649
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,760
Ah Shu!

650
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,830
Yuan Mo!

651
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,280
Ah Shu!

652
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,390
Yuan Mo!

653
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,690
I'm inside!

654
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,440
Ah Shu...

655
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,700
Ah Shu!

656
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,710
Come help!

657
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,580
Young Master, you're injured.

658
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,110
Let me bandage it for you.

659
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,890
It's just a minor injury.

660
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,840
I'll do it myself.

661
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,970
I need to register the refugees later.

662
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,910
I'll do it. Go over there.

663
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:17,620
Okay.

664
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,050
What's your name?

665
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,230
After registering your name and birthplace,

666
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,960
you may go to the nursing home in the east of the city to rest.

667
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,070
There are food, drinks, and physicians there.

668
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,270
After that...

669
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,520
What should we do after that?

670
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,750
We need to support our families.

671
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,390
Don't worry.

672
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,990
Sifang Pavilion will discuss countermeasures

673
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,580
to help everyone resettle.

674
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

675
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,910
Okay, register yourselves.

676
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,590
Thank you.

677
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,050
-Ms. Ah Shu!
-Ms. Ah Shu!

678
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,360
Listen to me.

679
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,750
I used to be a refugee.

680
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,980
But now I’m living well in Changle.

681
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,000
So please believe

682
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,400
Yong will be accountable to you.

683
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,390
How is it?

684
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,710
I think they passed out

685
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,640
because they inhaled too much ash.

686
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,940
We'll send them to the hospital right away.

687
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,540
A few with more serious symptoms

688
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,400
have been sent there by carriage.

689
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay.

690
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,530
Remember to register them after they wake up.

691
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,120
Yes.

692
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,460
Wait.

693
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,320
It's Black Wind Powder.

694
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,190
Chen Xinliang.

695
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,570
Hua! Go to the woodshed now!

696
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,770
The carriage transporting the injured!

697
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,690
Hurry! Stop him!

698
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,220
Let's go!

699
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,640
According to orders,

700
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,500
all vehicles will be stopped for inspection today.

701
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,830
-Be careful!
-Be careful!

702
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,440
Move!

703
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,950
Move!

704
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,230
Come out!

705
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,950
Wang Kunwu!

706
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,260
Watch out!

707
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,420
Black Wind Powder!

708
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
Don't act rashly.

709
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,670
Those in the carriage are poisoned with Black Wind Powder.

710
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,900
Just a little more

711
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,520
and even God can't save them.

712
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,480
Drop your weapons and ask them to make way!

713
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,010
Do you want to die with me?

714
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,010
Even if you escape, you have nowhere to go!

715
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,330
The Man in White won't let you off!

716
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,740
You're right.

717
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,390
Man in White...

718
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,000
But I'll never go back with you.

719
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,390
Die!

720
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,650
Your first murder?

721
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,400
My father taught me how to use a knife when I was young.

722
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,640
But it's my first time doing it.

723
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,420
I was wrong.

724
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,720
Chen Xinliang wanted to hurt those refugees.

725
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,540
I was too impatient and acted rashly.

726
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,150
What about before that?

727
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,270
Why were you in that carriage?

728
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,630
Chen Xinliang hurt you.

729
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,620
I was so angry

730
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,640
I wanted to teach him a lesson.

731
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,040
When I went to the area he was being detained,

732
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,880
I saw him sneaking out.

733
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,470
I didn't have time to call for help,

734
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,150
so I rubbed ash on my face

735
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,740
and lied in that carriage.

736
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,470
Ridiculous!

737
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,810
Do you know how dangerous that is?

738
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,650
I'm not afraid.

739
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,310
I just wanted to avenge you!

740
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,300
Does your wound still hurt?

741
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,720
Wipe your face.

742
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,930
Don't take risks alone again.

743
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,290
Do you hear me?

744
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,600
Susu.

745
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,000
So unexpected.

746
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,310
Chen Xinliang committed countless evil deeds.

747
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,110
He should've ended up like this.

748
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,670
Unfortunately,

749
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,190
we didn't get to

750
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,520
ask about the Man in White's whereabouts.

751
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,870
But we really can't blame her.

752
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,970
In that situation...

753
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,150
But birds must leave their traces when they fly by.

754
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,690
I'll ask Xiao'e later

755
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,370
and see if she knows...

756
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,280
Why does Yuchi Hua snore when she's sleeping?

757
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,060
Don't wake my Ah Shu up.

758
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:02,800
Alright.

759
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,640
She's tired.

760
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,460
Let her sleep.

761
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,660
Why do you care about her?

762
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,710
Don't you

763
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,200
dislike each other?

764
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,010
I disliked you before too.

765
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,780
As if you like me now.

766
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,110
But you know what?

767
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,850
You've really learned well from me.

768
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,160
You didn't even blink when you lied.

769
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,850
How did you think of pretending to be poisoned?

770
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,180
Even I was deceived.

771
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,400
I never believed in

772
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,030
supernatural powers or gods.

773
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,750
Someone must have

774
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,790
entered the Magic Vase to trigger its mechanism in advance.

775
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,070
So when I was examining the Magic Vase,

776
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,110
I held my breath

777
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,350
and didn't inhale the Black Wind Powder.

778
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,030
Fine. fine, you're great.

779
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,020
Why didn't you get away before

780
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,510
being sent to the villa?

781
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,730
You'd been chosen by Red Lotus Society.

782
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,530
I was afraid they might harm you.

783
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,690
You...

784
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,770
For m-me?

785
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,420
Because of my impulsiveness,

786
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,200
I once got my buddies killed.

787
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,310
I can't make the same mistake again.

788
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:19,790
Fine.

789
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,660
I owe you this time.

790
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,670
Wang Kunwu.

791
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,470
What did you mean by that?

792
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,630
I...

793
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,810
Am I your buddy now?

794
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,360
We're just colleagues.
