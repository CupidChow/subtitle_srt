[Episode 11]

4
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,800
According to the files,

5
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,460
your parents died in a desert storm

6
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,940
on their way back from their mission to Yanle.

7
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,259
But curiously,

8
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,210
it happened during the time of military mutiny in Yanle,

9
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,240
when Long Tuqi helped the new king ascend the throne.

10
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,700
What are you trying to say?

11
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,600
Your parents' deaths may not be an accident.

12
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,400
Besides, Deputy Envoy Kang is a trusted aide of Long Tuqi.

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,460
There's a good chance he knows what happened back then.

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,980
I've lost interest in this answer

15
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,790
many years ago.

16
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,600
Running away from it won't solve the problem.

17
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,060
The twinge will always be there,

18
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,290
making you toss and turn in agony.

19
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,950
I know how you got through

20
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,210

Don't be so full of yourself.

23

I'm not you.

24
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,670
You won't understand me.

Father.

27
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,790
Father, I really don't understand.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,060
Please teach me...

It's me.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,480
Are you okay?

37
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,870
You had a nightmare.

38
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,310
You kept calling Father just now.

39
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,670
I'm okay.

40
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,560
Go to sleep.

41
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,010
Is the reason why you don't want to teach me Go

42
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,600
that you don't want to think of your father?

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,630
Actually, it's a good thing that

44
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,899
you remember what your father looks like, right?

45
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,090
At least you've met your parents,

46
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,140
and you could dream of them.

47
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,510
I don't even know

48
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,970
what my parents look like.

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,940

Please.

We'll just listen. We won't get in your way.

81
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,120
It'll just be the three of us. No one else.

No, no, no.

99
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,040
This is utterly unacceptable.

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,830
It won't matter that we eavesdrop a little.

101
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,560
That's right. It won't matter.

Vice Minister An.

105
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,250
This is how we drink it in Yanle.

106
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,170
But unfortunately, Young Master Long won't be able to drink it anymore.

107
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,710
The state of Yong is deeply sorry for Young Master Long's death.

108
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,960
For the sake of the friendship between Yong and Yanle,

109
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,630
Yong is willing to make compensations

110
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,120
as our consolation to Viceroy Long's grief.

111
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,210
No amount of compensation

112
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,179
can bring back Young Master Long's life.

113
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,080
But it can bring back tea, silk and porcelain,

114
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,400
which the people of Yanle have been yearning for.

115
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,470
Deputy Envoy Kang, you came here for the barter between the two countries.

116
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,630
Besides, the past grudges

117
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,190
have been written off by you, Deputy Envoy Kang.

118
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,810
I believe the following negotiation

119
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,020
will go smoothly.

120
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,470
I hope so.

121
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,920
I have something important to discuss with Deputy Envoy Kang next.

122
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,850
Mr. Yu.

123
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,430
Yes.

124
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,950
Take everyone aside

125
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,270
so that we can have a discussion in detail.

126
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,870
Yes.

127
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,790
Please, Deputy Envoy Kang.

128
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,960
After the pleasantries,

129
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
things are about to get real, right?

130
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,510
Vice Minister An said he'd make compensations to Yanle.

131
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,440
Does that mean he'll concede?

132
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
Yanle is a desert land,

133
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,150
and the people there have a nomadic way of life.

134
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,580
They purchase a large amount of tea and grain

135
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,340
from Yong every year.

136
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,790
This year, there's been a bumper crop of tea,

137
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,270
and the price is already low.

138
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,480
Vice Minister An will deliberately

139
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,220
provide Yanle with

140
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,950
lower tea taxes and prices, I suppose.

141
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,720
But the grain and warhorses

142
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,390
are the tough nut to crack later in the negotiation.

143
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:48,910
That's right.

144
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,380
Do you still want to eavesdrop or not?

145
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:50,810
Okay.

146
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,400
Be quiet if you want to.

147
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,240
Okay.

148
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,990
Be quiet.

149
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,070
The tea shipped to Yanle this year

150
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,450
will be free of all taxes.

151
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,670
In addition, we can reduce the price by another 10%.

152
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,540
10%?

153
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,640
Yanle's Viceroy's son died such a miserable death in Changle.

154
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,770
Is this your so-called compensation?

155
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,990
The past is in the past.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
It's not appropriate

157
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,910
to keep talking about it, don't you think?

158
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,150
The point is that you aren't showing any sincerity.

159
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,630
But you're the one who didn't show your sincerity in the first place.

160
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,500
Last year, Yanle sold us 3,000 warhorses.

161
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,930
Why do you only offer us 2000 warhorses

162
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,780
for the same price this year?

163
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:28,910
Don't think that

164
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,120
Yong can only buy warhorses from Yanle.

165
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,920
Yuluo's merchants are always on call.

166
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,560
Then go buy from Yuluo's merchants.

167
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,440
The jade of Yuluo State is unmatched indeed.

168
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,000
But when it comes to warhorses,

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,120
theirs are a far cry from ours.

170
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,140
I didn't expect that

171
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,590
the people of Yong State would have such a bad taste.

172
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
We may as well drop the negotiation.

173
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,590
Yanle has tens of thousands of warhorses.

174
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,790
Do you have enough forage for them for the winter?

175
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,310
If you don't sell them to Yong,

176
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,360
you'll have to solicit grain from the people forcibly.

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,970
Aren't you afraid of causing a riot?

178
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,460
Who do you think you are

179
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,710
to openly discuss our state's important matter?

180
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,380
Forget it.

181
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,080
As you wish.

182
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,440
I...

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,190
Since we are already here,

184
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,820
we should try to be sincere to each other.

185
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,850
How about this?

186
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,490
Let's each take a step back.

187
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
What do you think?

188
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Mr. Yu.

189
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
A 10% discount on tea is my limit.

190
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,550
I'm your senior. I'll make the call.

191
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,790
That won't do, Mr. Yu.

192
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,980
We've already helped them lower the price.

193
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,530
Xiuyi, can't you calm down?

194
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,230
I can't calm down. We'll lose money if we lower the price any further.

195
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,740
Sit down.

196
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,210
Mr. Yu.

197
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,900
Sit down!

198
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Retainer An is young and impulsive.

199
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,800
Please forgive him for disturbing you.

200
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,710
As for the price of tea,

201
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,340
I'll ask the imperial court

202
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,100
for another 10% discount.

203
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,610
Another 10% discount?

204
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,740
In that case,

205
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,910
we can also give you more discount on warhorses.

206
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
But it can't be lower than this.

207
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,670
Okay.

208
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,830
We'll take this price.

209
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,350
Plus the forage of this amount.

210
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,910
Hey.

211
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,230
How much?

212
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,170
How should you take this down?

213
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,960
This is the minimum amount of forage.

214
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,270
Otherwise, I won't be able to report to Deputy Envoy Kang.

215
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
Then the level of warhorses must be raised.

216
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,780
Don't push your luck.

217
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,800
If you disagree,

218
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,860
don't even think about getting any grain from us.

219
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,550
The discount on tea will be cancelled as well.

220
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,190
I...

221
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,250
This is also for the benefit of your country.

222
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,480
Winter is coming in Yanle.

223
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,770
Please think twice for your country.

224
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,570
Fine.

225
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,210
We can agree on

226
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,630
the numbers.

227
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,150
But we have a small request.

228
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,670
Yanle and Yong State are separated by thousands of miles of sand.

229
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,350
We need an oasis

230
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,150
as our resting place.

231
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,550
We request

232
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,710
this oasis

233
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,630
as the place for us to trade horses.

234
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,800
[Yueying]

235
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,740
If it's for the convenience of horse trading,

236
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,440
I think...

237
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,970
How about this?

238
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,840
It's almost lunch time.

239
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,550
Why don't we take a rest?

240
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,580
We also need to ask our seniors for their permission.

241
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,750
Yong is such a big state,

242
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,370
yet you still have to ask for your seniors' permission for such a trivial matter?

243
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,850
If you can't even agree to this,

244
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,700
we won't give you any extra warhorses.

245
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,790
Since the number of warhorses has been agreed on,

246
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,810
the negotiation should be considered a success, right?

247
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,580
Probably.

248
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,060
But what's with the oasis?

249
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,910
Have you checked the geo- and hydro-logical conditions of the oasis?

250
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,950
Yes, repeatedly.

251
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,880
That oasis is small.

252
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,150
It can only be used to provide water for horses.

253
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,270
There should be no conspiracy in this.

254
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,530
[Friends from Afar]

255
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,400
We need to be more careful.

256
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,240
Send people to visit the envoys from different countries near the oasis

257
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,540
and inquire information of the oasis in detail.

258
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,510
This year, the weather in various regions across Yanle has been abnormal,

259
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,780
and there's a severe crop failure.

260
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,560
Maybe it's because the disaster is serious

261
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,020
that they had to reach an agreement with us as soon as possible.

262
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,590
What do you think?

263
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,640
I think Xiuyi was born to do this.

264
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,860
I mean,

265
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,670
we played "good cop, bad cop" in the negotiation

266
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,190
and coordinated very well.

267
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,190
It's possible that

268
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,350
the envoys of Yanle just know when to stop

269
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,150
and want to rush to sign the deal.

270
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,790
There must be something strange about things going wrong.

271
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,790
Vice Minister An.

272
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,320
Deputy Envoy Kang.

273
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,700
I just received an urgent order from Viceroy Long,

274
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,550
asking me to return to Yanle immediately.

275
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,410
The warhorse trade is very important.

276
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,710
How about we sign the agreement as soon as possible?

277
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,170
We may not see each other again any time soon.

278
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,670
We're more than happy to sign the contract as soon as possible.

279
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,900
But I believe you've all had a long day.

280
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,970
In order to do the honors,

281
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,230
we'll hold a banquet tonight to send you off, Mr. Kang.

282
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,190
How about we sign the contract

283
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,790
before you depart tomorrow?

284
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,990
Why do you have to dilly-dally?

285
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,420
But...

286
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,640
Fine.

287
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,290
I'm going back to Yanle Hall to rest then.

288
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,950
At first, I was only 50% suspicious.

289
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,590
But since they kept urging me, now it's been increased to 70%.

290
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,190
Lord Yanle is bedridden.

291
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,870
Long Tuqi is a warrior,

292
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,070
yet he has to manage court affairs now.

293
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,270
He needs assistance from his trusted Deputy Envoy Kang.

294
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,780
It's not surprising that he was urgently summoned back to Yanle.

295
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,660
Xiuyi, you are young indeed.

296
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,310
The barter between the two countries is surely important,

297
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,970
but the more anxious they are,

298
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,589
the more we can't let them lead our pace.

299
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,109
Yes. Right.

300
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
[West Court]

301
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,190
Everyone.

302
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,310
We've asked all over the West Market.

303
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,510
They all said it's just an ordinary oasis.

304
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,850
I just came back from visiting my father.

305
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,100
My father and Mr. Huang have been guarding the border for years.

306
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,910
They've dealt with quite a lot of people from Yanle.

307
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,550
They didn't see anything fishy about this.

308
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,290
Shen and I asked

309
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,750
the foreign merchants who have been to the oasis,

310
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,830
and they all said there's no problem.

311
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,830
Is it possible that we overthought?

312
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,520
Here, have some sugar cake.

313
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,670
Think while eating.

314
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,830
I just bought it in the West Market. It's still warm.

315
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,910
Every time I eat something sweet,

316
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,570
I come up with some good ideas.

317
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,270
Here, Sis.

318
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,310
Tell me.

319
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,910
Who understands what the people of Yanle think the best?

320
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,840
What do you mean?

321
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,390
As the saying goes,

322
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,180
the enemy of an enemy is a friend.

323
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,830
Then Yanle has countless enemies.

324
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,150
The nearby states, Yuluo and Yueying,

325
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,670
both hate Yanle's guts.

326
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,350
That's good.

327
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,240
We can go and ask the envoys of these countries.

328
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,710
But the banquet is about to begin.

329
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,840
Time is running out.

330
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,180
An.

331
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,720
The map isn't changing.

332
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,070
You can't see anything that's not on it no matter how closely you look.

333
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,470
I've checked carefully.

334
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,100
That oasis is small and shallow.

335
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,230
There are several bigger and better water sources around.

336
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,540
Yanle wouldn't have chosen such a place

337
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,870
if they were up to something.

338
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,870
Not necessarily.

339
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,550
What do you West Court have in mind?

340
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,580
Foreign affairs are too important to be taken lightly.

341
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,260
Please hold off their request in the banquet,

342
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,270
Vice Minister An.

343
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,360
Give us some more time.

344
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,190
Can you afford it

345
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,980
if you delay the negotiation between the two countries?

346
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,750
Retainer An.

347
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,750
Aren't you known for your capability?

348
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,610
It shouldn't be difficult for you

349
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,010
to stall it for a short while in the banquet, Retainer An, right?

350
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,550
This is a banquet between two states.

351
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,710
Do you think it’s like

352
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,580
the West Court's parties in the backyard of Sifang Pavilion?

353
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,390
Retainer An.

354
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,090
Let me remind you.

355
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,670
This national negotiation is led by the East Court.

356
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,600
The West Court is helping you get rid of the hidden danger.

357
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,150
If there's really something wrong with it

358
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,110
and you let it go,

359
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,510
you should know what the consequences will be.

360
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,870
You...

361
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,760
All right. Enough.

362
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,240
Calm down, you two.

363
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,870
It's all for our country.

364
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,390
How can you talk like this in front of...

365
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,390
Tell me the truth.

366
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,550
Did you find anything new?

367
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,390
Not yet.

368
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,430
It’s not as simple as it seems.

369
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,760
Please give the West Court two more hours.

370
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,430
I believe you.

371
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,630
Go now.

372
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,710
[Friends from Afar]

373
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,430
This banquet is specially held for the envoy delegation of Yanle.

374
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,070
Are you refusing to give us the honor of having you, Deputy Envoy Kang?

375
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,070
Vice Minister An.

376
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,940
Viceroy Long sent another urgent order,

377
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,800
asking us to go back immediately.

378
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,300
Besides, Young Master Long just died.

379
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,950
We're not in the mood to enjoy feasting.

380
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,510
Then the barter agreement between the two countries

381
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,510
can also be held off until next year.

382
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,140
Deputy Envoy Kang.

383
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,070
Yong and Yanle are thousands of miles away from each other.

384
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,940
No matter how urgent it is, you can still have a meal with us.

385
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,930
Please don't fail our sincerity

386
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,620
to Yanle's envoy delegation.

387
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,190
All right, all right.

388
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,750
We'll sign the contract right after the banquet.

389
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,420
Now you can have a seat at ease, right, Deputy Envoy Kang?

390
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,870
Please sit.

391
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,030
Come on.

392
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,910
Everyone, long time no see.

393
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,790
-Please.
-Come on.

394
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,590
Come on.

395
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,400
Here.

396
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,450
[Deputy Envoy of Yueying]

397
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,390
To be honest,

398
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
since I started working at Sifang Pavilion,

399
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,820
I've never had a good drink

400
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,710
since I had to negotiate with the people of Yanle.

401
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,650
[Deputy Envoy of Yuluo]

402
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,710
Ms. Yuchi,

403
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,340
you were also there during the negotiation with Yanle?

404
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,140
Of course.

405
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,190
All these years,

406
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,070
Yueying has suffered a lot because of them.

407
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,530
The people of Yanle have always been greedy.

408
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,430
I wonder what kind of unreasonable request

409
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,830
[Deputy Envoy of Xiyuan]

410
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,230
they proposed to Yong this time.

411
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,990
Don't worry. The people of Yanle

412
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,110
dare not be presumptuous when negotiating with Yong.

413
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,590
They behaved very well this time.

414
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,340
They've agreed to most of the terms,

415
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,600
and their request isn't too much either.

416
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,240
What request is it?

417
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,380
They just want a small oasis.

418
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,690
Vice Minister An.

419
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,350
There's a poem in Yong State which goes,

420
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,430
although today's banquet is great,

421
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,890
it'll still come to an end.

422
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,900
I can't drink anymore.

423
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,460
I think we should call it a day.

424
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,230
The night is still young.

425
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,670
Why are you in such a hurry, Deputy Envoy Kang?

426
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,670
Vice Minister An.

427
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,670
I can't disobey the order of Viceroy Long.

428
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,300
I think we should sign it as soon as possible...

429
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,360
Deputy Envoy Kang.

430
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,490
Before you depart,

431
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,610
I have a small wish.

432
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,590
Go ahead.

433
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,420
I've long heard that Deputy Envoy Kang is the Go Master of Yanle State,

434
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,310
and you haven't had any rival in years.

435
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,790
Yong is the birthplace of Go.

436
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,480
I know a little about Go too.

437
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,920
I wonder if I may have the honor

438
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,270
to have a game of Go with you, Deputy Envoy Kang.

439
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,860
I've heard a lot about Deputy Envoy Kang's Go skills, too.

440
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,510
I've been longing

441
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,590
to learn a few tricks from you.

442
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,590
Vice Minister An.

443
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,620
You either sign the agreement,

444
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,820
or let me depart for the journey.

445
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,510
Why do we have to play Go at this kind of time?

446
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,100
Retainer An.

447
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,930
It's indeed hasty of you to propose it

448
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,190
in front of so many people.

449
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,690
Haven't you heard?

450
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,200
The only game that Deputy Envoy Kang lost in his life

451
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,520
was when he competed with

452
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,450
the late Sifang Envoy, Yuan Hanjing.

453
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,520
Is that true?

454
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,950
Pardon me.

455
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,670
Vice Minister An.

456
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,140
It's understandable that Deputy Envoy Kang

457
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,080
doesn't want to play Go in the state of Yong.

458
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
After all, if he loses another game,

459
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,470
the title of Go Master will be...

460
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,830
I see.

461
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,250
Then I won't force you.

462
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,400
Just drink up your wine, everyone.

463
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,800
How ridiculous!

464
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,980
Bring it on.

465
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,850
How could Yong State look down upon Yanle like that?

466
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,730
Deputy Envoy Kang.

467
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,160
I...

468
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,470
Fine.

469
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,670
But I never play meaningless games.

470
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,130
If Yong State wins,

471
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,780
we can give you another 10% discount on horses

472
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,180
in the barter agreement.

473
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
But if I win,

474
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,170
Yong State must lower the tea price by another 10%.

475
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
What do you think?

476
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Vice Minister An.

477
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,710
What do you say? You don't dare?

478
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,940
Servants.

479
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,710
Set up the Go borad.

480
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,600
Deputy Envoy Kang.

481
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,630
Please enlighten me.

482
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,360
Retainer An.

483
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,950
Please.

484
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,880
Left 7, up 3.

485
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,900
Left 3, down 6.

486
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,190
Although Xiuyi is young and impulsive,

487
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,250
-Right 7, up 3.
-he listens.

488
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,870
He knows Kang Yunhai is a Go fanatic,

489
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,230
so he came up with this idea to buy time.

490
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,970
That's a brilliant idea.

491
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,180
Although it's a good idea,

492
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,620
Yuan Mo and the others still have to be fast.

493
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,910
With his skills, Xiuyi won't last long.

494
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,200
Left 9, up 3.

495
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,230
Right 3, up 3.

496
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,680
Right 2, up 5.

497
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,710
The other two deputy envoys couldn't hold their liquor.

498
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,770
I've asked someone to send them back.

499
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,300
When the deputy envoy of Yuluo heard about the oasis,

500
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,430
he was so frightened that he even spilled his wine.

501
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,430
There must be something wrong here.

502
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,150
Yanle and Yuluo are both neighbours and sworn enemies.

503
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,850
As long as it's beneficial to Yanle,

504
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,560
Yuluo won't be happy to see it.

505
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,750
Ah Shu.

506
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,700
Ms. Yuchi.

507
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,220
I'm too drunk.

508
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,400
I have to leave.

509
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,930
You...

510
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,390
We have a few questions for you.

511
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,390
Tell us the truth.

512
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,190
What's with the oasis?

513
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,210
How would I know

514
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,750
about Yanle's affairs?

515
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,870
If you don't tell the truth,

516
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,820
the oasis will soon be Yanle's.

517
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,590
If Yanle grows bigger,

518
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,190
it'll be a disaster to Yuluo.

519
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,990
As a citizen of Yuluo,

520
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,630
are you just going to

521
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,030
watch this happen?

522
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,990
Left 3, down 5.

523
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,200
Right 4, up 3.

524
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,340
Right 5, up 4.

525
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,740
Right 5, up 3.

526
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,160
Right 6, up 4.

527
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,160
Right 6, up 3.

528
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,240
An Xiuyi is so bad at Go.

529
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,300
He's about to lose.

530
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,830
Then why are you still standing here?

531
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,670
Hurry up and help him.

532
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,330
You're good at Go, aren't you?

533
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,110
How many times have I told you?

534
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,040
I haven't played Go for a long time.

535
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,430
Yuchi and the others went to see Director Bai.

536
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,070
We have to buy her more time.

537
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,110
I'll go.

538
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,220
You?

539
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,460
Are you crazy?

540
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,790
You aren't even familiar with the Go board.

541
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,830
Teach me then.

542
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,390
I...

543
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,350
Don't you think it's too late?

544
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,880
If what that person from Yuluo said is true,

545
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,150
are we just going to watch Long Tuqi get what he wants?

546
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,710
Right 4, up 8.

547
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,750
Right 3, down 6.

548
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,230
Left 8, down 4.

549
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,410
So hesitant.

550
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,610
The playstyle of the young generation of Yong

551
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,070
is really eye-opening.

552
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,670
Retainer An.

553
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,150
The outcome of this game seems to be obvious.

554
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,680
Even if you delay it any longer, it won't help.

555
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,550
Why don't we end it here?

556
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,520
An Xiuyi.

557
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,870
You haven't lost yet.

558
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,790
Don't panic.

559
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,440
Don't hesitate.

560
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,990
Make a move upper left.

561
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,990
A true gentleman should keep silent while watching a game.

562
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,870
I'm a crumb,

563
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,420
not a gentleman.

564
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Vice Minister An.

565
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,160
Please throw this person out.

566
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,670
No need.

567
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,990
I'd like to see

568
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,270
what she has up her sleeve.

569
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,230
Young lady.

570
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,850
Why don't you take his place and play?

571
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,530
Please.

572
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,100
Great move.

573
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,920
Nice.

574
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,750
This is a great move.

575
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,900
I didn't expect that after so many years,

576
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,830
I could see the game Yuan Hanjing created back then again.

577
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,950
Young lady.

578
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,220
Do you know Hanjing?

579
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,110
I don't.

580
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,260
But this...

581
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,750
I'm not the one who made the move either.

582
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,760
It was him who taught me.

583
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,690
He taught you?

584
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,310
I didn't expect that.

585
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,060
What are you looking at? I'm talking about you.

586
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,660
Yuan Mo!

587
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,630
Who is this?

588
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,280
I didn't expect that

589
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,790
you would recognize my father's game, Deputy Envoy Kang.

590
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,180
It's really you.

591
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,980
Back then, I was obsessed with Go

592
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,190
and played with your father many times.

593
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,530
Although we're of different status,

594
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,330
he's still an old friend of mine in the game of Go.

595
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,400
Since you're the son of my old friend,

596
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
I have something that

597
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,090
I'm sure you'd like to see.

598
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,910
Yuan Mo.

599
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,510
This is the Go board carved by your father himself.

600
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,040
I heard it was a birthday gift for his son.

601
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,640
There're words engraved under the board.

602
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,470
God bless my son.

603
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,750
Don't startle the gods and ghosts.

604
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,750
Father.

605
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,670
I'm done.

606
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,270
You're going on a mission tomorrow.

607
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,070
I'm not in the mood of playing anymore.

608
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,300
We promise you, Son.

609
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,890
We'll be back on your birthday next year.

610
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,400
Your father will

611
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,900
carve a jade Go board and a set of jade Go pieces for you

612
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,500
as your birthday gift, okay?

613
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,070
I'd never lie to you, Son.

614
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,080
Pinky swear.

615
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,600
Pinky swear.

616
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,110
Pinky swear.

617
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,200
Why do you have my father's things?

618
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,720
It was an unclaimed object that

619
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,440
Yanle's Dragon Cavalry found in the desert.

620
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,530
Now I'm its owner.

621
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,440
Yanle always honors the strong.

622
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,300
If you want this,

623
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,930
you have to beat me in a game of Go.

624
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,520
Give it to me.

625
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:08,920
You...

626
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,070
Give it to me!

627
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,640
Please.

628
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,150
Hanjing passed away many years ago.

629
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,030
I've always been upset

630
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,560
that I lost to him back then.

631
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,630
I didn't expect that I'd have a chance

632
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,990
to redeem myself today.

633
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,190
Please.

634
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:19,860
Yuan Mo.

635
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,210
Don't get distracted.

636
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,770
Think about what your father taught you.

637
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,080
Don't think of anything else

638
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,600
on the Go board.

639
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,030
You need to know how to find a way out of an impasse.

640
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,870
How could this be?

641
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,330
How is that possible?

642
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,850
My father used to tell me

643
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,030
only by fully concentrating on the game of Go

644
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,170
can I find a way out of an impasse.

645
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,410
I didn't understand it, and I couldn't do it.

646
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,440
I didn't understand until now that

647
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,900
only by forgetting about the result

648
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,210
and enjoying playing the game

649
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,670
can I

650
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,620
turn impossible

651
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,600
into possible on such a small Go board.

652
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,430
I lost.

653
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,470
This is bad.

654
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,830
Deputy Envoy Kang.

655
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,150
You win some, you lose some.

656
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,790
You still deserve the title of Go Master

657
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,310
in the state of Yanle.

658
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,590
In that case,

659
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,270
I'll claim the Go board.

660
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,710
Of course.

661
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,610
Not only the Go board is yours,

662
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,070
but we'll also lower the price of warhorses by another 10%.

663
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,190
Vice Minister An.

664
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,840
Since I've played the game of Go

665
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,550
and agreed to all your terms,

666
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,870
don't you think it's time to take the agreement out?

667
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,190
Let's sign the agreement immediately.

668
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,010
We need to hurry back to Yanle.

669
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,380
[Friends from Afar]

670
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Vice Minister An.

671
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,270
Please.

672
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,020
Hold on.

673
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,310
Vice Minister An.

674
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,590
There's something wrong with this agreement.

675
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,350
How dare you, a retainer, talk nonsense here?

676
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,710
Director Bai of Literature Hall is here.

677
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,840
He has something important to report.

678
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,070
Vice Minister An, Deputy Envoy Kang.

679
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,310
Greetings.

680
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,110
Ministry of Rites is a place for two states to negotiate important affairs.

681
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,110
Vice Minister An.

682
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,640
Isn't Director Bai at the wrong place?

683
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,300
I'm just a pedantic scholar.

684
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,670
I do know nothing about foreign affairs.

685
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,670
I heard that Yanle

686
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,740
is obsessed with a humble oasis in the desert.

687
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,350
I looked through history books,

688
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,830
and I want to verify it with Deputy Envoy Kang in person.

689
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,890
Yanle and Yuluo have always been neighbours.

690
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,920
Yanle is more powerful,

691
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,930
but since Yuluo is in control of

692
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,990
the biggest oasis on the trade route,

693
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,210
Yanle hasn't been able to do anything to Yuluo.

694
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,150
However, one month ago,

695
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,370
a major event

696
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,860
that's about to change the fate of the two states happened.

697
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,270
The Bulu River of Yuluo State which flows through Yanle and Yuluo

698
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,030
flooded this summer.

699
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,030
A rare river diversion happened.

700
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,430
What's that about?

701
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,670
Director Bai.

702
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,100
I was just guessing.

703
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,560
I don't know if it's right.

704
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,310
But is it possible that

705
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,230
after the river diversion,

706
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,230
the oasis that Yanle asks for

707
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,270
will become the biggest water source

708
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,730
in the desert.

709
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,810
Therefore, they'll be in full control of

710
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,310
the chokepoint of the 10-thousand-mile trade route.

711
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,440
Exactly.

712
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,660
Whoever controls the water source in the desert

713
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,400
will have dominance over the trade route.

714
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,190
Yanle wants Yong

715
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,510
to acknowledge the ownership of the oasis.

716
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,440
By then, all countries will surely attack Yong.

717
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,030
This will force Yong

718
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,310
to fight against all countries.

719
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,980
You're framing Yanle.

720
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,150
Director Bai is a great scholar of the time

721
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,390
and is respected by the people.

722
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,720
How dare you accuse him?

723
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,110
The key of friendship between two countries is sincerity.

724
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,650
It's really disappointing that

725
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,430
your country has been scheming like this.

726
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,830
Yanle has done everything we could

727
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,830
in the negotiation with Yong.

728
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,870
The oasis is originally a no man's land which is shared by many countries.

729
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,230
Who dares to have objection?

730
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,150
Whoever has any objection will have to fight Yanle.

731
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,070
Fight us!

732
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,070
Come on, let's fight!

733
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,310
Bring it on!

734
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,610
If you threaten to start a war,

735
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,510
it will only bring misery to the people of all states.

736
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,310
That's right.

737
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,620
How about our state, Yong, take the lead

738
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,820
to gather all nations

739
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,510
to discuss it?

740
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,490
There's no room for discussion.

741
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,150
Alright.

742
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,980
I didn't expect Yanle to have such an attitude.

743
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,330
Then, as far as I'm concerned,

744
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,810
the barter between the two countries should be put on hold.

745
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,080
Advisor Ma.

746
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,140
How dare you!

747
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Vice Minister An.

748
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,490
Looks like your state misunderstood us.

749
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,230
Yanle didn't know about the Bulu River diversion

750
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,240
that Director Bai just mentioned.

751
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,700
How can the two states give up barter

752
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,530
just because of some misunderstanding?

753
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,840
Isn't that so, Vice Minister An?

754
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,100
The barter between the two states is very important.

755
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,890
There's no need to hurry.

756
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,020
I suggest Deputy Envoy Kang

757
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,150
travel day and night to get back to Yanle

758
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,190
and ask for Viceroy Long's order.

759
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,430
This way, you can give Yong a satisfactory answer.

760
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,260
[Yanle Hall]

761
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,760
Yuan Mo from Sifang Pavilion is here.

762
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,230
What? You want to play another game with me?

763
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,310
I was ordered to bring the new barter agreement

764
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,840
here for you to have a look, Deputy Envoy Kang.

765
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,790
You may leave now.

766
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,430
I, Yuan Mo,

767
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,540
have something else that I want to ask you, Deputy Envoy Kang.

768
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,590
Let me guess.

769
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,470
Is it related to your parents?
