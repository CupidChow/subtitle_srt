00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,350
What's your name?

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,070
Where are you going?

9
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,630
To Yanle.

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,940
Wang Qiang.

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,820
I didn’t expect Retainer Wang to be serious.

12
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,300
Who gave him the courage to go against the East Court?

13
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,940
Exactly.

14
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,860
He also asked us to go through the foreign merchants' records

15
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,700
from the past three months.

16
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,550
Whoever slacks off will get fired.

17
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,910
If I could do that, I wouldn't stay in the West Court.

18
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,510
We are so busy

19
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,870
and we still have to help the East Court find a cat.

21

00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:39,700
What are you doing?

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,540
You scared me.

42
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,910
This is the seaweed mud Madam Yu gave me.

59
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
Let me guess.

60
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,910
Is it the case of the missing military crossbows?

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,470
The numbers don't match up?

62
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,270
Exactly.

63
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,329
I caught the criminal myself back then.

64
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,500
Yes.

65
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,370
This case isn't difficult to investigate.

66
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,670
But first,

67
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,910
I need you two to do me a favor.

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,000

75
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,440
That's not easy.

76
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,910
It's not easy to investigate the case either.

They're undocumented.

82
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,930
This is a bit troublesome.

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,390
Besides, only Wang has the official seal.

91
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,790
Let's see who finds the clue first.

92
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,980
Last time, I caught Kudel before you.

93
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,190
It's too risky.

94
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,110
I won't do it with you.

95
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,260
It's just a small bet.

96
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,670
Don't be nervous.

97
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,310
I have a maid, right?

98
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,590
She just wants an official identity.

104
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,150
I went to the wrong place.

105
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,450

109
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,820
You scared me.

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,800
Why are you here

111
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,510
in the middle of the night instead of working on my case?

112
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm working on your case.

113
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,080
I've talked to Wang from Sifang Pavilion.

114
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,790
Whether you can become a citizen of Yong

115
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,430
depends on whether I can

116
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,960
find clues for the armory case.

117
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,890
The armory case?

118
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,010
What does this place have to do with the armory case?

119
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,030
Come, let me show you something.

[Imperial City]

121
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,230
What are these circles?

122
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,730
This is a map of Changle City's housing price zoning map

123
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,650
that Ji made with years of effort.

124
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,000
See?

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,330
The ring closest to the Imperial City is the most expensive.

126
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,990
Look, this is the palace,

127
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,390
Imperial City, inner city, outer city,

128
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,670
and so on.

129
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,830
For example,

130
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,760
if you rent a house in the outer city,

131
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,460
it'll cost 50 copper coins.

132
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,550
It'll cost 100 in the inner city

133
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,420
and 1,000 in the Imperial City.

134
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,670
What does this red dot mean?

135
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,310
These red dots are the places

136
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,909
Kudel's group used to stay.

137
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,710
It seems they are not very rich.

138
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,090
But how are you sure it's here?

139
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,670
Didn't you steal Kudel's travel pass that day?

140
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,460
But he still entered the city.

141
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,070
The most likely place

142
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,510
is the underground sewer of Changle City.

143
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,960
Considering the same price and location,

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,330
plus the fact that it's close to the sewer,

145
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,150
the scope is narrowed down to here.

146
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,230
And look.

147
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,970
The table is clean.

148
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,310
There's still water left in the teapot.

149
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,440
They left in a hurry.

150
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,190
There's also a hearth in the yard.

151
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,030
Maybe they even dried clothes here.

152
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,030
That makes sense.

153
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,190
But what's the use of finding it now?

154
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,270
Obviously, there's nothing here.

155
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,870
Not necessarily.

156
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,730
Look.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,659
It looks like a map of Changle.

158
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,370
Can you recognize this place?

159
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,370
I’ve been well read since I was a kid.

160
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,030
The map of Changle City

161
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,690
has been ingrained in my mind.

162
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,370
But this is too fragmented to recognize.

164
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,270
Is that all?

165
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,570
All his things are here.

166
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,309
I was looking for someone from Sifang Pavilion.

167
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,240
Come search the foreign merchants with me tomorrow.

168
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Give it back to me.

169
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,390
This is the Jingzhao Prefecture.

170
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,990
We should see the evidence first.

171
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,880
The Sifang Pavilion

172
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
has the right to assist in this case's investigation.

173
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,570
Let's look at it together.

[West of the city]

175
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,950
This is the military crossbows' transport route

176
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,480

179
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,800
Is the other batch in Qingsong County?

180
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,650
I'll inform the magistrate of Jingzhao.

181
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,590
There are signs of people living here.

182
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,770
There are containers.

183
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,010
There's wine too.

184
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,960
This must also be where those bandits stayed.

185

187
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,590
Yes.

188
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,810
I'm home. You can leave now.

189
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,050
Was your house

190
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,630
broken into?

191
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,760
Where's my big map of Changle City?

192
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,950
Is it this one?

193
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,710
No.

194
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,230
Why are you still here?

195
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,940
I have to supervise you.

196
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,740
Supervise me?

197
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,110
I've been working all night for your legal status,

198
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,470
but you still don't believe me.

199
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,510
Who knows if you'll go

200
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,460
pleasure yourself again after I leave?

201
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,380
I won’t let you leave my sight

202
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,360
until I get Changle household registration.

203
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,990
You're not going to live here, right?

204
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,190
Do you think I want to live in this messy place?

205
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,390
You've spent all my money and I don't have household registration.

206
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,750
Where can I go?

207
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,120
Sleep on the street?

208
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,440
That's not what I meant.

209
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,720
What I meant was

210
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,690
it's inconvenient for us

211
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,810
to live together as a man and woman.

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,950
How about...

213
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,050
From shallow to deep,

214
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,950
from tickle powder to a fatal powder,

215
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,750
do you want to try them one by one?

216
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,830
I have thousands of other ways

217
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,630
to give you a missable death.

218
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,110
Look at you.

219
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,070
It's a "miserable" death.

220
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,750
Enough.

221
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,630
Put it away.

222
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,110
If you don't mind, you can stay, alright?

223
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,030
I don't care.

224
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,340
Suit yourself.

225
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,470
Hurry and find the clues.

226
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,440
I'll leave as soon as I get the household registration.

227
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,100
Be careful.

228
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,540
What is this?

229
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,470
I broke a bowl the other day.

230
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,870
I didn't have time to clean it up.

231
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,870
Did you get hurt?

232
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,630
There's only one bed?

233
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,500
You're a guest.

234
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,490
You can have it.

235
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,710
I haven't slept well for a long time.

236
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,070
What now?

237
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,490
Do you sleep while hugging a rock?

238
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,190
This is a treasure.

239
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,900
It's a top-grade Duanxi amethyst inkstone.

240
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,820
I've had it for a long time.

241
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,060
Don't break it.

242
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,070
What other traps are there in your room?

243
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,870
Nothing else.

244
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,470
Can you do it or not?

245
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,790
How long has it been?

246
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,230
How can I sleep with the light on?

247
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,910
Don't block the light.

248
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,710
Don't move it.

249
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,870
I'm almost done with the first piece.

250
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,790
Wait.

251
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,300
This is a leather map.

252
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,790
So what?

253
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,870
Look.

254
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,390
We like to make maps with leather,

255
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,080
because if it's not easy to piece it together from the front,

256
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,510
the texture on the back can provide clues.

257
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,460
You're really good at bragging.

258
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,860
I haven't figured out the front

259
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,910
and you're talking about the texture on the back?

260
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,140
Go away.

261
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,510
Don't disturb me.

262
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,510
Try it if you don't believe me.

263
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,830
I'm working on it.

264
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,630
Let me help you.

265
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,470
No, no, no.

266
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,990
Turn it over and look.

267
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,990
Come on. You do it.

268
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,110
Do it.

269
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,920
Look at the texture.

270
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,220
See?

271
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,150
I told you—

272
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,360
Impressive, Ah Shu.

273
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,220
Turn it over.

274
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,060
Turn it over.

[Sifang Pavilion]

276
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,510
Wang Kunwu,

277
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,200
are you out of your mind?

278
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,150
You want me to stop the Jingzhao Prefecture?

279
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,190
Didn't I tell you?

280
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,690
Cooperate. Cooperate!

281
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,380
The Sifang Pavilion only has the right to assist.

282
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,930
We shouldn't overstep boundaries.

283
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,630
The Jingzhao Prefecture sent too many men

284
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,500
to Qingsong County to find this batch of military crossbows.

285
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,420
I suspect it's the bandits' trick to lure them away.

286
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,620
Do you have evidence?

287
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,480
Kudel frequented Changle City for three months.

288
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,470
He should have figured everything out already.

289
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,950
Why did he still have such a detailed map

290
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,630
on him?

291
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,220
Is he directionally challenged?

292
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,270
He hid it in the hidden layer of his boots too.

293
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,240
Obviously, he left us a clue.

294
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,540
These are just your guesses.

295
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,310
I'm just the leader of the Sifang Pavilion.

296
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,110
How dare I tell the Jingzhao Prefecture what to do?

297
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,910
The Jingzhao Prefecture said it's in Qingsong County,

298
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,870
so it's in Qingsong County.

299
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,520
It's not in Qingsong County.

300
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,660
The bandits' real target is Nanshan.

301
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,550
This is a fragment of a map

302
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,450
found where the bandits stayed last.

303
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,110
The rest were burned to ashes.

304
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,220
This is too fragmented.

305
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,990
You can still find clues in it.

306
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:43,970
Look.

307
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,270
The bandits burned this map.

308
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,880
This proves that their target

309
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,840
is Nanshan.

310
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,380
Let's think about it.

311
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,680
These bandits

312
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,030
sent a large number of military crossbows to Nanshan.

313
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,030
Kudel also made a commotion

314
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,260
to attract our attention elsewhere.

315
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,390
Why?

316
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,670
Nanshan?

317
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,400
I think I heard of it somewhere.

318
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,190
Right.

319
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,420
Tan Lin, assistant minister of the Ministry of Personnel,

320
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,390
is going to Nanshan to inspect public sentiment.

321
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,310
You mean

322
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,470
their real target might be Tan Lin?

323
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,359
It’s very possible.

324
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,670
He was ordered to lead the creation of the Anping Law.

325
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,119
It's what the people often call the "new law."

326
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,840
In the past three months,

327
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,590
Tan Lin has been kept in the palace by His Majesty

328
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,390
to discuss the final matters

329
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,190
before publishing the Anping Law.

330
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,350
So...

331
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,730
So those bandits

332
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,210
couldn't find the chance to assassinate him

333
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,930
until this trip to Nanshan.

334
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,190
If the assistant minister of the Ministry of Personnel is assassinated,

335
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,510
it will lead to chaos.

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,890
asks Assistant Minister Tan to return home.

375
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,900
[Tan Lin, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Personnel]

376
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,390
Return?

377
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,850
Why?

378
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,230
I'm afraid some bandits want to harm you.

379
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,270
How do you know?

380
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,760
You must have heard about

381
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,220
the missing armory case.

382
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,680
Someone deliberately set things up

383
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,160
to transfer the Jingzhao Prefecture's soldiers to Qingsong County,

384
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,360
But the real target is you.

385
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,380
Assistant Minister Tan!

386
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,780
Assistant Minister Tan!

387
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,950
Assistant Minister Tan.

388
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,500
Alright.

389
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,310
I know your intention.

390
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,180
One year ago, the people suffered a flood.

391
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,970
I was ordered to go to Nanshan today

392
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,530
to observe the people's situation after the disaster.

393
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,480
Whether the officials try their best to save them

394
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,070
concerns the people's livelihood.

395
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,690
How can I ignore the people

396
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,890
because of some petty things?

397
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,680
Wait.

398
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,910
This...

399
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,870
Wait.

400
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,310
I have a plan

401
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,310
that can both protect you

402
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,150
and trap the bandits.

403
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,430
Mr. Tan is here!

404
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,150
Mr. Tan is here.

405
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,670
Mr. Tan.

406
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,160
Mr. Tan is here.

407
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,910
Kunwu.

408
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,970
Must we do this?

409
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,360
What did I do

410
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,240
for you to come up with such a bad idea to harm me?

411
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,410
Mr. Yu,

412
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,190
you're risking your life for a higher official.

413
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,470
You'll be promoted soon.

414
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,030
I don't want to be promoted.

415
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,430
I want to retire safely.

416
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,710
At this rate, I'm going to lose my head soon.

417
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,310
It's too late to back out now.

418
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,950
Here.

419
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,610
Put on your armor.

420
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,060
This can save my life, right?

421
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,700
Nope.

422
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,910
I want to get off.

423
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,070
But I can save you.

424
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,600
What can you do?

425
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,950
I know you.

426
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,800
Don't worry.

427
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,750
No.

428
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,910
Hey.

429
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,950
Folks,

430
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,100
Assistant Minister Tan from the capital

431
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,790
is here to visit Nanshan.

432
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,920
Please welcome him!

433
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,770
Assistant Minister Tan,

434
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,470
come out.

435
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,230
Close the curtains first. I...

436
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,310
Come out.

437
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,180
Villagers, welcome him.

438
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,390
Yu?

439
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,870
Wang Kunwu is taking risks.

440
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,230
Welcome.

441
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,260
Let's welcome Assistant Minister Tan.

442
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,980
Assistant Minister Tan, this way.

443
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,010
My knees are a little weak.

444
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,430
Protect Mr. Tan!

445
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,790
Protect Mr. Tan!

446
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,710
Step back!

447
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,390
Oh no.

448
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,850
Protect Assistant Minister Tan!

449
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,830
Mr. Yu,

450
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,140
why are you here?

451
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,150
Let's go.

452
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,100
Catch the assassin!

453
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,150
You're welcome.

454
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,030
For what?

455
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,110
Even if you brought reinforcements,

456
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,230
things aren't any better.

457
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,600
You—

458
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,310
Assistant Minister Tan?

459
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,950
Assistant Minister Tan,

460
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,230
come here!

461
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,270
I'll protect you.

462
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,110
Wait.

463
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,350
He's an assassin. Don't trust him.

464
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,820
Be careful, Ah Shu!

465
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,150
Ah Shu!

466
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,730
Are you okay, Ah Shu?

467
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,200
-I’m fine.
-How are you?

468
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,030
Let me see.

469
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,690
Be careful!

470
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,110
Be gentle.

471
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,040
Are you okay?

472
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,120
Are you badly hurt?

473
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,930
He's asking you.

474
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,790
I survived today.

475
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,070
Thank you all.

476
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,040
Assistant Minister Tan.

477
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,840
I'm glad you're fine.

478
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,990
It's the duty of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

479
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,670
Assistant Minister Tan, don't stand on ceremony.

480
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,570
I need to investigate the identity of the assassins.

481
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,290
Excuse me.

482
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,550
Go ahead.

483
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,430
Who is this?

484
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,110
Yuan Mo.

485
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,450
This young man is Yuan Mo.

486
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,710
He was the one

487
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,120
who guessed the real target of these bandits was you.

488
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,880
As the saying goes, heroes are young.

489
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,990
Thank you very much.

490
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,990
I'll leave first.

491
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,070
I will report what happened today to His Majesty.

492
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,030
Goodbye.

493
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,190
Goodbye.

494
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,790
Take care.

495
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,790
These assassins were from Yanle.

496
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,050
Did you find anything?

497
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,230
I also found this.

498
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,550
The assassins all wore this tooth badge

499
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,140
and this strange pattern.

500
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:35,850
Excuse me.

501
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:36,590
No.

502
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,250
Wang Kunwu, give it back to me!

503
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,210
Wang Kunwu!

504
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,230
-You two!
-Stop, Wang Kunwu!

505
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,830
The evidence should be mine.

506
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,750
Mr. Yu!

507
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,720
What kind of people do you have at Sifang Pavilion?

508
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,390
Wang Kunwu, you're outrageous!

509
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,090
That's right.

510
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,000
I...

511
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,710
I'll ask him to apologize to you later

512
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,750
and return the evidence to you.

513
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,710
I was in so much danger just now.

514
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,670
I almost died.

515
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,070
Thank you.

516
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,550
Mr. Yu,

517
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,480
your life was very safe.

518
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,630
As soon as the fighting started,

519
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,750
you went to hide under the carriage

520
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,710
and played dead.

521
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,310
No, you...

522
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,950
Why must you humiliate me like this?

523
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,260
Why did I have to hide?

524
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,160
That's because

525
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,550
you called my name

526
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,410
and almost ruined the whole plan.

527
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,150
It's my fault,

528
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,850
but if you hadn't changed your plan last-minute,

529
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,980
how could I have made the mistake

530
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,020
of alerting them?

531
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,110
Please stop.

532
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,390
I'll check

533
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,300
if there is more important evidence.

534
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,560
They tried so hard to assassinate Assistant Minister Tan.

535
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,410
Who are these assassins?

536
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,470
I heard that they are all from Yanle.

537
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,750
So what?

538
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,630
This is Changle, the capital of Yong.

539
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,240
No matter where they're from,

540
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,440
they won't be allowed to cause trouble.

541
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,090
Your maid's name is Ah Shu, right?

542
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,260
You were very brave in the restaurant.

543
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,360
How about I redeem you

544
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,640
and you work for me now?

545
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
Stop working for Yuan Mo.

546
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,150
Really?

547
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,550
Can I?

548
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,740
No, no, no.

549
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,340
Hold on.

550
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:13,910
Come on.

551
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,730
Her father is Duke Er,

552
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,190
one of the highest officials,

553
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,920
understand?

554
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,280
You'll be exposed sooner or later.

555
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,710
If you get caught,

556
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,870
both of us will be in trouble.

557
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,530
What are you murmuring about?

558
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,710
I told her that being chosen by you

559
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,350
is because of her good karma.

560
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,850
How about it, Ah Shu?

561
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,370
My father taught me to keep my word.

562
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,630
I have a contract with my master.

563
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,360
I can't work for you, Ms. Yuchi.

564
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,390
You keep your word.

565
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,160
I like you more and more.

566
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,310
Hurry up and thank her.

567
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,270
Thank you.

568
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,910
Look.

569
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,300
This is freshly cooked porridge.

570
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,070
Here.

571
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,880
Drink it while it's hot.

572
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,030
I'll put it here.

573
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,070
Just drink it yourself.

574
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,990
Wait, come here.

575
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,270
Hurry up.

576
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,490
That's inappropriate.

577
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,220
I can't reach it. Give me a hand.

578
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,460
Hurry up.

579
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,270
Pour it.

580
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,750
Pour it. What are you waiting for?

581
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,230
Are you afraid of looking at me or the wound?

582
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,110
If it's the former, there's no need.

583
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,100
If it's the latter, I'll do it myself.

584
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,750
I...

585
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,550
I'm afraid it'll hurt.

586
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,340
It won't hurt.

587
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,190
Pour it.

588
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,760
Okay.

589
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,200
Does it hurt?

590
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,830
Don't waste it.

591
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,110
It's hard to make this medicine.

592
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,550
Got it.

593
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,920
Well...

594
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,100
Your clothes are in the way.

595
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,820
Go to sleep.

596
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,610
What are you waiting for? Go to sleep.

597
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,430
Yang Li.

598
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,160
Come on.

599
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,590
Jin.

600
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,920
This liquor

601
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,990
is much spicier than your old lover.

602
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,990
Cheers.

603
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,630
Cheers.

604
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,550
Come on. Drink.

605
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,110
Here.

606
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,840
A good drink.

607
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,760
I must accomplish something in Wuzhou this time

608
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,670
before returning to Changle.

609
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,230
Bravo.

610
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,830
Bravo.

611
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,030
Jin,

612
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,500
try mine.

613
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,390
I hope when we get to Wuzhou,

614
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,640
we can still drink happily

615
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,030
like now.

616
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,120
-Of course.
-Okay.

617
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,790
Yes!

618
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's make achievements together

619
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,450
and return home in glory!

620
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,230
Don't worry, brothers.

621
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,140
I will avenge you.

622
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,429
You are...

623
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,960
I'm your maid.

624
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,949
I should do what a maid should do.

625
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,199
I was just kidding.

626
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,389
Look at this.

627
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,710
I was kidding too.

628
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,750
I can't stand your pigsty anymore.

629
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,910
Since I'm living here,

630
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,230
things have to be according to my wishes.

631
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,760
I helped you throw away

632
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,270
all of your useless junk.

633
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,110
Throw—

634
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,900
How is it? Isn't it clean?

635
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,990
You threw it all away?

636
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,250
I left nothing behind.

637
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,310
Let me ask you.

638
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,550
Where's my wine?

639
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,670
Let me ask you too.

640
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,060
It's been three days. Where's my stuff?

641
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,070
I'm working on it for you.

642
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,350
We made a great contribution.

643
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,070
Getting you a piece of paper

644
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,750
will be a piece of cake.

645
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,150
Do you see this wedge?

646
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,670
If you keep delaying it,

647
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,190
saying I'm your maid,

648
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,180
and keep talking nonsense...

649
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,110
Okay, okay.

650
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,470
I won't do it again.

651
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,230
I won't do it again.

652
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,070
Ah Shu, please tell me

653
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,670
if you threw away my wine or not.

654
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,270
Those are the good wine I've kept for years.

655
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,990
Xinfeng, Lao Chun, Wuyunjiang...

656
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,190
I didn't know the wine is expensive.

657
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,070
Yes, that's my lifeline.

658
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,870
It depends on your performance.

659
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,630
Okay.

660
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,510
I'm on it.

661
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,950
The door is this way.

662
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,320
I need to put my shoes on.

663
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,400
[Sifang Pavilion]

664
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,310
Sir,

665
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,470
Wang Kunwu and the others got the military crossbows back

666
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,840
and saved Assistant Minister Tan,

667
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,150
but Sifang Pavilion deals with external matters.

668
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,990
The most important thing is our relationship with the envoys of all nations.

669
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,260
No one can compare to you in this.

670
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,630
Retainer An, Ms. Lin.

671
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,950
I found the cat you asked me to find.

672
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,510
Send it over since you found it.

673
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,550
Why do you need us for such a small matter?

674
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,150
Fine.

675
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:29,970
Wait.

676
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,930
I remember the cat that Mr. Wen lost

677
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,050
was black all over.

678
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,760
Only its four paws were white.

679
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,670
This is not the right one.

680
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,910
Ji,

681
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,150
who are you trying to fool

682
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,550
by buying a random black cat?

683
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,880
It's been over a month. Where can I find it?

684
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,030
How about I buy a more similar one?

685
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,150
Buy another one?

686
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,550
Is this how the West Court

687
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,510
plans to deal with the envoy of Xiyuan like this?

688
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,910
Is finding a cat a trivial matter?

689
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,750
It concerns the relationship between two parties.

690
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,610
Do you losers of West Court understand?

691
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,140
Mr. Wen, envoy of Xiyuan,

692
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,000
has already returned home.

693
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,180
Looking for a cat will affect bilateral relations?

694
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,630
Who are you trying to scare?

695
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,240
Everyone knows how to order people around.

696
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,600
Ji is familiar with all the streets in Changle City

697
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,090
and helped Yuan Mo find the last place the bandits stayed.

698
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,550
Can the East Court do that?

699
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,590
Ji,

700
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,440
I'm your superior.

701
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,270
From now on, don't work so hard

702
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,550
on trivial matters

703
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,310
ordered by trivial people.

704
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,750
Yes.

705
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,390
Who are you calling trivial?

706
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,270
Wang.

707
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,550
Don't be smug.

708
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,320
Where's my tooth badge?

709
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,630
This is evidence.

710
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,030
Even if I have to hand it over,

711
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,070
I can't give it to you.

712
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,150
Give it back to me, you hear me?

713
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,710
Why are you arguing at the door now?

714
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,040
Don't you need to be on duty?

715
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,510
What evidence? Let me see.

716
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,030
Leave it to me.

717
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,660
Xiuyi, go ahead.

718
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,420
Mr. Yu.

719
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,710
Enough.

720
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,750
Susu, let's go.

721
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,740
Retainer Wang,

722
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,480
come here.

723
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,140
Do you recognize this tooth badge?

724
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,130
This is the identity tooth badge of The Faceless.

725
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,360
I haven't seen this

726
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,270
in person in many years.

727
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,690
How much do you know

728
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,760
about The Faceless?

729
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,820
They're an assassin organization hidden in the desert.

730
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,140
They've been here for decades,

731
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,470
causing chaos to the surrounding states.

732
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,640
Why didn't the other states join forces to eliminate The Faceless?

733
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,000
Yong has always had this plan.

734
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,680
Other than Yanle,

735
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,640
the other states also want to eliminate this danger.

736
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,040
Assistant Minister Tan was the one who pushed for it.

737
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,440
This is the real reason why Assistant Minister Tan was targeted.

738
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,890
Why would Yanle oppose it?

739
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,750
Sit.

740
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,460
Look.

741
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,470
Yanle has always been attacking the others.

742
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,610
Why?

743
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,650
Because they want to dominate the desert.

744
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,840
In recent years,

745
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,550
several important figures of the desert states have been assassinated.

746
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,050
Many people have died tragically.

747
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,640
Yanle reached an agreement

748
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,310
with The Faceless long ago.

749
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,050
Are we going to allow The Faceless to expand?

750
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,510
Kunwu,

751
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,750
many things are not as simple as you think.

752
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,940
I've seen your resume in the army.

753
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,470
I know your past.

754
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,470
Here's my advice.

755
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,540
Bear it and wait for the right time.

756
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,100
Guys.

757
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,990
Come here.

758
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,550
Come on.

759
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,480
Come here.

760
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,370
Take it.

761
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,390
Let me tell you a piece of great news.

762
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,000
An Xiuyi was defeated by Retainer Wang today.

763
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,520
From now on,

764
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,870
we don’t need to follow the East Court's orders anymore.

765
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,260
Great.

766
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,340
Good news.

767
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,630
Retainer Wang seems to be something.

768
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,660
He saved Assistant Minister Tan and went against the East Court.

769
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,320
Feels good.

770
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,610
Yes, it feels good.

771
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
But it's useless.

772
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,630
We need to get a raise.

773
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,620
Yes.

774
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Do you think Retainer Wang will have a future?

775
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,850
Will we have a bright future if we follow him?

776
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,140
He's just a soldier.

777
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,720
He has a limited future.

778
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,470
Talking about me?

779
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,260
Get to work.

780
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,070
Retainer Wang.

781
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,870
Kunwu!

782
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,430
My life is over!

783
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,790
What are you yelling about? Speak properly.

784
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,270
Hey,

785
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,270
when will our bet be fulfilled?

786
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,320
You don't know how my maid...

787
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,710
Anyway, if you don't fulfill it, I'm afraid my wine...

788
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,270
she will...

789
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,550
Alright, I got it.

790
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,250
It's just a registration.

791
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,010
I've done it for you.

792
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,870
You've done it?

793
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,990
That's great, Kunwu.

794
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,550
You're so credible.

795
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,830
You really saved me.

796
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,380
[Household Registration Contract]

797
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,750
What is this?

798
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,870
A household registration contract.

799
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,230
Not registering foreign maids

800
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,420
is against the new law.

801
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,590
From today onwards,

802
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Ah Shu will officially be your maid.

803
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,120
You're welcome.

804
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,650
I, Wang Kunwu, always keep my word.

805
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,070
Kunwu, you got it wrong.

806
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,390
You got it wrong.

807
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,750
I want Ah Shu to have

808
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,910
the official status of someone from Yong.

809
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,020
Are you kidding me?

810
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,100
Ah Shu is a foreigner.

811
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,000
If she wants to become a Yong citizen,

812
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,790
she must personally register her origin information

813
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,930
and verify her identity.

814
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,810
The verification will take ages.

815
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,330
It's not that simple.

816
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,160
I can't do it.

817
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,590
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

818
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,150
You didn't make it clear.

819
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,500
How did I not?

820
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,950
I said an official identity.

821
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,590
How is this not official?

822
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,390
She's a servant.

823
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:37,790
I...

824
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,100
Stop it.

825
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,430
I'm on duty now.

826
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,190
Get out!

827
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,870
You...

828
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,090
I...

829
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,950
You really killed me.

830
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,380
I...

831
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,410
[Ministry of Rites]

832
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,320
The assassination attempt of Tan Lin

833
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,210
was really done by The Faceless?

834
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,500
The tooth badge can't be faked.

835
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,440
I'm afraid

836
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,480
the Yanle are behind this too.

837
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,170
Tan Lin's political views

838
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,430
are exactly the same as Hanjing's from before.

839
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,830
It's been 16 years

840
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,470
and we still haven't found

841
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,100
Hanjing's remains,

842
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,430
while those criminals are still at large.

843
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,990
Back then, the three of us

844
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,670
studied under the same teacher.

845
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,570
You can judge the situation

846
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,610
and worked your way to the Ministry of Rites.

847
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,790
Yuan

848
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,830
was the most knowledgeable

849
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,720
and became the youngest Sifang Envoy of Yong.

850
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,950
He had friendly relations with all the desert states

851
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,320
and made great achievements.

852
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,480
Who would have thought

853
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,790
he would never come back?

854
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,260
Back then, Yanle had a mutiny.

855
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,060
[Sifang Envoy of Yong, Yuan Hanjing]

856
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,280
Hanjing and his wife went missing.

857
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,210
We both know

858
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,670
someone used The Faceless to kill them,

859
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,710
but the court could only declare that

860
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,010
they died in a desert storm.

861
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,120
It's not fair.

862
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,370
The Sifang Envoy of Yong

863
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,170
can't die in vain.

864
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,090
Yu,

865
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,350
you have always been polished and refined.

866
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,430
For the greater good and for Yong,

867
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,490
it had to be like this.

868
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,470
How is Yuan Mo recently?

869
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,210
I heard he contributed greatly to keep Tan Lin safe.

870
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,910
That brat.

871
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,780
He's smart,

872
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,950
but he's as stubborn as Hanjing

873
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,500
was before.

874
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,280
I pity this child.

875
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,020
At such a young age,

876
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,730
he became an orphan.

877
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:14,910
Well...

878
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,440
I'm going to retire in six months.

879
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,150
I have a wish before that.

880
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,000
Tell me.

881
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,040
Let Yuan Mo join Sifang Pavilion.
