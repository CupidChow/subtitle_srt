00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,759
What's wrong with Mr. Yu?

6
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,490
I don't know.

7
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,150
Why the long face?

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,810
Mr. Yu.

9
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,320
Let me talk...

10
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,610
Where... Where is East Court?

11
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,450
I guess they are too ashamed to come.

12
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,050
Exactly.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,390
They're the ones who assisted us this time.

14
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,470
We deserve all the credit.

15
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,550
-Yes.
-That's right.

16
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,380
-Don't we?
-Exactly.

17
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,310
Those people...

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,470
Yu.

19
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,110
We, the West Court, have done a great job in finding out the real culprit.

20
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,390
Why are you unhappy

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,870
and are even frowning?

22
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,310
Am I?

23
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,430
Aren't you?

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,310
Mr. Yu, are you blaming us for

25
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,990
neglecting other duties

26
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,870
as we worked on this case?

27
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,420
No, no, no.

28
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,220
This time, you guys

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,690
stayed united as one West Court

30
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,400
to solve the case together.

31
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,680
I've seen and remembered

32
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,750
everything you've done.

33
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,810
Then why do you still look so down?

34
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,150
That's because you guys

35
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,350
investigated the case too thoroughly.

36
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,020
I...

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,140
What's wrong with being thorough?

38
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,580
You don't understand.

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,590
It's great for Jingzhao Prefecture.

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,150
But it's not necessarily so

41
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,590
for Sifang Pavilion.

42
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,670
So the murderer was Mu Yikuan.

43
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,150
He is from Yanle.

44
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,630
That could be considered infighting.

45
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,150
Now, the murderer has become

46
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,110
Mu Yikuan's maid, Hongye.

47
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,420
Hongye is a native of Yong.

48
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,520
Yanle's delegation has come to express their condemnation.

49
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,040
They are almost at the gate of Changle City.

50
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,740
Even Long Tuqi is personally here?

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,520
He has to guard Yanle, so he wouldn't dare to come out so easily.

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,160
But our visitors indeed bear ill-intentions.

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,910
I heard the leader

54
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,210
is called Kang Yunhai, a trusted minister of Long Tuqi.

55
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,630
This man

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,030
knows Yong better than the people of Yong.

57
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,270
He's very scheming.

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,870
This time,

59
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,630
not only do we have to appease the people from Yanle,

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,430
but we also cannot bring shame to Yong.

61
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,470
You tell me.

62
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,890
Isn't this difficult?

63
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,270
This is so weird.

64
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,750
Didn't he already lose his disc?

65
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,080
What's going on?

66
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,740
Yuan Mo.

67
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,510
Come here.

68
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,350
What's wrong?

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,830
It makes no sense.

70
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,960
He lost his place but won in the end.

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,890
It's better to lose one disc than to lose the game.

72
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,310
It's more important to take the lead

73
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,570
than worry about the number of pieces in a game of Go.

74
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,180
It's like fighting.

75
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,470
It's okay to get punched first.

76
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,190
As long as I sprinkle the powdered drug at the critical moment

77
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,800
and it'll kill him, right?

78
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,830
Yeah, that's the idea.

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,700
You're amazing.

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,810
Teach me your ways.

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
No, I can't.

82
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,390
Please teach me.

83
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,450
I haven't played Go for years.

84
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,670
I can't teach you.

85
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,440
Why not?

86
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:08,980
I...

87
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,270
I can't teach you anyway.

88
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,590
Based on what I've just seen,

89
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,150
you're pretty good for someone playing according to the game records.

90
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,950
I can tell that you're talented.

91
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,340
Keep it up.

92
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,200
I don't believe you.

93
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,380
Yu told me

94
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,110
Yanle's delegation is coming.

95
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,670
Aren't you from Yanle?

96
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,970
Aren't you going to welcome them?

97
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,730
Welcome?

98
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,350
That's right.

99
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,780
I'll use my death-inducing powder to welcome them.

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,830
You hate them a lot, huh?

101
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,090
I don't just hate them.

102
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,790
I hate them with a passion.

103
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,270
I haven't had a home since I was born.

104
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,230
I had nothing.

105
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,030
It's all because of Long Tuqi

106
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,270
and his greedy claws.

107
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,710
People like him are high and mighty.

108
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,670
They eat, wear and use the best.

109
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,860
He had no regard for the lives of the people

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,770
and made us homeless.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,940
You’re in Changle now.

112
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,200
You won’t be homeless anymore.

113
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,860
You still have me.

114
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,460
Uh...

115
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,240
Don't say I didn't warn you.

116
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,590
The son of Long Tuqi died in Changle.

117
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,350
When the delegation of Yanle arrives,

118
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,150
I'm sure they'll come after you.

119
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,750
You need to be prepared.

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,990
Don't worry. I'm here.

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
It'll be okay.

122
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,090
You want to transfer Yuan Mo away?

123
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,760
Yes.

124
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,070
I have a more important task for him.

125
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,510
What could be more important than receiving the delegation?

126
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,070
Recently, the foreign merchants in the West Market commented that

127
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,710
someone smuggled refugees into Changle.

128
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,790
I have to send Yuan Mo

129
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,510
to go to the city gates and check it out.

130
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,480
He has discerning eyes.

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,890
He's perfect for this task.

132
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,490
You get me?

133
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,590
Mr. Yu.

134
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,150
Can't you send someone else to

135
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,530
investigate the matter of smuggling refugees?

136
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,740
Xiuyi has been with

139
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,790
And you are also familiar with

140
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,740
the case of Long Beina well, right?

141
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,090
It's enough for him to

142
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,909
deal with Yanle's envoy alone.

143
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,740

144
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,790
This time, Yanle's envoy

145
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,190
is Kang Yunhai, a trusted aide of Long Tuqi.

146
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,740
Your father, Vice Minister An, will personally receive him.

147
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,760
You'll be in charge of all matters.

148

I'm sure that with both of you working together,

149
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,300
it will definitely be a success.

150

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,710
Well, if East Court requires the help

159
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,820
they'll definitely assist.

particularly difficult task for you.

164

You'll be responsible for transcribing

165

all of the delegation's negotiations.

166
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,400
You mustn't...

167
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,340

Retainer Wang.

171
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,580
I've gone through all the files regarding Yanle

172
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,790
as per your instructions.

173
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,870
Long Tuqi

174
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,470
is Yanle's most powerful official.

175
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,550
He has a powerful army.

176
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,190
In the fifth year of Anping in Yong,

177
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,310
he started a rebellion.

178
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,030
Not only did he bring down the king of Yanle,

179
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,560
but he also wiped out the entire royal family.

180
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,070
The current king of Yanle

181
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,800
is his puppet which he planted.

182
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,050
He conferred himself the title of Viceroy.

183
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,520

are the files of our Sifang Pavilion staff

189
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,260
also kept here?

190
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,070
They are on the shelf over there.

191
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,510
I'll get it.

192
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,070
No need.

193
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,590
Go back to work.

194
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,750
Yuan Mo.

195
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,070
The son of Yuan Hanjing.

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,430
In the fifth year of Anping,

197
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,900
Yuan Hanjing was a Sifang Envoy to Yanle.

198
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,110
He met a sandstorm on his way back

199
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
and went missing?

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,680
In the fifth year of Anping...

201
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,790
It's the year Long Tuqi started the rebellion.

202
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,050
Was Yuan Mo's father's death not an accident,

203
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,320
but it was instead related to the people of Yanle?

204
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,200
So that's why Mr. Yu transferred him away.

205
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,820
The delegation of Yanle came

206
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,320
not only for the matter of Long Beina,

207
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,990
but they're also here to discuss the important matter of barter between our states.

208
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,320
Is everything ready?

209
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,250
Like father, like son.

210
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,930
I left everything to Xiuyi.

211
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,530
What's there to worry about?

212
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,920
The Yanle delegation is here.

213
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,230
They're here.

214
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,810
Get a grip on yourself.

215
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,310
Beat the drum!

216
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,430
Wait!

217
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,190
What do they mean?

218
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,230
-This is unacceptable.
-It's outrageous.

219
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,730
What kind of nonsense is this?

220
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,700
Yes, this is too much.

221
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,180
How ridiculous!

222
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,230
Xiuyi.

223
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
Yanle delegation, please stop.

224
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,770
May the envoy step forward.

225
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,060
The delegation must stop, and the envoy should step forward.

226
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,400
Protect the Vice Minister of Rites!

227
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,990
Go!

228
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,360
This is Yong's Changle City.

229
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,640
Why is the Yanle delegation not obeying our orders?

230
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,210
Why are you wearing mourning suits?

231
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,330
May the envoy step forward

232
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,940
and express your intention.

233
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,340
Otherwise, you will be treated as an enemy.

234
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,710
You are not a high-ranking official,

235
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,370
but you sure have a loud voice.

236
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,030
[Yanle's Deputy Envoy, Kang Yunhai]

237
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,270
Retreat.

238
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,560
I, An Yuandao, the Vice Minister of Rites of Yong,

239
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,630
am here to welcome you

240
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,390
on the special orders of the imperial court.

241
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,840
But you have come from afar

242
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,040
only to try and enter our city gates in mourning suits.

243
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,910
What kind of barbarian state is Yanle?

244
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,900
You've gone too far.

245
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,140
This is not how you should be treating a friend, isn't it?

246
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,290
Ways of friendship?

247
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,430
Viceroy Long of Yanle

248
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,520
sent his beloved son to Yong to study,

249
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,660
but he died in Changle City for no apparent reason.

250
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,780
Is this your way of friendship?

251
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,110
We also feel heartbroken over

252
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,030
Viceroy Long's loss of his son.

253
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,970
However, we must still respect our national etiquette.

254
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,470
I ask that Deputy Envoy Kang and your delegation please remove your mourning suits

255
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,030
and enter the city to discuss as equals,

256
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,320
so that we can settle the dispute

257
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,630
and let the deceased rest in peace.

258
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,750
Well said.

259
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,420
Equality.

260
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,100
The most important thing between two states is equality.

261
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,790
Vice Minister An.

262
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,280
Since you've mentioned that

263
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,000
Yong is also heartbroken,

264
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,290
then you must understand the pain of Viceroy Long

265
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,690
over the death of his son.

266
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,750
Fine.

267
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,560
There are new mourning suits here.

268
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,860
I ask that all the officials of Yong

269
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,590
put on the mourning suits and share Yanle's grief.

270
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,910
We'll get off our horses and enter the city immediately.

271
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,310
-Who does he think he is?
-He's gone too far!

272
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,470
Utter nonsense!

273
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,810
How could we as people of Yong mourn for Yanle?

274
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,990
Why not?

275
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,350
Yong and Yanle has been friends for years.

276
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,740
When the late king of Yong died,

277
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,490
didn't the people of Yanle also put on mourning suits for you?

278
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,550
When Yuan Hanjing, an envoy of Yong, died in the desert,

279
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,900
I had also take great pains to deliver his belongings back.

280
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,630
Now, given that Yanle's Viceroy's son died such a miserable death,

281
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,950
how could everyone in Yong be so heartless?

282
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,120
Why are the city gates closed?

283
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,270
Why are the gates closed?

284
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,000
Who told you to close the gates?

285
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,470
I did.

286
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Vice Minister An.

287
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,770
Deputy Envoy Kang.

288
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,950
I wonder if you're here

289
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,400
as an envoy representing Yanle

290
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,150
or to prepare a funeral for your Viceroy?

291
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,740
Today, Changle City's main gates are wide open

292
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,380
to welcome a distinguished guest of the state.

293
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,630
If you're here to mourn,

294
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,869
all of you please

295
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,869
use the side gate over there,

296
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,890
just like the people of Changle City.

297
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,710
It seems that your carriage is a bit too wide.

298
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,260
Well, you might have to saw off the ends of the posts first.

299
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,200
Otherwise, you'll have to compensate for breaking the door frame.

300
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,930
How dare you!

301
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,069
Who are you?

302
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,850
I'm just a small official of Sifang Pavilion's West Court.

303
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,820
How dare you talk like that as a lowly official?

304
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,420
Sir.

305
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,910
I may be a small official,

306
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,270
but I'm not lowly.

307
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,790
As a kid, you must've learnt，

308
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,530
”When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

309
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,910
No matter how small I am, I am also the host as Changle City.

310
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,730
You're guests invited by us.

311
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,560
How can the host mourn for a guest?

312
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,200
-That's right.
-Well said.

313
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,100
A state has its laws and a family has its rules.

314
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,240
If Deputy Envoy Kong insists on mourning for Young Master Long,

315
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,140
that's Yanle's private matter.

316
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,080
I was ordered here on behalf of

317
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,250
the imperial court of Yong for official business.

318
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,780
If you insist, please excuse me.

319
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,100
Wait.

320
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,530
I thought Yuan Mo would cause trouble,

321
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,940
but he just made a great contribution.

322
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
Yuan Mo is very smart.

323
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,590
He's a rare talent.

324
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,350
In the future,

325
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,150
you can get him to be more involved.

326
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,260
Okay.

327
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,010
[Ministry of Rites]

328
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,650
[Ministry of Rites' Council Chamber]

329
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,110
Please.

330
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,890
Please.

331
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,950
You and the delegation travelled day and night

332
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,950
to arrive in Changle early.

333
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,790
You must have had a long journey.

334
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,560
Ministry of Rites has prepared some wine for you.

335
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,640
After the banquet, we'll send you and your delegation

336
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,410
back to Yanle Hall for some rest.

337
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,140
Forget about the formalities.

338
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,120
Let's get down to business.

339
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,750
Deputy Envoy Kang, you came here for the barter between the two states.

340
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,110
We should be courteous.

341
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,950
Although I'm here to discuss the barter,

342
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,750
before that,

343
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,360
I would like to ask you for two persons.

344
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,910
Previously, you sent a letter stating that

345
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,630
Hong Ye, the murderer who killed Young Master Long,

346
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,560
has been caught.

347
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,030
In that case,

348
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,440
please hand over Hong Ye,

349
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,510
so that we can take her back to Yanle

350
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,040
and punish her according to the laws of Yanle.

351
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,270
Also, Young Master Long’s guard, Long Ge,

352
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,720
is still imprisoned

353
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,880
in the prison of Jingzhao Prefecture.

354
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,170
He needs to be transferred to our custody immediately.

355
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,310
Hongye is from Yong,

356
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,710
and she committed the crime in Yong.

357
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,570
She should be punished according to the law of Yong.

358
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,180
How can we hand her over to another state?

359
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,350
As for Long Ge,

360
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,950
he committed murder in Changle City and poisoned others.

361
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,020
He has violated the laws of Yong.

362
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,990
Considering that he gave us the antidote,

363
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,430
he can be given a lighter sentence according to the law.

364
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,110
But that's about it.

365
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,750
Between both our states,

366
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,910
there's no precedence in the exchange of criminals, has there?

367
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,350
It's going to happen now.

368
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Vice Minister An.

369
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,980
I'll repeat once more.

370
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,270
Presently,

371
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,920
it's Yanle's Viceroy's son who died.

372
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,820
If you're looking for precedent,

373
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,130
this is also an unprecedented case

374
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,920
in the history of both states.

375
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,830
Since this is a special case,

376
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,840
we should also handle it uniquely.

377
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,780
I'll not accept

378
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,800
anything less than

379
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,550
both of them.

380
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,070
Deputy Envoy Kang.

381
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,880
And this...

382
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,540
Advisor Ma.

383
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,760
Go and get Deputy Envoy Kang enjoy a cup of tea

384
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,850
and calm down.

385
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Vice Minister An.

386
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,320
Calm down.

387
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,990
Kang Yunhai came prepared.

388
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,380
I think they can have Long Ge.

389
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,590
But we must not hand over Hong Ye.

390
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,710
If we break the rules,

391
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,430
what will other states think?

392
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,950
Since the two states are

393
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,480
in the middle of an unprecedented situation,

394
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,440
I believe we can also negotiate together

395
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,430
an unprecedented compromise.

396
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,360
We are willing to take your suggestion

397
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,240
to transfer the Long Ge to Yanle.

398
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,670
However, the length of the sentence

399
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,420
can only be increased and must not reduced.

400
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,090
Also, Yanle must guarantee that

401
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,750
after Long Ge is released from prison,

402
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,030
he will never step into Changle City.

403
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,430
Is that okay?

404
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,950
Good. I agree.

405
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,030
Yanle will take care of Long Ge ourselves.

406
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,460
But...

407
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,590
I must have Hong Ye.

408
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,090
Deputy Envoy Kang.

409
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,950
You don't know what

410
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,630
compromise means, do you?

411
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,630
We can't be making the compromise ourselves

412
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,750
while you don't.

413
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,720
If you don't give in,

414
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,240
what's the point of negotiating in good faith?

415
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,070
Who told you

416
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,870
we are negotiating now?

417
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,710
Advisor Ma.

418
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,520
Yes.

419
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,390
Tell him what we are doing now.

420
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,090
We are informing you.

421
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,520
Tell their Ministry of Rites that

422
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,400
only when the two criminals are transferred

423
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,150
that we will continue our discussion on

424
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,190
trade and barter.

425
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,310
The transfer of prisoners is a sufficient and

426
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,440
necessary condition for subsequent negotiations.

427
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,430
So?

428
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,070
Do you plan on ruining the peace

429
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,400
between the two states for a murderer?

430
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,270
This is a matter of law and national dignity.

431
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,790
Forgive me for not acceding to your request.

432
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,370
In that case,

433
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,990
I don't think there's any need

434
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,790
for us to continue discussions.

435
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,390
Advisor Ma.

436
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,190
Yes.

437
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,370
Take Long Ge back to Yanle Hall.

438
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,200
Yes.

439
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,150
Well, we got nothing out of that,

440
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,540
and even lost one person to them.

441
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,720
[Yanle Hall]

442
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,250
I've identified him.

443
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,860
The chap at the city gates was Yuan Mo.

444
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,470
He's the son of Yong's late Sifang Envoy, Yuan Hanjing.

445
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,680
He's the son of Yuan Hanjing?

446
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,280
Yes.

447
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,650
That's why it felt like déjà vu.

448
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,270
Back then,

449
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,710
I often played chess with Hanjing.

450
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,430
Yuan Mo

451
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,810
is indeed quite like his father.

452
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,550
Long Ge wants to meet you.

453
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,920
Please.

454
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,270
I, criminal Long Ge,

455
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,600
thank you for saving me.

456
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,170
I didn't save you.

457
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,310
I just took you back to Yanle Hall.

458
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,220
According to the agreement between the two states,

459
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,080
you'll still have to be grounded.

460
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,190
I understand.

461
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,300
But being grounded in Yanle Hall

462
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,030
is like I am back at home.

463
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,380
Thank you, Deputy Envoy Kang, for not forgetting about me.

464
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,840
Long Ge.

465
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,680
Please rise.

466
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,780
You've been loyal to Young Master Long.

467
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,390
He was right about you.

468
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,030
I failed to protect him.

469
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,450
I deserve to die.

470
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,950
It’s not your fault.

471
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,110
I want to avenge Young Master Long too.

472
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,830
I wanted to take the murderer, Hong Ye,

473
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,590
back to Yanle and hack her up.

474
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,800
But Yong remains powerful,

475
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,910
so I failed.

476
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,510
Young Master Long.

477
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,410
Forgive us for not being able to kill the culprit for you

478
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,750
and bring comfort to your soul in heaven.

479
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,840
Deputy Envoy Kang.

480
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,170
My life was dedicated to our Young Master.

481
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,590
I beg you to let me fulfil my duty to our Young Master.

482
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,570
I promise I won't implicate you.

483
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,310
Shut up.

484
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,980
You must never think this way.

485
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,160
I finally got you out of prison.

486
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,870
How can I let you risk your life again?

487
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,230
Promise me, Long Ge.

488
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,000
Don’t make unnecessary sacrifices anymore.

489
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,790
Young Master Long will forgive us

490
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
in heaven.

491
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,230
Just stay grounded, understand?

492
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,770
Release the guards.

493
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,880
Report to me if anything happens.

494
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,800
Yes, Deputy Envoy Kang.

495
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,510
[Sifang Pavilion]

496
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,570
Stand up straight!

497
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,100
Let me ask you.

498
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,330
You're done with the case on smuggling refugees?

499
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,010
How can we ever get to the bottom of something like this?

500
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,400
Then why did you make a spectacle of yourself in front of

501
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,660
the Yanle delegation?

502
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,590
Fine, I won't do it again.

503
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,680
Then how about you tell me

504
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,010
what you were going to do

505
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,850
in that sticky situation then?

506
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,590
We...

507
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,050
Tell me.

508
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,120
No.

509
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,840
You just didn’t want me to meet Kang Yunhai.

510
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,380
It was that Kang Yunhai who

511
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,910
came to Yong and reported that my parents died in the sandstorm.

512
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,230
Yuan Mo.

513
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,210
I can't explain the past in a few words.

514
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,370
But do you trust him?

515
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,560
Yuan Mo.

516
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,060
I heard about what you did.

517
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,110
Good job!

518
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,280
I was previously wrong about you.

519
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,200
No, I...

520
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,390
Did I hit him too hard?

521
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,250
It probably hurts a little.

522
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,030
Ms. Yuchi.

523
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,400
What's the matter?

524
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,860
I'm here to ask

525
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,950
who are we going to send from Sifang Pavilion

526
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,080
to represent us in our discussions with the delegation?

527
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,040
You didn't have to ask.

528
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
For such matters,

529
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,980
of course it will be led by East Court.

530
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,060
On what grounds?

531
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,270
The East Court is familiar with military horses, provisions,

532
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,850
and the foreign trade situation.

533
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,310
These are the key points of the negotiation.

534
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,980
Hua.

535
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,430
If you want to work for Sifang Pavilion,

536
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,230
you can help me out at East Court.

537
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,060
Think about it.

538
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,390
You and I will be

539
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,730
invincible together.

540
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,830
Why did you have to join Wang Kunwu's side?

541
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,140
I think he's a nice guy.

542
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,020
At least he's better than you.

543
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,320
Better than me?

544
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,020
How am I not as good as him?

545
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,260
You're no match for him.

546
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,550
He's nothing but a soldier.

547
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,750
And you rely completely on your father.

548
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,730
I, An Xiuyi,

549
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,670
from a low-ranking official of Sifang Pavilion to the being East Court's retainer,

550
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,310
relied completely on my own skills.

551
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,280
If I had relied on my father,

552
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,880
I would have joined Ministry of Rites long ago.

553
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,240
Do you really think so?

554
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,640
Mr. Yu.

555
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,750
Mr. Yu, I have a question.

556
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,940
Has An Xiuyi done anything wrong in Sifang Pavilion?

557
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,290
He made mistakes occasionally.

558
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,590
Occasionally?

559
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,480
Has he ever been punished then?

560
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,770
It's understandable.

561
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,960
It's understandable.

562
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,510
Look.

563
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,890
Where did this favoritism come from?

564
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,990
Was it because you came from a humble background,

565
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,720
and you had worked really hard?

566
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,840
Ms. Yuchi.

567
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,340
What you said was inappropriate.

568
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,890
Xiuyi is indeed very motivated.

569
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,550
He's not like all the other guys.

570
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,590
Let's just talk about East Court.

571
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,130
East Court

572
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,710
stayed up late at night for months.

573
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,580
Thanks to you, the West Court

574
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,460
was stuck deep in the case.

575
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,510
I was being absolutely fair

576
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,910
when assigning the tasks.

577
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,900
I wasn't being biased at all.

578
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,990
It's settled then.

579
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,070
Did you hear that?

580
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,430
Yu was praising you.

581
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,690
You're different from the other guys.

582
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,250
No matter how hard you try,

583
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,550
in the eyes of others,

584
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,110
you'll always stick out.

585
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,750
And you're still trying to hide?

586
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,140
Sir.

587
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,990
Go ahead.

588
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,700
I think you might have misunderstood Advisor Yuchi.

589
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,450
I don't think she meant to

590
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,350
belittle your ambition,

591
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,210
but instead, wants you to accept your identity.

592
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,030
You don't have to mind people's criticism.

593
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,550
You might rely on Vice Minister An,

594
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,810
but you didn't take any favours from him.

595
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,650
You are not in control of

596
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,290
other people's favoritism.

597
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,920
So then, there's nothing wrong with being

598
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,720
diligent and ambitious either.

599
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,710
What's wrong?

600
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,330
Nothing.

601
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,290
It's the first time I've heard you talk so much.

602
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,250
[Yanle Hall]

603
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,960
[Prison]

604
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,860
Who are you?

605
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,600
What do you want?

606
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,990
Don't come over!

607
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,030
Help!

608
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,190
Sifang Pavilion wants to see Yanle's Deputy Envoy Kang.

609
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,050
Ask for him now.

610
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,820
This is Yanle Hall.

611
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,250
What do you want?

612
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Bring me the man.

613
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,080
Kneel!

614
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,810
Let me ask you instead.

615
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
We had just

616
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,730
handed Long Ge over to you.

617
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,490
You instead indulged him to break into prison

618
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,550
and assassinated an important criminal.

619
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,960
What are you all up to?

620
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,390
We... I...

621
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,710
We need to investigate this matter.

622
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,080
We can't judge simply based on your words.

623
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,800
I've already brought the criminal here.

624
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,659
You still want to deny it?

625
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,540
Step aside.

626
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,960
Otherwise,

627
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,620
I'll destroy Yanle Hall today.

628
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,670
How dare you?

629
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,030
You want to start a fight?

630
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,550
So what if I do?

631
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,429
Stop!

632
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,199
-Yuan Mo from Sifang Pavilion.
-Yuchi Hua from Sifang Pavilion.

633
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,929
Greetings, Deputy Envoy Kang.

634
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,670
Rise.

635
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,719
Long Ge?

636
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,370
Why are you here?

637
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,190
Aren't you...

638
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,750
So Deputy Envoy Kang had no idea that

639
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,060
your prisoner had actually escaped?

640
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,590
After Long Ge was transferred to our custody,

641
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,370
I ordered someone to keep a close eye on him.

642
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,230
How could it be?

643
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,690
Ma Zhiwen!

644
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm here.

645
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,570
How did you even watch him?

646
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,140
I...

647
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
How did you even watch him?

648
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,170
He...

649
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,400
He must have escaped by himself.

650
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,070
Yes.

651
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,070
Not only did he escape,

652
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,600
but he also killed another criminal, Hong Ye.

653
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,960
Isn't this a bit of a surprise?

654
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,030
Long Ge.

655
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,720
You've got a lot of nerve.

656
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,330
I just want to avenge my master.

657
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,280
Last night's escape and murder

658
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,940
was all my own doing.

659
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,350
It had nothing to do with Yanle

660
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,590
or Deputy Envoy Kang.

661
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,150
I'll bear all consequences

662
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,310
by myself.

663
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,670
Who do you think you are?

664
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,560
I came all the way to maintain Yanle's dignity

665
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,750
by trying to settle the resentment between the two states.

666
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,230
But what did you do?

667
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,900
Because of your own hatred,

668
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,110
you disregarded the agreement between both states

669
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,150
and took revenge on your own.

670
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,950
You're a disgrace to Yanle.

671
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,460
What you did

672
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,930
made all my efforts go to waste.

673
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,630
You've really disappointed me.

674
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,770
Everyone from Yong, listen up.

675
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,940
This is Yanle Hall,

676
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,370
so we'll follow the laws of Yanle.

677
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,070
Long Ge is a criminal whose custody

678
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,800
has been transferred to Yanle.

679
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,950
Now, he's made a terrible mistake and should be executed according to the law.

680
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,190
I'll have executed him on the spot.

681
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,340
Everything is in accordance with previous agreements between the two states.

682
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,030
Everyone from Yanle Hall, put your weapons away.

683
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,340
Go back and tell Vice Minister An

684
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,690
our debts are settled.

685
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,240
We can now discuss about the rest.

686
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,200
[Ya Feng]

687
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,750
Don't you all feel like we have lost?

688
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,980
They asked for Long Ge as soon as they came,

689
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,240
and we handed him over.

690
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,020
They wanted to kill Hong Ye to avenge for Long Beina.

691
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,750
Didn't they manage to do so too?

692
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,560
Long Ge has violated our law.

693
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,650
We should punish him as Yong instead.

694
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,690
But what happened?

695
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,980
Deputy Envoy Kang came and executed him on the street.

696
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,270
There's nothing we can do about them.

697
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,310
Don't you think we lost?

698
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,760
But I think Long Ge deserved to die.

699
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,150
He did so many bad things for Long Beina.

700
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,460
He deserved it.

701
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,300
And he cannot bring any more harm to Changle ever again.

702
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,150
The trade negotiation between the two states can continue.

703
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,510
We have to look ahead

704
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,150
and bid goodbye to all our troubles.

705
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,400
Let's welcome happiness from hereon.

706
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,830
-Let’s drink.
-Come on.

707
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,480
Yes.

708
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,060
You're right, Ms. Ah Shu.

709
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,420
Come on.

710
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,990
Cheers.

711
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,830
Cheers.

712
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,910
After this meal,

713
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,230
we have to all move forward.

714
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,190
The negotiation between the two states is coming.

715
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,850
We have to keep our spirits up.

716
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,550
You people from West Court must do your best...

717
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,090
in transcribing.

718
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,960
Retainer Wang.

719
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,320
It's not nice of you to pick on me

720
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,070
in front of everyone.

721
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,900
Transcribing is also

722
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,460
a relatively important task.

723
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,110
Yes.

724
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,200
Yuan Mo,

725
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,050
Don't drink so much.

726
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,520
Am I right or not?

727
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,830
No, no, no.

728
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,030
No, I am saying something is wrong with the wine.

729
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,120
Ah Shu.

730
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,310
Why does this wine

731
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,190
tastes like my Lingxi wine?

732
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,380
Yes.

733
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,320
Didn't Yuchi Hua give you money to buy wine?

734
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,830
Why did you take my Lingxi wine out?

735
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,110
Why should I buy more wine when we have wine at home?

736
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,810
Yuchi's money is also precious.

737
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,340
What's wrong with drinking a bit of your wine?

738
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,440
How petty.

739
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,300
Ah Shu!

740
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,240
Good job!

741
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:52,990
Fine.

742
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,990
No one is being serious.

743
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,030
We finally have a day off.

744
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,890
Can't we just have a nice dinner followed by a drink?

745
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,790
It's not bad indeed.

746
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,470
Here, pour me a cup.

747
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,310
I tell you, this Lingxi wine...

748
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,350
-It tastes really...
-Come on.

749
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,210
Hua, fill it up.

750
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,070
-I couldn't recognise the taste just now.
-Fill it up.

751
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,510
You knew?

752
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,390
I should have told you earlier.

753
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,470
Fill it up, Wang.

754
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,830
Come on.

755
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,590
Save some for me!

756
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,430
This wine is good.

757
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,670
Take it away. Come on.

758
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,270
Fill it up.

759
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,470
Fill it up.

760
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,470
I tell you—

761
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,480
You're done after just a few cups?

762
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,350
It hurts me to see you guys drinking like that.

763
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,300
Kang Yunhai is hard to deal with.

764
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,800
Are you upset too?

765
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,330
Does it have anything to do with me?

766
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,090
Yes.

767
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,990
On the day Yanle's delegation entered the city,

768
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,390
Yu transferred you away.

769
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,350
I found it strange,

770
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,880
so I went through the files.

771
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,210
Come back and drink!

772
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,900
Come on!

773
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,680
Come!

774
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,600
According to the files,

775
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,430
your parents died in a desert storm

776
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,770
on their way back from their mission to Yanle.

777
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,060
But curiously,

778
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,030
it happened during the time of military mutiny in Yanle,

779
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,080
when Long Tuqi helped the new king ascend the throne.

780
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,540
What are you trying to say?

781
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,530
Your parents' deaths may not be an accident.

782
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,120
Besides, Deputy Envoy Kang is a trusted aide of Long Tuqi.

783
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,040
There's a good chance he knows what happened back then.
