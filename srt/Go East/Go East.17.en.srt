00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,060
He pointed out the problem

4
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,350
and offered the court a specific solution.

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,120
has finally become like Hanjing.

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

8
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,800
We should hurry up and discuss it

9
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,910
before we invite the envoys of different states to discuss it together.

10
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,110
As long as we can resettle the refugees,

11
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,270
the alliance with the five states will have the support of the people.

12
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,530
By then, the envoys will feel the pressure from the people.

13
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,960
I believe there will be a new chance to form the alliance.

14
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,270
Yeah.

15
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,030
You're so far-sighted.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Just say what you want to say.

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,090
You haven't made up with Xiuyi?

18
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,980
Don't blame me for speaking my mind then.

19
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,230
Over the years, you've been busy with work

20
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,110
and barely spent any time with your son.

21
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,500
So it's understandable

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,230
that An Xiuyi is angry with you.

23
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,870
There's nothing wrong with you having requirements

24
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,910
and expectations for your son.

25
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,940
But you can't always criticize him.

26
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,510
Think about it.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,180
Back then, you planned to get Xiuyi into the Ministry of Rites.

28
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,070
He wouldn't

29
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,910
and insisted on coming to the Sifang Pavilion.

30
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,090
Starting from a low-ranking official, he's climbed up the ladder step by step,

31
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,060
just like you did back then.

32
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,990
He just wanted to anger me.

33
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,110
To anger you?

34
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,750
He risked his life just to anger you?

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,670
This time, in order to save the refugees,

36
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,260
Xiuyi went into the lion's den

37
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,050
and fought with The Faceless.

38
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,600
He even got injured.

39
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,450
He's injured?

40
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,650
How is he now?

41
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,990
Ask him yourself.

42
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,620
Alright.

43
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,380
It's not serious.

44
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,460

You really need to spend some time with him.

As a father,

49
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,230
sometimes you need to put aside your pride.

50
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,790
It doesn't hurt to be soft with your children.

51
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,510

Every time he fooled the refugees,

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,130
Why are you writing these things?

190
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,710
I was illiterate,

191
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,510
but it's different now.

192
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,240
You can't fool me again.

193
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,710
Ah Shu.

194
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,410
I have something to tell you.

195
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,610
Is someone at the door?

196
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,610
Wait, I…

197
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,460
Who's it?

198
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,870
I have something to tell you, Ah Shu.

199
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,830
Tell me later.

200
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,390
Coming!

201
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,830
Ah Shu! Ah Shu!

202
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,710
Ah Shu.

203
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,910
Shen.

204
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,070
Yuchi.

205
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,950
Wang.

206
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,430
Why have you all come here?

207
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,080
We came to celebrate for you.

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
Celebrate what?

209
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,630
Yuan Mo.

210
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,930
You haven't given it to Ah Shu yet?

211
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,790
What are you going to give me?

212
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,710
What is it?

213
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,090
Why are you hesitating?

214
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,520
My name is on it.

215
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,430
Natural… Cer…

216
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,150
[Naturalization Certificate]

217
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,550
It's a naturalization certificate.

218
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,280
Naturalization certificate?

219
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,750
My naturalization certificate?

220
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,550
Ah Shu.

221
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,190
From now on,

222
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,390
you're officially a citizen of Changle.

223
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,310
Yes!

224
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,830
Great!

225
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,150
Great!

226
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,760
I'm a Changle citizen now!

227
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,870
Look how happy she is.

228
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,030
Mr. Yu.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,950
It's so great!

230
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,910
Wang.

231
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,970
Congratulations.

232
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,800
Yuan Mo.

233
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,550
Thank you.

234
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,940
Ah Shu.

235
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,280
From now on, you are free.

236
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,990
You said you don't know your birthday.

237
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,910
You didn't even celebrate your quinceanera.

238
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,430
You're a citizen of Changle now,

239
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,500
so we want to hold a naturalization ceremony

240
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,110
for you.

241
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,230
Right.

242
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,810
I'll assign the tasks.

243
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,110
Let's start.

244
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,970
Wait, wait.

245
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,190
There are two more guests.

246
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,690
Come in. What are you waiting for?

247
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,790
Retainer An?

248
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,490
Susu?

249
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,130
Yes.

250
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,640
Back in the villa,

251
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,430
it was Retainer An who reminded Ah Shu to escape

252
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,560
and sent the signal.

253
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,430
Come on in.

254
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,750
Let's have some fun together tonight.

255
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,830
Welcome.

256
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,550
Retainer An, Susu,

257
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,310
I haven't thanked you yet.

258
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Come on in.

259
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,190
Don't just stand here.

260
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,710
Let's clean up this place, light a bonfire, and hang up some lanterns

261
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,550
for the celebration.

262
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,270
Yeah. Let's do it.

263
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,910
Let's go.

264
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:32,880
Let's go.

265
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,790
We're all colleagues tonight.

266
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,030
No retainers and subordinates.

267
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,830
Well said!

268
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,580
Great.

269
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,190
Look at this place. So empty.

270
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,550
Ah Shu.

271
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,430
We have to hang up lanterns.

272
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,190
Come with me.

273
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,750
That's right, Susu.

274
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,990
The lantern you chose looks much better.

275
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,830
Shen.

276
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,390
Switch the lantern in your hand

277
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,950
with Susu.

278
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,450
This one is fine.

279
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,150
Just do as I say.

280
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,080
You usually have good taste.

281
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,830
Switch.

282
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,750
Ji.

283
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,990
Can't you see there's one lantern missing

284
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,150
in the middle?

285
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,340
Hang one more up.

286
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,600
There are no extra lanterns.

287
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Go make one.

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,930
Xiuyi.

289
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,390
You two must be careful.

290
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,870
But the firewood must be piled up high.

291
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,110
-Yes.
-We need a big bonfire.

292
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,750
A big one.

293
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,150
Why hasn't anyone watered the flowers?

294
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,550
Brat.

295
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,980
You're so generous today.

296
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,860
Of course.

297
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,270
Okay. I'll water the flowers.

298
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,750
This Qingxi wine is 50 years old.

299
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,010
Are you really going to drink it tonight?

300
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,150
I'm happy today.

301
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,270
This wine is the best for the celebration.

302
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,220
Is it for the celebration, or do you need some Dutch courage?

303
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,300
You talk too much.

304
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,050
Open the bottles if you want to drink the wine too.

305
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,260
Don't chicken out later.

306
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,100
Go away.

307
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,390
Ah Shu.

308
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,790
Ah Shu, I need to tell you something.

309
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,990
Actually, I like you.

310
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,430
Why is it so awkward?

311
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,020
I know.

312
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,260
My clothes.

313
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,540
My clothes are wrong.

314
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,720
I can relax after getting changed.

315
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,520
It's been so long. Why haven't they come out?

316
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,950
Can Yuchi Hua do it or not?

317
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,110
Maybe she should let me dress Ah Shu up.

318
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,540
You're indeed good at that.

319
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,260
Yeah.

320
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,950
Why are you two so impatient?

321
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,480
The one who's truly impatient is milling around over there.

322
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,690
Are you talking about me?

323
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,070
I'm not impatient.

324
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,670
Why would I be?

325
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,720
We're coming.

326
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,430
They're coming.

327
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,360
They're coming.

328
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,470
So beautiful.

329
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,100
Stop staring.

330
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,870
Come. Come.

331
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,350
Sit down.

332
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,550
I announce that

333
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,300
Ah Shu's naturalization ceremony begins now!

334
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,310
Great!

335
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,760
Then, we'll move to the next step.

336
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,690
Sending gifts.

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,190
You prepared gifts for me?

338
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,390
Of course.

339
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,580
Yuan Mo has given you his gift.

340
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,520
It's my turn now.

341
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,840
A small congratulations gift.

342
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,070
Clap!

343
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,610
Sure.

344
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,670
It's a top-notch brush made of rabbit hair.

345
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,090
To master a skill,

346
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,550
you need to have good tools first.

347
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,110
We wish that Ah Shu could get

348
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,040
better and better at calligraphy.

349
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,170
In the future, you can see me

350
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,170
as your elder in Changle City.

351
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,480
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

352
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,010
Don't call me that.

353
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,480
Thank you, Yu.

354
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,230
That's more like it.

355
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,110
Yu.

356
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,790
Yu, you called me generous.

357
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,230
You're more generous than me.

358
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,870
Shut up.

359
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,130
Who am I doing this for?

360
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,870
Who's next?

361
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,750
Ah Shu.

362
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,410
I ordered this rouge for you

363
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,730
in another rouge shop.

364
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,440
It's the latest product. Try it.

365
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
Thank you, Hua.

366
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,910
See me as your elder sister in the future.

367
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,710
I'll protect you in Changle City.

368
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,910
Great!

369
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,670
So nice.

370
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,900
Thank you, Hua.

371
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,950
Ah Shu.

372
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,230
You're welcome in the Sifang Pavilion anytime.

373
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,430
I ordered two Aglaonema plants

374
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,030
in the West Market for you,

375
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,910
but they still haven't arrived yet.

376
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,710
Retainer Wang,

377
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,970
we've done you a favor.

378
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,050
Hurry. Yeah.

379
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,030
We went to the West Market before coming here

380
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,280
and brought the plants here.

381
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,610
They are here.

382
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,310
Take them.

383
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,710
Ah Shu.

384
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,510
Thank you.

385
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,270
Hold on.

386
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,550
Retainer Wang, as you said,

387
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,350
the West Court is like a big family, right?

388
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,910
Yeah.

389
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,510
We're all your brothers now.

390
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,970
Keep it up.

391
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,870
Wang.

392
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,540
Thank you.

393
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,270
Congratulations.

394
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,670
The gifts from the West Court are all great.

395
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,060
East Court, it's your turn.

396
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,920
Susu.

397
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,100
Ah Shu.

398
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,620
Susu and I prepared

399
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,040
a box of snacks for you.

400
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,070
Please accept it.

401
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,790
Great!

402
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,480
I love snacks.

403
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,630
Come on. Let's share them.

404
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,200
Wait.

405
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,750
A box of snacks is not good enough as a gift.

406
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,670
Let me try one.

407
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,460
These snacks are for Ah Shu.

408
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,950
Just be grateful that you can share them.

409
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,410
Try one.

410
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,670
I'll save my share for you.

411
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,270
Come on. Take more.

412
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,080
Come on.

413
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,140
We'll all try it.

414
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,550
Wait.

415
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,750
Delicious.

416
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,510
Stop!

417
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,080
These snacks are not for you.

418
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,510
It's okay.

419
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,190
I don't mind sharing with them.

420
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,980
Yeah.

421
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,950
So petty.

422
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,200
No, I mean…

423
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,280
these are dried grasshoppers for Poppet.

424
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,110
Luckily, we haven't eaten them.

425
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
You shouldn't have eaten so quickly.

426
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,040
You're so bad.

427
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,810
I'm surprised that you know about Poppet.

428
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,370
This gift is so special.

429
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,470
I like it.

430
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,570
I like all your gifts.

431
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
This is the first time

432
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,530
I've received so many gifts.

433
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,150
No one has held a celebration for me before.

434
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,220
Thank you, everyone.

435
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,450
I've never been so happy before.

436
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,270
Ah Shu.

437
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,680
Being happy is all that matters.

438
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,550
Remember.

439
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,150
Changle is your home now.

440
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,430
We're all your family.

441
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,550
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

442
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,130
Call me Yu.

443
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,550
Yuan Mo.

444
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,450
We've all said something.

445
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,160
Do you have anything to say to Ah Shu?

446
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,750
In the future, will you be Ah Shu's brother,

447
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,910
creditor,

448
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,790
or…

449
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,480
something else?

450
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,590
Me?

451
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,290
I'll be Ah Shu's…

452
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,030
I'll be whatever she wants me to be.

453
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,350
Alright.

454
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,440
Let's raise

455
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,590
our glasses, okay?

456
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,590
Come on.

457
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,950
I think

458
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,430
he needs some Dutch courage

459
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,300
to say what he really wants to say.

460
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,000
That's right.

461
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,600
Come on.

462
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,700
Let's drink to Ah Shu first.

463
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,950
Congratulations to her on becoming a citizen of Yong.

464
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,990
Cheers!

465
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,560
-Cheers!
-Thank you, guys!

466
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,770
Great!

467
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,750
Great!

468
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,350
Great!

469
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,180
Beautiful dance.

470
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,240
Let's drink.

471
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,310
Here.

472
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,750
Ah Shu,

473
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,270
you're so good at Yong's dance.

474
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,110
In the future,

475
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,030
I'll take you to meet the boys from big families in Changle City

476
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,950
for willow shooting.

477
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,780
I want to show them I have such a good sister!

478
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,210
Yes!

479
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,060
No!

480
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,750
Yuchi Hua,

481
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,070
you haven't got married yourself.

482
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,150
Don't worry about Ah Shu.

483
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,590
You…

484
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,200
Ah Shu, d-don't go with her.

485
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,150
Ah Shu is free now.

486
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,650
She can go wherever she wants.

487
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,730
I said she can't go, and that is that!

488
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,360
Guys, help me get him in.

489
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,470
Don't be afraid.

490
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,870
Careful.

491
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,750
Clean the mess.

492
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,190
Be careful.

493
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,550
You guys are so…

494
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,470
Clean the mess.

495
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,890
I'll make some hangover soup later.

496
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,570
Okay.

497
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,160
-Up the stairs. The first stair.
-Be careful.

498
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,110
-The second stair.
-Be careful.

499
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,770
Look.

500
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,390
Walk straight.

501
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,670
Look.

502
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,210
It seems that the East Court

503
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,370
never has such vibes.

504
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,310
What's wrong?

505
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,680
Is something bothering you?

506
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,030
Do you think…

507
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm really inept?

508
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,410
What makes you think that?

509
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,200
The Five States Conference

510
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,270
went quite well,

511
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,790
but it was ruined just because of something I said.

512
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,870
I got lost when I stalked those of the Red Lotus Society

513
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,720
and was recognized and caught when I tried to save the refugees.

514
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,930
I'm the worst.

515
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,380
I don't think they were your faults.

516
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,350
You're excellent.

517
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,110
Enough.

518
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,380
Don't try to comfort me.

519
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,350
I know.

520
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,310
No one really appreciates me.

521
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,670
My father doesn't.

522
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,710
He doesn't.

523
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,910
Neither do you.

524
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,800
I do appreciate you.

525
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,790
People in the East Court

526
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,070
respect and fear me

527
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,390
only because of my father.

528
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,360
Not to mention those in the West Court.

529
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,070
Even Yuchi Hua, who grew up with me,

530
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,260
despises me too.

531
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,260
Yes.

532
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,720
I admit that I work very hard,

533
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,920
but hard work doesn't always pay off.

534
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,510
Sometimes,

535
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,410
you just can't make it.

536
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,390
Am I right?

537
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,670
Yeah.

538
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,200
When I first came to the Sifang Pavilion and met you,

539
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,970
I was surprised

540
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,540
by how arrogant and ignorant you were.

541
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,150
You were conceited and imperious.

542
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,430
But after hearing what you said today,

543
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,200
I don't think you're hopeless.

544
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,030
You know your limits.

545
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,090
It's good.

546
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,850
Just don't forget everything

547
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,150
after you sober up tomorrow.

548
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,970
Don't go.

549
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,580
I need to tell you something.

550
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,710
I…

551
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,270
I…

552
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,230
I like you.

553
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,950
I like it when you're straightforward.

554
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,710
I like it when you're bossy.

555
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,050
I like it when you're overbearing.

556
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,210
When I first met you,

557
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,380
I knew you were special.

558
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,880
You're different from all the other girls I know.

559
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,930
We're here to say goodbye.

560
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,480
We didn't hear anything.

561
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,210
We didn't see anything either.

562
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,470
Guys, come and have some hangover soup.

563
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,790
Hua, you didn't drink much.

564
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,990
Why are you blushing?

565
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,270
Ah Shu.

566
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,630
I'm a little drunk.

567
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,780
I'm going back.

568
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,590
Drunk?

569
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,100
It's my turn to propose a toast?

570
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,070
Yes, it's your turn.

571
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,630
Well, his wife has a bad temper.

572
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,110
She won't let him in if he goes back too late.

573
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,740
We'll take our leave.

574
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,670
I'm not leaving!

575
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,350
I need beauty sleep too.

576
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,470
I won't help you clean up.

577
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,110
We're leaving.

578
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,990
Here is to you.

579
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,190
No, no. Go to the door.

580
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,570
Drink at the door.

581
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,280
Careful. Careful.

582
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,390
Why are they all leaving?

583
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,900
Young Master.

584
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,390
You're back.

585
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,320
What's the matter, Father?

586
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,700
Which arm?

587
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,220
What?

588
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,390
Which arm of yours is injured?

589
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,160
Just a minor injury.

590
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,950
Don't worry about it.

591
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,170
I'm asking you!

592
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,830
Why can't you just

593
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,960
answer me directly?

594
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,830
Left arm.

595
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,750
Let me see.

596
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,770
I told you,

597
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,450
it's just a minor injury.

598
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,880
You don't need to see it.

599
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,650
I'm your father.

600
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,510
Why can't I check on your wound?

601
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,550
Since I was young,

602
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,090
I've recovered by myself

603
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,380
every time I got injured.

604
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,270
When have you ever shown concern?

605
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,150
Now you pretend to care.

606
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,840
Fine.

607
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll show you.

608
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,270
I got this scar

609
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,070
when I fell down from a tree.

610
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,700
There's a knife wound here.

611
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,630
I got this scratch from a tree branch while I was riding a horse.

612
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,890
Do you want to see more?

613
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,910
I have scars on my legs and back too.

614
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,510
Do you want to see them?

615
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,510
I can take off my clothes and show them to you.

616
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,320
Xiuyi!

617
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,820
The front yard

618
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,800
is only 118 steps away

619
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,630
from the back yard.

620
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,510
When I was young,

621
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,350
I counted steps every time I came here.

622
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,840
I thought to myself,

623
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,140
"It's such a short distance,

624
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,860
but why does Father barely come to see me?

625
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,230
Is it because I'm not good enough

626
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,530
and Father isn't satisfied with me?"

627
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,080
Until one day, I stopped counting.

628
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,070
Because I realized I had grown up.

629
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,510
So take my advice.

630
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,750
Don't try to be a loving father and expect me to be a filial son.

631
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,730
We'll just live under the same roof

632
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,270
like two strangers.

633
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,350
It's better this way.

634
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,680
The bottles are still here.

635
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,370
Poppet is here too.

636
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,930
The flowers and plants are here too.

637
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,540
Ah Shu's things are all here.

638
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,790
So Ah Shu agreed?

639
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,230
She's not leaving?

640
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,350
Yuan Mo.

641
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,160
What are you looking at?

642
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,710
Ah Shu.

643
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,690
You're sober?

644
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,160
Ah Shu.

645
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,960
What I said to you last night

646
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,720
was all from the bottom of my heart.

647
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,790
Last night?

648
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,640
You said a lot of things last night.

649
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,510
You kept talking when you were drunk.

650
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,970
Don't drink so much again.

651
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,320
Eat.

652
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,510
What does she mean?

653
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,270
She's shy?

654
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,120
Or is she testing me?

655
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,210
Oaky, Ah Shu.

656
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,590
I'll listen to you and won't drink anymore.

657
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,890
You'll call the shots in this house in the future.

658
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,640
Your word is law!

659
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,350
I've always been calling the shots.

660
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,470
What are you talking about?

661
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,070
You're so glib this morning.

662
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,360
Finish the porridge.

663
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,160
Okay, Master.

664
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,310
By the way,

665
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,710
I'm not your little maid anymore.

666
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,870
If you don't want me to live in your house,

667
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,710
I can move out.

668
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,790
Take your time.

669
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,520
You choked on the porridge.

670
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,930
Let me get you some water.

671
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,520
Move out?

672
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,140
I'm sure now.

673
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,420
This must be a test.

674
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,760
I won't let you go.

675
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,230
You haven't sobered up?

676
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,240
Let go of me.

677
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,450
No!

678
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,050
Unless you say you're not leaving.

679
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,150
I'm not leaving!

680
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,110
You're going to be late.

681
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,490
Go to the Sifang Pavilion now,

682
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,250
or Yu will deduct your salary again.

683
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,860
You do know how to run a household.

684
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,590
I'll go now.

685
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,120
I'm leaving, Master.

686
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,490
From now on, I'm a man who will support his family!

687
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,570
Yuan Mo confessed love to Yuchi Hua?

688
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,910
Really?

689
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,990
Maybe you were drunk and heard it wrong.

690
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,950
Shen was there too.

691
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,030
Ask him if you don't believe me.

692
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,150
Retainer Wang, Retainer An,

693
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,310
and Susu were all there.

694
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,310
They all heard it.

695
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,320
He said,

696
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,310
"I like it when you're bossy and overbearing.

697
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,070
When I saw you,

698
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,110
I knew you were different from other girls."

699
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,630
That's exactly Yuchi Hua.

700
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,270
Yeah.

701
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,180
He held Yuchi Hua's hand and said,

702
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,140
"Don't go."

703
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,530
And neither of them came to work today.

704
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,520
So,

705
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,490
don't judge a book by its cover.

706
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,870
Guys,

707
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,750
don't talk about this matter ever.

708
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,840
You must keep it a secret.

709
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
I don't want to be killed by that she-devil.

710
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,850
I'm afraid the whole Sifang Pavilion knows it now.

711
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,640
Don't gossip when you're on duty.

712
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,440
Yes.

713
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,240
Good morning, boys!

714
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,710
You all came early today.

715
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,040
Great.

716
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,050
Great.

717
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,940
This is what the men of the West Court should be like.

718
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,470
-You see?
-Do we have a lot of work today?

719
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,110
-He's refreshed and happy.
-Do we?

720
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,190
It's fine.

721
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,270
I can finish your work for you.

722
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,790
I'm full of energy today.

723
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,290
I can't wait to get to work!

724
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,630
Where is Yuchi Hua?

725
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,090
Why didn't Yuchi Hua come?

726
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,800
She asked for a leave.

727
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,470
She caught a cold last night.

728
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,750
I asked her to wear more clothes,

729
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,150
but she wouldn't listen.

730
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,580
Tell me if there's a task.

731
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,710
I'm always ready.

732
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,950
He cares so much about her.

733
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,530
I don't want to believe it.

734
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,390
But this is too real.

735
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,370
Why are you dawdling here?

736
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,710
Get back to work!

737
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,530
Yes.

738
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,510
On it!

739
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,910
Recently, refugees from different states

740
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,270
have gathered in front of our embassy,

741
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,180
asking our envoy to reconsider the alliance with Yong

742
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,970
to ensure long-term peace in the desert.

743
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,440
This is so great.

744
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,130
Yes.

745
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,010
It seems that we may be able to form the alliance again.

746
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,370
This calls for celebration.

747
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,710
He'll pay.

748
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,560
All the female refugees I visited today said the same thing.

749
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,190
They all said Chen Xinliang stared at their feet.

750
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,920
Looks like your guess is right.

751
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,150
They're indeed looking for a young girl

752
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,070
who has a special mark on her feet.

753
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,159
The Man in White went through so much trouble.

754
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,900
That girl must be a big shot.

755
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,510
But how has she ended up in Changle?

756
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,080
Fortunately,

757
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,850
they didn't find her among the refugees.

758
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,480
What if he's wrong?

759
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,389
Maybe that girl

760
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,130
is not among the refugees.

761
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,520
You mean she's already a citizen of Changle?

762
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,550
It's very likely.

763
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,440
Anyway,

764
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,540
we must find her before the Man in White.

765
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,200
I'll go to Yuchi Hua tomorrow.

766
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,090
Why will you go to her?

767
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,210
To expand the search area.

768
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,550
I didn't know you were so good at using public resources for personal gain

769
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,630
and soldiering on.

770
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,710
What are you talking about?

771
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,090
I can't understand you.

772
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,160
What else does Yuchi Hua like

773
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,190
besides weapons?

774
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,130
I need to give her what she wants.

775
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,860
You're going to give her a gift?

776
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,880
Of course. I need a favor from her after all.

777
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,610
But it's for work.

778
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,230
You have to reimburse me.

779
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,600
How much is this?

780
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,740
Ten wen.

781
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,500
Ten wen?

782
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,640
Are you going to buy this for Yuchi Hua?

783
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,000
Why would I?

784
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,250
I'm picking one for Ah Shu.

785
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,110
This is for Yuchi Hua.

786
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,530
She didn't come to work again.

787
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,950
I guess she hasn't fully recovered.

788
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,050
Give this to her.

789
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,600
Don't tell her it's from me.

790
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,200
Yuan Mo.

791
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,100
You're buying a bracelet for Ah Shu

792
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,960
and prepared cold medicine for Yuchi Hua.

793
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,350
Do you think it's proper?

794
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,810
What's improper about it?

795
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,840
I thought you were just flippant,

796
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,090
but it turns out you're a total scumbag.

797
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,510
Give it to her yourself.

798
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,830
You…

799
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,040
You don't need to pay for the bracelet.

800
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,920
Wang Kunwu likes Hua, fine.

801
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,670
But who does Yuan Mo think he is?

802
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,580
How dare he like Yuchi Hua too?

803
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,110
He actually confessed his love when he was drunk.

804
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,180
He even touched her hands.

805
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,980
I grew up with Hua but have never touched her hands!

806
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,160
Retainer An.

807
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,990
Mr. Yu wants you to go to the council chamber for a meeting immediately.

808
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,610
Got it.

809
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,460
You two must have noticed that

810
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,870
there have been some changes in the situation

811
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,390
that are favorable to us.

812
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,340
All states have sent us letters

813
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,270
and agreed to reconsider the alliance.

814
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,870
To prevent the failure last time

815
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,910
from happening again,

816
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,310
I've decided to take a different approach.

817
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,060
Tackle them one by one.

818
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,960
The East and West Courts will negotiate with them separately

819
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,820
to reach an initial agreement with the five states.

820
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,550
Then, the Ministry of Rites and the envoys will gather together

821
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,920
to announce the formation of the alliance.

822
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,710
The one who contributes the most to it will be rewarded with fifty taels of silver

823
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,110
and promoted to Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

824
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
Sifang Envoy?

825
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,450
What is that position?

826
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,260
Retainer Wang, you were in the army,

827
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,770
so you may not know about it.

828
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,100
The Sifang Envoy of Yong

829
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,590
will be bestowed by the emperor with the dragon banner and the lion emblem.

830
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,870
He shall visit different states on behalf of Yong,

831
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,110
going south to Duluo

832
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,470
and traveling west beyond the Yanzhi Pass.

833
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,870
Meeting the Sifang Envoy

834
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,990
is like meeting the emperor of Yong.

835
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,270
Traveling around for state affairs

836
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,640
is not only a supreme honor

837
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,260
but also a dangerous task.

838
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,450
Few people are capable enough for it.

839
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,000
It's unprecedented

840
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,680
for people your age

841
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,510
to be among the candidates.

842
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,880
It's always been my dream to become the Sifang Envoy.

843
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,810
The East Court

844
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,430
will do our best to make the alliance form.

845
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,440
This is a serious matter.

846
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,680
The East and West Courts must work together.

847
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,520
Mr. Yu.

848
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,800
Are you going to make the West Court assist the East Court again?

849
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,790
Am I the kind of superior

850
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,990
who plays favorites?

851
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,140
I've come up with a wonderful idea.

852
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Draw lots.

853
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,130
Fair enough, isn't it?

854
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,710
There are five states.

855
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,670
Why are there only two pieces of paper?

856
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,850
Among the five states,

857
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,190
Yuluo and Mobei are the most difficult to convince.

858
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,320
If we can sway Yuluo,

859
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,920
they'll just need to make small compromises

860
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,560
to convince Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

861
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,800
Yueying and Mobei are bound by marriage.

862
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,930
They keep fighting,

863
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,480
but in fact, Yueying relies a lot on Mobei.

864
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,880
Swaying Mobei means swaying Yueying.

865
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,110
Looks like

866
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,880
you've done your homework, Retainer An.

867
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,390
But I wasn't asking you.

868
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,180
You enlightened me, Retainer Wang.

869
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,110
I have a lot to learn and must work hard.

870
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,440
I wasn't drunk that day.

871
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,570
I remember

872
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,630
what you told me.

873
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,910
All right.

874
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,510
Is everything clear?

875
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,640
Pick one.

876
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,690
Retainer Wang.

877
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,780
You go first.

878
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,830
Yueying and Mobei.

879
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,660
Then the West Court will deal with these two states.

880
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,190
So naturally, the East Court will handle

881
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,870
Yuluo, Dongyuan, and Xiyuan.

882
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,710
Remember.

883
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,050
The one who makes the alliance form will get a big reward.

884
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,340
You may leave.

885
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,050
Xiuyi.

886
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,480
Is there something else?

887
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,270
Why do you favor me?

888
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,280
What do you mean?

889
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,510
I guess

890
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,440
on the other piece of paper,

891
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,950
it's also Mobei and Yueying, right?

892
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,460
You…

893
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,420
It's all wet.

894
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,950
You deliberately made the West Court deal with Mobei, the trickier state,

895
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,690
and gave me the easier task.

896
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,630
Is it because you don't trust me?

897
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,950
Xiuyi.

898
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,950
If I did this in the past,

899
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,750
I would be favoring you.

900
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,910
But I'm doing this now because I like you.

901
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,960
Think about it.

902
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,350
After all that's happened,

903
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,020
do you still not know what your shortcomings are?

904
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,360
You always bite off more than you can chew.

905
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,690
Since you became the retainer of the East Court,

906
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,650
you've been trying to make great achievements.

907
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,360
But what leads to failure

908
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,430
is usually these small details.

909
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,780
Am I right?

910
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,170
Think about it.

911
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,910
Negotiating with Yuluo, Dongyuan, and Xiyuan

912
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,960
seems

913
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,150
an easy task,

914
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,890
but the relationships between the three states are complicated.

915
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,820
There are many intricate matters.

916
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,630
So you must think carefully

917
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,190
about every detail.

918
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,990
Otherwise, you may repeat your mistake.

919
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,450
This is a test for you.

920
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,270
What do you think?

921
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,100
You can understand my arrangement now, can't you?

922
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,910
Mr. Yu,

923
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,430
I…

924
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,110
You don't need to say anything.

925
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,780
Remember.

926
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,920
No foreign affair is too small.

927
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,450
Go.

928
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,540
This is a great chance to form the alliance.

929
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,830
We're aware of it.

930
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,890
Yanle must know it too.

931
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,730
So we have to hurry.

932
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,030
Don't worry.

933
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,550
Everything is arranged.

934
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,440
Speaking of arrangements,

935
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,510
I heard that

936
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,320
you've given the easy task to the East Court

937
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,550
and the tough one to the West Court.

938
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,230
Is that true?

939
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,990
Be honest with me.

940
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,470
Okay.

941
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,440
I really can't hide anything from you.

942
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,170
In the past, because of you,

943
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,470
I favored Xiuyi.

944
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,750
But this time,

945
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,140
I want to give Yuan Mo an opportunity to improve himself.

946
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,460
Think about it.

947
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,870
No matter which state I let Xiuyi deal with,

948
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,760
he can handle it well.

949
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,560
Right?

950
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,390
But Yuan Mo is different.

951
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,400
He has been working in the Sifang Pavilion for months

952
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,670
and just made some achievements.

953
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,550
I want to strike while the iron is hot

954
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,950
and make him grow faster.

955
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,980
If you think

956
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,540
I'm partial on this matter,

957
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,210
I won't deny it.
