[Episode 4]

4
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,110
I chatted with Yu for a long time.

5
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,030
I'm so thirsty.

6
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,390
-No!
-No!

7
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,160
What's the smell of this water?

8
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,720
What are you guys doing?

9
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,509
-Oh no.
-Oh no.

10
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,110
Well...

12
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,310
What should we do now?

13
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,810
Be careful! Be careful!

14
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,430

Ah Shu, figure out a solution now!

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,910
Figure out a solution now!

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,710
Hang in there.

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,230

This is Yuan Mo.

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,670
Hurry up!

Hurry! Hurry, Ah Shu!

40
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,980
I'm sorry, Wang.

41
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,680
I didn't do it on purpose.

42
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,130
Shouldn't you apologize to me first?

43
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,510
My pants are wet.

44
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,070
Water.

45
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,040
It's the water spilt by him.

46
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,190
What are you thinking about?

47
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,230
It's my fault.

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
I didn't anticipate the consequences.

49
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,340
I'm sorry, everyone.

50
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,560
Thank you, guys.

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,630
It's been two years.

52
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,000
I finally saw my buddies again.

53
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,280
You're welcome.

54
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,230
By the way,

55
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,030
what were you shouting

56
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,570
when you were out of your mind?

57
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,350
Jin?

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,060
He's your buddy, isn't he?

59
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,050
What's wrong with him?

60
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,110
Nothing.

61
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,990
It looks like Dragon Scale Grass and Soul-restoring Incense

62
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,650
can really make people crazy.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,710
How did you feel after being poisoned?

64
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,250
My head ached so badly.

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,990
I saw that Yuan Mo was tied with a rope

66
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,430
which was as red as blood

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,860
and was very dazzling.

68
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,670
A powerful force seemed to be attracting me

69
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
to go towards him.

70
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,960
Look at you two.

71
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,550
It was fine that you tied me up,

72
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,180
but you shouldn't have found a red rope,

73
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,330
and I was almost killed because of it.

74
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,210
Could it be that the person poisoned by it

75
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,120
will take red as the target?

76
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,650
Then Cao Huo...

77
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,170
Do you remember in the center

78
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,630
of the banquet hall that day,

79
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,310
there was a red carpet?

80
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,350
And the fan which Ms. Hua tossed to Dou Chun

81
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,230
was also red.

82
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,190
So someone poisoned Cao Huo on purpose?

83
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,250
And his real target was...

84
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,550
Dou Chun.

85
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,110
So he wasn't trying to poison the chairman of the Mobei Chamber of Commerce,

86
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,070
but to take advantage of his madness

87
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,200
to kill General Dou?

88
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,030
Let's go.

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,590

Well... Well...

92
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,590
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,350
It's not us.

94
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,740
It's you.

95
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,150
You can go by yourself.

96
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm not going.

97
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,990
Your brain is still useful.

98
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,990
I need you to continue to analyze it.

99
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,750
I'm not a member of your Sifang Pavilion.

100
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,790
Why should I listen to you?

101
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,320
Let go of me now! Let go of me!

102

Come on! Come on!

109
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,470
You're so noisy.

110
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,250
I'll ask you one last time.

111
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,120
Are you going or not?

112
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,850

113
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,120
Okay.

What are you doing?

120
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,950
Why are you yelling?

121
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,909
You're not serious at all.

122
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,840
Go aside to play.

123
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
Ah Shu, take him away!

It's not important.

127
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,790
What can I do for you, Mr. Yu?

128
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,330
After you get off work,

129
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,440
empty the office of the East Court.

130
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,350
You guys had better move back to the West Court.

131
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,090
Why?

132
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,910
Why?

133
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,670
You guys from the West Court

134
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,070
took away the task of our East Court previously.

135
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,470
What happened in the end?

136
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,590
There was a murder in Governor Dou's mansion.

137
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,510
We haven't found the murderer yet so far.

138
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,080
Cao Huo was in charge of the Mobei people in the West Market.

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,670
But now they're all here to ask us for the murderer.

140
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,740
And the foreign merchants

141
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,910
are all staying in the mansion and are unable to leave.

142
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,070
Don't you know how much trouble

143
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,310

I'll leave the rest of it to your East Court.

149
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,110
There are not many Mobei people in the West Market,

150
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,799
but they are fond of bravery and fighting.

151
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,110
They tend to cause trouble easily.

152
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,350
You must handle it properly.

153
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,679
Don't let any problem occur again. Got it?

154
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,809
Please don't worry, Mr. Yu.

155
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,030
I've asked Susu to do it.

156
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,500
Okay.

157
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,669
The professional tasks

158
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,559
should be handled by professional people.

159
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,270
Am I right?

160
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,850
Yes, yes.

As for you guys from the West Court, go back to do the job of affixing seals.

164
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,440
This is an order.

165
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,700
Wait

166
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,190
I don’t care if others go back to the West Court.

As the Advisor of the Ministry of Justice,

168
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,190
I request that Wang Kunwu should assist in the investigation of this case.

170
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,870
Our East Court can also assist you in your investigation.

171
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,470
You?

172
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,630
Okay.

173
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,880
Then let me ask you.

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,690
How did Cao Huo die?

175
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,350
What was the situation of the crime scene?

176
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,710
Who was the murderer's real target?

177
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,270
The real target?

178
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,510
So this case is not over yet?

Mr. Yu.

180
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,190
It's an important matter.

181
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,830
I think we should...

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,560
Ms. Yuchi, please go ahead.

192
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,430
Who decorated the banquet hall that day?

193
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,290
I decorated it.

194
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,070
So the red carpet under the Governor's table

195
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,150
was also put by you?

196
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,390
The Governor moved to a new house.

197
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,670
There were many red decorations in his mansion

198
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,510
mainly for the purpose of celebrating it.

199
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,310
Those were just some common banquet decorations.

200
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,110
What?

201
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,180
Is this related to Cao Huo's death?

202
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,670
Nothing.

203
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,230
The guests who attended the banquet that day

204
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,630
live here respectively.

205
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,150
If you want to ask them,

206
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,660
please do it by yourselves.

207
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,490
I'll leave you alone.

208
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,670
Thank you.

209
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,330
What the butler said makes sense.

210
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,290
There is nothing suspicious.

211
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,890
Let's split up and ask the guests.

212
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,440
You two.

213
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,760
Go to that room.

214
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,190
Wang Kunwu.

215
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,030
You really don't treat me as an outsider, do you?

216
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,760
You just treat me as your subordinate, don't you?

217
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,140
I think Ms. Hua is playing the Pipa so well.

218
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,840
But I don't like listening to it.

219
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,050
Finally, someone is here.

220
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,060
You two are here to investigate the case, right?

221
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,990
Let me tell you.

222
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,870
I thought about it all night.

223
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,820
There must be something fishy about Cao Huo's death.

224
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,510
You feel quite at ease while talking to strangers.

225
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,610
Sit. Officers, please sit down.

226
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,550
Have a seat.

227
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,920
Please sit down.

228
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,740
Come on. Tell me about it.

229
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,030
Do you still remember what happened

230
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,270
before Cao Huo was possessed by a ghost?

231
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,030
The strong wind blew out the candles?

232
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,230
What happened before that?

233
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,270
Ms. Hua danced with a fan?

234
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,070
That's right.

235
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,310
Soon after she tossed the fan to the Governor,

236
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,840
the candles went out.

237
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,510
Then Cao Huo went crazy.

238
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,200
So there must be something wrong with Ms. Hua.

239
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,470
Young man.

240
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,750
Look. I've provided you

241
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,270
with such an important clue.

242
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,390
Can you let me out first?

243
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,320
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,860
Not yet.

245
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,390
How long are you going to lock me up?

246
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,270
It's not a big problem for others.

247
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,150
But I still have a lot of business

248
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,000
which I need to deal with urgently.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,290
What's more,

250
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,350
the travel pass issued by the Sifang Pavilion

251
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,630
will expire soon.

252
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,630
If I don't renew it soon,

253
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,470
I'll be kicked out of Changle.

254
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,360
What business do you do?

255
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,140
I just... do some ordinary business.

256
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,870
If my guess is right,

257
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,890
you do spice business, right?

258
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,670
The Soul-restoring Incense offered by Cao Huo

259
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,680
was bought from him.

260
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,310
Buddy.

261
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,070
Don't talk nonsense.

262
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,710
Soul-restoring Incense is for sale in my shop.

263
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,040
But I have so many shops.

264
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,950
How do you know

265
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,500
it was bought from my shop?

266
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,000
Even if it had been bought from my shop,

267
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,470
I didn't kill anyone.

268
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,630
You smelled the incense yesterday, too.

269
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,160
He was possessed by a ghost.

270
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,310
Yes, yes, yes.

271
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,960
He was possessed by the ghost of Wei Yunqi.

272
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,310
Why are you nervous?

273
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,950
I'm not nervous. I just...

274
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,470
Why aren't you making a written statement?

275
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,170
You're not from the Jingzhao Prefecture, are you?

276
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,210
You're from the Sifang Pavilion?

277
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Neither is right.

278
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,860
How about this?

279
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,710
Take the money

280
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,430
and find a way to let me out.

281
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,600
Think about it.

282
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,350
You are not an official.

283
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,360
This is not against the law.

284
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,570
I really can't afford to waste time anymore.

285
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,950
I really can't do this.

286
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,470
Got it.

287
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,960
With just a Pipa,

288
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,800
you could perform the grand song, Dance of the Cavalry.

289
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,670
I admire you.

290
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm flattered, Retainer Wang.

291
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,750
I've been practicing it hard for ten years.

292
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,170
That's why I can master the essence of this song.

293
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,050
Ten years?

294
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,950
This song has been played in the palace

295
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,300
for no more than two or three years.

296
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,030
How did you know this song ten years ago?

297
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,400
There's something you don't know, Retainer Wang.

298
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,930
Although this song is the music of the palace,

299
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,010
it originated from the army at first.

300
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,790
When His Majesty was still the Governor,

301
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,030
after he defeated the invaders,

302
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,530
he wrote new lyrics for an old song in the army to celebrate it.

303
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,340
That was how the Dance of the Cavalry was created at first.

304
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,270
It seems that

305
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,350
it's been ten years till now.

306
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,090
I see.

307
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,470
But since it's the music of the army,

308
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,960
how come you can play it?

309
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,230
What?

310
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,210
Is this related to the soul-restoring murder case?

311
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,860
I'm just a weak woman.

312
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,180
I was lucky to be invited by the Governor to entertain everyone.

313
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,870
I didn't expect that something like this would happen.

314
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,750
Retainer Wang.

315
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,980
You have to speak up for me.

316
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,160
Why did you toss the red fan to the Governor

317
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,150
while you were dancing for him last night?

318
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,150
Retainer Wang, you don't know that?

319
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,350
It looks like you seldom go to a  brothel.

320
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,590
I've always danced with a red fan.

321
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,670
And the guests all consider getting the red fan

322
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,000
as a big joy.

323
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,310
Where is that red fan?

324
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,830
I gave it to the Governor.

325
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,720
What? Do you also want it, Retainer Wang?

326
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,800
As long as I can leave this place which is full of trouble,

327
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,190
not to mention a red fan,

328
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,430
I can give you anything you want.

329
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,910
It's not like what you're thinking.

330
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,270
I'm not thinking about anything.

331
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,350
Why are you having a guilty conscience?

332
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,550
What did you find out?

333
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,010
Ms. Hua knows the music of the army quite well.

334
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,410
That's unusual.

335
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,260
It's still about listening to the music.

336
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,770
You...

337
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,690
It feels so good to be rich.

338
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,950
This heavy feeling is so great.

339
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,110
What are you doing?

340
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,470
Where did you get so much gold and silver?

341
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,350
Yuchi.

342
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,950
You came at the right time.

343
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,190
There's something wrong with that foreign merchant, Guan Feng.

344
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,630
He's actually a spice businessman.

345
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,190
He was also the one who sold the Soul-restoring Incense to Cao Huo.

346
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,920
In addition,

347
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,030
he used this money to bribe Yuan Mo so that he could leave here.

348
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,710
Exactly.

349
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,440
He even wanted to bribe me?

350
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,230
How could he not think about whether I'm that kind of person?

351
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,960
Yes, you're.

352
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,210
Why do you think so?

353
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,950
I'm just trying them on.

354
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,859
[Shady willows and Blooming Flowers]

355
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,030
Buddies.

356
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,640
I've really been wronged, buddies.

357
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,950
Why are you arresting me?

358
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,210
Did you catch the wrong person, buddies?

359
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,850
You guys did this, right?

360
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,720
I gave you all the money, didn't I?

361
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,570
Go, go, go.

362
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,590
Buddies, I've really been wronged.

363
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,580
Buddies!

364
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,710
He's even trying to deny it?

365
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,170
He was caught red-handed.

366
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,970
He even wanted to bribe us?

367
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,160
No way.

368
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,420
Let's go, Ah Shu. Time to eat.

369
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,010
Wait.

370
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,330
What's wrong?

371
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,240
Take them out.

372
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,220
What... What should I take out?

373
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
Cut the crap.

374
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,480
Don't force me to use violence.

375
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,390
When did you hide them?

376
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,830
Wang Kunwu, let me tell you.

377
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,290
I'm just like your debtor.

378
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,110
Let's go.

379
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,950
There's more.

380
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,490
There's nothing else.

381
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,180
Look.

382
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,320
It's empty. There's nothing else.

383
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I'll do it myself.

384
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,030
Well,

385
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,740
I found such an important clue.

386
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,110
I just took a small sum of money.

387
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,430
What's wrong with that?

388
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,870
There's really nothing else this time.

389
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,530
It's empty.

390
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,490
Yuchi,

391
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,130
there must be more.

392
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,610
You...

393
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,330
Guards!

394
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,140
Yes!

395
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,300
Help him.

396
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,610
There's nothing else.

397
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,550
Pour them out.

398
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,550
Nothing else. There's really nothing else.

399
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,030
Go on.

400
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,550
No.

401
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,510
Wang Kunwu.

402
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,550
I haven't got even with you for breaking my arm.

403
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,010
Nothing else. There's really nothing else.

404
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,390
I heard that Wang Kunwu was scolded by Yu.

405
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,420
He didn't allow the West Court to interfere in the Governor's case.

406
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,920
It was not easy to get this task,

407
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,550
but it was taken away by An Xiuyi again.

408
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,670
In the future,

409
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,130
life will be hard for Ji and the others again.

410
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,510
There's nothing they can do.

411
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,790
That's because the people of the West Court don't have a say with their humble positions.

412
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,870
Why don’t you find a way to help them?

413
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
For example, finding the murderer.

414
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,660
I never help people for free.

415
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,010
Think about it. Just think about it carefully.

416
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,410
Sir.

417
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,790
Give me a portion.

418
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,310
Okay.

419
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,150
Please take it.

420
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,210
You're just treating me to this?

421
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,340
Aren't they just some pastry crumbs with sesame on them?

422
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,000
How stingy.

423
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,590
You don't understand it, do you?

424
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,430
It's true that these pastry crumbs can't be served in a banquet.

425
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,140
It's also a low-end dessert.

426
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,160
But after it's covered with this sesame and is fried,

427
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,390
it'll be both fragrant and crispy.

428
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,080
It's really delicious. Let me tell you.

429
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,350
It can't be served in a banquet and it's a low-end dessert.

430
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,410
Got it!

431
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,660
What do you mean?

432
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,860
I've been thinking

433
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,770
what phrase I should use

434
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,720
to describe you.

435
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,870
I finally figured it out.

436
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,230
These pastry crumbs can't be served in a banquet and are low-end desserts.

437
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,000
And you're also

438
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
not good enough to attend a banquet, and you're a low-end

439
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,640
and annoying man.

440
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,230
So I should call you

441
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,870
scum.

442
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,710
Scum.

443
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,130
It's such an appropriate word.

444
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,000
Retainer An.

445
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,980
What's the matter?

446
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,380
This case is not over yet.

447
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,470
Since you're in charge of this case,

448
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,790
let me remind you.

449
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,580
Beware of Ms. Hua.

450
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,670
Wang Kunwu.

451
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,080
Do you know what I hate the most about you?

452
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,700
What I hate the most

453
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,640
is your attitude of being in the high position.

454
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,540
You ask me to beware of Ms. Hua?

455
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,150
Don't I know I should beware of her?

456
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,750
I don't need you to remind me.

457
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,190
Why do you always think that you are better than me?

458
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,310
I've never thought so.

459
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,380
Then why do you always compete with me in every aspect?

460
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,640
I was demoted to this place from the army.

461
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,190
I don't aspire to make contributions,

462
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,120
but I just hope to make no mistakes.

463
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,680
Only after I get through this tough situaion

464
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,940
will the higher-ups probably transfer me back to the army.

465
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,710
I'm really getting more and more confused.

466
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,790
You've been working so hard in the Sifang Pavilion

467
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,190
just in order to leave the Sifang Pavilion?

468
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,040
It's up to you whether to believe it or not.

469
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,430
Investigate him.

470
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,110
Yes.

471
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,280
You mean

472
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,270
the bandit's target was the Governor?

473
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,630
Yes.

474
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,450
After the investigation of our East Court,

475
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,510
the murderer's target was Governor Dou.

476
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,270
So tonight,

477
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,730
the Governor must be transferred to a safe place

478
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,060
and be guarded closely.

479
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,790
Please take a look, Retainer An.

480
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,140
This place is surrounded by water.

481
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,880
There's only a small boat used as a ferry between it and the shore.

482
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,770
I've ordered the people to guard the shore more closely.

483
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,070
As long as this bandit goes into the water,

484
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,730
we will definitely catch him.

485
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,510
It turns out that Butler Jiang

486
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,410
has already figured out a safe measure for Uncle Dou.

487
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,330
I admire you.

488
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,340
Please don't worry, Butler Jiang.

489
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,310
Our East Court and the soldiers of the Jingzhao Prefecture

490
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,750
will certainly guard the place all night.

491
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,750
I'm sure not even a bird can fly over.

492
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,510
Thank you, Retainer An.

493
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,390
Greetings, Uncle.

494
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,310
Xiuyi?

495
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,980
Sit.

496
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,470
Uncle.

497
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,430
I'm here to tell you something important.

498
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,310
What is it?

499
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,640
Although this is a very safe place,

500
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,110
among all the guests,

501
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,320
you still need to beware of Ms. Hua.

502
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,200
Her?

503
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,230
Xiuyi,

504
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,240
I think you're just too careful.

505
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,920
Ms. Hua?

506
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,440
She's just a weak woman.

507
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,370
Even if she wants to kill me,

508
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,550
what can she do?

509
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,260
In the past few days,

510
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,030
you've been working so hard for me.

511
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,270
Tonight,

512
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,600
just drink with me.

513
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
What do you think?

514
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,460
I'll do as you wish.

515
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,280
I'd like to drink a toast to you.

516
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,010
Cheers.

517
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,090
Although the Governor is quite composed,

518
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,270
the bandit is still there and we have to be careful.

519
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,910
We still need to take special care of Ms. Hua.

520
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,320
Since she's the prime suspect,

521
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,670
and you are so worried,

522
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,020
I'll keep an eye on her personally.

523
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,420
Retainer An, please guard the door outside.

524
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,150
Just in case.

525
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,960
Don't worry.

526
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,980
Thanks.

527
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,220
Please forgive me if I didn't take good care of you.

528
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,500
What do you mean by doing this, Butler Jiang?

529
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,150
For the safety of the Governor,

530
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,390
I've decided to accompany you personally tonight.

531
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,410
Please forgive me, Ms. Hua.

532
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,990
You...

533
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,240
In the middle of the night,

534
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,110
you and I are alone in a room.

535
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,310
If this news gets out, how can I maintain my reputation in the future?

536
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,510
Don't worry, Ms. Hua.

537
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,420
I won't do anything improper.

538
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,720
Young Master.

539
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm fine.

540
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,740
You've just had a drink with the Governor.

541
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,870
Have some congee to warm your stomach.

542
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,010
Thank you.

543
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,060
Why don't you take a rest first tonight?

544
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,880
I'll guard this place for you.

545
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,830
Okay.

546
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,600
Thank you.

547
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,830
Judging from the coagulation of the blood,

548
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,050
I think he died around 12 o'clock last night.

549
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,190
There are disorderly knife wounds on the body.

550
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,020
There are three wounds altogether from the same weapon.

551
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,550
They are mainly in the chest

552
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,670
with different depths.

553
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,870
But the fatal attack is here.

554
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,420
Where were you at 12 o'clock last night?

555
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,790
Yesterday, Retainer An reported to the Governor that

556
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,190
Ms. Hua was suspected.

557
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,680
So... So I was in her room

558
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,390
to keep an eye on her all night last night.

559
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,990
Was there anything unusual?

560
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,100
She stayed up without going to sleep

561
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,510
and played the Pipa all night.

562
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,190
I guess

563
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,310
she was worried that I might do something improper to her.

564
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,710
Did she go out of her room?

565
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,380
No, she didn't.

566
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,510
Retainer An guarded the room outside.

567
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,640
He can testify, too.

568
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,210
You were there all night?

569
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,650
I...

570
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,140
Were you there or not?

571
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,990
I had a drink with the Governor last night.

572
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,840
Later, I felt very tired and sleepy,

573
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,960
so I left first.

574
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,440
But Susu was there all night.

575
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,500
And the people of the East Court, too.

576
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,390
I guarded the room outside all night.

577
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,830
Including Ms. Hua,

578
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,680
no guests in the mansion left their own rooms.

579
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,790
What's more, I've asked the guards.

580
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,510
No one went into the water last night.

581
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,390
So the murderer couldn't have come inside

582
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,450
the Mid-lake Pavilion from outside.

583
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,490
Did a ghost come?

584
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,070
[Sifang Pavilion]

585
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,270
I told you to beware of Ms. Hua.

586
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,470
What did you do?

587
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,800
I also wanted to ask you.

588
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,870
We listened to you

589
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,990
and kept an eye on Ms. Hua all night.

590
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,470
But she never left the room.

591
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,150
Did you play tricks on me by telling me some fake news deliberately?

592
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,070
Nonsense!

593
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,510
You just hated me for taking away your credit,

594
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,110
so you set a trap on purpose so that I would make a fool of myself, right?

595
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,070
I wouldn't do such a meaningless thing.

596
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,670
Really?

597
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,510
You didn't do the job as the Guoyi Commandant of the Mingwei Prefecture,

598
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,710
but you came to our Sifang Pavilion to be a civil servant.

599
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,350
Do you think no one will know

600
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,890
your scandals if you don't talk about them?

601
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,750
What did you say?

602
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,710
What did I say?

603
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,590
Isn't it your specialty

604
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,230
to frame your colleagues?

605
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,270
Back then in the desert,

606
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,030
those several buddies in the army

607
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,410
died because of you, weren't they?

608
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,540
You are not worthy of mentioning them!

609
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,430
Young Master, be careful!

610
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,630
-Why did you hit him?
-Why did you hit him?

611
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,270
Stop!

612
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,360
Are you all that ill-behaved?

613
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,350
This is the Sifang Pavilion!

614
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,880
It's not a barbarous place.

615
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,920
Get out, you all!

616
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,930
How should I criticize you two?

617
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,070
It's fine for you to argue with each other.

618
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,110
But how could you fight with each other

619
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,040
in front of your colleagues today?

620
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,240
No matter what caused your fight just now,

621
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,640
Retainer Wang,

622
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,930
from now on, don't fight again in the Sifang Pavilion.

623
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,650
Understand?

624
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,250
Rules are rules.

625
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,080
Though I look like an easy-going man normally,

626
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,760
if it happens again next time,

627
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,010
I won't tolerate it.

628
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,830
Retainer An.

629
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,690
There are some things you can say,

630
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,070
but there are some things you can't say.

631
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,950
Understand?

632
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,590
Similarly,

633
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,270
there are some things you can do,

634
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,630
but there are some things you just can't do.

635
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,910
Since I asked you to receive the foreign officials, you should've done so.

636
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,870
Why did you take up the job of guarding the mansion at night?

637
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,210
Now Vice Minister An is asking me whether Dou Chun's death

638
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,990
has anything to do with our Sifang Pavilion.

639
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,150
How do you think I can explain it to him?

640
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,640
I'll reply to Vice Minister An myself.

641
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,770
I won't make things difficult for you, Mr. Yu.

642
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,120
Susu.

643
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,190
Take Retainer An to deal with it.

644
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,740
Yes.

645
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,120
Retainer An.

646
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,650
Retainer Wang.

647
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,290
I beg you. Stop asking for trouble. Okay?

648
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,830
Just pity the dozens of people in the Sifang Pavilion.

649
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,990
They all rely on this job to support their family.

650
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,150
Buddies.

651
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,370
Retainer Wang?

652
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,190
Assistant Minister Tan.

653
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,410
What brings you here?

654
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,160
I often come here to have a drink when I'm free.

655
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,730
You're not on duty today?

656
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,860
I'm not a member of the Sifang Pavilion after all.

657
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,910
Would you like to have a drink with me?

658
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,590
Sure.

659
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,030
Bring me a pot of wine.

660
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,470
Yes.

661
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,230
Sit.

662
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,380
You were demoted to the Sifang Pavilion

663
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,090
because of them, right?

664
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,570
I know a little about you.

665
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,250
You want to return to the army, right?

666
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,120
I want to go back to Wuzhou

667
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,930
to eliminate the Faceless Man and take revenge for my buddies.

668
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
The Faceless Man is mysterious.

669
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,900
Even if you return to Wuzhou,

670
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,330
I'm afraid you won't find any clues.

671
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,650
Wang Kunwu.

672
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,570
What do you think of being demoted

673
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,770
to the Sifang Pavilion?

674
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,420
It was the punishment from the superiors as I acted recklessly.

675
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,150
Look at this wine pot.

676
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,150
It was just a piece of unpainted clayware before calcination.

677
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,250
Only after calcination can it become useful.

678
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,270
Wang Kunwu.

679
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,360
Sifang Pavilion

680
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,980
is the most well-informed place in the world.

681
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,310
For you, it can be a cage,

682
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,040
but it can also be a furnace to forge weapons.

683
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,320
It's never too late for a gentleman to take revenge.

684
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,150
Wang Kunwu.

685
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,260
In order to take revenge,

686
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,580
how long can you wait?

687
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,590
Let go of me!

688
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,230
If we find the murderer together,

689
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,030
then you won't feel upset, will you?

690
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,360
There are not any clues.

691
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,710
Soon the whole Changle City will know that

692
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,110
the Jingzhao Prefecture is quite useless.

693
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,360
Where are you going?

694
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,330
I've worked so hard

695
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,790
because I don't want to embarrass my father!

696
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,100
Why are you so angry?

697
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,960
[The Key of Law Is Stability]

698
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,840
Why are you here?

699
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,230
I'm here to calm you down.

700
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,179
Do you have any clues?

701
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,340
Don't forget that

702
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,550
I was the one who deduced that

703
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,550
the murderer's target was Dou Chun.

704
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,310
Yes.

705
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,650
What's that saying?

706
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,160
It's just sheer luck for a blind cat to catch a dead mouse.

707
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,430
Your Yong dialect has improved a lot.

708
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,390
You are not a blind cat.

709
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,450
Go catch a dead mouse and show it to me.

710
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,370
Although this brat is annoying,

711
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,850
he's kind of a capable man.

712
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,000
Whatever he does, his goal is to gain benefits.

713
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,030
Just tell me what condition you want.

714
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,310
As a citizen of Yong,

715
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,080
can't I even have the awareness of

716
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,670
finding the real murderer and bringing justice

717
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,310
to the dead people?

718
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,090
Speak in human language.

719
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,220
I need to raise maids

720
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,770
and I'm short of money.

721
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,160
You said that the depths of these three knife wounds on the body were different?

722
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,800
Yes.

723
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,680
I think it was caused by the murderer's unstable emotions

724
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,080
when he tried to kill him.

725
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,630
There's a second possibility.

726
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,420
There was more than one murderer.

727
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,480
I've thought about it, too.

728
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,430
It's likely that multiple people committed the crime.

729
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,090
There's a third possibility.

730
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,750
There was only one murderer.

731
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,870
He did that in order to confuse us.

732
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,770
That makes sense, too.

733
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,990
There's a fourth possibility.

734
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,550
No.

735
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,050
There's no fifth one.

736
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,110
But there is really a fourth possibility.

737
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,630
Tell me.

738
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,290
The murderer guessed that

739
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,270
I could guess that he might be confusing us.

740
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,920
So he deliberately created a facade of confusing us

741
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,180
in order to confuse us.

742
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,180
What?

743
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,820
You must be very puzzled.

744
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,630
It's okay. This is not important.

745
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,490
What matters is

746
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,990
how the murderer avoided all the guards

747
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,980
and went into this pavilion.

748
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,320
Nothing.

749
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,020
Is there anything special?

750
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,630
No.

751
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,610
There's nothing special.

752
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,200
This is the wine which the Governor drank last night.

753
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,180
What's wrong?

754
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,740
It has a different smell.

755
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,310
They are the same kind of wine.

756
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,630
Though they are the same kind of wine,

757
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,350
the wine in the cup

758
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,630
has one more smell than the wine in the pot.

759
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,950
Did someone put drugs in it?

760
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,920
An Xiuyi also had a drink here last night.

761
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,800
He felt very tired and sleepy after that.

762
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
He fell asleep very soon.

763
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,350
I found it.

764
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,070
I found it.

765
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,090
What did you find?

766
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,590
Important evidence.

767
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,290
Where is it?

768
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,490
Look.

769
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,350
Ah Shu, come on.

770
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:23,900
Come on.

771
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,870
A secret passage?

772
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,440
Let's go down and have a look.

773
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,150
Okay.

774
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,290
I still have to rely on myself.

775
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,680
If they are safe when they're back,

776
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,410
go down with me to have a look.

777
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,840
Are you having fun here?

778
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,410
Go in front of me.

779
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,230
I thought you were very bold.

780
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,920
We've just passed by the fork road.

781
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,060
Those who are in front of us won't know that we're inside here.

782
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,460
But those who are behind us might know that.

783
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,630
It's so dark.

784
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,150
I can't see anything.

785
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,150
Why didn't you take out the fire stick earlier?

786
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,300
Who is it?

787
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,720
What does this have to do with us?

788
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,670
How could you lock us up for so long?

789
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,070
Let's leave here at once.

790
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,030
What a big trouble.

791
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,090
[Luxuriant Grass and Trees in Spring]

792
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,230
What a waste of time.

793
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,870
This is ridiculous!

794
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,330
I'm sorry.

795
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,530
Forgive me if I didn't take good care of you.

796
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,540
What's going on?

797
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,910
We came here for dinner.

798
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,430
I'm sorry.

799
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,160
What a waste of our time.

800
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,590
I told you it had nothing to do with us.

801
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,830
But you insisted on locking us up.

802
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,990
Alright. Let's go home now to take a rest.

803
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,570
You've locked us up for so many days for no reason.

804
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,410
How could you do this?

805
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:39,930
Yes.

806
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,590
Forgive me if I didn't take good care of you.

807
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,270
Butler Jiang, my condolences.

808
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,010
The murderer has admitted it and will be punished.

809
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,400
The case could be sovled successfully

810
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,560
mostly due to your help.

811
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,270
You've also worked very hard these days.

812
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,600
My master has just died.

813
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,340
I'm sorry but I can't see you off farther.

814
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,800
The four of you, follow me.

815
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,120
Is Yuan Mo's trick reliable?

816
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,470
What if those guests run away?

817
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,940
This brat is quite smart.

818
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,550
We can give it a try.

819
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,040
There's one more thing.

820
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,880
I need to go back to the Sifang Pavilion and ask about it clearly.

821
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,880
[Sifang Pavilion]

822
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,770
Yu.

823
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,020
We've really found out about the truth this time.

824
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,200
I don't believe it.

825
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,270
Don't lie to me.

826
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,920
How many times have you lied to me about this matter?

827
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,270
As for the report I'm going to submit to the Ministry of Rites,

828
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,830
I tore it and then wrote it again and again.

829
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,830
How old am I?

830
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,160
I can't bear your torture like this, can I?

831
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,580
It's true this time.

832
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,150
This is definitely the final conclusion.

833
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,760
Alright.

834
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,390
Then tell me who the murderer is.

835
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,400
We haven't caught him yet.

836
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
What did I say?

837
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,750
You're just trying to fool me.

838
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,880
Because before we catch the murderer,

839
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,030
there's something

840
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,470
I want you to help me with.

841
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,380
I can help you,

842
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,030
as long as the case can be solved as soon as possible.

843
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,840
Just tell me.

844
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,190
Although the murderer has been confirmed,

845
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,210
we're still not clear about his motive.

846
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,470
For the sake of caution,

847
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,950
the Jingzhao Prefecture has released everyone temporarily.

848
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,150
On one hand, we can keep an eye on the murderer secretly.

849
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,260
On the other hand, I can ask you carefully

850
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,050
about the reasons and consequences of Wei Yunqi's rebellion case back then.

851
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,450
Wei Yunqi?

852
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,950
Is this case closely related to him?

853
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,310
It's very closed related to him.
