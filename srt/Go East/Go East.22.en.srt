[Episode 22]

3
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,250
I just want to ask you

4
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,190
if you stayed

5
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,789
partly because of me.

6
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,300
Yes.

7
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,910
I have you in my heart.

8
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,590
But please forgive me.

9
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,090
I can't accept your feelings right now.

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,670
Why?

11
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,740
Why?

12
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,690
In every dream of mine,

13
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,150
my brothers ask me the same thing.

14
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,480
Why haven't I caught the Man in White?

15
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,390
Why haven't I avenged them?

16
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,079
Why am I the only one

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,329
living in this world alone?

18
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,640
I can't answer them.

19
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,470
When

20
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,110
I can answer their question,

21
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,860
I can answer you too.

22
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,840
We just need to catch the Man in White, right?

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't think it's mutually exclusive.

24
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,830
We can even catch the Man in White together.

25
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,150
I can help you.

26
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm ready to die

27
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,400
for this any time.

28
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,870
But you don't have to do that.

29
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,150
You should live a better life

30
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,620
and find someone who cares about you more.

31
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,220
That person shouldn't be me.

32
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,680
He shouldn't be someone with a grudge in his heart,

33
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,990
blood on his blade,

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,310
and a death wish in his mind.

35
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,890
I have you in my heart.

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,150
But I'm sorry.

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,210
Okay.

38
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,360
I see.

39
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,910
So...

40
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,930
It didn't work out?

41
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,570
Susu.

42
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,980
Book me the best balcony seat

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,740

44
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,360

Make way.

48
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,920
Don't step on it.

49
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
You're in the way.

50
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,150
You don't have to do this.

51
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,420
Leave it to the clerks.

52
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,150
It's not clean at all. Look.

53
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,350
The floor is covered with bits of paper.

54
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,190
What are you doing? I'm sweeping the floor.

55
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,190
Get out of the way.

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,030
If you're really upset, you...

57
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,070
I'm not.

58
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,190
You are.

59
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
I've figured it out

61
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,790
You are worried that

you will die any time

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,190
while catching the Man in White.

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,790
So, you dare not accept me in advance.

65
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,650
You don't want to delay me, right?

66
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,520
How about this?

67
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,350
From now on,

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,720
I just need to do one thing,

71
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,280
to protect you.

72
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,560
Protect me?

73
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,320
Yes. I just need to

74
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,560
ensure that you safely

75
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,870

76
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,159
and avenge your brothers without dying.

77
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,950
Then, you will have nothing to worry about,

78
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,300
and we can be together for the rest of our lives.

79
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,990
Wouldn't that be perfect for both of us?

80
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,190
That makes sense.

81
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,910
But why do I still feel something is wrong?

82
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,500
It's a deal.

83
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,490
Little Xiu.

84
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,940
Why are you here?

85
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,330
Give me your hand.

Hurry up.

91
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,630
I didn't want to go since you invited me last time.

92
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,760
Fortunately, I was needed elsewhere.

93
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,659
You're inviting me again.

Hua.

96
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,090
When was the last time

97
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,240
we had a meal together like this?

98
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
Twenty years ago.

99
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,310
That time, you stole money from your home

100
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,550
and bought me sugar paintings.

101
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,950
But your father found out

102
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,630
and almost beat you to death.

103
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,820
Forget it.

104
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,770
Let's not talk about that.

105
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,340
Here.

106
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,520
Try this dish. It's delicious.

107
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,880
Just speak your mind.

108
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,870
Don't beat around the bush.

109
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,960
Okay.

110
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,580
I'll tell you then.

111
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,350
I was at Ruyi Pavilion last night.

112
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,760
I didn't eavesdrop.

113
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,370
I don't know what you guys were talking about.

114
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,060
But I can see that Wang Kunwu rejected you.

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
What else did you see?

116
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,910
Do I have to tell you?

117
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,270
I'll leave if you don't.

118
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,070
I'll tell you.

119
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,540
Hua.

120
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,870
Wang Kunwu doesn't deserve this.

121
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,900
He doesn't deserve what?

122
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,500
He's letting your love down.

123
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,780
Do you know what love is?

124
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,300
Letting down you say...

125
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,679
How can you say that?

126
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,909
Isn't it obvious?

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,390
Wang Kunwu doesn't like you.

128
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,230
It's useless no matter how nice you are to him.

129
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,590
Why don't you save your love

130
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,429
for the right person?

131
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,470
What do you mean?

132
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,110
Isn't it obvious?

133
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,790
Me.

134
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,230
Hua! Wait.

135
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,270
Hua! Hua!

136
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,130
Little Xiu!

137
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,550
I knew it!

138
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,270
Ever since I went to Sifang Pavilion,

139
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,020
something felt wrong whenever I saw you.

140
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,680
So you're waiting for me here.

141
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,950
We're friends who grew up together.

142
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,820
How dare you think that of me?

143
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,920
I'm not thinking anything bad!

144
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,950
I really like you!

145
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,310
Enough! Calm down.

146
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,240
Why do you suddenly have an ulterior motive towards me?

147
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,470
We grew up together since childhood

148
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,000
and we know each other well.

149
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,350
Your father is Duke Er

150
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,110
and my father is an official.

151
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,010
Our family status match.

152
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,630
Now both of us are in Sifang Pavilion,

153
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,550
you're in charge of West Court

154
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,550
and I'm in charge of East Court.

155
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,310
We're evenly matched.

156
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,390
All conditions are suitable.

157
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,150
Isn't this a perfect match?

158
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,630
Bah!

159
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,310
Perfect match? No way!

160
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,200
Hua. Hua.

161
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,400
Get out of my way!

162
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,080
No.

163
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,230
I must make it clear to you today.

164
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,430
An Xiuyi.

165
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,600
Who taught you all this?

166
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,430
Childhood sweethearts and matching family status?

167
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,230
Why are you as old-fashioned as my father?

168
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,330
Besides, is this appropriate?

169
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,140
Why not?

170
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,400
What do you like about me?

171
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,800
I...

172
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,610
I...

173
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,850
Okay, forget words, let's use actions.

174
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,310
Hug me.

175
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,920
All of a sudden?

176
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,760
Hug me.

177
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,570
Are you afraid or don't you know how?

178
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,780
Why would I be afraid?

179
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,680
Fine.

180
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,550
Is this a hug?

181
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,880
How do you feel?

182
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,470
A little awkward.

183
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,080
Kiss me.

184
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,510
Don't you like me? Kiss me.

185
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,600
No, no, no.

186
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,160
Don't be like this.

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,360
Right? Isn't it strange?

188
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Isn't it awkward?

189
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,330
We are friends

190
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,200
who grew up together.

191
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,020

Since you are here, please sit down.

213

Yanle has been working with The Faceless for years,

I didn't expect you to come here.

What brings you here today?

217
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,890
Yuan Mo from the Sifang Pavilion

218

Have you noticed her?

220
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,050
I'm the envoy of Yanle.

221
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,480
Why would I pay attention to a maid?

222
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,790
If I'm not mistaken,

223
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,050
she is the girl Viceroy Long is looking for.

How is that possible?

225
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,060
She has already become a citizen of Changle

226

It seems that you think I’ve been too idle recently.

Viceroy Long has asked me to cooperate with you.

Girls shouldn't casually show their feet to others.

380
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm not someone else. I...

381
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,570
I just won't let you do it.

382
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,900
As the Mandarin saying goes,

383
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,480
do not look at what is contrary to propriety.

384
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,110
I just learned it.

385
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,330
Fine, you wash your feet yourself.

386
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,480
Be careful. The water is a bit hot.

387
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,370
Got it.

388
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,670
Let me know when you're done.

389
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,810
Remember to renew the contract.

390
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,210
Okay.

391
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,390
How has business been recently?

392
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,910
Not bad.

393
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,090
Do the shoes fit?

394
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,760
Please come again.

395
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,200
Okay.

396
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,800
Bosslady,

397
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,720
I didn't check your official certificate yesterday.

398
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,680
I'm here to check it today.

399
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,520
Wait a minute.

400
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,630
My Lord.

401
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,110
Someone else looked after the shop yesterday.

402
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,100
[Official certificate]

403
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,440
Someone else?

404
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,780
It was a tall woman yesterday, right?

405
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,980
Your younger sister.

406
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,430
You must be mistaken.

407
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,310
I don't have any tall girl here.

408
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,440
I went back to my parents' house with my husband yesterday.

409
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,790
We didn't open the shop.

410
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,160
Why are you here?

411
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,630
They're from the Yanle Embassy.

412
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,220
Okay, I'm done.

413
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,910
This is just your speculation.

414
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,790
Is it reliable?

415
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,960
I think it's very reliable.

416
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,160
First of all,

417
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,140
someone opened the closed shoe shop

418
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,710
to pretend it was opening for business.

419
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,120
There was no customer when I went in.

420
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,600
There were only three Yanle people and Ah Shu.

421
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,900
Two of the three Yanle people

422
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,760
are men of Deputy Envoy Kang from the Yanle Embassy.

423
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,660
Besides,

424
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,030
instead of opening other shops,

425
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,560
the Yanle people

426
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,630
opened a closed shoe shop to stop Ah Shu.

427
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,670
And they insisted on changing her shoes.

428
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,300
The only reason for that is

429
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,020
they wanted to check her feet.

430
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,150
I can't think of another reason.

431
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,550
They think Ah Shu has a special mark on either of her feet.

432
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,760
Most importantly,

433
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,710
they

434
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,160
are probably right.

435
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,650
Ah Shu is the one they're looking for?

436
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,740
How could it be?

437
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,490
I also thought it was impossible at first.

438
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,840
But last night,

439
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,220
Ah Shu's behavior

440
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,320
was very unusual.

441
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,120
She strongly resisted it when I tried to wash her feet.

442
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,440
She even kicked me out.

443
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,090
If it's really Ah Shu,

444
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,600
she's in great danger now.

445
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,150
Exactly.

446
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,120
Luckily, I showed up in time yesterday.

447
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,490
You have to help me with this.

448
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,200
I can't let Ah Shu be in danger.

449
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,110
We need to find out

450
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,480
who Ah Shu is

451
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,380
and why the Yanle Embassy and Man in White

452
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,640
want to find her first.

453
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,360
You can ask Ah Shu directly.

454
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,080
I told you she strongly resisted it.

455
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,280
She won't tell me.

456
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,590
What if she runs away from home

457
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,440
and doesn't talk to me anymore?

458
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,510
Go catch someone in the Yanle Embassy.

459
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,210
Put a sack on his head, beat him up, and force him to tell you.

460
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,080
Ridiculous.

461
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,330
How about this?

462
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,310
Go to someone who's not smart,

463
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,050
like Ma Zhiwen,

464
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,630
who was taught a lesson by Yuchi Hua last time.

465
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,360
Ask him out to interrogate him.

466
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,690
No, you can't interrogate him directly.

467
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,070
You can't let him realize you're interrogating him.

468
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,950
You can do that, right?

469
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,170
Do you know what you're talking about?

470
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,610
It's impossible to do that.

471
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,740
It's not impossible.

472
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,760
Do you have a way

473
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,930
to interrogate Ma Zhiwen?

474
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,530
I followed him for a few days.

475
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,700
I know a little about his private life.

476
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,890
But this method

477
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,100
is a bit improper.

478
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,000
Fairy Lady,

479
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,540
greetings.

480
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,380
Why did you come

481
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,600
today?

482
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,500
I've been doing something important recently.

483
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,570
I wonder if I can succeed.

484
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,620
Are you... looking for someone?

485
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,830
Well...

486
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,170
To be honest,

487
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,500
we are looking for the daughter of Yanle's late lord,

488
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,280
Princess Yanle who has been missing for years.

489
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,360
A girl named Ah Shu

490
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,250
is suspicious.

491
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,380
We wanted to find out if there is

492
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,620
a Vanessa tattoo on her ankle.

493
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,350
But someone ruined our plan

494
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,630
and we failed.

495
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,400
I just want to ask you

496
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,550
if she is Princess Yanle.

497
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,370
This is bad.

498
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,340
Why?

499
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,080
Do you know why you failed last time?

500
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,930
Why?

501
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,950
This woman is noble and distinguished.

502
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,840
She is blessed by God.

503
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,750
Asking about her might leak important secrets.

504
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,940
The lifespans of the people asking about her or asked about her will be shortened.

505
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,270
Shortened...

506
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,130
Shortened...

507
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,490
Fairy Lady,

508
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,040
do you have a solution?

509
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,510
Done.

510
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,370
I've cleared the misfortunes for you.

511
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,980
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

512
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,840
Thank you for casting a spell.

513
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,920
Thank you for saving my life.

514
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,870
Remember,

515
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,970
no matter what her identity is,

516
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,180
you can't continue to investigate.

517
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,310
Otherwise, you will be killed.

518
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,520
I will keep that in mind.

519
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,140
I'm leaving.

520
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:23,930
My Lord.

521
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,600
Don't tell anyone

522
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,390
about what you heard tonight.

523
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,010
Don't deceive people again.

524
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,920
Or I'll send you to the Jingzhao Prefecture.

525
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,460
Yes.

526
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,530
Leave.

527
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,750
Princess Yanle is still alive.

528
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,170
The point is that it could be Ah Shu.

529
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,060
This is unbelievable.

530
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,650
This is just their guess.

531
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,780
The only way to identify Ah Shu now

532
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,710
is for you to check

533
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,520
if there is a Vanessa tattoo on her ankle.

534
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,690
Okay.

535
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,770
But no matter what the result is,

536
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,630
please keep it a secret for Ah Shu.

537
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,120
We have to tell Yu

538
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,320
the person Man in White is looking for

539
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,510
is Princess Yanle.

540
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,730
But don't worry.

541
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,010
If Ah Shu really is Princess Yanle,

542
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,530
we must keep it a secret

543
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,050
and discuss it later.

544
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,190
Let's go.

545
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,020
What are you thinking?

546
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,160
This should be confiscated.

547
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,900
Well...

548
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,740
We also put in a lot of effort just now.

549
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,090
This is illicit money.

550
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,420
This... This should...

551
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,000
[Yanle Embassy]

552
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,350
Where did you go?

553
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,560
Greetings, Deputy Envoy Kang.

554
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,950
I couldn't find you anywhere.

555
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,870
Deputy Envoy,

556
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,400
I heard there's a peerless chess manual on street stalls.

557
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,660
So I went to look for it for you.

558
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,110
But when that person took it out,

559
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,200
I knew it was fake.

560
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,530
He wanted to cheat me out of money

561
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,830
because I'm from Yanle.

562
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,870
No way!

563
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,660
Advisor Ma,

564
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,430
Yong has been keeping a close eye on the Yanle Embassy.

565
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,510
Don't go out if it's not necessary,

566
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,110
in case someone follows you.

567
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,910
Deputy Envoy Kang, you're wise.

568
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,380
Yes.

569
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,190
Indeed, they've been keeping a close eye on us.

570
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,480
So in my opinion,

571
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,990
we shouldn't get involved

572
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,000
in looking for Princess Yanle, right?

573
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,320
Deputy Envoy,

574
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,780
think about it.

575
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,640
Man in White is making a fuss

576
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,120
about Princess Yanle

577
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,710
in order to gain Viceroy Long's favor

578
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,190
and achieve his own goal.

579
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,440
We can't investigate Princess Yanle anymore.

580
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,990
It will alert Yong.

581
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,130
As for Viceroy Long,

582
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,400
even if something goes wrong, Man in White will take responsibility.

583
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,980
Why do you care so much about this?

584
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,880
I...

585
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,060
I'm doing this for Yanle's sake.

586
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,010
Very good.

587
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,480
Rest early.

588
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,390
Goodbye, Deputy Envoy Kang.

589
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,320
So your arm was numb.

590
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,550
You could have told me earlier.

591
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,570
You could have just pulled your arm back.

592
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,650
I was worried I might wake you up.

593
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,300
Thank you.

594
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,240
You couldn't even hold the spoon steadily because of me.

595
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,150
But I can only sleep well with your arm as my pillow.

596
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:47,750
Is that so?

597
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,750
If you like it,

598
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,610
I'll chop it off and give it to you.

599
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,120
Ah Shu.

600
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,890
The desert is very beautiful, right?

601
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,540
Yes.

602
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,670
I heard

603
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,640
there are many butterflies there.

604
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,830
Yes.

605
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,710
There's a kind of butterfly called...

606
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,770
Vanessa, right?

607
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,870
Why are you suddenly asking this?

608
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,230
When I was checking official certificates in the West Market today,

609
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,890
I heard it from a foreign merchant who passed by.

610
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,520
Vanessa.

611
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,440
Why are you looking at me like that?

612
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,140
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

613
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,270
I'm just curious.

614
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,410
Vanessa is common in the desert.

615
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,070
Its wings are red,

616
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,490
like fire and blood.

617
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,500
It's more like its unyielding personality.

618
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,720
It's sandy and windy in the desert throughout the year.

619
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,780
It's hard to survive even for people.

620
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,490
But Vanessa can.

621
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,060
It only needs a bit of grass or leaves to survive.

622
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,130
With a pair of fragile wings,

623
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,490
it can go through the sand and wind

624
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,590
and fly across the desert

625
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,070
to the oasis.

626
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,450
No obstacles

627
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,380
can stop it from pursuing freedom,

628
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,090
even if it'll be covered with wounds.

629
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,840
The scars on your back

630
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,160
are the price you paid for your freedom, right?

631
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,400
I did go through a lot

632
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,510
from Yanle to Yong.

633
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:13,989
I starved.

634
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,780
I was robbed

635
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,699
and deceived.

636
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,840
Sometimes, I was even hunted by The Faceless.

637
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,949
The scar on my back

638
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,250
was left when I hid from The Faceless.

639
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
I thought I would die there.

640
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,630
But maybe I was not fated to die there.

641
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,720
I never heard you talk about this before.

642
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,920
You suffered so much.

643
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,790
Do you know why I wanted to come to Yong

644
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,020
and become a citizen of Yong that much?

645
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,690
Because I didn't want to run anymore.

646
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,150
I really don't want to live like that anymore.

647
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,910
I was hunted like a stray dog.

648
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,470
I didn't have any dignity.

649
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,390
Luckily, I came to Changle

650
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,990
and met you.

651
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,580
That's why I don't have to live a precarious life anymore.

652
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,970
You gave me a home

653
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,440
and let me live with dignity.

654
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,340
Yuan Mo,

655
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,500
thank you.

656
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,160
Ah Shu.

657
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:41,800
Yuan Mo.

658
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,440
You're drunk.

659
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,820
Ah Shu, you...

660
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,420
Yuan Mo,

661
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,090
sorry.

662
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,470
I know what you want to ask.

663
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,380
Yes.

664
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,400
I am Princess Yanle.

665
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,110
I lied to you.

666
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,730
I lied to everyone.

667
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,140
Man in White has found me.

668
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,390
I can't stay here any longer.

669
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,210
Or you'll be in trouble.

670
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,990
Thank you for everything you gave me.

671
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,510
I will never forget it.

672
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,080
Yuan Mo,

673
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,660
goodbye.

674
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,290
Princess Yanle is in Changle?

675
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,560
If so,

676
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,830
Long Tuqi, that rebel,

677
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,430
will feel uneasy.

678
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,270
Yes.

679
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,470
Long Tuqi suddenly started a rebellion back then.

680
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,870
Yanle's people have been holding a grudge.

681
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,140
But they dare not speak out their anger.

682
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,980
Now,

683
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,740
if the people know Princess Yanle is still alive,

684
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,780
they will definitely support her.

685
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,170
Then Long Tuqi will be overthrown.

686
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
By that time,

687
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,790
the situation of the desert, and even Yong,

688
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,120
will be affected.

689
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,840
If Long Tuqi is overthrown,

690
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,250
the desert will be in rare peace.

691
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,140
The pressure on the border of Yong

692
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,470
will also be relieved.

693
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,170
But if Long Tuqi controls Princess Yanle,

694
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,510
he will suppress dissidents in the name of the princess

695
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,730
and collude with The Faceless

696
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,480
to continue his tyranny over Yanle's people.

697
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,150
If so, the desert

698
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,020
can never be in peace.

699
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,420
Yu,

700
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,390
Princess Yanle can't fall into the hands of Long Tuqi.

701
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,840
Yes.

702
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,850
Ah Shu.

703
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,600
Ah Shu.

704
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,850
Ah Shu.

705
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,390
Ah Shu.

706
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,400
Ah Shu.

707
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,140
Who is he?

708
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,630
Yuan Mo?
