I've marked this article with my comments.

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,400
Go back and think about it again.

7
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,039
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,660
It's a wedding day.

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,190
Let's not talk about homework.

10
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,170
That's right, Father-in-law.

11
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,410
Father-in-law.

12
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,690
They're here.

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,750
The bride is here!

14
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,030
So beautiful.

15
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,370
So beautiful.

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,710
So beautiful.

17
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,270
So beautiful.

18
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,800
So beautiful.

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,930
The bride and the bridegroom, make bows.

20
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,590
The first bow to the guests.

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,470
You can't bow!

22
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,920
Why not?

23
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,590
Yeah. Who is she?

24
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,010

25
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,770

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,060
Hua, what's wrong?

30
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,320
Forgive me for being impolite.

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,230
You can't get married.

32
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,460
Why not?

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,350
Hua,

34
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,670
is there any misunderstanding?

35
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,830
Director Bai,

36
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,840
do you still have the article of On Attracting Talents that Young Master Mu wrote that day?

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
It happens to be here.

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,829
Yuan,

39
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,490
articles are for reading,

40
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,660
not smelling.

41
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,760
This article is well-written.

42
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,070
What a pity.

43
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,500
The ink you used is ordinary.

44
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,670
But Director Bai used a different type of ink to write his comments.

45
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,670
Although they're on the same paper,

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,079
the ink Director Bai used smells pleasant.

47
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,630
It's true.

48
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,870
Let me smell it.

49
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,630
This is impossible.

50
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,190
It's just an article.

51
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,910
Does it have anything to do with my wedding today?

52
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,910
Of course.

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,930
The Literature Hall is an official academy.

54
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,329
It uses the same ink as the Sifang Pavilion.

55
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,440
It's the top-quality ink purchased by the government.

56
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,860
Director Bai's comments were written

57
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,590
in the Literature Hall's top-quality ink.

58
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,810
But Young Master Mu's article

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,900
was written in lower-quality ink he purchased.

60
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,390
You insist that

61
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,700
you were writing this article in the Literature Hall that day.

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,560
But the ink you used is not from the Literature Hall.

63
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,709
It means

64
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,410
you lied.

65
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,830
Young Master Mu, you already

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,630
wrote On Attracting Talents long ago, right?

67
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,830
You just needed

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,150
to give the article you prepared in advance

69
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,520
to Director Bai between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,780
to create the illusion

71
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,070
that you were in the Literature Hall the whole time.

72
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,750
Yikuan,

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,180
what on earth is going on?

74
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,650
Suqin,

75
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,060
let me explain.

76
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,360
I really was in the Literature Hall.

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,350
I didn't lie to you.

78
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,990
Mu Yikuan,

79
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,790
why don't you let me tell your story?

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,430
You just arrived in Changle and haven't gained a firm foothold.

81
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,950
So you went to learn willow shooting, a game for people in the palace,

82
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,350
in order to know noble and powerful people

83
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,210
through the willow shooting game

84
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,830
and flatter them for personal gains.

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,750
Finally,

86
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,170
you seized an opportunity one day

87
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,470
and met Ms. Bai.

88
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,710
Then through Ms. Bai,

89
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,570
you gained Director Bai's favor.

90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,910
You were admitted to the Literature Hall as an exception.

91
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,910
You studied hard.

92
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,150
As long as you could rank among the top in the annual exam,

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,310
you could gain fame.

94
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,390
You've been very cautious this whole time.

95
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,030
Unfortunately, due to Long Beina,

96
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,630
your goal once within easy reach

97
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,950
became something out of reach.

98
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,680
Because only one person from Yanle

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,580
can have the chance to be an official in Yong.

100
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,590
And this person

101
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,390
seems to have been predetermined to be Long Beina.

102
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,510
So,

103
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,550
only by getting rid of Long Beina

104
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,710
can you fulfill your wish

105
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,230
to be a distinguished man from a poor family.

106
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,860
Am I right?

107
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,830
My Lady!

108
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,850
You've been very nice to me.

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,500
At this point, I can't continue to lie to you.

110
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,220
Actually, I work for Young Master Mu.

111
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,070
Hong Ye!

112
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,270
What did you say?

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,260
Young Master Mu gave me some money

114
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
and asked me to get close to you

115
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,520
to help him achieve his goal.

116
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,310
That day, I begged you to take me to the willow shooting ground.

117
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,500
It was Young Master Mu's order.

118
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,810
Shut up!

119
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,180
Suqin.

120
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,750
Suqin, I didn't lie to you.

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
My love for you is real.

122
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,230

Trust me.

125
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,070
Trust me, okay?

126

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,790
-Suqin.
-Suqin!

128
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,540

146
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,260
Why did you do that?

147
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,210
Why?

148
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,030
-Ms. Hong Ye.
-Mu Yikuan, what did you do?

Ms. Hong Ye.

151
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,240
On my way back that day,

152
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,960
I saw him running out from the alley.

153
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,409
I only found out later that a murder had happened there.

154
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,430

155
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,110
Get up!

156
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Take him away!

157
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,070
Hong Ye!

158
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,590
Send Ms. Hong Ye to the hospital now.

159
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

160
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,150
This is the murder weapon.

161
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,430
Take it back to the Jingzhao Prefecture.

162
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,990
Yes.

[Sifang Pavilion]

164
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,350
Great.

165
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,640
Since we have caught the suspect,

166
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,070
I can report to the higher-ups.

167
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,700
A person from Yanle killed another person from Yanle.

168
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,110
It has nothing to do with Yong.

169
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,549
So there won't be any diplomatic dispute.

170
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,429
This is great.

171
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,270
This time, it's all thanks to

172
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,650
your joint efforts.

173
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,049
Mr. Yu,

174
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,750
Mu Yikuan has been imprisoned,

175
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,010
but he hasn't confessed yet.

176
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,910
Yanle's delegation will arrive in Changle soon.

177
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,840
We still don't know how to explain.

178
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,630
Don't worry.

179
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,590
The evidence is solid. He can't get away with it.

180

Retainer An,

181
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,950
the East Court

182
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,560
was in charge of this case before.

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,840
Please

184
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,100
go to the Jingzhao Prefecture

185
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
and work with them to close the case,

186
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,420
so that I can give a reply to your father.

187
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,950
Kunwu,

188
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,990
this case has been solved thanks to the West Court.

189
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,150
But you should understand me.

190
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,710
The West Court has outshone the East Court many times.

191
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,670
This would make Retainer An feel ashamed.

192
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,390
Things are really difficult for me

193
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,570
since I'm caught between him and his father.

194
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,590
I don't want to compete for the credit.

195
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,120
I just want to do my job well.

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,850
That's great.

197
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,910
Great.

198
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,200
Why are you here?

199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,350
How is my master's case going?

200
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,810
The murderer is not Ah Shu,

201
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,990
but Mu Yikuan.

202
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,590
It's him.

203
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,670
Where is he now?

204
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,660
I want to take him back to Yanle

205
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,730
and hand him over to the viceroy.

206
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,730
Mu Yikuan committed a crime in Yong.

207
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,800
He should be interrogated in Yong.

208
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,430
Fine.

209
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,150
What about Ah Shu?

210
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,350
What are you going to do with Ah Shu?

211
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,810
Ah Shu is not the murderer.

212
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,910
Of course we should let her go.

213
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,840
She used poison to blind my master.

214
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,950
And you let her go just like this?

215
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,350
I visited the witnesses at the crime scene.

216
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,390
They all saw

217
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,220
Long Beina attacked Ah Shu first.

218
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,170
I'm warning you.

219
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,670
This is Yong.

220
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,130
Don't do anything stupid.

221
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,610
Go to the Jingzhao Prefecture.

222
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,170
Yes.

223
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,740
I was released before using it up.

224
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,390
I'm already home?

225
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,930
Where is the coachman?

226
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,830
Where is the coachman?

227
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,640
Long Ge.

228
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,470
You should have a taste of what Master suffered.

229
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,390
It's fragrant and sweet.

230
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm sure Ah Shu will like it.

231
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,790
Ah Shu.

232
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,820
I almost forgot.

233
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,980
Use the water on pomelo leaves to dispel bad luck.

234
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,460
Welcome...

235
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,120
-Yuan Mo.
-Ah Shu.

236
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,240
Ah Shu!

237
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,140
What's wrong, Ah Shu?

238
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,020
Your eyes...

239
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,670
What's wrong with your eyes, Ah Shu?

240
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,170
Ah Shu,

241
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,030
don't be afraid.

242
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,020
You'll be fine.

243
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,350
Tell me how to treat your eyes.

244
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,070
Just tell me what medicine should be used.

245
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,750
Don't underestimate me.

246
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,720
Now I can almost recognize

247
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,630
all those complex things.

248
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,230
Just tell me.

249
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,950
-I... I won't be mistaken.
-It's useless, Yuan Mo.

250
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,430
What Long Ge used is Yanle's unique Blindness Powder.

251
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,220
There's no way we can make the unique antidote.

252
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,210
Then he must have the antidote.

253
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm going to him.

254
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,210
Don't go.

255
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,430
It's dangerous for you to go alone.

256
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,200
And he won't let you find him.

257
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,250
I can't see anything.

258
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480
If you're not here...

259
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,270
Ah Shu.

260
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,250
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

261
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,510
Don't be afraid.

262
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,830
It's okay.

263
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,260
You two, search here.

264
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

265
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,700
Yuan Mo.

266
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,430
Did you catch him?

267
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,870
He didn't go back to the Yanle Hall.

268
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,990
He was not in his room either.

269
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,690
I've asked all the foreign merchants in the West Market.

270
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,750
No one has seen him.

271
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,310
I also asked the brokers.

272
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,390
Changle City is so big.

273
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,250
It's really hard to find someone.

274
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,150
I've put up the wanted posters.

275
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,810
Long Ge has never lived in an inn or left the city.

276
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,950
I'm going back now.

277
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,070
Ah Shu is alone. I'm worried about her.

278
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,130
Calm down, Yuan Mo.

279
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,330
I've sent maids to take care of her.

280
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,190
I also asked Uncle Huang

281
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,550
to find the best doctors in Changle City

282
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,990
to treat her eyes.

283
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Yanle's delegation is about to arrive.

284
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,580
We need to bury Long Beina.

285
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,640
We're going to collect his body?

286
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,270
Yeah.

287
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,390
We shouldn't hold a funeral for him.

288
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,170
No.

289
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
We should hold a funeral for him.

290
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,220
The grander, the better.

291
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,130
Be careful.

292
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,050
You almost got scalded.

293
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,430
Where are the maids sent by Yuchi Hua?

294
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,470
How come none of them is here?

295
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,670
I wanted to be alone.

296
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,520
So I sent them back.

297
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,030
Come. Hurry. Have a seat.

298
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,560
Here.

299
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,760
Be careful.

300
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,750
You can't touch anything randomly.

301
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,270
What if you scald yourself?

302
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,710
No matter what, you should've waited for me to come back.

303
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,310
I didn't get to drink the plum wine you mentioned that day.

304
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,640
I wanted to have a taste.

305
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,720
So I asked them to make fire and put some plums in the kettle.

306
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,680
I just needed to wait for the wine to finish brewing.

307
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,880
But I can't even do such a trivial thing.

308
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,190
Do you think you can successfully

309
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,930
make plum wine by putting some plums

310
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,660
in the kettle and cooking them?

311
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,790
You wasted my good wine.

312
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,810
Let me tell you how to brew plum wine.

313
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,670
First, you need to soak plums

314
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,220
in the wine for at least a year.

315
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,900
It'd be great if they can be soaked for three years.

316
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,590
Then, filter the rich plum juice

317
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,030
with fine gauze.

318
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,600
In this way, the fragrance of plums

319
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,830
can completely seep into the wine.

320
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,990
I think the plum tree in Changle City

321
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,390
is going to blossom soon.

322
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,310
The flowers are not beautiful at all.

323
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,510
I don't like enjoying flowers usually.

324
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,550
Yuan Mo.

325
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,670
It doesn't matter even though I can't see things.

326
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,030
I just think it's a pity.

327
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,760
I've gone through so much to come to Changle,

328
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,190
but I can't see the prosperity of Changle City anymore.

329
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,900
When I get used to it, I'll make my own living.

330
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,390
I won't be your burden.

331
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

332
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,710
I will take care of you.

333
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,370
I'll take care of you forever.

334
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,510
After all, our names are on the same household registration paper.

335
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,510
That makes us a family.

336
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,620
Family members should take care of each other.

337
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,630
Young Master,

338
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,470
I'm late.

339
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,800
Your master said

340
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,650
the strength you used to kowtow is not enough.

341
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,270
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,650
Give me the antidote.

343
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,360
Come on. Turn around.

344
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,550
Watch the stair.

345
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,180
We still haven't arrived?

346
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,890
Soon.

347
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,210
We're here.

348
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,110
What is this place?

349
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
So mysterious.

350
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,780
Open your eyes.

351
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,030
My eyes...

352
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,210
I can see things now.

353
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,210

354
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,020

358
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,030
The antidote given by Long Ge was applied on the gauze.

359
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,110
Luckily, it worked.

360
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,050
♫Love is simply♫

361
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,630

363
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,700

Don't just look at me.

386
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,070
I spent 500 wen bribing the doorkeeper.

387
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,930
That's why he agreed to let us come up here.

388
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,110
Seize the chance and spend more time enjoying the scenery.

So beautiful.

392
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,600
Look over there.

393
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,800
That's the Taiping Gate.

394
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,230
You entered Changle City from there back then.

395
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,640
That is also the place where we first met.

396
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,120
And there.

397
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,640
Where?

398
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,330
Over there.

399
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,720
That very big place.

400
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,610
It's the Ministry of Rites.

401
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,290
Yes.

402
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,840

410
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,480

-See?

411
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,230

Madam Gongsun.

443
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm here.

444
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,580
Young Master Yuan, you're here.

445
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,690
I've already prepared it for you.

446
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,300
This is the latest style.

447
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,470
It's beautiful and not conspicuous.

448
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,550
It suits this lady very well.

449
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,100
Do you like it?

450
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,320
It's so beautiful.

451
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,890
The fabric must be very expensive.

452
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,360
This is top-quality silk.

453
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,550
These beads

454
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,310
were sewn onto it one by one.

455
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,630
So gorgeous.

456
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,220
Wait.

457
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,870
You want to buy me clothes?

458
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,470
What are you up to now?

459
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,710
What do you mean?

460
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,870
Your eyes

461
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,160
finally recovered.

462
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,390
I just want to buy you clothes to celebrate it.

463
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,860
Would you be that nice?

464
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,670
Don't think I don't know this.

465
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,870
Now you claim the clothes are given to me,

466
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,270
but you'll say

467
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,470
I owe you money later.

468
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,970
Do you really think so?

469
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,950
Fine.

470
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,580
You're right.

471
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,160
I knew it.

472
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,570
You owe me 50 wen for this set of clothes.

473
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,500
What do you think?

474
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,870
Fine, 50 wen.

475
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,310
It's not like I can't afford it.

476
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,110
I'll buy them.

477
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,670
Okay.

478
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,200
That's more like it.

479
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,580
Anyway, when the troubles pile up, you get used to them.

480
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,600
Thank you, Madam Gongsun.

481
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,950
When the troubles pile up, you get used to them.

482
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,230
Sounds interesting.

483
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,200
Who said that?

484
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,240
I don't want to tell you.

485
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,550
Tell me.

486
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,110
Well...

487
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:37,870
[Bai's Mansion]

488
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,420
Hua,

489
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,550
I'm just going to live in the Nanshan Temple for a few days

490
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,510
for relaxation.

491
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,110
You're busy. You don't need to keep me company.

492
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,830
Don't worry.

493
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,550
I will forget those things and people in the past.

494
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,580
Cousin,

495
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,870
I'm not going there to keep you company.

496
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,350
I'm going there to hide for a few days.

497
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,730
My father will be back in a few days.

498
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,130
And he'll be nosy again after he comes back.

499
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,020
He might even force me to have a blind date.

500
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,990
So annoying.

501
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,110
Get in.

502
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,310
Be careful.

503
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,710
My Lady.

504
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,630
It's a long journey.

505
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,410
The horse's faeces is very smelly.

506
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,530
So I specially prepared an incense burner.

507
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,200
Thank you.

508
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,480
Mu Yikuan,

509
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,910
what will it take for you to confess?

510
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,810
The Sifang Pavilion is here to help with the case investigation.

511
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,610
Open the door!

512
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,010
What are you doing here?

513
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,940
Wang Kunwu, you...

514
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,460
Where is Hong Ye?

515
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,590
Stop! Let go of him!

516
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,420
Tell me! Where is Hong Ye?

517
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,320
Mu Yikuan,

518
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,780
Bai Suqin is in danger.

519
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Suqin.

520
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,700
What happened to Suqin?

521
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,090
Yuchi went to the Nanshan Temple with Suqin.

522
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,690
Now both of them are missing.

523
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,900
Soldiers reported that the carriage was abandoned nearby.

524
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,640
Knockout incense was lit in the carriage.

525
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,100
Now you can tell us, right?

526
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,710
Where exactly is Hong Ye?

527
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,310
I don't know.

528
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,070
Stop pushing me.

529
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,640
I think you're asking the wrong person.

530
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,750
He stabbed Hong Ye.

531
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,070
How would he know Hong Ye's whereabouts?

532
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,470
No.

533
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,910
Mu Yikuan

534
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,040
didn't stab Hong Ye.

535
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,440
Hong Ye stabbed herself.

536
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,100
Because you want to cover up for Hong Ye and take the blame for her.

537
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,890
Mu Yikuan,

538
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,830
if you still have feelings

539
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,160
for Suqin,

540
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,870
tell us honestly

541
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,470
where exactly Hong Ye is.

542
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,300
If you delay any longer,

543
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,960
they'll be in greater danger.

544
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,550
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

545
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,510
It's just that I really don't know.

546
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,390
What is this place?

547
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,880
Cousin.

548
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,110
Cousin, wake up!

549
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,390
Wake up.

550
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,750
Cousin, wake up!

551
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,770
Hua.

552
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,770
We fell into someone's trap.

553
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,170
We have to figure out a way to get out of here.

554
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,190
If you really have no idea,

555
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,430
tell us about Hong Ye.

556
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,680
As long as you can tell us some details,

557
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,280
we can have clues to find her.

558
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,190
Now you're the only one who can save Bai Suqin.

559
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,250
Think about the consequences.

560
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,790
Wait.

561
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,620
I first met Hong Ye

562
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,910
on a street of Changle.

563
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,590
She was being beaten on the street by her master at that time.

564
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,710
I really couldn't stand it.

565
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,240
So I helped her gain freedom with all my money.

566
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,080
She said her parents starved to death due to a famine.

567
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,750
Later, she was sold to a foreign merchant

568
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,750
and became a maid.

569
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,550
The foreign merchant's wife often tortured her.

570
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,990
If anything went against her will,

571
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,390
she would lock her up in a dark and cold room.

572
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,030
Dark and cold?

573
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,390
Do you know

574
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,590
which foreign merchant she was sold to?

575
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,490
This is what she doesn't want to recall the most.

576
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,820
The more reluctant she is to talk about it,

577
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,070
the stronger obsessiveness she has in her heart.

578
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,200
But what exactly does Hong Ye want to do

579
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,900
by kidnapping Bai Suqin?

580
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,220
She's such a paranoid.

581
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,350
Of course she wants her enemy to experience

582
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,810
what she suffered before.

583
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,640
I'm begging you.

584
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,330
I'm begging you.

585
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,670
Go save Suqin now.

586
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,670
I'm begging you.

587
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,190
Dark and cold? Could it be a cellar?

588
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,950
A cellar?

589
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,190
There are a few hundred foreign merchants in Changle City

590
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,070
who have a cellar.

591
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,910
How should we find them?

592
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,070
Search one by one.

593
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,240
Let's go.

594
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,240
Hong Ye is a woman.

595
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,630
It wouldn't be easy for her and the coachman

596
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,830
to take unconscious Yuchi Hua and Bai Suqin

597
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,990
somewhere far away.

598
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,870
So they must have been hidden

599
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,710
somewhere near the carriage.

600
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,370
The west is the place where all kinds of foreign merchants live.

601
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,440
It's the most suitable for hiding someone.

602
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,670
The houses of the foreign merchants here are rented.

603
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,830
I'm going to search them one by one now.

604
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,470
Hurry up. We don't have much time left.

605
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,470
The East Court, listen to my order.

606
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,090
-Yes.
-Yes.

607
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,620
You follow Retainer Wang's order.

608
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,100
You guys follow Ji.

609
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,330
Don't miss any house.

610
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,090
-Yes!
-Yes!

611
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,700
Move.

612
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,020
Let's go.

613
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,970
It's so cold.

614
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,990
Cousin, don't sleep.

615
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't sleep, Cousin.

616
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,610
Don't sleep. Hang in there.

617
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,700
Hang in there.

618
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,080
Anybody? Help!

619
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Someone is coming.

620
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,930
Cousin, someone is coming.

621
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,170
Someone is coming!

622
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,050
Help us!

623
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,270
It's you.

624
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,580
Surprised?

625
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,220
The owner of this house has been doing business somewhere else for years.

626
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I've sent the old doorkeeper away.

627
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,070
No one will come to save you.

628
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,860
Why?

629
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,670
Why do you want to murder us?

630
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,330
It's all your cousin's fault!

631
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,960
She took away what belongs to me.

632
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,910
You mean...

633
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,730
Mu Yikuan?

634
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,910
I advise you not to waste your energy.

635
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,410
You've been here for four hours.

636
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,120
Soon, you two will freeze to death here.

637
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,030
My Lady,

638
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,730
remember me forever.

639
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,150
Stop!

640
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,230
Let us out!

641
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,750
Let's go search that house.

642
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,310
Okay.

643
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,480
Searching the houses one by one

644
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,870
is too time-consuming.

645
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,940
Wait.

646
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,350
What's wrong?

647
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,750
That woman is wearing thin clothes,

648
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,750
but she's also wearing thick boots.

649
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,830
-Hong Ye.
-Hong Ye.

650
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:36,930
Hong Ye!

651
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,030
It's really you.

652
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,870
Where is Yuchi?

653
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,750
Where are they?

654
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,550
You can never see them again.

655
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,080
There's frost on her boots.

656
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,050
It's an ice cellar.

657
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,360
Yuchi Hua!

658
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,770
Yuchi Hua!

659
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,230
What happened to her?

660
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,870
Step aside!

661
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,080
-Don't stand in the way!
-Hua.

662
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,470
Lift the quilt! Hurry!

663
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,390
Bring more quilts!

664
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,130
An Xiuyi, get me a basin!

665
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,760
Here.

666
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,390
What are you doing?

667
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,590
Her limbs are frozen.

668
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,990
We have to warm her up as soon as possible.

669
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,060
Susu, go get some hot water.

670
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,720
-No!
-Okay.

671
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,510
Hot water will only rot her limbs.

672
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,440
Do you want her to become disabled?

673
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,830
This is a common method used in the army.

674
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,660
Soldiers always get frostbitten at night in the desert.

675
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,190
This is how they treat them.

676
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,850
Find some more ice to grind it.

677
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,560
The smaller pieces, the better.

678
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,540
-Susu.
-You go.

679
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,550
She needs to go to the hospital to get a doctor here.

680
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,930
How come it's you?

681
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,950
You can still say harsh words. You'll live.

682
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,970
I feel so cold.

683
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,520
Don't worry.

684
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,260
In a few days,

685
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,400
you can be lively and whip me.

686
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,980
Where is my cousin?

687
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,330
Where is my cousin?

688
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,740
She will be fine.

689
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,600
[Jingzhao Prefecture]

690
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,080
That day, Mu Yikuan went after Hong Ye.

691
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,500
Wang Kunwu and I followed them closely.

692
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Outside the door,

693
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,290
we heard Mu Yikuan asking Hong Ye

694
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,600
why she did that.

695
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,540
We both thought he meant Hong Ye's betrayal in public.

696
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,690
The truth is

697
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,840
Mu Yikuan saw with his own eyes

698
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,360
that Hong Ye stabbed herself with a pair of scissors.

699
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,620
He didn't understand.

700
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,400
So he asked her why she did that.

701
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,580
This is the pair of scissors used to stab you that day.

702
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,929
We found a little white powder

703
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,830
and some burn marks on it.

704
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,420
Magistrate, please take a look.

705
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,150
What is the white powder on this?

706
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,420
I applied

707
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,630
Mituluo on this knife in advance.

708
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,750
The powder on it

709
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,230
is the residue of Mituluo after it was burnt.

710
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,150
Mituluo

711
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,600
is a kind of medicine commonly used

712
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,870
for patients' pain relief in hospitals.

713
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,180
I accidentally met

714
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,070
a pedicurist on the street that day.

715
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,110
He told me

716
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,350
most of his customers coming for a pedicure

717
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,420
have foot sores and calluses

718
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,260
on their feet.

719
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,990
So he would apply

720
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,350
Mituluo on the knife in advance

721
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,830
and burn the knife.

722
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,860
It's for cleanliness

723
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,350
and pain relief.

724
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,040
If Mu Yikuan used the pair of scissors

725
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,020
to stab Hong Ye on impulse,

726
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,500
how could he burn it in advance for disinfection

727
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,510
and apply Mituluo powder on it

728
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,640
to relieve her pain?

729
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,550
Hong Ye,

730
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,490
the evidence is solid.

731
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,660
Yes.

732
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,320
I framed Mu Yikuan on purpose.

733
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,710
Because he is heartless.

734
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,400
In order to help him,

735
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,600
I willingly became

736
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,630
Bai Suqin's maid.

737
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,540
I did everything I could to help him

738
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,260
get admitted to the Literature Hall to show his talent.

739
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,470
I can do whatever it takes

740
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,120
to remove the future obstacles for him.

741
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,780
I can even kill people for him.

742
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:14,810
Yes.

743
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,550
I killed Long Beina.

744
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,180
On my way back from Inebriation Restaurant that day,

745
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,950
I saw Long Beina...

746
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,470
in conflict with her.

747
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,020
At that time, I thought

748
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,820
as long as I got rid of Long Beina,

749
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,710
no one

750
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,310
could stop Yikuan from having a bright future.

751
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,070
But in the end,

752
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,760
he chose to abandon me

753
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,790
and marry Bai Suqin, that bitch.

754
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
You helped Mu Yikuan get close to Bai Suqin on purpose.

755
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,620
Had this never occurred to you before?

756
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,350
I wouldn't have cared

757
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,370
if he just wanted to marry her.

758
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,110
She's just a pitiful woman being used by someone

759
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,310
and a defenseless noble lady.

760
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,510
It's not difficult

761
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,930
to make her disappear.

762
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,980
But Yikuan,

763
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,790
you shouldn't have fallen in love with her.

764
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,130
Since you didn't kill Long Beina,

765
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,030
why did you use your On Attracting Talents

766
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,510
to forge an alibi?

767
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
I didn't forge it.

768
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,750
After the annual exam,

769
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,890
I knew I could hardly succeed.

770
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,560
So I was depressed at that time.

771
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,200
On my way back, I saw Long Beina.

772
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,870
I knew he made all my efforts

773
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,230
in vain.

774
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,560
So I became emotional

775
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,190
and wanted to argue with him.

776
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,030
This...

777
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,070
But I saw Ah Shu in conflict with him.

778
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,510
This is for your arrogance and domineering behavior.

779
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,390
I dare not step forward.

780
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,530
Sooner or later, I'll get even with him myself.

781
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,170
You brat,

782
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,160
when I become an official of Yong,

783
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,480
I will kill everyone in your clan!

784
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,130
Until I heard Long Beina

785
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,550
reveal the truth that I couldn't accept.

786
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,590
For people like me,

787
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,190
no matter how hard we try,

788
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,660
we are no match for those

789
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,670
born to be superior forever.

790
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,150
I was in despair

791
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,300
and went back to the Literature Hall absent-mindedly.

792
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,800
Yikuan.

793
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,780
Why are you here?

794
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,090
Why haven't you gone home to rest?

795
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,840
Sir,

796
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,390
I...

797
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,320
I suddenly got inspired

798
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,130
and wrote this article.

799
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,260
So I forgot the time.

800
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,770
Did you not do well in the exam

801
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,490
because you were in a bad state today?

802
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,000
Director Bai has been very nice to me.

803
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,660
I didn't want him to know

804
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,760
I almost gave up my studies

805
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,230
because of fame.

806
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,270
So I could only fob him off with On Attracting Talents.

807
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,350
Actually, I think Director Bai knew

808
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,970
the position would be given to Long Beina long ago.

809
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,130
He brought forward your wedding

810
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,400
and invited you to be a teacher in the hall

811
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,750
because he didn't want you to be too sad.

812
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,100
He treats you really well.

813
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,580
After that day,

814
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,990
I finally realized

815
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,710
what I want the most.

816
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,870
I also set my life goal

817
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
and finally found

818
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,460
a home I've always been dreaming of.

819
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,720
I really want to stay with them.

820
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,450
I don't want to let those who are good to me down anymore.

821
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,190
So you chose to let me down.

822
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,290
I can't

823
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,730
fulfill my promise to you anymore.

824
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,050
I broke my promise.

825
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,530
I promised you

826
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,350
I would spend the rest of my life making it up to you.

827
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,530
But why?

828
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,870
Why did you do those stupid things?

829
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,030
Mu Yikuan,

830
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,270
don't you think you're hypocritical?

831
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,830
Although I committed a serious crime today,

832
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,830
I don't regret

833
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,510
anything I did.

834
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,710
In my heart,

835
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,630
love is love,

836
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,870
and hate is hate.

837
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,000
I despise you

838
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,950
and I will never forgive you.

839
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,230
Take her away.

840
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,320
Yes.

841
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,220
Move.

842
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,360
Stop!

843
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,670
[Advisor of Yanle: Ma Zhiwen]

844
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,510
Deputy Envoy.

845
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,370
We're about to arrive in Changle.

846
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,440
Change into the clothes we prepared.

847
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,630
Let them know

848
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,620
how much trouble they've got themselves into.

849
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,710
Yes.

850
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,960
Listen to my order!
