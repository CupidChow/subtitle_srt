[Go East]

2
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,870
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,070
Yuan Mo's such a scumbag.

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,990
I was just kidding before.

5
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,390
Actually, he's not scummy at all.

6
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,190
What do you think happened between

7
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,190
Yuan Mo and Yuchi?

8
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,150
Don't you know

9
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,810
Yuan Mo is pursuing Yuchi Hua?

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,010
What did you say?

11
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,900
Yuan Mo... is pursuing Yuchi?

12
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,310
This matter has become a big deal.

13
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,970
Everyone in Sifang Pavilion knows about it.

14
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,440
That old man was too cruel.

15
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,490
Even the ruler was broken.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,870
The thing is I don't even know

17
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,110
why I got hit.

18
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,640
Right,

19
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,150
do you know why?

20
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,290
You were asking for a beating.

21
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,560
Wait.

22
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,380
What do all of you mean?

23
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,810
Don't you know

24
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,460
how Yuchi Hua is against me?

25
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,079
There's nothing in this world that can't be solved.

26
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,760
Now that I think about it, I'd rather not solve it!

27
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,980
You have food in your bowl but you're staring at the pot.

28
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,370
What are you going on about?

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,520
You like Ah Shu.

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,800
Don't think I don't know this.

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,040
I... I've never hid it!

32
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,180
I've always liked my Ah Shu.

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,900
So what?

34
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,430
Since you like Ah Shu,

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,540
why did you tell Yuchi Hua you like her?

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,460
Are you teasing Ah Shu

37
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,750
or teasing Yuchi Hua?

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,100
Are you sincere?

39
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,680
Men like you who toy with others' feelings

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,550
are the most despicable.

41
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,360
Wait, wait.

42
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,040
What did you say?

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,170
I said I despise you.

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,850
No, no.

45
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,400
You just said... You said I-I...

46
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,110
I...

47
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,190
I told Yuchi Hua I-I like her?

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,700
When? No way!

49
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,550
Are you sick? Or am I, or is she?

50
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,390
You're sick.

51
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,260
Have you completely forgotten what you did?

52
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,579
Everyone heard it on the night

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,579
of Ah Shu's naturalization ceremony.

54
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,110
Naturalization ceremony?

55
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,390
Don't go.

56
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,330
Yuchi!

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,110
Ah Shu?

58
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,050
What's up?

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,790
Hua.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,830
I need to clarify something with you.

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,080
On the night of the naturalization ceremony,

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
what did Yuan Mo say to you?

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,900
Gosh darn it!

64
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,149
It's such a big misunderstanding.

65
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,060
Good luck to you.

66
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,240
So my Ah Shu

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
doesn't know that I like her!

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,040
I was still happy all day long!

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,810
So Yuchi Hua thought...

70
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,870
No, no.

71
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,430
I have to explain to her.

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,140
I have to make it clear!

73
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,840
Yuan Mo.

74
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,490
Your lunch box from Ah Shu.

75
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,600
Look.

76
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,220
My Ah Shu is still nice to me.

77
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,380
She even brought me a lunch box.

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,030
Where is she?

79
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,810
After I told her you like Yuchi Hua,

80
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,540
she left the lunch box and left.

81
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,090
Ah Shu!

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,600
Ah Shu!

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,750
Wait for me, Ah Shu!

84
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,870
Ah Shu!

85
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,170
Ah Shu!

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,380
Ah Shu!

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,560
Ah Shu!

88
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,790
Ah Shu, what are you doing?

89
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,540
Nothing. I should've moved out long ago.

90
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,030
Wait.

91
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,530
Y-You've been living well here.

92
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,790
Why are you moving out?

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,430
I'm free now.

94
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,590
I can go wherever I want.

95
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,540
It's inconvenient for you with me here.

96
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,870
I might even hinder you.

97
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,300
Ah Shu, did you hear something?

98
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,270
It's a misunderstanding.

99
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,310
That's not true, Ah Shu.

100
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,460
Don't you have a mouth? Then I'll say it for you.

101
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,090
Ah Shu.

102
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,230
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,700
I like your buddy Yuchi.

104
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,430
Ah Shu, it's a big misunderstanding!

105
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,430
That's not true!

106
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,800
There's no misunderstanding.

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,430
Yuan Mo.

108
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,380
From now on, you can hit your high road

109
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,030
and I'll cross my bridge of reincarnation!

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,830
Ah Shu!

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
It's the single-log bridge.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,930
I'll cross whatever bridge I like!

113
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,210
Ah Shu, don't go.

114
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,170
Listen to me.

115
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,630
I like you!

116
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,680
I only like you.

117
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,580
It's never been anyone else.

118
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,940
I like how frank,

119
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,990
domineering,

120
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,120
and brusque you are.

121
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,630
When I first saw you, I thought you were special

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,430
and different from other girls.

123
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,030
Have you told Yuchi all this?

124
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,560
Yes.

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,260
I memorized it.

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,360
I've memorized it many times.

127
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,350
But what I want to say is...

128
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,800
At the city gate entrance...

129
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,640
I saw you for the first time.

130
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,110
In the vast sea of people,

131
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,210
I saw you at first sight.

132
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,610
I was happiest during the time

133
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,960
you spent in my home.

134
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,120
I want to be with you.

135
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,320
Ah Shu.

136
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,110
I want to teach you how to write and play Go.

137
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,860
I want to watch the stars on the lounge chairs with you.

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,320
I want to set off all the fireworks with you.

139
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,820
I want to drink with you,

140
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,990
make you delicious food,

141
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,540
and give all my money to...

142
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,070
Actually,

143
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
I already knew it.

144
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,390
Ah Shu.

145
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Ah Shu, I have something to tell you.

146
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,340
Actually, I like...

147
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,490
This won't do.

148
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,409
Calm down. Calm down.

149
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,040
One more time.

150
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,390
I knew you liked me then.

151
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,090
But after hearing you say it again,

152
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm still very touched.

153
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,960
Then...

154
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,920
So...

155
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,970
Can you promise me...

156
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,480
not to leave?

157
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,470
Really?

158
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,250
Awesome. Awesome!

159
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,910
Oh, right.

160
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,890
This is for you.

161
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,030
For me?

162
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,169
It's so beautiful.

163
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,620
Do you like it?

164
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,650
Let me put it on you.

165
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,169
Okay.

166
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,350
What a ruckus it was.

167
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,350
My father even beat him up.

168
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,810
I have to buy a bottle of wine for him

169
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,330
and apologize to him.

170
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,780
You've to get him a good one.

171
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,500
Who do you think fell in love first?

172
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,010
Some things happen before you know it.

173
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,160
Order doesn't matter.

174
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,510
You're right.

175
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,690
Finally, a trouble of mine's settled.

176
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,770
It's been a long time since I've shopped so freely.

177
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,490
I can enjoy it properly today.

178
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,620
We haven't sparred in a long time.

179
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,530
When will we spar again?

180
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,620
You'll lose no matter what.

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,930
How arrogant.

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,720
I'll spar with you after the five states' alliance is formed.

183
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,450
Deal.

184
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,080
Pinky swear.

185
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,160
Childish.

186
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,100
Pinky swear.

187
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,030
Young Master.

188
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,970
It's raining heavily.

189
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,640
Why don't we go back first?

190
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,260
Book me the best private room

191
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,130
in Wispy Pavilion.

192
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,060
Wispy Pavilion?

193
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,540
Such an expensive restaurant?

194
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,270
Just book it.

195
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,890
Let's go.

196
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,690
[Escape]

197
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,040
Stop the carriage!

198
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,190
Turn around and go back.

199
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,520
Let's go.

200
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,090
Give it to me!

201
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,740
Are you crazy?

202
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,910
How dare you drive in the busy city?

203
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,240
Move!

204
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
Sorry, sorry.

205
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,250
Madam Li. Madam Li.

206
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,680
Madam Li!

207
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,720
Why are you here?

208
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,670
Help! Madam Li is dying!

209
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,210
Come out first!

210
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,830
Guards! Take Madam Li to the hospital!

211
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,490
-Yes!
-Yes!

212
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,360
Move! Make way!

213
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,810
What's going on?

214
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,220
What's going on?

215
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,680
What on earth happened?

216
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,870
Wasn't that the carriage of Yuluo Envoy's wife?

217
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,670
Why was this pretty boy in it?

218
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,970
Let's go back to Jingzhao Prefecture for interrogation.

219
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,060
I know him!

220
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,030
Isn't he the travel pass clerk from Sifang Pavilion?

221
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,580
Are they having an affair?

222
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,480
I've read it.

223
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,900
Dongyuan has no objection.

224
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,320
I have no objection.

225
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,780
It's perfect.

226
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,360
Yuluo has no objection.

227
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,010
That's great.

228
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,610
Please sign the agreement

229
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,580
and stamp your official seal.

230
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,820
My Lord!

231
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,180
Bad news.

232
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,940
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

233
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,760
Take me to Her Ladyship.

234
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,510
Lord Li.

235
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,620
Can you sign the agreement before you leave?

236
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,240
How dare Sifang Pavilion disrespect me?

237
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,880
Sign what agreement?

238
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,150
Goodbye!

239
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,600
Who can tell me what happened?

240
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,430
Why did Shen Bailian appear

241
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,830
in Madam Li's carriage?

242
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,540
It's all over the city now.

243
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,740
Everyone is talking about a Sifang Pavilion member

244
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,240
having an affair with a married woman.

245
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,840
How embarrassing.

246
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,370
Wang Kunwu!

247
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,480
Shen Bailian is under you. Tell me.

248
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,460
I'll give you an explanation.

249
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,800
Ji, why are you hiding?

250
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,110
You and Shen are the closest.

251
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,520
Don't you know he's close to Madam Li?

252
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,130
I haven't seen him these days.

253
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,660
I don't know who he's been spending time with.

254
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,190
You didn't see him?

255
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,550
Doesn't he have to work?

256
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910
That's not it.

257
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,640
He used up

258
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,830
all his annual leave days in one go.

259
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
To hook up with a noble woman?

260
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,390
I've told him

261
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,050
not to hang out with those noble women.

262
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,460
But he didn't listen.

263
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,720
When he was imprisoned for fake goods,

264
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,360
that Madam Li personally

265
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,430
took him out of prison.

266
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,470
If I'd known

267
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,950
she was Yuluo Envoy's wife,

268
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,080
I'd have tried to stop him.

269
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,740
Don't act all righteous.

270
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,440
Even trying to distance yourself from it.

271
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,600
Didn't you ask Shen to go to Renyi Square to seduce noble women

272
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,270
to investigate the refugees?

273
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,290
What do you have to say?

274
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720
Wang Kunwu!

275
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,750
Are you trying to ruin my plans?

276
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,350
-Let go of him!
-Let go!

277
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,070
Talk things out.

278
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,330
-Let go of him!
-Xiuyi!

279
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,210
Let go!

280
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,590
Mr. Yu.

281
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,920
I've convinced the three states to reach an agreement.

282
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,380
They were about to sign it.

283
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,620
But because of West Court's people,

284
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,480
Yuluo Envoy refuses to see me now!

285
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,550
If this keeps up,

286
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,660
Dongyuan and Xiyuan States will renege eventually.

287
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,810
I've been planning for so long,

288
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,420
but it was ruined by West Court!

289
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,220
Wang Kunwu.

290
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,830
Are you trying to obstruct me from getting

291
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,600
the greatest merit?

292
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,840
Watch your words!

293
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,920
West Court isn't that idle.

294
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,590
An Xiuyi.

295
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,400
You haven't investigated it properly.

296
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,110
What's with all these accusations?

297
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,910
Investigate?

298
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,590
Sure.

299
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,730
I'll investigate it now!

300
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,990
Where is Shen Bailian?

301
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,770
Enough.

302
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,080
Look at you. Ridiculous.

303
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,570
You always quarrel when something happens.

304
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,030
See?

305
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,800
The door is still open.

306
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,960
Aren't you ashamed?

307
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,430
Wang Kunwu.

308
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,690
It was caused by West Court.

309
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,770
You must investigate it thoroughly.

310
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,470
And you.

311
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,710
All of you are vexing.

312
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,460
Let me tell you.

313
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,990
If you dare cover up for Shen Bailian,

314
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,300
I won’t let you off!

315
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,910
[Prison]

316
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,470
I've asked him.

317
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,810
He won't say anything.

318
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,770
I hope you can make him speak.

319
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,260
Over there.

320
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,480
The higher-ups ordered for no visitors.

321
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,390
I'll guard the door.

322
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,120
Ask quickly.

323
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,430
Shen.

324
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,680
You're here.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,600
Sister...

326
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,590
No.

327
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,180
How is Madam Li?

328
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,400
You still care so much about her in this plight?

329
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
What's your relationship with her?

330
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,090
There's nothing between Madam Li and me.

331
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,390
We're just...

332
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,720
just friends who get along.

333
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,180
I don't care if you get along.

334
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,870
But why must you hang out now?

335
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,290
As An Xiuyi was about to sign

336
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,000
an agreement with Yuluo, Xiyuan, and Dongyuan,

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,670
something happened to Madam Li,

338
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,800
and you happened to be in her carriage.

339
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,730
Shen.

340
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,430
I hope you can tell us

341
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,790
what you've done exactly.

342
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,790
Only then can we help you.

343
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,730
I...

344
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,220
Retainer Wang.

345
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,990
I promised Madam Li

346
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,690
I wouldn't say.

347
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,819
Do you know your current situation?

348
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,560
You created such a scandal

349
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,140
at a key moment for the alliance.

350
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,870
You'd be lucky to just be fired.

351
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,270
If Yuluo Envoy insists on punishing you,

352
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,270
just the count of adultery is enough

353
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,880
to sentence you to exile!

354
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,630
I...

355
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,270
Madam Li and I are like siblings.

356
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,230
I really...

357
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,470
can't divulge her stuff.

358
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,140
At least tell us what you can.

359
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,090
Where did you go?

360
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,050
How did she faint?

361
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,600
I really didn't know

362
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,030
things would turn out like this.

363
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,630
I've been there with her many times.

364
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,370
Nothing went wrong

365
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,070
in our previous meetings.

366
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,110
Where did you go?

367
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,790
We...

368
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,600
went to Wispy Pavilion together.

369
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,920
Wispy Pavilion?

370
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,190
Wispy Pavilion?

371
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,940
It's a new restaurant.

372
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,890
It only entertains nobles.

373
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,510
Commoners can't get in.

374
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,550
Madam Li loves their First-class Divine Soup.

375
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,130
She was ecstatic every time she finished it.

376
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,730
She said it made her feel like she was floating.

377
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,430
Divine Soup...

378
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,630
Ecstatic...

379
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,670
Feels like floating...

380
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,870
Shen.

381
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,760
After drinking the soup, did Madam Li's heart beat faster,

382
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,710
and did she laugh for no reason

383
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,040
and even hallucinate?

384
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,110
How did you know?

385
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,110
I suspect Madam Li was poisoned.

386
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,790
Poisoned?

387
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,220
What poison?

388
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,090
We need to go to Wispy Pavilion to figure it out.

389
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,990
Are you done?

390
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,230
Someone is coming.

391
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,860
You can't enter Wispy Pavilion.

392
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,790
It only receives customers introduced by regulars.

393
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,410
Their private rooms must be booked in advance.

394
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,140
If Madam Li didn't lead the way,

395
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,190
I wouldn't even know where the entrance is.

396
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,120
Wispy Pavilion?

397
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,600
Who wants to go to Wispy Pavilion?

398
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,110
Do you know Wispy Pavilion?

399
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,670
Yes.

400
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,480
An Xiuyi invited me to dinner at Wispy Pavilion tonight.

401
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,350
What do you want?

402
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,900
Tell me.

403
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,030
Why are you having dinner at Wispy Pavilion?

404
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,760
How do you...

405
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,230
None of your business!

406
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,350
Tell me the truth

407
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,350
or I'll punish you!

408
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,190
Are you threatening me?

409
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,590
I...

410
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,430
Ouch!

411
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,750
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

412
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,790
I planned to celebrate at Wispy Pavilion after

413
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,910
the three states' agreement was signed,

414
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,660
but your West Court dragged me down...

415
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,190
-Get to the point.
-Get to the point.

416
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,750
Point? What point?

417
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,150
What do you want to know?

418
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,950
Why did you invite Yuchi Hua to dinner alone?

419
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,670
Why?

420
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,510
We grew up together!

421
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,020
What's wrong with a meal together?

422
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,010
Do you know what kind of place it is?

423
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,580
Isn't it just a concealed restaurant?

424
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,320
It may be unusual to you,

425
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,790
but to Changle's nobles,

426
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,870
it's commonplace!

427
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,760
He doesn't know.

428
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,860
Let's let go.

429
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,250
I trust you for now.

430
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,230
But your private room is gone.

431
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,150
Wait, why?

432
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,940
Do you know how long it took to book it?

433
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,690
Forfeited!

434
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,520
If you want Yuluo Envoy back at the negotiation table,

435
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,350
be generous.

[Wispy Pavilion]

437
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,050
This collar's scratching my neck.

438
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,470
So rich people

439
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,290
live with their necks being strangled.

440
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,420
I'll help you fix it.

441
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,030
Much better.

442
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,170
Let's go.

443
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,780
Let's go.

444
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,830
How is it opened?

445
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,950
The door is so thick.

446
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,650
No one can hear it even if it's knocked.

447
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,620
Could there be a mechanism?

448
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,530
Look for it.

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,630
Secretive, indeed.

Yes.

I'm Yuchi Hua.

455
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,600
What's wrong?

456
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,240
Nothing.

457
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,870
Excuse me.

458
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,460
Please give me your hands.

What is this?

462
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,130
I don't know. I can't see.

463
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,850
What does it look like?

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,780
Is it poisonous?

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,780
It's quite unique with the flowers and plants.

Why did he leave?

468
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,970
I've never seen such a restaurant.

469
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,110
But...

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,680

What is this First-class Divine Soup made of?

487
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,250
Is it as magical as the rumors say?

488
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,090
You'll know after you drink it.

489
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,030
To be honest,

490
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
since Duan of Inebriation Restaurant

491
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,540
transferred to our shop,

492
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,090
his First-class Divine Soup

493
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,190
has become our signature dish.

494
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,910
It's drawing more and more customers.

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,610
As for the formula,

496
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,110
I'm afraid only Duan knows it.

497
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,390
Okay.

498
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,210

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:30,920
No need.

No, you are so weak.

What if it's super potent?

510
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,420
I'll drink it first.

511
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,570
You can't take it.

512
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,670
I'll drink it first.

513
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,190

Drink it.

523
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,990
No.

524
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,410
The flowers have bloomed.

525
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,350
All bloomed.

526
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,470
What happened?

527
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,740
I don't know.

528
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,410
But it's so beautiful.

529
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,860
It's really beautiful.

530
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,280
You too.

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,230

533
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,190
I think so.

534
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,720
But we're still investigating.

535
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,050
Yes.

536
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,140
We have to wake up.

537
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,280
But I want to stay here forever.

538
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,200
Me too.

539
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,350
It's so comfortable here.

540
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,020
There's no rush then.

541
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,760
What's the hurry?

542
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,690
Wake up!

543
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:00,860
You're poisoned.

544
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,660
Get up now!

545
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,020
I haven't had the soup. How did I get poisoned?

546
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,610
They found out we were substitutes.

547
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,790
So the poison wasn't added to the soup.

548
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,360
It's in the charcoal!

549
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,700
Wormwood!

550
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,670

551
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,390
Something is wrong with the chef Duan!

552
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,450
Get out of here now!

553
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:29,850
Don't run!

554
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,760
How dare you run?

555
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,870
You're the one who served the soup.

556
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,470
Tell me.

557
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Did you add wormwood to the charcoal?

558
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,520
I’m innocent!

559
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,300
It wasn't me!

560
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,520
It really wasn't me!

561
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,050
It was Duan!

562
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,780
He said customers will keep coming after adding it.

563
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,860
It really wasn't me!

564
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,440
Manager, help me!

565
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,510
Duan.

566
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,430
How could you harm me?

567
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:02,790
Where is he?

568
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,480

I told him the customers were substitutes.

572

It really has nothing to do with me.

573
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,190
Do you have more wormwood?

574
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,950
Yes.

575

But he always took it behind my back.

Alright, it's none of your business.

Excuse me.

This is it.

590
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
This is wormwood?

591
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,970
This is the powder extracted from wormwood.

592
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,790
It can make you forget your worries

Wormwood doesn't originate from Yong.

As a chef,

how'd Duan get wormwood?

598
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,790
It’s profitable.

599
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,800
It must've been

Those who take it

You mean my wife was poisoned with wormwood?

Madam Li's symptoms that day

615
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,050
perfectly matched those after overdosing

I can't let go of Kuo'er.

622
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,460
We once had a son

623
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,990
named Kuo'er.

624
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,540
Because we were always away

625
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,580
and didn't discipline him well,

626
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,630
Kuo'er died in a fight.

627
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,910
My husband treated him as the shame of the Li family.

628
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,970
But I'm his mother.

629
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,750
He was in my womb for ten months.

630
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,480
He was my beloved child.

631
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,390
I couldn't let it go.

632
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,440
I once thought of doing the unthinkable to reunite with Kuo'er.

633
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,440
It was Shen...

634
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,640
who kept trying to comfort me.

635
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
That's why I didn't kill myself.

636
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,980
I was then introduced to Wispy Pavilion.

637
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,240
I just wanted to meet my Kuo'er more.

638
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,900
There's nothing between Shen and me.

639
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,620
We're just friends.

640
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,900
I couldn't talk about Kuo'er to anyone.

641
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,420
I could only tell him.

642
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,810
He's also the only one...

643
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,870
who could understand me.

758
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,050
Your Highness.

759
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,010
I deserve to die, Your Highness.

760
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,330
How did your prince fall into the river?

761
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,380
I don't know.

762
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,660
His Highness drank too much last night

763
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,190
and asked for hangover soup.

764
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,870
So I went to get it from the carriage.

765
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,870
But when I came back, he was already missing.

766
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Your Highness...

767
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,270
Your Highness...

768
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,800
I’ve seen this canister before.

769
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,350
During the search of wormwood,

770
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,570
there was a same one in Duan's room.

771
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,240
It's wormwood.

772
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,700
Why is Duan's item among the evidence?

773
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,430
Did Duan... kill the prince?

774
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,300
Regardless,

775
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,050
Prince Duomi's sudden death in the river is a big deal.

776
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,370
I doubt the alliance will work out.

777
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,230
Lord Ao.

778
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,930
You are...

779
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,930
Duomi! Duomi!

780
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,480
You left so suddenly.

781
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,870
[Sifang Pavilion]

782
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,760
Mobei was hesitant about the alliance to begin with.

783
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,180
Duomi's accident gave them more excuses.

784
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,980
I'm afraid the five states' alliance won't work out.

785
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,640
We just placated Lord Li,

786
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,420
and now Prince Duomi's dead.

787
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,590
Are you sure there's no conspiracy behind this?

788
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,510
Duomi! Duomi!

789
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,490
The heavens are unfair!

790
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,070
How can I explain to Khan that

791
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,950
our state's jewel has perished here?

792
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
I failed my duty as the Mobei Envoy.

793
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,220
I should just die too!

794
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,250
Lord Ao, sorry for your loss.

795
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,710
We also just found out

796
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,800
Prince Duomi died

797
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,390
after drunkenly falling into the river.

798
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,620
How is that possible?

799
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,590
Why'd he fall into the river?

800
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,450
He must have been murdered!

801
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,450
This matter needs to be verified by Jingzhao Prefecture

802
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,710
before a conclusion can be drawn.

803
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,710
Vice Minister An.

804
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,350
Save it with the formal talk.

805
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,390
When Yong wanted to ally with Mobei,

806
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,840
nothing was off-limits.

807
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,640
Now that there's trouble, you're all about bureaucratic procedures?

808
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
Prince Duomi was killed in Yong State.

809
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,730
Mobei will never ally with Yong State

810
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,390
ever again.

811
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,150
Just give up!

812
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,800
You have ten days to hand over the murderer

813
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,480
and account for this.

814
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,580
Otherwise, we won't let this go easily!

815
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,950
Poor Prince Duomi.

816
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,500
Wait, Lord Ao.

817
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,460
Wait.

818
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,550
You left so suddenly!

819
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,270
It's a lose-lose situation for us!

820
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,490
Even if we find the murderer within ten days,

821
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,830
Mobei still won't ally with us.

822
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,180
No.

823
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,850
They'll agree to ally with us.

824
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,370
Didn't you hear it?

825
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,420
Lord Ao just said that

826
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,380
since Prince Duomi died in Yong,

827
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,520
he won't agree to an alliance.

828
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,370
As long as we find the murderer,

829
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,510
I can make Lord Ao return

830
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,060
to discuss the alliance.
