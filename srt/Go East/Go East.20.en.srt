Yuan Mo.

4
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,720
What are we looking for?

5
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,150
What’s in

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,140
Wispy Pavilion?

7
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,750
Wormwood.

8
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,440
I’m looking for wormwood.

9
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,250
How could there be wormwood here?

10
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,530
Of course there isn't.

11
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,180
Because the wormwood is in the ledger.

12
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,910
Are you dumb?

13
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,730
Who'd record poison purchase in the ledger?

14
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,820
Look.

15
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,750
This is the price of cabbage

16
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,829
after Duan came.

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
This is the previous one.

18
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,140
It only cost a few more wens per 500 g.

19
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,190
Is that a lot?

20
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,470
You might be unaware of

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,730
how much ingredients a restaurant need.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
Look at the purchase volume.

23
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,900
So much cabbage every half a month?

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,430
That means it's a lot more expensive.

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,030
Yes.

26
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,110
Not only that,

27
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,540
but also these fish and chicken.

28
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,390
They're all more expensive

29
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,130
since Duan came.

30
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,390
It means he distributed the cost of wormwood

31
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,750
evenly across the ingredients.

32
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,730
But how did he transport

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,950
wormwood in?

34
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,670
We'll know once we check his purchase book.

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,430
Nothing suspicious.

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,160
They're all common ingredients of restaurants.

37
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,300
Common ingredients?

38
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,180
What are you looking for now?

39
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,829
I know.

40
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,829
Wispy Pavilion is a restaurant.

41
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,110
So naturally,

42
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,910
we looked for clues in the ingredients

43
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,310
Wispy Pavilion bought.

44
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,270
But what if the wormwood

45
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,430
wasn't sneaked into the ingredients?

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,030
Besides ingredients,

47
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,600
there are also consumables

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,360
like bowls, utensils, tables, and stools.

49
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,860
25 kg of Luffa pulp?

50
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,760
It'd last beyond ten years.

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,390
Isn't Luffa food?

52
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,110
After Luffa's dried,

53
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,720
it can be used to wash dishes

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,570
or package valuable and fragile things.

55
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,050
Did Duan wrap the wormwood

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,810
in the Luffa pulp to bring it into Wispy Pavilion?

57
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,269
This is so beautiful.

58
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,269
Yes, so cute.

Top quality.

83
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,610
Quality doesn't matter.

84
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,340
What matters is we want a lot.

85
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,520

Sir, you want so much?

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,560
Can you use them all?

88
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,800
It depends on how I use them.

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,990
How'll you use it?

90
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,010
We'll use it however Duan does.

Cut the crap.

94
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,590
Duan recommended us.

95

But Duan

96
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,390
hasn't shown up for a long time.

97
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,120
He must've bought too much last time,

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,580
so it's enough for a while.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
We want to buy more.

100
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,270

How do you dare buy goods now?

103
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,950
Jingzhao Prefecture can shut Wispy Pavilion down,

104
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,410
but can it restrain all of Changle's nobles?

Where are you taking us?

115

we need to get it from the warehouse.

117
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,550
How far is it?

118
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,790
Not very far.

119
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,870
What's wrong?

120
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,260
Are you in a hurry to use it yourself?

121
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,450
Of course, I can't wait.

122
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,980
That's it.

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,030

Are you kidding me?

126
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,020
Is this a warehouse?

127
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,250
Go down and have a look.

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,790
Duan

131
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,510
wouldn't recommend strangers to me.

132
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,690

Stay away. Stay away!

135
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,370
Stay away!

136
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,190
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

137
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,830
Back off!

138
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,070
Stay away!

139
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,840
Don't be afraid.

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
You ignorant imbeciles!

141
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,060
Do you know who we are?

142
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,910
How dare you!

143
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,550
Who are you?

145
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,280
Wispy Pavilion was raided,

146
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,210
yet we can still buy goods now.

147
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,940
Rack your dumb brains.

148
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,190
Who could've such guts?

149
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,440
Judging from your accent,

150
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,030
you're Yanle's...

151
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,460
nobles?

152
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,970
You're right.

153
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,630
Not only are we Yanle's nobles,

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
on behalf of Kang Yunhai,

155
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,700
I'd like to greet everyone.

156
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,270
Kang Yunhai.

157
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,700
Could it be that Yanle Embassy wants to

158
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,270
get involved in the wormwood business?

159
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,430
Seriously?

160
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,350
Playing so big.

161
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,140
This is Yong territory.

162
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,560
It’s exactly because it’s Yong territory

163
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,350
that your business

164
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,750
is easier to do when Yanle Embassy backs you.

165
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,430
In your shop,

166
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,910
I've already told you that

167
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,610
even Jingzhao Prefecture can't do anything to us.

168
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,730
Who would've thought that

169
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,750
you thieves would

170
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,740
brazenly wave weapons at us.

171
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,070
Are you all crazy?

172
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,170
Hurry up.

173
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,430
Put them away.

174
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,670
Put them down.

175
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,120
We're friends.

176
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,240
These are all regular procedures.

177
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,060
Please don't mind it.

178
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,510
You're wise.

179
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
This is how business should be done.

180
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,610
Let's check the goods.

181
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,870
Please.

182
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,700
Alright. Dismiss.

183
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,930
Get back to your work.

184
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,150
I sell these to Duan.

185
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,390
Top grade, for sure.

186
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,480
If you say it's top grade,

187
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,520
I wouldn't dare flatter you.

188
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,720
What... What do you mean by that?

189
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,590
Wormwood originates from Xiyuan.

190
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,660
Transported to Yong by water,

191
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,790
it'd be a little moist.

192
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,740
But your goods are extremely dry.

193
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,110
I reckon these were

194
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,550
planted in a shed in a dry and rainless area in Mobei.

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,930
You save half the travel expenses,

196
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,860
but it lacks some flavor.

197
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,920
You can fool Duan with these

198
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,030
but not me.

199
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,830
You're so young but such an expert.

200
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,510
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,640
Come on.

202
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,650
Show this customer

203
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,140
our best stuff.

204
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,230
Yes.

205
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,970
Please have a look.

206
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,980
Treasure in the mortal world.

207
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,310
Are you satisfied?

208
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,250
These goods are 30% more expensive

209
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,400
than those we sell Duan.

210
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,870
30%?

211
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,920
So what if it's 40% more expensive?

212
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,610
We're from Yanle Embassy.

213
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,230
It's peanuts to us.

214
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,350
100 silver taels.

215
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,440
Cash on delivery.

216
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,080
We'll load them right away.

217
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,280
Are you stupid?

218
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,020
Didn't you

219
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,580
bring us here without explaining?

220
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,380
Do we look like we have cash on us?

221
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,360
Then what's your plan?

222
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,230
You can't buy this on credit.

223
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,490
You... You're robbing...

224
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,570
We came here to examine the goods.

225
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,770
Understand?

226
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,470
Have you seen anyone examining goods

227
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,720
with a case of cash?

228
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,110
We're satisfied with the goods.

229
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,230
Load the carriage to leave at night.

230
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,960
I'll escort you to the back door of Yanle Embassy.

231
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,550
When the goods arrive, you'll get the money.

232
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,270
I've never done this before.

233
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,950
That's because you've never met such a big client.

234
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,670
If you think it's strange, take us as hostages.

235
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,250
Will that do?

236
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,560
Let's make a deal.

237
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,540
At this point,

238
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,490
if anything goes wrong,

239
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,940
you two will suffer.

240
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,030
That won't do.

241
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,400
Load the carriage.

242
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,290
Load the carriage!

243
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,650
Manager Liang.

244
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,190
We brought a Luffa pulp buyer who claims to be

245
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,320
from Yanle Embassy.

246
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,600
I just want to buy some stuff!

247
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,990
Is this necessary?

248
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,360
I've been running around all day!

249
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,230
Where is your manager?

250
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,110
This...

251
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,750
Yuan Mo? Ah Shu?

252
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,580
Advisor Ma!

253
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,610
We're just buying some stuff.

254
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,660
Why are you doing it yourself?

255
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,600
Well...

256
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,070
T-T-That's right.

257
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Recently, we've been entertaining

258
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,640
many guests.

259
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,230
They even asked me to buy them myself.

260
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,750
It's just some Luffa pulp!

261
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,070
Why did they bring me to this hole?

262
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,790
-Seriously...
-I know.

263
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,540
Really...

264
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,630
Don't worry, Advisor Ma.

265
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,430
I-I-I...

266
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,910
Ah Shu and I have bought it for you.

267
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,310
We're about to send it back to the posthouse.

268
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,310
You've bought it?

269
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,700
Y-You and Ah Shu?

270
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,740
Alright, don't worry.

271
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,790
Go back and wait.

272
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,150
Go, go, go.

273
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,810
Wait, you've bought it for me?

274
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,630
Hang on!

275
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,700
You know each other?

276
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,660
You're both here to buy Luffa pulp?

277
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,350
You're both from Yanle Embassy?

278
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,170
He said Yanle Embassy!

279
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,070
I'm from the west hall.

280
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,870
What west hall?

281
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,350
Aren't you from Sifang Pavilion's West Court?

282
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,190
Sifang Pavilion? Bah!

283
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,330
Arrest him!

284
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,090
What Sifang Pavilion...

285
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,540
Let's go!

286
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,550
Move!

287
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,970
Liar! Shameless!

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,920
Catch him. Catch him!

289
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,120
Buddy!

290
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,310
I-I'm just here to buy Luffa pulp!

291
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,260
Don't do this!

292
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,060
Don't...

293
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,350
I told you not to do this!

294
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,950
I missed!

295
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,500
Hurry!

296
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,870
Isn't it time for Wang Kunwu and Yuchi Hua to show up?

297
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,830
Why aren't they here yet?

298
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,630
Let's go.

299
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,790
Sir!

300
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,070
Sir!

301
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,660
Why is he here?

302
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,710
Thank you.

303
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,270
Thank you for saving us.

304
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,640
But why are you here?

305
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,790
Because of... him.

306
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,260
Prince Duomi?

307
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,360
Ah Shu, Yuan Mo.

308
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,370
Did you miss me?

309
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,850
You're still alive!

310
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,350
We all thought...

311
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,410
Thought I was dead?

312
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,430
Did you shed tears behind my back?

313
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,360
I actually wish you were dead.

314
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,270
You don't seem surprised

315
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,910
that I'm not dead.

316
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,630
Of course.

317
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,150
I've been looking for you for days.

318
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,410
I just didn't expect you to show up here.

319
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,080
What do you mean?

320
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,270
Were you looking for him?

321
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,350
This is not a place to talk.

322
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,280
Let's leave now.

323
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,490
Nariji!

324
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,990
Duomi, be careful!

325
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,700
Yuan Mo.

326
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,220
We finally meet.

327
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,780
Do you know me?

328
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,350
Of course.

329
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,860
I should also thank your father and mother.

330
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,710
If I hadn't killed them,

331
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,380
I wouldn't be who I am today.

332
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,950
Yuan Mo.

333
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,280
Don't listen to him.

334
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,950
Yuan Mo.

335
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,900
Man in White.

336
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,210
Yuan Mo, he's provoking you.

337
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,390
Miss,

338
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,560
why do you have the prestigious Yanle accent?

339
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,820
None of your business.

340
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,150
Leave her here.

341
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,070
Kill the rest.

342
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,670
Step back!

343
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,470
Yuchi!

344
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,490
Sorry, I'm late.

345
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,710
Come on, Jin!

346
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,830
-Come on!
-Come on, drink up!

347
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,430
Come on!

348
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,950
Jin, bottoms up!

349
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,890
It's gone! Another one!

350
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,980
-Come on!
-Come on!

351
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,150
Come on!

352
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,540
Come on!

353
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,990
Drink up!

354
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,480
-Have some meat!
-Have some meat!

355
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,340
Have some meat!

356
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,590
Bro, add some firewood.

357
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,860
Come on! I'll do it!

358
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,670
Hurry up!

359
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,190
Come on! Let's continue!

360
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,380
Cheers!

361
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,380
Buddies.

362
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,750
Wang!

363
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,840
Come on! Let's drink together!

364
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,240
Kunwu, come on!

365
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,920
Bro, we've been waiting for you!

366
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,550
Come on!

367
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,100
Buddies!

368
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,530
Wang.

369
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,230
You...

370
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,790
We finally meet again.

371
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,130
We miss you so much.

372
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,540
I miss you a lot too.

373
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,590
Kunwu.

374
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,230
I've married my beloved.

375
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,230
I've married my beloved!

376
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,390
Good.

377
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,510
Wang.

378
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,790
I've earned merits.

379
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,670
I've returned home to take care of my mother.

380
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,350
No one in my family

381
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,310
can ever bully my mother again!

382
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,910
Awesome! Awesome!

383
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,550
Bro.

384
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,150
I've saved up enough money

385
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,360
and bought two mu of land!

386
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,680
I'm living so well!

387
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,470
Good. Good.

388
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,490
Bro.

389
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,200
What about you?

390
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,030
I...

391
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,510
I...

392
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,270
No.

393
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,900
I have to go back.

394
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,470
I... I can't stay here.

395
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,720
I have to avenge you.

396
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,660
Bro, stay.

397
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,130
Kunwu, stay.

398
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,540
Everyone misses you.

399
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,600
No, no. I have to go.

400
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,700
Bro, don't go.

401
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,650
Stay here, bro.

402
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,910
I have to avenge you!

403
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,510
Kunwu!

404
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,350
I have to go!

405
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,250
Bro.

406
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,670
We agreed to return home in glory together!

407
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,420
Return home in glory.

408
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,830
I have to go.

409
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,750
Return home in glory.

410
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,270
I have to go.

411
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,670
Return home in glory.

412
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,590
I have to take revenge.

413
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,270
Return home in glory.

414
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,590
I'll avenge you!

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,330
He's awake. He's awake.

416
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,110
How are you?

417
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,070
Where is the Man in White?

418
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,470
He escaped.

419
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,750
I couldn’t catch the female killer either.

420
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,800
And the wormwood...

421
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,250
It's been handed to Jingzhao Prefecture.

422
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,070
I'm useless.

423
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,520
It was a great opportunity,

424
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,710
but I failed to arrest the Man in White.

425
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,030
It's not your fault.

426
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,470
After I was poisoned,

427
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,750
I saw my buddies again.

428
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
When I saw them...

429
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,080
I really couldn't leave them.

430
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,080
Wang, don’t be sad.

431
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,860
After we take down this wormwood workshop,

432
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,310
it can’t harm people anymore.

433
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,830
Prince Duomi is still alive.

434
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,050
And though the Man in White sounds mysterious,

435
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,670
he's nothing special.

436
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,330
At least we almost caught him this time.

437
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,300
Ah Shu is right.

438
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,710
If the Man in White dares to act again,

439
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,740
we will catch him.

440
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,290
Where's Duomi?

441
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,230
He...

442
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,830
is burying his bodyguard.

443
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,940
Thank you for your years of protection.

444
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,210
The eagle on the prairie

445
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,920
will take you home.

446
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,430
His name was Nariji.

447
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,990
It means "shield."

448
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,800
Don't worry.

449
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,000
We'll catch the Man in White

450
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,730
and avenge him.

451
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,990
I was planning on making merry

452
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,310
and whiling my life away in Changle.

453
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,930
To think fate still caught up with me.

454
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,940
There's no use running away.

455
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,400
It's only a matter of time.

456
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,590
You said you were looking for me when we first met.

457
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,000
Did you know I wasn't dead?

458
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,400
Of course.

459
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,650
The corpse by the river

460
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,470
had thick fingers with deep fingerprints

461
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,670
and hands filled with calluses.

462
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,690
He clearly did manual labor for a long time.

463
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,170
Especially those calves

464
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,330
filled with veins like earthworms.

465
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,660
I've read it in medical books that

466
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,550
these symptoms are largely caused by fatigue.

467
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,270
That person

468
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,310
must've stood a lot in his lifetime.

469
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,540
But Prince Duomi is

470
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,710
the most idle person in Changle.

471
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,800
He likes to wander around,

472
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,910
wine and dine, and taste delicious food.

473
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,430
How could he have such symptoms?

474
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,640
That corpse was...

475
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,310
That corpse was Duan.

476
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,950
Let go!

477
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,540
Let go!

478
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,440
Let go.

479
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,790
I've seen you before.

480
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,640
You're Inebriation Restaurant's chef.

481
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,900
Why are you harming me?

482
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,490
I lost my job at Inebriation Restaurant.

483
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,430
Other shops dare not hire me

484
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,430
because of your rubbish bad review.

485
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,720
I got addicted because of you.

486
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,340
I...

487
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,390
I'll kill you. I...

488
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,260
Pull me up!

489
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,470
I can save you.

490
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
You can't help me.

491
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,420
I've to kill you.

492
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,640
Only then would he give me wormwood!

493
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,590
Him? Who is he?

494
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,480
Let go!

495
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,280
No wonder

496
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,240
you said that if we find the murderer,

497
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,950
you could force Lord Ao back to the negotiation table.

498
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,110
So you already knew

499
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,640
Duomi killed Duan

500
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,410
and disguised the corpse as himself?

501
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,900
I didn't kill Duan.

502
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,290
That day, I fell into the water.

503
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,470
Duan strangled me,

504
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,250
and I choked on water and fainted.

505
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,820
When I woke up,

506
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,640
I was already in that remote house.

507
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,280
There were even food and water inside.

508
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,870
Then I managed to contact Nariji

509
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,640
and asked him to keep an eye on you.

510
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,220
That's how I found that warehouse.

511
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Nariji was skilled in martial arts,

512
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,690
but he couldn't swim.

513
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,670
When he learned I was saved,

514
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,350
he was relieved.

515
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,600
So there was a fourth person there?

516
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,830
I went to a restaurant once.

517
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,020
Someone also hinted me to escape.

518
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,100
I daren't tempt fate then,

519
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,530
so I didn't go into the dark alley.

520
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,190
Stop!

521
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,260
Turn around and go back.

522
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,720
They saved you more than once.

523
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,750
Who could it be?

524
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,070
Who cares?

525
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,690
As long as they're helping us,

526
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,820
they're our friend.

527
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
That makes sense.

528
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,730
Anyway, Duomi isn't dead.

529
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,540
So the talks will go back on track.

530
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,190
I'll inform Mr. Yu tomorrow.

531
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,000
No hurry.

532
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Now, wormwood has entered Changle,

533
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,960
Madam Li was poisoned,

534
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,310
and Prince Duomi was attacked.

535
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,990
Everything

536
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,790
can prove the Man in White did it.

537
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,990
Yanle must be involved.

538
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,230
Although the talks can resume,

539
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,650
it's only to force Lord Ao to agree to the alliance.

540
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,450
We can't guarantee Yanle won't play tricks again.

541
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,000
We must find a way to solve it once and for all.

542
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,390
Duomi.

543
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,610
Rest in peace.

544
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,330
Where did he go? Guards!

545
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,780
Did you kill me?

546
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,540
Not me, not me.

547
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,510
Prince Duomi.

548
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,240
It's Deputy Envoy Kang.

549
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,080
He wanted you dead.

550
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,710
You should claim his life.

551
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,800
Prince Duomi! Prince Duomi!

552
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,940
I have no grudge against him.

553
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,310
Why did he kill me?

554
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,040
He wants to use your death as an excuse

555
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,470
to opt out of the alliance with Yong.

556
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,670
I also did it because of the newly-born prince...

557
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,470
It was just a lapse of judgment.

558
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,460
Prince Duomi, please spare my life.

559
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,830
Please spare my life.

560
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,610
Write it down.

561
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,420
Write it down.

562
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,390
I'll write it.

563
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,700
[Ministry of Rites]

564
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,270
Vice Minister An.

565
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,730
Deputy Envoy Kang is here.

566
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,370
May I know why you

567
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,730
summoned me?

568
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,020
There was a huge storm last night.

569
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,750
I wonder if you slept well.

570
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,370
Thank you for your concern.

571
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,990
I slept soundly last night.

572
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,270
If I were you,

573
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,980
having done so much evil,

574
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,650
I'm afraid I'd have trouble falling asleep.

575
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,470
What do you mean by that?

576
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,710
In the land of Yong, how dare you

577
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,940
hire killers to assassinate Mobei's Prince Duomi

578
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,750
and try to stop the alliance between Yong and the five states.

579
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,830
Luckily, Prince Duomi killed the killer,

580
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,320
preventing the disaster.

581
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,350
How are you still acting here?

582
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,080
What prince of Mobei?

583
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,870
I don't know him at all.

584
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,980
Besides, Yong allying with the five states

585
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,530
has nothing to do with me.

586
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,250
This is Lord Ao's statement.

587
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,120
How do you explain it?

588
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Vice Minister An.

589
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,720
This is just his side of the story.

590
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,410
Do you really believe it?

591
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,480
If you don't admit it...

592
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,270
I'll reveal this side of the story to the world.

593
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,820
Let's see if the people believe you or me.

594
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,230
Vice Minister An.

595
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,700
Don't push me too far.

596
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,310
If you don't want to

597
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,110
aggravate the situation,

598
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,710
you must obey the law of Yong

599
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,760
and behave like a proper envoy.

600
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,860
If you dare obstruct

601
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,200
the alliance between Yong and the five states,

602
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,830
we won't let you off easily.

603
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,320
Yanle's already struggling in the desert.

604
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
If Yong allies with the five states,

605
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,990
you'd be against Yanle.

606
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,920
If you form an alliance,

607
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,270
Yanle will be in a sorrier plight!

608
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,570
If you were me,

609
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,370
would you just sit back and watch?

610
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,030
Thanks to Mobei's sanction to allow Prince Duomi

611
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,960
to take over as envoy temporarily,

612
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,610
the alliance ceremony between Yong and the five states could be brought forward.

613
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,840
[Yong]

614
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,949
Today, the envoys of the five states

615
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:51,500
of Mobei, Dongyuan, Xiyuan, Yueying, and Yuluo

616
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,670
have gathered at Ministry of Rites.

617
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,370
It's my honor to have you here.

618
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,580
The six states are as one.

619
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,020
We hereby pledge our loyalty to each other.

620
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,050
Fulfill the oath and Heaven will bless us.

621
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,550
-Fulfill the oath and Heaven will bless us.
-Fulfill the oath and Heaven will bless us.

622
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,510
The alliance ceremony begins now.

623
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,190
Mobei Envoy, please come forward.

624
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,110
Bow.

625
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,910
Exchange the agreement.

626
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,230
Bow.

627
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,600
Dongyuan Envoy, please come forward.

628
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,870
Bow.

629
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,190
Bow.

630
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,580
Xiyuan Envoy, please come forward.

631
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,390
From now on,

632
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,660
Yong and the five states will ally

633
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,230
to maintain good relations, stay united in times of crisis,

634
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,590
and help each other.

635
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,300
Violate the oath

636
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,590
and one shall suffer divine retribution.

637
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,660
-Violate the oath
-Violate the oath

638
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,460
-and one shall suffer divine retribution.
-and one shall suffer divine retribution.

639
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,120
[Ruyi Pavilion]

640
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,190
I thought I'd see you at the alliance ceremony.

641
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,450
Only retainers are qualified to attend.

642
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
My rank's too low.

643
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,390
You should've witnessed that magnificent event.

644
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,600
After all, you were the ones who gave your all

645
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,250
for this alliance.

646
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,340
It's enough to hear that.

647
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,800
The alliance has been formed.

648
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,850
Prince Duomi is alive too.

649
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,110
It's worth a drink.

650
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,670
Come on.

651
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,760
But I'm not here to celebrate.

652
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,970
I'm saying goodbye.

653
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,680
I'm returning to Mobei.

654
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,940
Returning to Mobei?

655
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,210
Would your brother accept you?

656
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,710
With Yong's mediation,

657
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,430
my brother has allowed me to return to my homeland

658
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,890
and will ensure my safety.

659
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,560
The envoy of Mobei...

660
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,980
Will be assumed by the deputy envoy for now.

661
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,140
I've been in Yong

662
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,440
for long enough.

663
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,660
I’ve eaten all the delicacies of Changle.

664
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,870
Besides, the stunning beauty

665
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,450
has someone she loves.

666
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,050
What's the point of me staying here?

667
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,480
I might as well pack my bags and return home.

668
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,510
After all,

669
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,970
the place where my mom brews Kumis

670
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,060
is the real home of a wanderer.

671
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,570
You reminded me of that.

672
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,800
In my opinion, these are all excuses.

673
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,000
You want to go back and get down to work.

674
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,380
The six states have formed an alliance,

675
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,710
but Mobei's situation is still unstable.

676
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,310
You're going back

677
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,570
to use the alliance to accumulate your power

678
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,670
and take the offensive.

679
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,070
Yuan.

680
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,830
You overestimated me.

681
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,190
I was born to be idle.

682
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,350
I'm not interested in the court;

683
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,760
much less competing with my brother for the throne.

684
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,440
I just ran away for too long.

685
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,910
It's boring.

686
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,270
I want to live differently.

687
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,270
Throughout these years,

688
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,350
I've lost too much.

689
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,710
I don't want to do this anymore.

690
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,560
It's a beautiful occasion.

691
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,440
Don't let the great wine go to waste.

692
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,750
Alright. Here's to you realizing your dreams.

693
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,470
Cheers.

694
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,080
Cheers.

695
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,310
What is it?

696
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,190
Are you really not coming with me?

697
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

698
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,510
But I’m very satisfied in Changle.

699
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,060
Heard that, Your Highness?

700
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,130
Take care. We'll see you off here.

701
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,390
In that case,

702
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,470
I can only accept the engagement back home

703
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,070
and marry Yanle's princess.

704
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,120
You're engaged,

705
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,550
yet you're eyeing Ah Shu?

706
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,510
Everyone knows

707
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,480
Yanle's princess has been missing for years.

708
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,570
Who knows if she's alive?

709
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,690
I can't be alone forever, can I?

710
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,910
What if they find her?

711
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,650
I'll force myself to marry her.

712
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,980
I don't care if you find her or not.

713
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,280
Anyway, don't you dare take a fancy to Ah Shu.

714
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,680
I'm a prince.

715
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,190
So what?

716
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,740
Even if it jeopardizes our states' ties,

717
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,500
I won't let you take Ah Shu away.

718
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,140
See you on the battlefield.

719
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,090
Fine, I'm afraid of you.

720
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,350
Can I surrender?

721
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,470
But get this clear.

722
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,910
I didn't lose to you.

723
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,040
I just respect Ah Shu's wishes.

724
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,950
Guys,

725
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,750
I'm sure we'll meet again.

726
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,080
No thanks. Goodbye.

727
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,850
Let's go!

728
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,050
Although Duomi is a bit annoying,

729
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,430
he's quite handsome.

730
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,760
Goodbye to you too.

731
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,270
What's wrong? Jealous?

732
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,950
No.

733
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,190
You're jealous.

734
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,070
Look at your pouty face.

735
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,730
I'm not!

736
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,840
You're petty.

737
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,750
I'm very confident.
