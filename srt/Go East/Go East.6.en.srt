Don't worry.

You'd better not target me.

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Still denying it?

193
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,790
Where did you get this money?

194
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,290
It'll be temporarily confiscated.

195
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,690
Yuchi Hua, are you blind?

196
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,830
You gave me this money.

197
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,560
How is it dirty money now?

198
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,920
Are you dirty or am I?

199
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,040
This box does seem to be from my mansion.

200
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,630
See?

201
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,570
Who knows about the money?

202
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,440
They weren't stringed when I gave them to you.

203
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,930
I stringed all of them

204
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,090
wen by wen.

205
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,940
Huh? Are you crazy?

206
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,790
Regardless, it's confiscated for now!

207
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,310
Those disfigured customers

208
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,670
are waiting for your compensation.

209
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,330
Arrest him!

210
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,260
Ah Shu... It was Ah Shu!

211
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,230
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

212
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,820
My money!

213
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,100
[Jingzhao Prefecture]

214
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,230
Do you two plead guilty?

215
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,800
I, Yuan Mo, am innocent.

216
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,750
As for her...

217
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,380
Yuchi.

218
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,110
Ah Shu.

219
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,620
If you broke the law,

220
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,070
I can't be biased.

221
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,950
Say something.

222
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,520
Say what?

223
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,840
I can't go to prison.

224
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,990
You know what'd happen if they investigated me.

225
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,790
It's too late for regrets.

226
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,030
You want me to take the blame for you?

227
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,590
No way.

228
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,120
Please, just this once.

229
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,910
I'll listen to you from now on.

230
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,000
Why didn't you listen to me before?

231
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,880
It's too late.

232
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,530
I'm warning you.

233
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,250
If you dare to collaborate,

234
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,960
you'll be punished severely.

235
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,350
Magistrate.

236
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,770
It's all my fault.

237
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,590
It has nothing to do with my master.

238
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,630
Please don't punish my master.

239
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,970
Just punish me if you have to.

240
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,030
Just plead guilty.

241
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,830
Why are you crying?

242
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,190
Master.

243
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,840
Please don't kick me out.

244
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,830
I'm stupid.

245
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,840
I can't make good rouge

246
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,870
and don't make much money.

247
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,390
But I've tried my best.

248
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,030
To make rouge quickly to sell

249
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,690
to help you get a bigger house,

250
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,180
I haven't slept for days.

251
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,300
Wait, wait, wait.

252
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,940
What does your brazen troublemaking

253
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,150
h-have to do with my house?

254
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,670
It has nothing to do with it.

255
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,600
Master, whatever you say is right.

256
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,970
I misspoke.

257
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,830
Master, please don't hit me.

258
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,890
Ah Shu.

259
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,700
Make it clear.

260
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,190
Did Yuan Mo hit you before?

261
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,390
Did he force you to do those things?

262
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,250
You...

263
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,500
You only did it because you were afraid he'd hit you?

264
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,630
You're framing me.

265
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,270
Shut up!

266
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,460
Don't be scared, Ah Shu.

267
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,370
I'm here. No one will hurt you.

268
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,800
Just tell Magistrate Lin.

269
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,400
Magistrate Lin.

270
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,260
There must be a reason behind this.

271
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,820
W-What reason?

272
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,920
Both of you are deceived by her.

273
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,790
So she wasn't pleading guilty?

274
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,530
She was lying when she said you're innocent?

275
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,560
-Well, that’s...
-Ah Shu.

276
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,630
Stop hiding it for him.

277
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,600
No, I can't tell you...

278
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,620
Look, Magistrate Lin.

279
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,320
What is it?

280
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,140
Yuan Mo physically punished a maid

281
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,740
and instigated her to do illegal things,

282
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,870
tempting her to commit crimes.

283
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,830
Guards!

284
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,630
Put Yuan Mo in prison to await punishment.

285
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,030
Yes!

286
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,030
Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,030
Wait!

288
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,190
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

289
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,230
I'm innocent!

290
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,310
Ah Shu!

291
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,750
Ah Shu!

292
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,630
[Prison]

293
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,050
Move!

294
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,910
Be gentle. Be gentle.

295
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,810
Wait, wait.

296
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,590
Sir. Sir.

297
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm innocent.

298
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,860
-Go in!
-You got the wrong person.

299
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,270
It has nothing to do with me.

300
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,630
How could I do such a thing?

301
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,360
You're here.

302
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,800
Shen?

303
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,310
Have a seat.

304
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,860
It's you.

305
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,580
You used to

306
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,510
sell fake paintings and carve fake seals.

307
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,550
Now you're even selling fake rouge

308
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,750
to lead Ah Shu astray?

309
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,470
What do you mean I led her astray?

310
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,470
No wonder.

311
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,850
How could Ah Shu know those noble women?

312
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,820
I'm in hot water because of you two, you know?

313
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,600
It was Ah Shu who wanted to make money

314
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,950
and dragged me into it.

315
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,310
Why does she want to make money?

316
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,150
Am I not good to her?

317
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,880
Shouldn't you be aware of that?

318
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,750
Stop lying.

319
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,810
Where is Shen Bailian? Take me there.

320
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,830
Here, Madam.

321
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,870
[Madam Li]

322
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,850
See? The victim is here for you.

323
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,670
Just you wait.

324
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,860
Madam Li!

325
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,870
Shen.

326
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,110
Are you okay?

327
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,620
Did you suffer?

328
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,140
Did anyone bully you?

329
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,980
Let me see.

330
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,630
What are you doing here?

331
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,590
I brought this upon myself.

332
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,550
I even hurt you.

333
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,470
I can't face you anymore.

334
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,720
This misunderstanding was due to you being tricked.

335
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,510
Look.

336
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,560
My face is fine now.

337
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,050
Besides, you've refunded my money.

338
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,140
Why'd I blame you?

339
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,710
Madam.

340
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,430
You really don't blame me anymore?

341
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,310
Are you okay?

342
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Let me see your face.

343
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,800
Turn around and let me see.

344
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,340
Say no more.

345
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,880
If it weren't for you,

346
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,250
I wouldn't have found

347
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,330
a confidant in this foreign country.

348
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,150
Madam.

349
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,830
This is not a place to talk.

350
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,900
Release him.

351
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:33,840
Yes.

352
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm released?

353
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,630
Shen Bailian.

354
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,330
This victim bailed you out.

355
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,330
You can leave now.

356
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:40,990
Well...

357
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,710
Thank you, Madam Li.

358
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,190
Madam.

359
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,970
Back off!

360
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,150
Wait, wait, wait!

361
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,360
Shen Bailian! Shen Bailian!

362
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
I... What about me?

363
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,470
Wait, Madam Li.

364
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,760
I'm with him.

365
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,640
You could

366
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,270
bail me along with him.

367
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,710
Quiet! Back off!

368
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,510
Yuchi.

369
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,270
Thank you for pleading for me.

370
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,830
Yuan Mo

371
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,630
is usually glib.

372
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,030
I thought he only used his words.

373
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,080
I didn't expect him to hit you.

374
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,470
Those who hit women are all jerks.

375
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,460
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

376
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,250
No need.

377
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,670
I appreciate your kindness.

378
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,120
Yuan Mo and I are master and servant after all.

379
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,410
You're this hurt! How's it not his fault?

380
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,850
W-What I meant was...

381
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,170
it's not entirely his fault.

382
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,790
You know he loves his wine.

383
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,610
That day, I accidentally spilled

384
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,340
his favorite Jade Spring Wine.

385
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,390
So he asked me to punish myself with a ruler.

386
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,970
Ridiculous.

387
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,900
He's still a scumbag for mistreating his maid.

388
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,180
Stop defending him.

389
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,430
By the way,

390
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,150
will Yuan Mo be okay?

391
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,110
What he did would warrant

392
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,660
at least one year in prison.

393
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,450
One year?

394
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,210
Is that too little?

395
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,950
No...

396
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,480
Anyway, don't worry.

397
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,550
No one will bully you anymore.

398
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,070
Uncle Lin also fined Yuan Mo 20 strings

399
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,110
to compensate the victims.

400
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,710
By the way,

401
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,520
you can take back the remaining 10 strings for him.

402
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,670
What's wrong?

403
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,990
There are still 10 strings left.

404
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,850
Why don't you take it back for him?

405
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,589
Yuan Mo.

406
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,630
One more pot.

407
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,750
No. 380.

408
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,020
Okay.

409
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,970
Hang it at a noticeable spot.

410
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,370
Remember to renew the contract next month.

411
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,630
You're out too?

412
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,230
I...

413
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,720
You even have a lady following you secretly while you're at work.

414
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,610
It seems this fake rouge also bridged a romance.

415
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,770
Confidants. We're just confidants.

416
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,880
Where are you going?

417
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,990
You have your lady to protect you.

418
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,360
Yuan Mo only has me.

419
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,060
I'll find Ji to figure out a solution.

420
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,260
After all, this happened because of me.

421
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,150
I was just afraid in court.

422
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,050
I didn't expect such serious consequences.

423
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,260
Now,

424
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,310
we're living freely outside,

425
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,690
but he's suffering inside.

426
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,820
Okay.

427
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,710
Thank you.

428
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,550
Next.

429
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,620
Ah Shu?

430
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,790
How much does it cost to bail someone

431
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,670
from Jingzhao?

432
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,860
Is this enough?

433
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,470
Put that away now.

434
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,330
Mr. Yu has his own plan

435
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,540
to save Yuan Mo.

436
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,690
[Inebriation Restaurant]

437
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,650
Yuan Hanjing?

438
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,120
That's right.

439
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,680
Yuan Mo is very stubborn.

440
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,950
He never talks about his past.

441
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,970
So few people know

442
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,390
he's the orphan of Hanjing.

443
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,350
I should take care

444
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,190
of a hero's descendant.

445
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,100
Thank you, Magistrate Lin.

446
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,640
But...

447
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,480
Is there a problem?

448
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,110
It has nothing to do with this case.

449
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,200
Do you know Duke Er's daughter?

450
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,710
You mean Yuchi Hua?

451
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,560
Yes.

452
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,180
Ms. Yuchi has been working in the Ministry of Justice.

453
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,020
It's not that she isn't doing well.

454
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,670
But with Ms. Yuchi's ability,

455
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,830
if she could find a less taxing job

456
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,190
in Sifang Pavilion,

457
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,790
I believe Duke Er would be very pleased.

458
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,650
You're right.

459
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,400
If you want her to join Sifang Pavilion...

460
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm not saying she's not up to it.

461
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,330
I don't mean that.

462
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,750
But with Ms. Yuchi's talents,

463
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,600
it's really a waste for her

464
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
to be working with petty officials.

465
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,470
I’m afraid it's not good enough for Duke Er's daughter.

466
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,350
Exactly.

467
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,930
It's difficult.

468
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,240
Yes, indeed.

469
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,380
I have an idea.

470
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,720
A few days ago,

471
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,970
didn't Sifang Pavilion cooperate with Jingzhao

472
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,490
to solve the case of General Dou's murder?

473
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,230
Ms. Yuchi

474
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,090
and Retainer Wang from West Court

475
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,130
had seamless chemistry.

476
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,170
How about this?

477
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,500
In the name of Jingzhao Prefecture,

478
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,570
Ms. Yuchi could be in charge of

479
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,510
supervising affairs that involve

480
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,630
both Jingzhao and Sifang Pavilion.

481
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,710
What do you think?

482
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,070
Great.

483
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,510
In that case,

484
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,580
in name, Ms. Yuchi is still

485
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,350
under Jingzhao Prefecture.

486
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,630
As for the work,

487
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,390
she's assigned to your Sifang Pavilion.

488
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,230
Yes, yes.

489
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,330
Then she doesn't have to report everything to me.

490
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,960
All worries will be solved.

491
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,970
That's right.

492
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,630
What

493
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,490
do you think?

494
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,030
This method is acceptable.

495
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,540
Shall we proceed so?

496
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,670
Sure.

497
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,840
Magistrate Lin.

498
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,830
Well...

499
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,580
I suddenly remembered.

500
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,520
Yuan Mo's case has been clarified.

501
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,530
He's innocent.

502
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,630
That's right.

503
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,000
The maid under his name

504
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,140
colluded with Shen Bailian.

505
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,710
Yes.

506
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,400
They have paid the bail

507
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,260
and compensated the victims.

508
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,030
The victims

509
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,470
have withdrawn the lawsuit.

510
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,500
So Yuan Mo can be released, right?

511
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,250
Of course.

512
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,750
He also contributed a lot to Dou's case.

513
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,910
His merits are more than enough to offset his mistake.

514
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,390
Thank you, Magistrate Lin.

515
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,470
Then

516
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,400
Ms. Yuchi should quickly

517
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,550
be registered under Sifang Pavilion.

518
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,540
Then you won't be worrying day and night.

519
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,390
Please.

520
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,810
-Please.
-Please.

521
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,050
Here, eat more.

522
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,690
Thank you.

523
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,760
Here you are.

524
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,410
Thank you.

525
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,990
Here.

526
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,870
Sir, here!

527
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,710
Here! Here!

528
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,020
Sir.

529
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,320
You look so handsome with a bucket.

530
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,330
Nothing's left.

531
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,380
What do you mean?

532
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,670
Ask around about

533
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,120
my ties with Yu from Sifang Pavilion!

534
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,540
I'm innocent!

535
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,950
Yu...

536
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,300
Ji...

537
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,780
Shen Bailian...

538
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,560
Come visit me now.

539
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,310
Yuan Mo.

540
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,510
You've suffered.

541
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,110
I... I've suffered so much.

542
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,210
Yu! Yu!

543
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,660
Is that you, Yu?

544
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,510
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

545
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,750
This kid...

546
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,070
Eat slowly.

547
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,370
You can be released after eating.

548
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,870
Really?

549
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,350
Awesome.

550
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,600
Thanks to that maid,

551
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,030
I've been here for so long.

552
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,950
You are the best.

553
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,350
You still think about me.

554
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,170
Of course we should.

555
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,020
But there's a little condition.

556
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,530
Let me make it clear today.

557
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,960
As long as you let me out,

558
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,750
I'll agree to any condition!

559
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,500
Good! What a man!

560
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,230
Yuan Mo.

561
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,910
From Changle.

562
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,350
Yes.

563
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,350
He is a translator needed by Sifang Pavilion.

564
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,880
He is now in Jingzhao's prison.

565
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,780
Since he helped the government solve a major case, he's earned merits.

566
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,920
According to the law,

567
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,900
Sifang Pavilion petitioned with Jingzhao's Ministry of Justice
for his acquittal on account of his merits.

568
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,480
Henceforth, he's transferred to Sifang Pavilion.

569
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,620
It's not that serious.

570
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,310
You're despicable, Yu.

571
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,690
Why are you so shameless?

572
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm not going!

573
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,920
Really?

574
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,550
Even if you starve me to death today,

575
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,390
I won't go.

576
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,190
Fine, fine. I respect your integrity.

577
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,930
I have nothing else to say.

578
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,890
Advisor Yuchi, I'm really sorry.

579
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,790
I didn't expect

580
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,630
things to turn out like this.

581
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,150
Sorry to have troubled you to bring me to this dirty place.

582
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,070
To apologize,

583
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,140
well,

584
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,260
I brought two jars of 30-year-old Lingxi wine.

585
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,350
Let's drink it now.

586
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,490
Please.

587
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,270
A scrooge like you

588
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,620
actually brought such expensive wine?

589
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,380
You have no idea.

590
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,290
There's a theory with Lingxi wine.

591
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,900
It's a fine wine at 10 years old.

592
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,590
It's an aged wine at 20 years old.

593
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,100
It's a perfect wine at 30 years old.

594
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,860
There's only one jar of it.

595
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,560
The wine has an overwhelming aroma.

596
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,130
Even Jingzhao's prison

597
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,030
has become a paradise.

598
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,260
We have to meet often,

599
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,750
so we should take care of each other.

600
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,500
This first bowl is to you.

601
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,330
You're too polite, Mr. Yu.

602
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,870
After all, Sifang Pavilion only deals with foreign affairs.

603
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,340
I'll try not to visit you often.

604
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,470
There won't be so many chances to meet.

605
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,960
You don't understand.

606
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,150
Fate is quite magical.

607
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,590
We might even see each other every day.

608
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,350
Gosh, there's a bug in the wine.

609
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,710
What a waste.

610
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,310
Here's another toast to you.

611
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,540
I wish you endless joy

612
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,690
in Sifang Pavilion

613
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,950
such that

614
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,760
you aren't stressed and throwing tantrums.

615
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,680
As such, I'd have a stable career

616
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,230
until I retire.

617
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,350
Yu.

618
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,570
Is there something

619
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,360
you haven't told me?

620
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,160
No.

621
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,700
What else could there be?

622
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,230
There's more.

623
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,790
Come on.

624
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,710
Have one more.

625
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,350
Enough!

626
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,910
Here.

627
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,980
Save a sip for me.

628
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,310
Want some?

629
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,860
Yes.

630
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,170
Sign the papers first.

631
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,710
Start as a clerk in West Court.

632
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,810
Your working hours are 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.

633
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,990
You can't be absent without applying for leave.

634
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,190
No drinking at work.

635
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,750
No extra meals.

636
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,100
With everything, big or small,

637
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,870
you're at the command of Retainer Wang Kunwu.

638
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,830
How cruel...

639
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,140
Why don't you just kill me?

640
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,000
What's wrong with you?

641
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,700
How could you say that?

642
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,720
You know what?

643
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,510
I spent half a month's salary

644
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,490
to treat Lin Zuocheng to a meal to devise this plan

645
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,170
to save you from prison.

646
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,910
Don't be ungrateful.

647
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,330
You're so disappointing.

648
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,210
Yu. Yu. Yu.

649
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,630
We've been friends for over 20 years.

650
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,310
Over the years,

651
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,270
I've helped Sifang Pavilion out quite a bit, right?

652
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:35,550
Yes.

653
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,670
I've contributed

654
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,750
after all.

655
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,100
Why are you forcing me to become a regular employee?

656
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,600
Why?

657
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,990
Why are you yelling?

658
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,750
Do you think I want to?

659
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,270
I feel sorry for you.

660
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,880
Ask her.

661
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,910
Ask her.

662
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,430
Ask Advisor Yuchi

663
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,970
if prisoners sentenced for a year

664
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,590
have to go to extremely cold places to dig mines!

665
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,390
That's right.

666
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,930
How can you truly repent without suffering?

667
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,070
See? Heard that?

668
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,700
Tell me!

669
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,030
Is there any wine there?

670
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,020
Wine?

671
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,650
You'd be glad to have food.

672
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,870
Poor thing.

673
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,330
He deserves it anyway.

674
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,030
Forget it. All my efforts are in vain.

675
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,630
I'll stop talking.

676
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm done. Let's go, Miss.

677
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,290
I'll sign it!

678
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,910
Let's...

679
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,860
Let's talk about the salary first.

680
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,720
500 wens per month.

681
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,990
That's the maximum.

682
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,610
Okay.

683
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,920
But you'll be rewarded if you do well.

684
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,520
There will be rewards.

685
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,910
Yuan Mo.

686
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,720
Take a shower and report to work tomorrow.

687
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,950
Are you planning to live here?

688
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,030
Just one bed?

689
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,880
Since you're a guest,

690
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,040
you can have the bed.

691
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,630
It's so hard.

692
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,340
How does he usually sleep here?

693
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,160
Thank you!

694
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,640
It's nothing. It's my duty.

695
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,390
You're back!

696
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,020
What did you do?

697
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,980
You'll know when you go in.

698
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,490
I didn't touch your precious

699
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,710
hidden wine.

700
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,340
I bought those outside myself.

701
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,960
I didn't have time to tidy up.

702
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,030
I asked the craftsman to make another bed.

703
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,600
You don't have to sleep on the floor anymore.

704
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,320
You suffered for so many days.

705
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,650
Look, I drew this.

706
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,430
With this room divider,

707
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,390
we can sleep at ease.

708
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,070
I couldn't draw the fireworks well.

709
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,360
So I used knockout powder to make them.

710
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,860
Look, don't they look more similar now?

711
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,930
It's quite pretty.

712
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,580
I'm sorry.

713
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,480
I know I was wrong.

714
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,390
I made fake rouge and put you in prison.

715
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,240
Did you spend...

716
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,480
all my money?

717
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,780
No, no.

718
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,590
I got these with my savings.

719
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,790
Your 10 strings are over there.

720
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,550
As for the remaining 20 strings,

721
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,550
I'll pay you back slowly.

722
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,430
Forget it.

723
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,980
I almost forgot to tell you.

724
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,500
Thanks to you,

725
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,790
I have a job now.

726
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,320
I'm entering Sifang Pavilion to redeem myself.

727
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,770
I'll work hard every day to make my own living.

728
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,800
So if the money's gone,

729
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,429
then so be it.

730
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,130
I don't care.

731
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,510
I have a monthly salary now.

732
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,199
I won't starve to death.

733
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,280
I know I've caused you a lot of trouble.

734
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,679
You can't rent a big house without your money.

735
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,250
I did this

736
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,080
so you'd live comfortably.

737
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,639
It'd been comfortable.

738
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,989
Although I'd been in prison these days,

739
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,510
I'd been living comfortably.

740
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,060
I sat whenever I wanted.

741
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,960
I lied down whenever I wanted.

742
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
No one ordered me to do this and that.

743
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,140
No one made snakes bite me,

744
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,070
poisoned me,

745
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,390
or acted all pitiful to trick me.

746
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,280
I didn't need to calculate

747
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,280
if my daily expenses

748
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,160
were enough to feed two people.

749
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,260
I didn't need to worry

750
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,110
about my money and wine

751
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,190
disappearing.

752
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,530
Most importantly...

753
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,500
It was so quiet.

754
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,080
So quiet that I could hear the flames of candle wicks.

755
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,050
Just like before you came to my house.

756
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,620
Do you really think so?

757
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,200
Are you the one who should apologize?

758
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,870
It's clearly me.

759
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,120
I'm really sorry.

760
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,830
I really shouldn't have

761
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,690
caught you at the city gate

762
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,910
and kidnapped you as my maid.

763
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,320
I watched you and held you back every day

764
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,470
such that your extraordinary talent couldn't be unleashed.

765
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,190
Really.

766
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,070
It's all my fault.

767
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,310
I'm sorry.

768
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,370
You've been whiling your days away for years.

769

You still can't let go of your parents' matter.

You are his only flesh and blood in this world.

771

He was the Sifang Envoy.

772
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,910
He had to represent Yong in other states.

773

What did he get in the end?

774
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,010
What did Sifang Pavilion and the court

775
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,210
do for him in the end?

776
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,470

Yes.

Wait.

Who are you to call us Shen and Ji?

789
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,130
Don't you know your current

position?

A newly recruited clerk of Sifang Pavilion.

A newbie, you know?

793
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,220
Act like a newbie.

794
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,520
That's right.

795
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,820
Come earlier than us in the future.

796
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,320
Pour us some tea.

805
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,630
You'd tell my wife?

This trick could threaten me in the past,

but not now.

I'm sorry.

815
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,620
In the future, as a sinner,

816
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,860
I dare not share

Yuan Mo, buddy.

819

We were just kidding.

820
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,230
Why did you take it seriously?

821
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,710
Yes.

Isn't this Yuan Mo?

823
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,780
Why did you condescend

824
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,480
to join Sifang Pavilion?

825
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,660
I didn’t like you before,

826
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,540
but you weren't under Sifang Pavilion.

827
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,910
So you were out of my control.

828

Now that you're under Sifang Pavilion,

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,790
