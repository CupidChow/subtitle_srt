someone told me you would become the Sifang Envoy,

15
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,259
I'd give them a slap across the face.

16
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,080
I wouldn't believe it myself,

You're very smart and talented.

20
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,200
But what made you the Sifang Envoy in the end

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,370
was your own choice.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,840
You chose to be a responsible person

23
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,670

24
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,200

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Cut the crap.

193
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,790
We've come this far.

194
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,150
It's too late to discuss it with him.

195
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,040
Here, take it.

196
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,490
Aren't you usually very bold?

197
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,590
Why are you so timid when my father is involved?

198
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,990
I've thought it through.

199
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,800
This seems disrespectful to Duke Er.

200
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,970
He's my father.

201
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,420
He's already used to it.

202
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,700
Over there.

203
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,130
Come.

204
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,890
Come with me.

[Household Registration Certificate]

207
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
The household registration certificate.

208
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,390
With this, we can register our household

209
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,670
and get married.

210
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,420
We'll become husband and wife.

211
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,340
Tell me.

212
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,720
Whose idea was this?

213
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,120
-It was my idea.
-Mine.

214
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,580
That's nonsense.

215
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,670
It was my idea.

216
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,790
Was it him?

217
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:57,910
I…

218
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,440
Did he put you up to this?

219
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,410
-No…
-Duke Er.

220
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,840
We just wanted to…

221
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,470
Shut up!

222
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,620
Am I asking you?

223
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm talking to her. Butt out!

224
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,590
Tell me.

225
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,050
We're going to Yanle.

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,280
What?

227
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,440
Ah Shu is going back to Yanle.

228

Yuan Mo is going too.

229
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,690
We went through so much together.

230
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,720
I can't let them take risks alone.

231
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,550
But I know

232
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,470
you wouldn't agree even if I told you.

233
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,860
So you stole the certificate?

234
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,810
Planning to marry him behind my back?

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,160
Don't you always pressure me to get married?

236
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,550
Isn't this exactly what you want?

237
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,670
Can you let us go now?

238
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,750
Couldn't you at least tell me?

239
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,430
You actually want to marry him secretly!

240
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,220
Am I so hard to deal with in your eyes?

241
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,040
Yeah.

242
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,390
I used to pressure you to get married,

243
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,440
but have I ever forced you later on?

244
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,780
This guy

245
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,810
just wanted revenge at first.

246
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,030
I didn't want you to be taken advantage of!

247
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,160
Then what happened?

248
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,230
You fell in love with each other.

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,720
So I just let it be,

250
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,950
didn't I?

251
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,930
For so many years,

252
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,390
I've loved and doted on you.

253
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,640
If I suddenly died one day,

254
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,780
who would protect and love you?

255
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,880
If you married the wrong man,

256
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,290
I'd worry about you for the rest of my life, you know?

257
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,970
Your mother must be disappointed in me in heaven.

258
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,110

Stop crying.

264
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,990
It's all my fault.

265
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,970
Alright, Uncle Huang.

266
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,450
Don't be angry.

267
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,270

Where's Yu?

275
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,810
He's not here.

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
Where did he go?

278
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,170
He went to the back garden.

279
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,780
Gosh.

280
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
Why are you so impatient?

281
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,890
Take that off now.

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,260
Yu hasn't left yet.

283
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,080
It'll be awkward if he comes back and sees you.

He's not coming back.

Let me remind you.

Although you're the Sifang Envoy now,

287
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,110
you should still be careful with how you address people.

288

Don't casually call people by their names.

Now that I've retired,

Not sudden at all.

In Yanle, there's a kind of herbal wine

383
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,930
that's a miracle cure for back pain.

403
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,630
Yes, I understand.

Before setting off,

443
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,180
I went to visit their grave.

444
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
I placed Father's "Sifang Annals"

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,080
before the grave.

446
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,980

"With virtue in my heart,

448
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,090

00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,290
At that moment,

450
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,650
I thought I understood my father.

451
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,730
It's not until I'm in the desert

452
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,780
that I realize

453
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,770
I've never truly understood him.

454
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,160
The world is so vast.

455
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,350
People are so small.

456
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,820
It takes such a long time to reach another place,

457
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,690
yet people never stop traveling.

458
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,350

I didn't say that.

467

Prince Duomi has learned of our delegation's arrival

474

and set up camp ahead to welcome us.

475
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,840
When he left Changle, he said we'd definitely meet again.

476
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,170
I didn't believe it then.

477
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,110
In retrospect,

478
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,470
he was right.

Speaking directly with Duomi

483
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,470
can save us a lot of trouble.

484

We couldn't say much in our previous correspondence.

485

I'm not sure about his current situation in Mobei.

486
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,640
The fact that he can meet us without hesitation

487
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,840
shows that he must have gained some power in Mobei.

It seems that Duomi is no longer the same as before.

I've made it clear to the Khan that I have no intention of replacing him.

00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,350
That's how I got

540
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,420
what I have today.

00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,150
To be honest,

544
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,440
I've come here

545
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,850
to ask you for a favor.

546
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,770
Outwardly, Long Tuqi welcomes the princess's return,

547
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,400
but actually, he wants to kill her.

548
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,050
Yong wants to protect the princess but is too far away to do so.

549
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,580
So you want to use Mobei as a deterrent.

550
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,870
Am I right?

551
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,630
Your Highness,

552
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,030
you're right.

553
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,820
Yong wants to borrow an army from Mobei

554
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,020
and station it at the border between Yanle and Mobei

555
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,480
in case anything happens.

556
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,220
Yong will cover all military expenses.

557
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,040
Although I've broken off my engagement with the princess,

558
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
her concerns are still my concerns.

559
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,260
I shouldn't refuse.

560
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,810
But unfortunately...

561
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,630
What?

562
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,410
Unfortunately, Mobei is a small and weak state.

563
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
Our capital is too far from Yong

564
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,400
and too close to Yanle.

565
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,400
Are you afraid

566
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,470
of antagonizing Long Tuqi

567
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,640
and facing retaliation in the future?

568
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,840
Do you know that

569
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,750
when you entered Mobei's territory,

570
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,920
the Dragon Cavalry of Yanle

571
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,180
had quickly gathered at Mobei's border,

572
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,410
ready to attack us at any time?

573
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,900
Has Long Tuqi

574
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,350
anticipated my plan?

575
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,370
Mobei and Yong have formed an alliance.

576
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,730
If Long Tuqi dares to invade Mobei,

577
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,350
Yong will not stand by.

578
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,980
Then what will you do?

579
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,220
Even if Yong sent troops to our capital,

580
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,400
it'd take at least a month.

581
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,190
By then, I fear Mobei's capital would have been reduced to ashes.

582
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,210
Even if Yong is willing to stand up for Mobei,

583
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,520
what's the point?

584
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,280
Moreover, if I mobilized Mobei's troops,

585
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,360
the Khan would interpret it as coveting military power.

586
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,020
It'd expose my strength to the Khan.

587
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,240
Do you think

588
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,900
he'd let me live?

589
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,420
Guys.

590
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,940
Please forgive me

591
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,740
for having to refuse your request.

592
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,910
Although I can't help you,

593
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,680
I won't let your trip here be in vain.

594
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,080
I prepared a gift for you.

595
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,370
Please accept it.

596
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,770
Princess.

597
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,220
Sifang Envoy.

598
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,110
I prepared a cart of dried meat,

599
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,900
a cart of naan bread, and a cart of water for you.

600
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,570
I wish the delegation a safe journey.

601
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,700
How can you call yourself a gourmet?

602
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,030
You promised supplies,

603
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,050
but this is all you're giving us?

604
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,820
Sifang Envoy, as you're new to the desert,

605
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,150
you probably don't know

606
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,350
the way of surviving in the vast desert.

607
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,390
If I prepare delicacies for you,

608
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,530
they'll spoil within half a day.

609
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,820
But these things are enough to last the whole delegation

610
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,990
in the desert for more than a month.

611
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,600
I was just kidding.

612
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,640
Thank you.

613
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,120
Travel safe.

614
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,720
Deputy Envoy Ma.

615
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,390
They talked in there for a long time.

616
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,450
We must be cautious.

617
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,650
Cautious about what?

618
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,050
Isn't the result of their discussion

619
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,310
already written all over Yuan Mo's face?

620
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,530
Stop the carriage.

621
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,870
Princess,

622
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,160
why are we stopping?

623
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,310
Huangsha Village is not far ahead.

624
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,750
It's where I lived as a child.

625
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,130
Would you like to take a look?

626
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,940
I'll go with you.
