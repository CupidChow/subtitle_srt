You asked me to investigate Ah Shu's identity before.

I sent someone to do it,

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,810
After you left,

189
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,520
I started learning to weave from my mother

190
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,870
to help with the family expenses.

191
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,730
What about you?

192
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,470
After I left, I headed east.

193
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,680
I followed merchant caravans,

194
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,870
did odd jobs,

195
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,390
and even got robbed.

196
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,590
When I had nothing to eat,

197
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,360
I even stole things.

198
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,420
I almost died in the desert once.

199
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,530
Was it hard for you on the road?

200
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,450
It was alright.

201
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
On my journey,

202
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,190
I encountered a sandstorm with the caravan.

203
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,020
It was a close call, but we made it through.

204
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,070
Oh, right.

205
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,950
What about Chubby, Huoligu, Alinge, and the others?

206
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,080
Are they doing well?

207
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,250
They're all doing fine.

208
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,590
It's just that you left without saying goodbye back then.

209
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,550
After you left,

210
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,050
we were all sad for a long time.

211
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,580
I left in such a hurry.

213
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,560
I didn't have time to say goodbye to everyone.

214
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,130
But it's good that we've met again.

215
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,790
Let's go to bed early.

216
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
I need to look for work tomorrow.

217
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,590
[Yuchi's Mansion]

218
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,870
I don't know if you can hear me or not.

219
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,310
But if you can,

220
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,050
maybe I'll be afraid to say it.

221
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,610
Actually, in my heart,

222
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,230
I've already chosen you.

223
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,710
I never thought

224
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,750
that I, a warrior from the border

225
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,000
who should have been just a passerby in Changle,

226
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,750
would fall for someone...

227
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,760
Nor did I dare hope that someone would love me.

228
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,110
To be honest, I don't know

229
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,230
when I started to love you.

230
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,180
Maybe it was when we first fought,

231
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,390
or perhaps when you called out to your men.

232
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,750
These images

233
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,410
always appear in my mind without realizing.

234
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,070
But whenever I want to linger on them a bit longer,

235
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,580
the figure of the Man in White

236
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,900
appears in my mind involuntarily.

237
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,270
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,820
It's taken me until now to tell you these things.

239
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,820
If you can wake up,

240
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,700
I hope you can forgive me.

241
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,390
Hurry up.

242
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,390
Hurry up.

243
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,370
What's your name?

244
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,050
Abai'er.

245
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,540
-Look carefully before you stamp.
-Where are you from?

246
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,200
From Yanle.

247
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,140
Where are you headed?

248
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,970
To Yueying to sell twilight muslin.

249
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,970
Twilight muslin?

250
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,470
How long are you staying?

251
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,530
About half a month.

252
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
Wait a minute.

253
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,870
Didn't you arrive on the 10th of July?

254
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,780
It's been half a month already.

255
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,290
You want to stay another half month?

256
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,390
Not in a hurry to make money, huh?

257
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,990
Sir,

258
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,550
we just arrived yesterday.

259
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,350
That's right.

260
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,200
They're the only merchant caravan

261
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,260
from Yanle selling twilight muslin this month.

262
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,780
Mr. Yuan, you need to drink less.

263
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,090
Your memory isn't as good as it used to be.

264
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,740
No, that's not right.

265
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,450
I couldn't have remembered it wrong.

266
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,130
July 10th of the 22nd year.

267
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,070
Ah Shu has a sister named Ah Shilan.

268
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,400
On the 10th of July,

269
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,910
she arrived in Changle with a Yanle caravan

270
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,710
selling twilight muslin.

271
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,500
I didn't remember it wrong.

272
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,230
I even checked her travel pass.

273
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,040
Let me check.

274
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,770
Wait a moment.

275
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,650
Look.

276
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,600
There was no cloth-selling caravan on July 10th.

277
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,570
What's wrong with him?

278
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,070
Yuan Mo said he wanted to find someone named Ah Shilan.

279
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,070
Manager,

280
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,790
the fabric my sister weaves is both light and durable.

281
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,150
The patterns are different too.

282
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,470
Look, this one is different.

283
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,480
Take a close look at this craftsmanship.

284
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,160
See?

285
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,990
Young lady,

286
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,430
is it you who's looking for work

287
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,790
or is it your sister?

288
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,750
It's my sister looking for work.

289
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,150
She's new here and too shy to speak up.

290
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,680
Manager,

291
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,180
I'm very good at weaving.

292
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,710
An average weaver can weave four zhang a day.

293
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,230
I can weave five zhang

294
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,140
for the same pay as the others.

295
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,700
Yes, hiring my sister is a good deal.

296
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,310
Then, besides weaving,

297
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,750
can you do anything else?

298
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,390
Laundry, cooking, cleaning, sweeping.

299
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,450
I can do all of that.

300
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,910
Then it's thirty wen per day.

301
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,110
Start working today.

302
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,870
Alright.

303
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,470
Wait for me a moment.

304
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,040
Great! You found a job.

305
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,750
I can finally support myself.

306
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,130
Thank you, Ah Shu.

307
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,090
How about this?

308
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,490
You go home and wait for me.

309
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,710
I'll start work first.

310
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,100
I'll go find you when I get back in the evening.

311
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,030
Okay, I'll go home and wait for you.

312
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,640
I'll be waiting for you.

313
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,900
Ah Shu.

314
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,620
Ah—

315
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,540
Why are you here?

316
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,440
I should be the one asking you that.

317
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,150
You hid Ah Shu here?

318
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,310
Hid?

319
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,790
Why would I hide her?

320
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,850
Then why are you looking for her here?

321
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,210
Since Mr. Yu gave the order

322
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,190
to look for Princess Yanle,

323
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,550
you've been weird.

324
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,950
You've been acting sneakily.

325
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,350
You also made Ah Shu move here for no reason.

326
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,070
Now, you're investigating Ah Shilan.

327
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,600
What are you hiding from us?

328
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,010
I don't know what you're talking about.

329
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,250
Yuchi Hua is injured.

330
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,630
We encountered the Man in White

331
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,560
outside the Yanle Embassy.

332
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,110
She was hit by a hidden weapon while protecting me.

333
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,530
She's still unconscious.

334
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,080
How did this happen?

335
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,850
Yuan Mo.

336
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,310
If you consider Yuchi Hua and me as friends,

337
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,270
tell us the truth.

338
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,550
I'm sorry, I...

339
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,360
I kept it from you to protect you.

340
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,330
Really.

341
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,080
Ah Shu...

342
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,300
Ah Shu is actually Princess Yanle.

343
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,680
Thank you.

344
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,570
Next.

345
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,790
Thank you, sir.

346
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,970
Where are you from?

347
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,870
From Dongyuan.

348
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,630
Where are you going?

349
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,260
Yanle.

350
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,870
Thank you, sir.

351
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,670
Next, please.

352
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,130
Where are you from?

353
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,260
Yanle.

354
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,050
Where are you heading?

355
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,340
Nowhere.

356
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,710
If you're not going anywhere, why are you here?

357
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,640
Who are you?

358
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,550
I am Princess Ah Shilan of Yanle.

359
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,820
I've come to seek protection from Yong.

360
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,710
Kunwu,

361
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,370
please keep Ah Shu's matter a secret.

362
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,830
Do you plan to keep this a secret forever?

363
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,640
Being Princess Yanle

364
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,500
will only bring trouble to Ah Shu.

365
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,790
Why not let this title

366
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,810
disappear forever in the desert?

367
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,670
Running away won't solve the problem.

368
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,950
But then you...

369
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,640
Retainer Wang, Yuan Mo,

370
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,680
Mr. Yu is looking for you two everywhere.

371
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,540
What happened?

372
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,310
Princess Yanle has arrived.

373
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,120
You... you mean Princess Yanle?

374
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,070
Yes, that's right. Princess Yanle.

375
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,270
You know this person.

376
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,150
It's that Ah...

377
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,120
You won't let me sneeze now?

378
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,160
You... you just keep it to yourself.

379
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,890
Don't say it out loud.

380
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,690
Right, right, right.

381
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,420
We should keep our voices down.

382
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,270
Who would have thought Ah Shilan was a princess?

383
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,750
Who?

384
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,740
The Ah Shilan you're looking for.

385
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,190
Ah Shilan?

386
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,650
Didn't you say to keep it down?

387
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,410
Mr. Yu.

388
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
You're finally here.

389
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,270
There's big trouble, you know?

390
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,600
Where's Princess Yanle?

391
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,210
What Princess Yanle?

392
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,280
Let me tell you,

393
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,020
before her identity is proven,

394
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,470
she's just an ordinary refugee from Yanle.

395
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,830
We don't even know if she gave her real name

396
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,230
and you call her a princess, huh?

397
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,270
Isn't Princess Yanle called Ah Shilan?

398
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,110
When this Princess Yanle disappeared,

399
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,950
she wasn't even a year old.

400
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,590
The king of Yanle hadn't even named her yet.

401
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,970
Let me tell you,

402
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,890
this matter

403
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,720
involves the grudges between Yong and Yanle.

404
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,270
If not handled properly, it could cause conflict between the two states,

405
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,350
or even lead to war.

406
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,990
Yu,

407
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,860
you're wise.

408
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,630
At a time like this,

409
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,490
you're still putting on this act?

410
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,780
So you're saying

411
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,510
that even if Ah Shilan is the real Princess Yanle,

412
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,960
you won't acknowledge it?

413
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,150
How many lives do I have

414
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,430
to dare acknowledge her as the princess on my own?

415
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,430
This matter must be reported to the Ministry of Rites

416
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,580
before any decision can be made.

417
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,540
Then why did you

418
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,870
hurriedly call us over?

419
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,080
My silly boy,

420
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,410
I have to know if this princess

421
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,730
is real or not.

422
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,110
Let me tell you.

423
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,110
She's in the guest house in the back.

424
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,270
No matter what means you use later,

425
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,780
you two must verify her identity for me.

426
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,270
And if you find any information,

427
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,510
don't let anyone know about it.

428
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,660
I'll go to the Ministry of Rites now.

429
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,510
Let's talk when I get back, okay?

430
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,500
Not a day of peace.

431
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,940
Let's go.

432
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,590
Kunwu.

433
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you.

434
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,270
What are you thanking me for?

435
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,710
Thank you for finally knowing how to be flexible.

436
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,040
You didn't tell Yu that Ah Shilan is a fake.

437
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,930
I also have a responsibility to protect Ah Shu.

438
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,970
Let's go.

439
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,220
Let's go meet this Ah Shilan.

440
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,790
Should I call you Ah Shilan,

441
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,950
or Princess?

442
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,390
I am both Ah Shilan and the Princess.

443
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,350
Do you know the punishment for impersonating a princess?

444
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,910
I'm not impersonating anyone.

445
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,960
I am Princess Yanle.

446
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,850
Princess Yanle died in the desert long ago.

447
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,390
How can you possibly be Princess Yanle?

448
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,190
Every word I say is true.

449
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,190
Every word is true?

450
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,910
That's not what you said

451
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,640
at Ah Shu's place a few days ago.

452
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,720
You said you came to Changle

453
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,720
to work.

454
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,140
When we first met,

455
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,850
you obviously didn't believe me.

456
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,510
Why should I have told you the truth?

457
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,510
What about Ah Shu?

458
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,920
You keep saying that she's like your sister.

459
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,150
Why did you lie to her?

460
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,450
I didn't lie to Ah Shu.

461
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,350
The identity of a princess carries too much danger.

462
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm still being hunted.

463
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,590
I didn't want to get Ah Shu involved,

464
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,220
so I didn't tell her the truth.

465
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,880
You said you are the princess.

466
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,030
So how did you escape from Yanle Palace?

467
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,250
How did you grow up?

468
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,180
And how did you get to Changle?

469
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,570
I was able to escape safely from the Yanle Palace

470
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,750
thanks to the Sifang Envoy of Yong,

471
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Yuan Hanjing.

472
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,610
The Sifang Envoy and his wife learned of the palace coup.

473
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,600
They risked their lives to take me out of the palace

474
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,400
and handed me over to a minister loyal to my father.

475
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,970
They themselves perished in the desert.

476
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,290
This minister sent me to the countryside

477
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,850
to escape Long Tuqi's pursuit.

478
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,600
Later, the news leaked out,

479
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,430
so I left Yanle.

480
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,200
I wandered the desert for all these years.

481
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,230
I followed caravans and did odd jobs.

482
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,910
I was even robbed.

483
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,660
When I was starving,

484
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,190
I even stole things.

485
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,110
Once I almost died.

486
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,710
Fortunately, the heavens favored me

487
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,790
and I survived.

488
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,960
Finally, I made it out of the desert and came to Changle.

489
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,950
It's quite a touching story.

490
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,770
Too bad I don't believe a word of it.

491
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,310
You two haven't seen my evidence yet.

492
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,520
Why are you so sure I'm an impostor?

493
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,870
What evidence?

494
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,460
I've seen the red butterfly on Ah Shu's foot.

495
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,110
Ah Shilan's is exactly the same.

496
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,430
How did she find out Ah Shu's identity?

497
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,400
Is she impersonating the princess

498
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,250
voluntarily or under someone's orders?

499
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,590
After receiving protection from Yong,

500
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,050
what will her next move be?

501
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,690
Since you have so many questions,

502
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,460
why didn't you ask for clarification earlier?

503
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,560
Didn't Mr. Yu already say

504
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,810
we need to wait for Vice Minister An's instructions?

505
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,130
If I expose her on my own

506
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,070
without approval from the Ministry of Rites,

507
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,930
wouldn't that be against orders?

508
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,950
I think you have your own agenda.

509
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,100
What agenda can I possibly have?

510
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,320
Ah Shu is being hunted

511
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,940
due to being Princess Yanle.

512
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,650
Now that Ah Shilan has come forward herself

513
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,990
and admitted to being Princess Yanle,

514
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,310
Ah Shu will be safe.

515
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,390
You don't want to expose her.

516
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,660
You...

517
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,630
You're right about everything.

518
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,830
Yuan Mo,

519
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,870
you are a member of Sifang Pavilion.

520
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,430
This matter

521
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,260
also concerns the relationship between Yong and Yanle.

522
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,990
You can't only think for Ah Shu.

523
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,190
State affairs

524
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,670
will be decided by the high officials of the Ministry of Rites.

525
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,270
It's not up to a mere clerk of Sifang Pavilion like me

526
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,130
to worry about.

527
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,360
You...

528
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,390
Don't you want to know

529
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,450
Ah Shilan's real purpose for impersonating the princess?

530
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,110
Then let's play along with her act until the end.

531
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,160
It's settled.

532
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,900
Princess Yanle has come to seek protection from Yong.

533
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,920
I have already reported this to the court.

534
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,890
I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts

535
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,690
and come up with a strategy.

536
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,240
The most urgent matter

537
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,460
is to determine whether this princess is real or fake.

538
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,140
If this woman was sent by Yanle

539
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,760
deliberately to test us,

540
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,560
rashly acknowledging her would lead to endless troubles.

541
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,430
In my opinion, regardless of whether she's real or fake,

542
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,590
Yong should refuse to acknowledge her.

543
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,950
We might as well hand this case over to Jingzhao Prefecture

544
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,880
and close it as a common fraud case.

545
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,110
This way, we can avoid

546
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,370
direct conflict between Yong and Yanle.

547
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,710
Seventeen years ago,

548
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,390
Sifang Envoy Yuan Hanjing and his wife

549
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,150
died in the desert to protect

550
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,830
the infant Princess Yanle.

551
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,320
Seventeen years later,

552
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,520
Yong is actually refusing to acknowledge Princess Yanle.

553
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,030
Hanjing,

554
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,720
you truly died in vain.

555
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,420
In my opinion,

556
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,390
we should ask Yanle to verify this woman's identity.

557
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,670
If Yanle says she's real,

558
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,730
we'll treat her as the real princess.

559
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,270
If Yanle says she's fake,

560
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,230
we'll punish her as an impostor.

561
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,610
Let me ask you this.

562
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,830
If Yanle knows she's the real princess

563
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,260
but refuses to acknowledge her,

564
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,950
then after Yong lowers our guard

565
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,870
and they kidnap the real princess back to Yanle,

566
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,150
what should we do?

567
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,680
Well...

568
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,410
This woman's background is unclear

569
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,590
and the authenticity of her identity is hard to determine.

570
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,990
The Ministry of Rites should not get involved at this time

571
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,190
to avoid being exploited by those with ulterior motives.

572
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,890
I think this matter

573
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,260
should be temporarily handled by Sifang Pavilion.

574
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,950
We'll make a final decision after investigating the truth about this woman.

575
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

576
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,190
After all this discussion,

577
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,650
why is it thrown back to me?

578
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
Vice Minister An?

579
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
Vice Minister An.

580
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,950
Ah Shu.

581
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,650
Yuan Mo.

582
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,960
Wang.

583
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,750
Princess.

584
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,510
You've kept us in the dark for so long.

585
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,950
He knows everything now.

586
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,300
He stopped me at home.

587
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,330
I'm sorry, Wang.

588
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,750
I had no choice but to keep it from you before.

589
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,850
It's not your fault.

590
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,460
I know what you've been through.

591
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,380
No one else

592
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,070
would've admitted to being Princess Yanle either.

593
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,400
You've been very brave.

594
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,750
Thank you, Wang.

595
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,390
What about Ah Shilan?

596
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,290
You know about that too?

597
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,640
It's all over the streets now.

598
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,270
They're saying she's Princess Yanle.

599
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,110
I need to see her.

600
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,270
Now is not the time.

601
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,840
The guesthouse.

602
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,390
Thank you.

603
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,670
Wang Kunwu, you...

604
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,070
What's meant to happen will always happen.

605
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,230
That may be true,

606
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,830
but don't say I didn't warn you.

607
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,960
If you let them meet,

608
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,160
things will get out of hand and there'll be no turning back.

609
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,310
You said yourself that the show must go on.

610
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,840
Besides, I'm curious to see

611
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,220
how this fake princess

612
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,640
will handle the real one.

613
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,110
Ah Shu.

614
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,350
Why are you impersonating as the princess?

615
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,820
I'm not impersonating anyone.

616
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,830
I am the princess.

617
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,230
Why are you lying?

618
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,150
We grew up together.

619
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,950
Why do you have the red butterfly on your ankle?

620
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,230
That's the totem of my mother's clan,

621
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,310
the royal family's mark.

622
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,430
I've had it since I was little.

623
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,710
You're still lying to me.

624
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,190
I treated you like my own sister.

625
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,590
You said I'm lying to you.

626
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,840
Why are you so sure I'm lying?

627
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,290
You don't need to show me this.

628
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,420
If I hadn't seen it before,

629
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,260
I wouldn't have been able to draw it so accurately.

630
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,070
You've known my identity all along.

631
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
So are you taking my place for my sake,

632
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,350
or do you have other motives?

633
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,350
Is someone forcing you to do this?

634
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,980
None of that. Stop guessing.

635
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,540
Then why are you doing this?

636
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,680
Ah Shu,

637
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:30,880
you must remember what I'm about to say.

638
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,390
Never let anyone see

639
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,880
the mark on your ankle again.

640
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,920
The Faceless are looking for you everywhere.

641
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,470
They want to kill you.

642
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,250
The only way for you to survive in Yong now

643
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,580
is for me to become you.

644
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,540
But...

645
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,700
Why are you suddenly doing all this for me?

646
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,460
Sit down first.

647
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,400
Sit.

648
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,210
If you hadn't forced me today,

649
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,370
I would have taken these words to my grave.

650
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,909
Do you remember the uncle

651
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,969
who brought you to Huangsha Village?

652
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,469
He told me all of this.

653
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
He also ordered me to do this.

654
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,810
Now, as long as Yong acknowledges me as the princess,

655
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,199
I can get Yong's protection.

656
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,760
Meanwhile, you won't have to worry about your identity being exposed anymore.

657
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,400
You can live freely

658
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,360
under the name of Ah Shu.

659
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,230
Although that Yuan doesn't trust me,

660
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,940
I can tell

661
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,900
that he genuinely cares about you.

662
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,510
He also doesn't want

663
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,170
anyone to know your identity.

664
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,590
But do you know

665
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,030
what you'll face after becoming Princess Yanle?

666
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,090
Why are you so silly?

667
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,280
None of that matters.

668
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,270
Doing this is good for Yanle too.

669
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,730
That's enough.

670
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,490
Uncle should have told me about this earlier,

671
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,510
or at least consulted with me.

672
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,980
But I've never had a chance to meet him.

673
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,520
I won't have many chances to meet him in the future either.

674
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,710
But trust me.

675
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,680
It's safer for him not to meet.

676
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,880
Ah Shilan.

677
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,180
It's alright.

678
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,350
Is this for me?

679
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,530
I bought it in the West Market this afternoon.

680
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,290
It's beautiful. I love it.

681
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,220
Thank you.

682
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,270
Ah Shu,

683
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,170
that uncle of yours...

684
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,400
I'm sorry, Wang,

685
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,690
I've sworn

686
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,080
never to reveal his identity.

687
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,440
I actually hope what she said is true.

688
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,870
That way, you can be at ease

689
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,470
and just be our little Ah Shu.

690
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,530
Who cares about being a princess or not?

691
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,260
It's not as simple as you think.

692
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,390
What Ah Shilan did

693
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,220
has put herself in a precarious position.

694
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,630
The relationship between Yong and Yanle

695
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,030
will suddenly become tense because of her.

696
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,130
Is it that serious?

697
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes, it is.

698
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,450
Yong will have to consider

699
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,100
whether to recognize Ah Shilan

700
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,500
as Princess Yanle or not,

701
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,420
while Yanle will have to decide

702
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,630
whether to continue hunting

703
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,240
this Princess Yanle whose identity has been exposed or not.

704
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,040
Either way, the situation for both sides will change dramatically.

705
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,150
It's possible that by now, the people of Yanle

706
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,080
already know that Ah Shilan has come seeking refuge.

707
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,700
We need to come up with a plan.

708
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,830
Don't worry, Ah Shu.

709
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,830
Rest assured and go back.

710
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,040
Leave the rest to us.

711
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,020
Go on.

712
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,990
Everyone's here?

713
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,730
Mr. Yu, what did the Ministry of Rites say?

714
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,500
What else could they say?

715
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,150
They've just kicked the ball back to us.

716
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,140
You two, tell me,

717
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,720
did you find out anything?

718
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,730
Apart from the tattoo on her foot,

719
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,880
there's no other evidence to prove her identity.

720
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,100
So you're saying

721
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,110
she's likely an impostor?

722
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,150
Not necessarily.

723
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,230
I mean, she knows my father's name

724
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,310
and knows the details

725
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,970
of how my father saved Princess Yanle back then.

726
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,070
I don't think we can hastily conclude

727
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,110
that she's a fake.

728
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,070
You basically said nothing.

729
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,630
Let me tell you,

730
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,910
the Ministry of Rites has ordered

731
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,970
that we must get to the bottom of this.

732
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,020
Alright, everyone, sit down.

733
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,450
Let's discuss what to do next.

734
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,650
Mr. Yu,

735
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,390
I believe

736
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,200
that regardless of whether this Princess Yanle's identity is real or fake,

737
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,860
Yong should acknowledge her.

738
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,030
Why is that?

739
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,980
For Yong,

740
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,900
who the real Princess Yanle is doesn't matter.

741
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,830
The important thing is whether she can be of use to us.

742
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,970
The people of Yanle despise Long Tuqi for staging a military coup.

743
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,120
They all hope for the restoration of the former king's bloodline.

744
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,180
And Princess Yanle

745
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,680
is the pawn to check Long Tuqi's power.

746
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,460
Even if Yong doesn't do nothing,

747
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,600
Long Tuqi will still be wary.

748
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,520
You're treating Princess Yanle as a pawn.

749
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,260
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

750
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,280
Some sacrifices are unavoidable.

751
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,150
What if she refuses to be used by us?

752
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,630
She's on Yong territory,

753
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,160
seeking our protection.

754
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,860
When under someone's roof,

755
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,670
she has no choice but to lower her head.

756
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,630
Let's not discuss whether this plan is feasible or not.

757
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,630
Just acknowledging her as Princess Yanle

758
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,380
is beyond the Sifang Pavilion's authority.

759
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,060
Xiuyi,

760
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,530
is there any other way?

761
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,910
Then let's settle for the next best thing.

762
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,180
We don't have to acknowledge her title as princess,

763
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,310
but we'll treat her as one in practice.

764
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,520
What do you mean?

765
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,990
In name,

766
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,250
she's just a woman from Yanle who came to Changle

767
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,180
to seek a living.

768
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,870
But in terms of food, clothing, housing, transportation, servants, and etiquette,

769
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,150
everything will be provided as if she were a princess.

770
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,990
This way, Yong will have room to maneuver.

771
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,910
If Long Tuqi has ill intentions,

772
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,390
we can acknowledge her identity as a princess

773
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,650
to provoke internal conflicts in Yanle.

774
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,370
If Long Tuqi behaves himself,

775
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,870
we'll stay put.

776
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,310
Even if her identity

777
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,910
is proven false one day,

778
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,740
we can simply charge her with a crime.

779
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,390
We would have only

780
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,990
lost some money, that's all.

781
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,790
Impressive.

782
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,630
Retainer An is really sparing no expenses

783
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,910
to exploit her.

784
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,080
If I'm called the scum of humanity,

785
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,270
he should be called the scum of the nation.

786
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,390
Alright, alright.

787
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,800
Stop making sarcastic remarks.

788
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,270
You come up with an idea.

789
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,400
I can't come up with such a rotten idea,

790
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,520
but I must remind everyone

791
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,250
that Ah Shilan publicly sought protection.

792
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,830
This matter must have spread like wildfire already.

793
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,760
Sifang Pavilion

794
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,870
needs to be on guard against any action from Yanle.

795
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,630
The princess has appeared?

796
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,590
Yes,

797
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,210
the news is all over Changle City.

798
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,740
Do you know her name?

799
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,110
It's... it's... Ah Shilan.

800
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,910
Ah Shilan?

801
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,570
Deputy Envoy Kang,

802
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,950
we've been looking for the princess

803
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,750
and now, she suddenly appeared.

804
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,150
Could it be Yong intentionally deceiving us?

805
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,490
It's possible.

806
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,310
Come with me to Sifang Pavilion.

807
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,510
I will verify her authenticity myself.

808
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,350
Yes, sir.

809
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,470
[Sifang Pavilion]

810
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,250
Deputy Envoy Kang.

811
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,330
Why did you come uninvited again?

812
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,820
I'm here to meet Princess Yanle.

813
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,070
Please ask Her Highness to come out

814
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,370
and come back to the Yanle Embassy with me.

815
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,740
Princess Yanle?

816
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,280
What Princess Yanle?

817
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,060
Mr. Yu.

818
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,570
Don't play dumb.

819
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,890
Deputy Envoy Kang,

820
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,760
early this morning,

821
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,550
there was indeed a woman named Ah Shilan

822
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,080
who claimed to be Princess Yanle

823
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,150
and came to Sifang Pavilion seeking refuge,

824
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,630
but I have already persuaded her to leave.

825
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,760
Persuaded to leave?

826
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,390
Here's the thing.

827
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,950
Recently, there have been rumors

828
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,260
that Princess Yanle has come to Changle City.

829
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,150
As a result, many eligible young women

830
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,940
are trying to use this opportunity to gain status.

831
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,930
I gave an order

832
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,280
to drive away anyone impersonating the princess.

833
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,150
Whether the princess is an impostor or not

834
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,030
should be determined by Yanle.

835
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,480
How dare Sifang Pavilion act on its own?

836
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,670
If our princess ends up on the streets,

837
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,540
can you bear

838
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,870
this responsibility, Mr. Yu?

839
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,210
Deputy Envoy Kang,

840
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,800
if you don't want the princess to be homeless,

841
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,110
then who was it that left her stranded in the desert

842
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,590
with her fate unknown?

843
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,970
You're being rude.

844
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,150
That's an old matter.

845
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,170
The misunderstandings therein are not for outsiders to discuss.

846
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,570
Mr. Yu,

847
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,810
the princess has always been in Viceroy Long's heart.

848
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:34,010
[Huaiyuan Hall]

849
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,870
He's mobilizing the entire state to search for her,

850
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,070
wishing to bring her back to Yanle to discuss important matters.

851
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,400
Surely you don't intend to obstruct this?

852
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,450
Mr. Yu,

853
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,620
since Deputy Envoy Kang insists on seeing Princess Yanle,

854
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,470
why don't I

855
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,480
go and bring the princess back?

856
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,780
Go and return quickly.

857
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:58,590
Yes, sir.
