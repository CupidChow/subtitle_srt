[Episode 12]

4
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,670
I, Yuan Mo,

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,680
have something else that I want to ask you, Deputy Envoy Kang.

6
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,789
Let me guess.

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,790
Is it related to your parents?

8
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,510
My parents went to Yanle as envoys,

9
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,470
but only their cenotaphs

10
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,670
returned to Changle.

11
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,760
All these years, I’ve always wanted to know

12
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,590
how they died.

13
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,660
Please tell me the truth.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,240
Fine.

15
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,880
16 years have passed.

16
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,790
You should know the truth.

17
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,180
Did those people from the Ministry of Rites tell you

18
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,900
your parents died in a sudden sandstorm?

19
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,190
Hanjing was a splendid Sifang Envoy.

20
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,800
He was talented and good at chess.

21
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,550
Unfortunately, he did something foolish.

22
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,680
As an envoy,

23
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,730
he tried to interfere with Yanle's internal affairs.

24
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,760
[Yuan Hanjing's wife, Du Hengqing]

25
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,540
That day,

26
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,770
Viceroy Long charged into the palace with the Dragon Cavalry

27
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,350
with a petition for the people.

28
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,670
But he insisted on charging out

29
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,310
of the palace with the princess of the previous dynasty.

30
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,750
He wanted to be a hero.

31
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,970
In the end, he met The Faceless in the desert.

32
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,990
The couple died tragically.

33
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,960
Was their death only due to The Faceless?

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,950
Did it have nothing to do

35
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,740
with Yanle and Long Tuqi at all?

36
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,710
How dare you!

37
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,540
The name of my supreme Viceroy Long

38
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,050
is not something you can call casually.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,130
If this had anything to do with Yanle,

40
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,270
then the death of a Sifang Envoy

41
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,510
wouldn't have been uninvestigated by the Yong State.

42
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,470
Yuan Mo.

43
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,040
Everyone knows that

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,870
The Faceless is a bunch of ghosts in the desert.

45
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,530
They'd do anything for money.

46
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,630
Maybe your parents

47
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,030
offended a powerful man of Yong State

48
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,760
which resulted in their death.

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Whatever you say.

50
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,910
One day,

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,910
the truth will be revealed.

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,640
I'm waiting for that day too.

53
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,050
Since you are here,

54
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,830
please inform the Sifang Pavilion.

55
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,870
Changle City is so bustling.

56
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,630
I plan to stay longer.

57
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,270
I won't go back to Yanle for the time being.

58
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,590
The agreement

59
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,480
concerns Yanle's provisions for winter.

60
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,550
If Yong colludes with the countries of desert

61
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,310
to discuss the ownership of the oasis,

62
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,590
it will bring more trouble to Yanle.

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,280
This is the real reason why

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
you're staying in Changle, right?

65
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,270
Why isn’t he here yet?

66
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,090
Where is he?

67
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,050
Not here yet?

68
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,000
He's here.

69
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,240
He's here. Hide well.

70
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,370
Where is Yuan Mo?

71
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,700
What are you doing?

72
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,250
Why are you two here?

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,040
We thought Yuan Mo was here.

74
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,020
What a pity.

75
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,880
What a pity?

76
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,180
Yeah, for Sifang Pavilion's

77
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,540
newest chess master,

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,870
we specially bought party poppers from Xiaguang Pavilion.

79
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
Isn't it all wasted now?

80
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes.

81
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,950
What do you mean?

82
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,910
Say it again.

83
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,790
Let's go.

84
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,220
I think the party popper

85
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,600
was not wasted on Retainer An.

86
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,000
Retainer An knew Deputy Envoy Kang very well.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,270
He stood up even though he knew he was no match for him.

88
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,800
I admire those brave enough

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,110
to lead in the army.

90
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,410
Little Xiu.

91
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,960
You might have lost,

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,140
but you traded your pride for precious time.

93
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,470
It's a glorious defeat.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,040
Thank you. No need.

95
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,330
He never changes.

96
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,260
[Communication Beyond Words]

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,640
Thanks to Yuan Mo,

98
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,350
Yanle failed to take any advantage of us.

99
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,110
I've decided to put Yuan Mo in charge of West Court

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,610
and let him assist Wang Kunwu.

101
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,980
What do you think?

102
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,850
What do I think?

103
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,110
I have to thank you dearly

104
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,260
on behalf of Yuan Mo.

105
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,120
But this matter was all thanks to you.

106
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,100
It was you who insisted there must be something wrong.

107
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,830
That's why Yuan Mo and the others found the truth.

108
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,890
There you go again.

109
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,630
Stop flattering me.

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,160
No need to say it as it is.

111
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,510
But what made me most happy

112
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,550
about the Yanle negotiation this time

113
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,660
was that the two Courts managed to put their differences aside

114
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,780
and cooperate as one.

115
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,110
They equally contributed too.

116
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,730
Especially Xiuyi,

117
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,870
who stepped up at the critical moment.

118
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,470
He would make a fine general.

119
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,150
I know Xiuyi.

120
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,370
He needs more experience.

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,600
You're too demanding.

122
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,659
Xiuyi, you came at the right time.

123
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,790
We were praising you.

124
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,830
Come on.

125
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,770
Mr. Yu.

126
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,110
What is it?

127
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,740
It's business of course.

128
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,840
About the oasis,

129
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,640
how will you handle the matter?

130
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,970
It concerns peace and stability in the desert.

131
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,620
We must discuss it carefully with the Ministry of Rites

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,610
before we deal with it.

133
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,130
How long will the discussion take?

134
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,870
Why should I inform you?

135
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,760
It is natural to play it safe in matters of state.

136
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,950
If you play it safe all the time,

137
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,430
you will lose the opportunity to strike first.

138
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,270
Yanle may send troops to occupy the oasis tomorrow.

139
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,500
Then tell us.

140
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,390
Enlighten us with your

141
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,670
brilliant plan, Retainer An.

142
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,470
I think the Sifang Pavilion should take the lead and

143
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,670
gather the five Desert States together as soon as possible to conclude a covenant.

144
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,039
We should sign a barter agreement to share the oasis

145
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,830
and cooperate with them to suppress Yanle's ambitions.

146
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,590
An alliance meeting of the five states.

147
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,380
You should know

148
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,010
how difficult that is.

149
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,179
It's easier said than done.

150
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,440
Yes.

151
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,900
The Sifang Pavilion cannot possibly

152
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,760
oversee such a major state event.

153
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,590
This is the details of the alliance meeting drafted by the East Court.

154
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,590
May the Ministry of Rites please review it.

155
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,830
If the review fails,

156
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,350
you can lecture me then.

157
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,370
Thank you, Retainer An...

158
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,110
He is so ambitious and arrogant.

159
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,430
He even wants to set up an alliance between Yong and the Five States?

160
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,390
How ignorant and arrogant!

161
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,370
An.

162
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,630
Why don't you take a look first?

163
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,870
Father.

164
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,520
I've received

165
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,460
your birthday present for me.

166
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,920
I didn't forget the chess lessons

167
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,790
you taught me when I was young.

168
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,650
I didn't embarrass you.

169
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,640
I even became a manager now.

170
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,180
Mother.

171
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm doing well now.

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,150
[Grave of Husband Yuan Hanjing and Wife Du Hengqing]

173
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,630
I even have a fierce little maid at home now.

174
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,570
I'll bring her to visit you next time.

175
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,100
She

176
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,960
is just like you.

177
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,080
She has a sharp tongue and a soft heart.

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,160
She likes gardening too.

179
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,510
She grew this herself.

180
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,130
This place is nice.

181
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,650
It's suitable for burial.

182
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,630
There are only two sets of clothes and a chess book inside.

183
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,490
We didn't even find their bodies.

184
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,120
What kind of burial is that?

185
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,030
The deceased has passed.

186
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,780
It's up to the living

187
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,750
to decide if they're at peace or not.

188
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,720
That's what I did back then.

189
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,800
I buried Jin, Chen Xiong, and Yang Li.

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
They were all my pals.

191
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,010
Back then, we went to Wuzhou to join the army.

192
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,920
We agreed to make achievements together and return to Changle.

193
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,040
I was the only one who came back alive.

194
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,840
Were you transferred here

195
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,370
because of them?

196
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,210
We were eradicating The Faceless in the desert together.

197
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,250
But I was careless

198
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,290
and we fell into their trap.

199
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,740
Later, I always wanted to avenge them.

200
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,050
I repeatedly violated the military discipline

201
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,380
and was demoted here.

202
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,190
Yuan Mo.

203
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,230
You said last time

204
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,720
I don't understand the pain of losing my family.

205
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,520
You're wrong.

206
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,370
We have a common enemy.

207
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,590
Let's

208
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
avenge our loved ones together.

209
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,870
It's a deal then.

210
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,270
What do you plan on doing?

211
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,750
Who had a deal with you?

212
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,680
I just borrowed your hand to get up.

213
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:37,840
You...

214
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,240
I'm leaving.

215
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,610
Deputy Envoy Kang.

216
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,960
A secret letter from Viceroy Long.

217
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,230
What's wrong?

218
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,460
Do you know about The Faceless?

219
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,560
Everyone in the desert knows them.

220
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,070
Viceroy Long seems to have reached

221
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,270
some sort of agreement with The Faceless.

222
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,310
He wants us to aid

223
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,870
The Faceless' activities

224
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,970
in Changle City.

225
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,350
Do you know anything about the current chief

226
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,310
of The Faceless, Man in White?

227
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,710
He is a mysterious man.

228
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,320
No one knows his age and appearance.

229
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,520
Isn't the Yanle delegation in a hurry to go back?

230
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,970
Why hasn’t there been any movement yet?

231
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,820
They're not leaving anymore.

232
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,260
They couldn't take advantage of the barter agreement.

233
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,390
I guess they are thinking of getting us

234
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,160
tripped up somewhere else.

235
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,950
It's good that they don't leave.

236
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,260
The longer they stay here,

237
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,720
the better the Yanle delicacies in the city.

238
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,990
The barbecue here

239
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,570
tastes exactly the same as the one I had

240
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,430
when I was a kid.

241
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,110
Really?

242
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,850
Since I started working at Sifang Pavilion,

243
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,720
I seldom have time to eat with you.

244
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,390
I'll pay for it today.

245
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,110
Boss.

246
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,700
Payment.

247
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,190
Let's go.

248
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,390
Take care.

249
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,190
Thank you.

250
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,470
Yuan Mo.

251
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,490
I don't know if it's just me,

252
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,710
but since you won back your father's chess board,

253
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,170
it feels like you have become more cheerful.

254
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,180
Your Yong dialect has improved a lot.

255
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,840
You used that word correctly.

256
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,950
But indeed,

257
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,810
I've taken a lot of things off my mind.

258
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,830
Is it because of Deputy Envoy Kang?

259
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,590
What did he say to you

260
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,350
when you sought him that day?

261
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,930
He not only told me that

262
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,920
my father had always loved me,

263
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,510
but he also informed me that

264
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,710
my parents' deaths were not for naught.

265
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,510
During the turmoil in Yanle,

266
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,540
they were trying to protect Princess Yanle.

267
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,230
That's why they met The Faceless in the desert.

268
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,580
What's wrong?

269
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,970
Nothing.

270
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,190
What happened next?

271
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,560
What happened to the princess?

272
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,140
I don't know.

273
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,430
I hope she's still alive.

274
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,880
I hope she doesn't let my parents down

275
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,520
and live a better life.

276
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:43,970
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,690
What?

278
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,320
I mean I'm also from Yanle.

279
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,870
If it weren't for us,

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,560
your parents might have survived.

281
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,620
Ah Shu.

282
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,190
Do you know

283
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,440
what Changle City is?

284
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,550
Changle City?

285
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,750
Isn't it just a city?

286
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,170
My father asked me the same question,

287
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
and I gave the same answer as you did.

288
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,260
But he told me that

289
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,460
Changle City

290
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,750
is a place that many people want to be in.

291
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,690
Here,

292
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,710
every morning,

293
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,080
people can wake up to the scent of fresh naan.

294
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,740
Every sunset,

295
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,550
people can go to sleep in peace.

296
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,350
His wish

297
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,450
was to let everyone in the world

298
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,570
live a peaceful life

299
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,800
like in Changle City.

300
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,830
So,

301
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,050
whether that girl was Princess Yanle or not,

302
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,020
my father would have risked his life to save her.

303
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,490
He only wanted her to be able

304
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,980
to eat a freshly baked naan

305
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,510
and grow up happily

306
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,410
and healthily like me.

307
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,910
Right?

308
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,329
Let's go.

309
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,099
Time to go home.

310
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,900
Another batch.

311
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,300

Mr. Huang.

315
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,270
-I really...
-Let’s go.

316
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,470
I don't want to go. You...

317
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,870
Come on. Let's go.

318
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,070
I'm speechless.

319
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,870
Let's go.

320
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,310
My Lady, let's go.

321
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,450
Mr. Huang.

322
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,870
What's going on here?

323
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,310
Master specially arranged this for you.

324
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,840
Let's go.

325
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,660
Hurry.

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,910
Okay. Come on.

I have something to tell you. Hurry.

Hurry up.

No.

Come.

See if you like any of them.

340
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,400
Father.

341
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,030
I can't believe you arranged this.

342
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,030
You're unbelievable.

343
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,990
I can't believe you're making me pick among

344
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,120
the people my sister rejected either.

345
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,670
You have to let her choose first.

346
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,240
After all, you ruined her marriage.

347
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,500
I...

348
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,350
You're still young. Let your sister choose first.

378
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,330
It's quiet.

379
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,180
Quiet?

380
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,770
Why are you here?

381
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,680
You're back.

382
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,710
Why? Do you want to drink together?

383
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
She wants to hide here for a few days.

384
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,540
No.

385
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,640
You can't avoid a blind date.

386
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,370
Hurry up and go...

387
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,840
Then stay here.

388
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,630
She also wants you to plead for her

389
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,570
and ask Duke Er to stop arranging blind dates for her.

390
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,070
How dare I offend Duke Er?

391
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,070
What if he brings the army here

392
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,530
and wreak havoc in my yard?

393
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,200
Just name me your price.

394
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,680
This time is different.

395
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,330
Don't you know who your father is?

396
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,790
Even if you give me all your assets,

397
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,350
I won't help you.

398
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,640
What about information on The Faceless?

399
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,250
What?

400
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,620
I know you and Wang Kunwu

401
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,310
are investigating The Faceless.

402
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,550
The information about them

403
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,000
is scattered among the cases handled by the Ministry of Justice

404
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,260
and the Supreme Court.

405
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,110
In the whole of Changle City,

406
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,310
only I can help you get that information.

407
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,880
Help me, you say?

408
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,450
That's the Ministry of Justice, okay?

409
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,910
How could you possibly...

410
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,810
[Ministry of Justice]

411
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,550
Disregarding the Ministry of Justice,

412
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,280
surely you couldn't handle the Supreme Court...

413
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,260
[Supreme Court]

414
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,940
Convinced now?

415
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,470
Find a way

416
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,980
to make those men give up on the blind dates.

417
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,950
It's best to convince them

418
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,040
so they would never bother Hua again.

419
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,170
Yuchi Hua.

420
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,540
Your father is such a difficult person.

421
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,960
How did you escape to my place?

422
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,760
I said I have someone in my heart.

423
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,670
What?

424
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,340
Who?

425
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,620
It's fake.

426
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,070
If I didn't say that,

427
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,600
how could my father give up?

428
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,100
What if it's true?

429
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,190
How much is it?

430
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,350
Give me this.

431
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,930
Look, it's a tight fit.

432
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,350
Are you Wang Kunwu?

433
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,400
What can I do for you?

434
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,150
Are you Lady Yuchi Hua's lover?

435
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,480
What?

436
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,010
If we defeat him, Yuchi Hua will be ours!

437
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,270
Stop.

438
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,980
Guys,

439
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,150
Is there any misunderstanding?

440
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,960
What misunderstanding?

441
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,650
Go!

442
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,430
He's her lover!

443
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,320
Catch him!

444
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,550
Catch him! After him!

445
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,270
Stop! Stop!

446
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,810
Stop! Stop!

447
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,510
Stop! Stop!

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,110
Stop! Stop!

450
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,390
Catch him!

451
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Catch him!

452
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,380
Stop!

453
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,090
Stop!

454
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,180
Stop! Stop!

455

Stop! Stop!

456
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,520
Stop!

457
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,670
After him!

458
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,730
Go! Go! Go!

459
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,670
If it isn't the lover?

460
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,300
What are you talking about?

461
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
I was chased for three blocks this morning.

462
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,110
Tell me if you know anything.

463
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,770
I don't understand anything.

464
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,390
Of all the people out there, Hua

465
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,500
chose you instead.

466
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
You're all crazy.

467
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,340
Do you know her?

468
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,910
Since young, Hua loved

469
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,600
marching and fighting games.

470
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,390
She played as the general

471
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,150
and I was her deputy general.

472
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,190
Hua likes red and black.

473
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,670
She hates yellow.

474
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,350
Hua doesn't like sour food.

475
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,910
She likes spicy things.

476
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,680
Her first whip

477
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,090
was the willow branch I snapped for her.

478
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,850
I even fell off the tree

479
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,060
and hurt my arm,

480
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,940
leaving this scar.

481
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,810
We grew up together.

482
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,150
I know everything about her.

483
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,250
What about you?

484
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,950
Do you know her?

485
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,580
Why would she care about you?

486
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,200
So no matter how many people are saying

487
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,630
that Yuchi Hua loves you,

488
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,200
I won't believe it.

489
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,240
Let me give you a piece of advice.

490
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,760
Don't take it seriously.

491
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Don't let it get to your head either.

492
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,580
Otherwise, you'd just

493
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,170
disappoint yourself.

494
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,950
Susu.

495
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,960
Let's go.

496
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,030
An Xiuyi.

497
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,910
So you like her.

498
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,410
What are you talking about?

499
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,550
I just figured it out.

500
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,290
If you really like her, just say it.

501
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,660
If you can't say it,

502
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,710
I can help you.

503
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,590
Don't you dare!

504
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm warning you. Don't talk nonsense.

505
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,020
Or I won't go easy on you.

506
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,990
Other than those powerful young masters,

507
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,870
my father found me

508
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,690
a bunch of corny scholars.

509
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,240
The martial approach failed, so he's trying a literary one?

510
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,830
Help me think of an excuse.

511
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,990
Get my father to

512
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,460
lose hope in all of them.

513

[Yu Zhaoyan]

514
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,880
Say they're too old,

515
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,420
or bad-looking,

516
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,550
or already have a wife and concubine,

517
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,710
or unfililal.

518
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,470
Whatever excuses you can think of.

519
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,170
Hurry up and make them up.

520
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,640
He's best at reversing right and wrong.

521
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,230
But Hua,

522
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,060
don't you think Wang is very impressive?

523
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,100
What if your father really takes a liking

524
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,150
to him?

525
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,600
I think

526
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,850
dealing with one person

527
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,530
is better than dealing with a group of people,

528
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,360
right?

529
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,710
Of course.

530
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,060
Wang Kunwu would rather die than obey you.

531
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't have given you this idea.

532
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,480
You know?

No.

536
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,450
Did you do this?

537
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,640
No, Kunwu.

538
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,310
Listen to my excuse.

539
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,690
I mean, listen to my explanation.

540
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,590
You're toying with me!

541
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,150
Wang, take it as helping Yuchi.

542
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,030
She doesn't mind, why should you?

543
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,270
Dare I toy with you?

544
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,660
You're not helping me for nothing either.

545
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,590
I have secret information about The Faceless.

546
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,000
The Faceless?

547
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,130
Where's the information?

548
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,030
It depends on your performance.

549
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,440
When my father stops arranging the blind dates,

550
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,260
the information will be delivered.

551
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,860
See?

552
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,510
That was how she lured me in.

553
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,710
You have to endure it.

00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,190
What do you want me to do?

555
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,500
Master,

556
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,290
I heard that Wang Kunwu

557
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,690
fought over 20 skilled

558
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,360
rich young masters in a row.

559
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,260

00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,340
It looks like Lady Yuchi picked a good one.

562
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,540
Good? In what way?

563
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,270
I heard he's just a demoted soldier.

564
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,140
I wonder how Hua'er

565
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,870
was mesmerized by him.

566
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,450
The one in her heart, she said?

567
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,810
She just found a guy to shut me up.

568
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,550
Master,

569
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,150
Retainer Wang of Sifang Pavilion is here.

570
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,310
Let him in.

571
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,020
Yes.

572
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,440
Since he came here himself,

573
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,680
you should scrutinize him for her sake.

[Yuchi's Mansion]

575
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,220
Duke Er, I have something

576
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,730
to ask of you.

577
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,080
You mean

578
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,930
you want to marry my daughter?

579
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,910
Stop dreaming!

580
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,940
Without my approval,

581
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,860
no one can marry my daughter!

582
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,150
Ms. Yuchi wanted me to say that.

583
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,690
But I don't want to lie to you with her.

584
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,210
Actually, there is nothing going on

585
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,090
between us.

586
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,070
She is only doing this

587
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,680
because you left her no choice.

588
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,780
You went against

589
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,850
her wish first.

590
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,640
How dare you!

591
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,800
How dare you talk to Duke Er like that?

592
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,970
I'm telling the truth.

593
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,570
Wang Kunwu, you're too bold.

594
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,470
I am not bold,

595
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,040
I just have nothing left to lose.

596
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,340
Ms. Yuchi's marriage

597
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,800
should be decided by her.

598
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,160
She respects you,

599
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,120
but she's also very sad.

600
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,070

601
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,770
please let her choose her own husband.

602
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,030
That's all I have to say.

Well...

618
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,500
Then what about the information on The Faceless?

619

He's a cunning man.

624
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,010
He was promoted five years ago.

In one year,

626
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,490
he plotted and killed the 5 strongest members of The Faceless.

627
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,510
Since then, no one can shake his position anymore.

628

00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,470
His style is unique.

630
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,880
Other than assassination and robbery,

631
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,370
he even started to manipulate the black market business.

632
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,350
He embezzled a lot of money

633
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,030
and infiltrated various states with money.

634

Within three years,

and the killing of General Dou using Cao Huo

641
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,970
might all be orchestrated by him.

642
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,320
Your brothers were killed by him, right?

He's always wearing a mask

646
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,110
and often appears wearing white.

647
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,010

But he disappeared

00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,120
before sending the mat.

Tell me if you need anything.

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,240
Dear guests,

680
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,550
they are illegal residents of Changle City.

681
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,710
Ignore them.

682
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,040
Mind your own business.

683
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,830
Get back to work.

684
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,780
Granny, are you okay?

685
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,880
You said your son went missing.

686
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,350
He's good at solving cases.

687
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,900
Why don't you tell him?

688
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,480
This way, please.

689
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,800
He's here.

690
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
Please help me.

691
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,020

692
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,880
Granny, please get up.

693
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm half blind.

694
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,170
I have no one to rely on.

695
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,140
I can only do chores at a dye house to make a living.

696
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,990
If anything happens to Qing'er,

697
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,880
how will I live?

698
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,140
Please help me.

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,790
Thank you.

707
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,230
Take your time.

708
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,640
When did he disappear?

709
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,820
What was he wearing on the day he went missing?

710
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,750
She wasn't drunk.

711
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,670
Think about it.

712
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
She's very sober.

713
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
Take it there.

714
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,660
Yes.

715
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,510
Ji.

716
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,220
It's overflowing.

717
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,180
What happened?

718
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,010
I played with fire all my life

719
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,159
and now I got burned.

720
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,170
I rented a house in Changle City

721
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,409
most of my life.

722
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,350
Now I finally became a sub-landlord,

723
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:15,949
but

724
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,219
the tenants screwed me over.

725
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,070
What, you failed to get rent?

726
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,810
Exactly.

727
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,510
The tenants have completely disappeared.

728
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,550
Back then, I pitied these refugees.

729
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,350
It's not easy to make a living in Changle City.

730
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,790
so I rented the house to them.

731
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,360
I bet you just wanted to take advantage of them

732
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,889
since you knew they were illegal residents

733
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,690
and wouldn't dare to offend you.

734
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,620
If it weren't for me,

735
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,840
they would have been expelled from Changle City.

736
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,239
Would they have found a job at Renyi Square?

737
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,929
Those ungrateful people.

738
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,960
Where can we find them?

739
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,210
This is Renyi Square we're talking about.

740
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,940
It's where all rich merchants and envoys of other states live.

741
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,960
The people inside are either rich or noble.

742
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,469
What, you want me to knock on their doors

743
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,510
to find some illegal refugees?

744
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,210
Renyi Square?

745
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,389
I've promised that old lady.

746
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,070
No, no, no.

747
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,090
Wait a minute.

748
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,590
Are you going to Renyi Square too?

749
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,410
Are you going too?

750
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,630
Some tenants of mine are missing.

751
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,550
They're working

752
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,630
at Renyi Square.

753
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,720
I was just wondering how I could enter.

754
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,920
If you're going, can you ask them for me?

755
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,070
When did your tenants

756
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,990
disappear?

757
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,390
They disappeared the day before yesterday.

758
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,590
But they were there the day before that.

759
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,490
The day before yesterday?

760
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,270
That granny's son

761
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,790
was delivering the mat the day before yesterday

762
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,990
before he suddenly disappeared.

763
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,120
What a coincidence.

764
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,340
Ji.

765
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,700
How many tenants are there in total?

766
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,260
Six.

767
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,390
Two men and four women.

768
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,550
My house is small.

769
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,680
The rent is more appropriate this way.

770
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,240
Seven people went missing on the same day.

771
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,810
Do you think we're in trouble again?

772
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,730
I'll report it to Mr. Yu

773
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,120
to search Renyi Square.

774
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,090
Don't waste your time.

775
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,390
That's Renyi Square.

776
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,710
Renyi Square!

777
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,790
Do you think Yu will approve it?

778
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,130
What should we do?

779
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,000
There are more and more refugees

780
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,030
flooding into Yong from neighboring states.

781
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,760
Someone will surely cause trouble.

782
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,070
If we don't find out the truth,

783
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,870
there will be endless troubles.

784
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,990
Shen.

785
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,870
Among the noble ladies in Renyi Square,

786
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,510
you are close with a few of them, right?

787
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,510
Why do you ask?

788
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,360
It's been an hour.

789
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,120
Why isn't he back yet?

790
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,690
Don't worry. Soon.

791
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,620
We can't rush things like this.

792
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,170
I'll drop you off here, Mr. Shen.

793
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,860
See you.

794
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,270
Come on.

795
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,450
Take a break.

796
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,500
Thank you.

797
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,550
My legs are tired from running.

798
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,560
From running?

799
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,520
From running.

800
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,830
Even though he was in a carriage.

801
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,090
Let me tell you.

802
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,870
Among these missing people,

803
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,890
a few of them really worked for the lady I'm acquainted with.

804
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,370
Some were laundry maids,

805
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,930
some drove the carriages,

806
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,320
and some helped out in the kitchen.

807
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,070
All drudgery, basically.

808
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,700
Say something we don't know.

809
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,510
What you don't know is that

810
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,750
the servants of Renyi Square

811
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,390
have something strange in common.

812
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,720
Don't keep us guessing.

813
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,850
On the 1st and 15th of every month,

814
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,910
they all took the night off.

815
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,000
Took the night off?

816
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,600
Then, they would visit the same place together.

817
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,270
It is said to be called the Red Lotus Pavilion.

818
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,790
Followers need to possess a document of universal salvation

819
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,510
to gain entry.

820
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,710
Can you get me a few?

821
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,240
Where are they?

822
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,670
You scared me.

823
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,300
I found them. One for each of us.

824
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,020
Okay.

825
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,590
From now on, we don't know each other.

826
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,140
Mix into the crowd and follow them.

827
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,540
See where they are going.

828
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,540
Didn't you say you didn't want to help?

829
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,330
Why are you so proactive now?

830
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,230
Ji said

831
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,190
as long as I find them,

832
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,450
I'll get half the rent.

833
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,540
Let's go.

834
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,820
Stretch your hands flat.

835
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,780
Okay.

836
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,180
Please come in.

837
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,950
Stretch your hands flat.

838
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,430
Please come in.

839
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,990
Please come in.

840
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,760
How much can Shen earn outside

841
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,870
with his skill of creating imitation goods?

842
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,310
Your document of universal salvation.

843
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,790
His talent is wasted at the Sifang Pavilion.

844
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,900
Stretch your hands flat. Okay, please come in.

845
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,960
Please show your Red Lotus Immortal's document of universal salvation.

846
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,710
Stretch your hands flat.

847
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,570
Please come in.

848
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,300
Please show your Red Lotus Immortal's document of universal salvation.

849
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,700
Stretch your hands flat.

850
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,510
Please come in.

851
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,370
Please show your Red Lotus Immortal's document of universal salvation.

852
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,770
Stretch your hands flat.

853
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,170
Please come in.

854
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,820
[True Lotus Reveals its Might]

855
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,350
Red Lotus Immortal

856
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,430
is powerful.

857
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,060
Kind men and women

858
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,190
kneel before him.

859
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,590
Is the bottle talking?

860
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,770
That's ridiculous.

861
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,830
Those who have ulterior motives sneaked into our Red Lotus Pavilion today.

862
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,340
Show yourself now.

863
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,430
Otherwise, the Almighty Immortal will show himself

864
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,620
and punish you with his Magic Vase.

865
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,230
Who is it?

866
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,940
Those who are unfaithful.

867
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:44,990
Who is it?

868
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,680
It's not me.

869
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,920
No, no.

870
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:25,900
No.

871
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,990
What are you doing?

872
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,190
What's wrong?

873
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,300
Who are you?

874
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,110
[Chen Xinliang]

875
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,930
I'm Chen Xinliang.

876
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,100
If you're not sincere,

877
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,100
why are you here?

878
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,790
Please forgive me, Red Lotus Immortal.

879
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,830
I heard that

880
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,890
you can make us poor live a good life,

881
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,440
that's why I'm here.

882
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,600
But my heart is distracted

883
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,130
and offended you.

884
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,030
Please bless me

885
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,240
and let me live a carefree life.

886
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,170
Please bless my family with peace and health.

887
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,850
All my believers

888
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,210
must make an offering.

889
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,760
One turns to ten, ten turns to hundred,

890
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,140
and hundred turns to thousands.

891
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,900
I have no money.

892
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,020
There are three wens in your pocket.

893
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,240
Why did you lie?

894
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,830
How is that possible?

895
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,370
Give it a try.

896
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,990
Try it.

897
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,800
Try it. Hurry up.

898
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,150
Let me.

899
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,710
I have money.

900
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,780
Wait.

901
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,350
Don't be fooled

902
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,550
by such dirty tricks.

903
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,820
This person must be their mole.

904
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,450
They are tricking everyone to put money in.

905
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,040
If you don't come to your senses,

906
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,200
you will lose everything.

907
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,640
Don't slander me.

908
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,150
You're the mole!

909
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,470
It's easy to expose this trick.

910
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,810
If Red Lotus Immortal

911
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,890
really knows everything,

912
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,750
can you guess

913
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,750
how much money I have in my pocket?

914
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,230
Yes, he's right.

915
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,990
Take a guess.

916
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,510
Guess how much it is.

917
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,070
There are 27 copper coins in the bag.

918
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:23,810
27.

919
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,460
Come on. Count it.

920
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,190
Right?

921
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,670
Is it 27?

922
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,810
27 wen!

923
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,640
It's really 27 wen!

924
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,310
It's working.

925
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:44,010
The Red Lotus Immortal is powerful.

926
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,710
The Red Lotus Immortal is powerful.

927
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,970
If you're not sincere,

928
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,350
why are you here?

929
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,670
Sincerely bring forth your offering

930
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,020
and reap endless benefits.

931
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,060
Where is my money?

932
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,830
Pay me back!

933
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,950
That's the money for my meals tomorrow!

934
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:43,860
Give me back my money.

935
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,260
Or I'll smash the bottle!

936
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,930
What are you doing?

937
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,130
Give me back my money!

938
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:50,750
Pay me back!

939
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,240
Pay me back!
