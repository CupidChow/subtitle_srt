[Jingzhao Prefecture]

5
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,880
Who's barking madly at Jingzhao's gate?

6
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,410
You!

7
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,120
Advisor Ma.

8
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,680
Long time no see.

9
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
Let him up!

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,210
What Advisor Ma?

11
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,320
I am now Deputy Envoy Ma.

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
Deputy Envoy Kang has just passed away

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,530
and you're Deputy Envoy Ma.

14
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,050
Isn't it a bit too soon?

15
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,950
Yanle Embassy's affairs

16
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,410
are none of your business!

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,150
Listen up.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,340
Today, no matter what,

19
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,329
I must take Deputy Envoy Kang's corpse back to Yanle Embassy!

20
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,850
I have a duty to protect Yanle's interests!

21
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,140
If it's really for Yanle's interests,

22
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,910
you should patiently wait for the autopsy results.

23
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,950
You show no concern for the case details,

24
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,180
yet you keep insisting

25
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,310
on taking Deputy Envoy Kang's corpse.

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,270
Could you be rushing to destroy evidence?

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,770
You...

28
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,190
You're talking nonsense!

29
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,670
How dare you suspect me!

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,590
Advisor Ma!

31
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,730
This is Jingzhao Prefecture.

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,579
Questioning suspicious people is our duty.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,680
Heard that?

34
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,100
You've come to the wrong office!

35
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,680
If you truly want to negotiate

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,880
with Yong as an envoy,

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,650
go to Sifang Pavilion!

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,410
Sifang Pavilion?

39
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,810
If you don't leave, I'll have you thrown in.

40
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,670
Fine, fine.

41
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,790
This is how you want to play it, huh?

42
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,420
Fine.

43
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,640
I'll go to Sifang Pavilion now!

44
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,590
Let's see what you can do to me!

45
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:09,910
Let's go.

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,770

47
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,270
Sifang Pavilion.

48
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,670
-To Sifang Pavilion!
-To Sifang Pavilion!

49
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,140
A petty man in power.

50
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,750
When dealing with men like him,

51
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,810
we can't be polite.

52
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,450
Deputy Envoy Kang's autopsy report.

53
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,090
A foreign substance under his nails

54
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,290
that's blue in color.

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,950
What is it?

56
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know,

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,800
but I suspect it's related to Man in White.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,930
Some kind of poison?

59
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,010
I've tested it.

60
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,390
There's no toxicity.

61
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,280
Then what could it be?

62
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,240
Your Highness.

63
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,660
Deputy Envoy Kang instructed me before the accident

64
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,670
that when necessary,

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,930
I should present this to you.

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,100
I believe now's when it's most necessary.

67
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,750
Isn't this Lins' Depository's seal?

68
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,530
Deputy Envoy Kang had something stored there?

69
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,270
Uncle Kang told Si Niang

70
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,710
to take it out when necessary.

71
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,260
It must be very important.

00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,649

demanding Deputy Envoy Kang's corpse.

77
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,420
He must be making a scene at Sifang Pavilion now.

78
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,260
Go ahead.

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,340
I'll take care of things here.

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Alright, let's split up.

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,909
Thank you both for coming, esteemed envoys.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,990
As the deputy envoy, I'm grateful.

92
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,260

[Mobei Envoy, Lord Wu]

94
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,220
and Viceroy Long has always supported our khan.

95
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,190
Now Deputy Envoy Kang has met with misfortune,

96
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,670
I, Wu, naturally came to support you.

97
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,270
Well, well...

98
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
You're too kind, Lord Wu.

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,370
You said Lord Ao has returned to Mobei.

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,930
So the entire Mobei Embassy

101
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,150
must depend on you now, Lord Wu!

102
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,660
We should keep in touch more often.

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,380
I was thinking the same thing.

105
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,390

What are you doing?

121
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,430
What are you doing?

122
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,670
I'm Yu Deshui, the head of Sifang Pavilion!

123
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,430
What's the reason for all this commotion?

124
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,970
Mr. Yu.

125
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm Ma Zhiwen, Yanle's Deputy Envoy,

126
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,630
representing Yanle

127
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,300
to get us...

128
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,520
I only knew people from Yanle Embassy were making a scene.

129
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,470
I didn't realize the esteemed envoys from Mobei and Yueying were also present.

130
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,410
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,700
Please don't be, Mr. Yu.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,390
I should've notified you before coming.

133
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,090
No worries.

134
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,290
What's the matter?

135
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,130
Mr. Yu.

136
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,390
Yanle's Deputy Envoy Kang was killed in Yong.

137
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,410
As fellow envoys,

138
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,830
we can't help but worry

139
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,870
about our own safety in Changle.

140
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,010
Today,

141
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,960
if you don't

142
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,710
offer any explanation,

143
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,930
it might not be acceptable.

144
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
May I ask, Lord Wu,

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,440
are you representing Mobei now

146
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,850
or representing Yanle?

147
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,909
Of course I represent Mobei.

148
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,210
Then let me ask you,

149
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,060
what does this matter have to do with Mobei?

150
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,350
With this matter...

151
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,150
I only represent myself.

152
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,100
Who you represent isn't important!

153
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
What's important

154
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,340
is Yong State must agree to Yanle's demands!

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm talking to the two envoys.

156
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,160
Who's interrupting and making such unreasonable demands?

157
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,030
Guards!

158
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,870
-Yes!
-Yes!

159
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,830
Try me!

160
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,650
I'm the Yanle Envoy Ma Zhiwen!

161
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,770
How dare you treat me like this!

162
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,630
The only Yanle Envoy recognized by Yong

163
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,450
is Kang Yunhai.

164
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,550
You claim to be the Yanle Envoy.

165
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,650
Where are your credentials?

166
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,800
Cre...

167
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,150
C-C-Cre...

168
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,430
Credentials, right?

169
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,750
Yong has never received

170
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,120
any document from Yanle about replacing their envoy.

171
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,960
So if anyone dares to claim

172
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,390
to be the Yanle Envoy,

173
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,850
Yong won't acknowledge them.

174
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,640
-So it's fake?
-So it's fake?

175
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,130
-So it's fake!
-So it's fake!

176
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:06,930
You lied to us!

177
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,340
-It's actually fake.
-It's actually fake.

178
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,860
The document hasn't reached Yong?

179
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,270
It was an emergency.

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,390
Yanle Embassy can't be without a head for even a day!

181
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,820
So I assumed the position first!

182
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,270
The document is on its way!

183
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,190
I-It's... o-on the way!

184
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,370
Yet you already called us here

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,270
and even acted as equals with us?

I think this is all a misunderstanding.

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,390
Deputy Envoy Kang raised Princess Longshuang?

218
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,290
That's right.

219
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,250
Deputy Envoy Kang supported the late King of Yanle,

220
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,610
so he met with this fatal disaster.

221
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,260
We've misjudged him.

222

Enduring years of humiliation and hardship

223
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,650
is truly admirable.

Esteemed envoys,

225
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,410

226

I've been blaming you these past few days...

280
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,590
for not listening to me.

281

If you'd just stayed in Sifang Pavilion,

282

you'd have been safe.

283
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,860
Perhaps that night,

284
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,090
we could've carried lanterns together,

But then again,

287
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,550
the reason you're called Susu...

288
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,060
is because you've always been headstrong.

289
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,840
I first recruited you to East Court...

290
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,190
also because of your rebellious

291

and opinionated nature.

You were always by my side,

293
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,160

Although she was a bit harsh to us,

339
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,900

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,300
You ran into Man in White?

375
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,370
Since we weren't sure,

376
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,790
we didn't dare act rashly.

377
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,250
Yuan Mo!

378
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,870
Stop taking the princess around everywhere.

379
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,790
If something bad happens,

380
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,470
can you bear the responsibility?

381
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,310
Mr. Yu.

382
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,810
It's not Yuan Mo's fault.

383
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,800
This is a keepsake Uncle Kang left for me.

384
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,960
I've to go even if it's dangerous.

385
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,730
So it's this keepsake.

386
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,070
But your status is different now.

387
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,450
Tell me...

388
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,510
It's just a Go manual!

389
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,090
Do you have to risk it for this Go manual?

390
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,740
I'm begging you.

391
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,310
I'm too old to handle such agitation.

392
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,860
Wait.

393
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,510
How did Man in White know

394
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,440
you're going to Lins' Depository?

395
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,290
Because there's a mole in Sifang Pavilion!

396
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,500
Xiuyi.

397
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,300
It's a mole now?

398
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,760
Don't just say stuff.

399
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,750
Retainer An.

400
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,350
What mole?

401
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,470
This mole

402
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,850
is in your West Court.

403
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
I know you're upset,

404
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,750
but you can't

405
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,390
keep targeting West Court.

406
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,910
This parade map was given to me by Susu

407
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,910
before she died.

408
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,750
She wanted to tell me

409
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,100
her killer is related to this map.

410
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,770
And this map... was made by Ji.

411
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
This map was indeed made by Ji.

412
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,250
That still doesn't prove he's the killer.

413
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,070
Right.

414
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,670
We've all seen Man in White.

415
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,470
That build...

416
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,670
Ji's build...

417
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,190
They look nothing alike.

418
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,030
Then he must be in cahoots with Man in White!

419
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,600
In any case, he's involved!

420
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,650
Retainer An.

421
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,440
We're all devastated by Susu's death.

422
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,150
We're usually like family.

423
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,210
Don't ruin our relationships on impulse.

424
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,080
Family?

425
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,310
Susu is dead.

426
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,260
I have no family left.

427
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,770
Xiuyi.

428
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,570
Mr. Yu.

429
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,540
I just have one question for you.

430
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,890
Where exactly is Ji?

431
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:55,910
He...

432
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,100
Mr. Yu.

433
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,430
West Court's records are missing.

434
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,030
-Yeah.
-Are you going...

435
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,750
Was it you?

436
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,360
Xiuyi!

437
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,710
Xiuyi!

438
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,230
Did you conspire with Man in White to kill Susu?

439
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,140
Did you?

440
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,590
Xiuyi!

441
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,660
Did you?

442
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,070
Xiuyi!

443
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,130
What are you doing?

444
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,540
An Xiuyi, are you crazy?

445
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,030
I conspired with Man in White?

446
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,030
Do you have proof?

447
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,250
You want proof?

448
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,790
I'll give you proof!

449
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,390
Mr. Yu.

450
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,590
Six months ago, belladonna seeds

451
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,330
entered Yong in seven batches!

452
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,540
Each batch was personally approved by Ji!

453
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,950
What a coincidence!

454
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,240
Shen Bailian.

455
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,370
Aren't you the expert at detecting forgeries?

456
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,390
Take a look! Is this Ji's handwriting or not?

457
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,070
This... this is impossible.

458
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,430
I didn't sign these!

459
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,350
Mr. Yu.

460
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,250
I've been framed.

461
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,650
I've really been framed!

462
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,170
Mr. Yu.

463
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,610
The evidence is conclusive.

464
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,830
I humbly request you handle this matter impartially!

465
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,990
Otherwise, even if I have to bypass the chain of command,

466
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,800
I will seek justice!

467
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,190
It's suspicious indeed.

468
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,410
Ji.

469
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,600
Chief Secretary Yuchi.

470
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,300
First, detain Ji at Jingzhao Prefecture.

471
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,830
Those from West Court,

472
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,660
cooperate with Retainer An to investigate this thoroughly!

473
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,210
Yu.

474
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,030
Mr. Yu!

475
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,750
Listen to me!

476
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,920
I've never seen An Xiuyi this impulsive before.

477
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,230
Susu's death was too sudden.

478
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,080
They've worked together for years, spending every day together.

479
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,590
His reaction is reasonable.

480
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,740
We need to pull ourselves together

481
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,870
to clear Ji's name as soon as possible.

482
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,580
Are there any clues in this Go manual?

483
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,040
It's just an ordinary Go manual.

484
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,750
Nothing special.

485
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,490
They're all famous historical matches.

486
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,270
This match...

487
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,920
What is it?

488
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,680
The moves are a bit unusual.

489
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,950
And here...

490
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,780
The final winning move...

491
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,670
isn't recorded in it?

492
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
Is it too obvious that

493
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,690
they felt no need to record it?

494
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,670
No, no.

495
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,110
In the previous matches,

496
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,040
the final move is always recorded.

497
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,650
But this match seems to have intentionally left it blank.

498
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,920
Uncle Kang deliberately left out the winning move.

499
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,220
The shape these black pieces form...

500
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,590
Kunwu, what's your take on this?

501
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,450
I know nothing about the art of Go,

502
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,910
but these black pieces

503
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,130
form into some shape.

504
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,910
It's like I've seen them before.

505
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,430
Where?

506
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,190
I remember.

507
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,890
It looks similar to Yanle Embassy's layout.

508
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,830
Yuchi Hua and I once

509
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,360
saw Yanle Embassy's layout

510
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,040
when looking for clues about Man in White.

511
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,100
It's very similar.

512
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,040
The people of Yanle love Go.

513
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,110
The Yanle Embassy was

514
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,540
originally built using the "four corners" method,

515
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,430
dividing it into four areas.

516
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,000
It matches perfectly.

517
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,000
So you're saying

518
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,010
the clue Uncle Kang wanted to give us

519
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,730
should be...

520
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,300
Here.

521
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
The winning move.

522
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,840
Where is this?

523
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,270
-Mourning hall?
-Mourning hall?

524
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,720
Deputy Envoy Kang hid the clue in the mourning hall?

525
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,550
It's possible.

526
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,010
Yanle's people are afraid of Long Tuqi.

527
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,670
They'd never disrespect Long Beina's mourning hall.

528
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,480
So it's the safest hiding place.

529
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,070
Looks like we need to pay Long Beina another visit.

530
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,750
Come on.

531
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,200
Come over.

532
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,940
Come over, all of you.

533
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,000
What's this about?

534
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,200
After what happened at Sifang Pavilion,

535
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,550
everyone should step over this to ward off bad luck.

536
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,350
I'll go first.

537
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,290
Careful, careful.

538
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,240
These are new boots.

539
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,110
Wait.

540
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,000
What is it, Yuan Mo?

541
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,000
Shen.

542
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,150
Are these boots...

543
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,610
New winter boots issued by Sifang Pavilion.

544
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,760
Is there a problem?

545
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,010
Who made them?

546
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,210
Jing Yunsheng.

547
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,880
Sifang Pavilion had them specially made there.

548
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,970
We're always running around on errands,

549
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,410
wearing out our soles.

550
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,870
These custom-made ones

551
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,070
have soles that are two layers thicker.

552
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,750
Custom-made for Sifang Pavilion?

553
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,860
Why didn't I get a pair?

554
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,790
Ji already picked up yours for you.

555
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,840
It's at your seat.

556
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,760
It seems An Xiuyi was right.

557
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,680
There really is a mole in Sifang Pavilion.

558
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,420
And this mole

559
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,080
is the Man in White himself.

560
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,880
Why are you so certain?

561
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,070
When I was hiding in Lins' Depository,

562
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,870
I saw the Man in White's boots.

563
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,650
They were just like the ones Shen is wearing.

564
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,720
Now that you mention it,

565
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,740
I think I saw them too.

566
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:19,990
It seems Man in White

567
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,990
doesn't know these winter boots

568
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,850
custom-made for Sifang Pavilion

569
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,250
are different from those in Jing Yunsheng's shop,

570
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,450
or he wouldn't have made such a mistake.

571
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,200
But every clerk

572
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,140
in Sifang Pavilion has a pair.

573
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,130
So who is the Man in White?

574
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,290
No one seems plausible.

575
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:38,980
Not just

576
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,990
the clerks.

577
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,040
Who else?

578
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,750
The newly recruited runners in the East and West Courts.

579
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,550
That's right.

580
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,780
I know their addresses.

581
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,260
They were all registered upon recruitment.

582
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,220
I'll handle this with Yuchi Hua.

583
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,070
Hurry and find this winning move.

584
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,500
Okay.

585
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,470
My Lord.

586
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,710
Jingzhao has stepped up their efforts,

587
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,970
searching everywhere for The Faceless.

588
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,470
You mustn't risk returning to Sifang Pavilion again.

589
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,630
I was just going with the flow.

590
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,430
It was just for the novelty.

591
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,250
Now that East and West Courts are at odds,

592
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,150
someone will naturally become my scapegoat.

593
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,000
Yiyi.

594
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,120
Do you miss the desert's wind and sand?

595
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,760
Pass down the order.

596
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,400
Command all The Faceless members in Changle to withdraw.

597
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,470
All traces must be erased as well.

598
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,350
Are we returning to Yanle?

599
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,410
I've received news

600
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,900
that Yanle's king is near death.

601
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,470
Yanle is about to face a major upheaval.

602
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,350
I've waited for so long.

603
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Finally, this opportunity's here.

604
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,450
That's where I can truly realize my ambitions.

605
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,800
But what about the joint blood letter?

606
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,890
If we can retrieve it,

607
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,800
their lives will be in the palm of our hands.

608
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,950
No rush.

609
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,510
There are others more eager to get the blood letter.

610
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,820
We just need to sit back and reap the benefits.

611
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,950
There's not much water now.

612
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,880
It'll be easier.

613
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,060
Undress.

614
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,670
I won't undress.

615
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,430
Are you going into the water like this?

616
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,860
Who said I was going in?

617
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,030
As Yanle's princess,

618
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,210
do I need to sneak into Yanle Embassy?

619
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,550
Right, right. I forgot.

620
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,630
That works too.

621
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,830
Saves me the trouble.

622
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,930
It can't be saved.

623
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,430
Why not?

624
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,270
You're a princess.

625
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,730
Can't you just bring me in?

626
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,030
I can't.

627
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,730
As Yanle's princess,

628
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,710
if I bring someone from Yong's Sifang Pavilion

629
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,750
into Yanle Embassy,

630
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,010
what'd that look like?

631
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,170
Then what should I do?

632
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,230
What can you do?

633
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,620
Just keep undressing.

634
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,940
See you at Yanle Embassy.

635
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,960
Don't keep me waiting.

636
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,400
Ah Shu.

637
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,910
I'm actually not a great swimmer.

638
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,460
H-How about you reconsider?

639
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,590
Keep undressing!

640
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,910
-Long live Princess Longshuang!
-Long live Princess Longshuang!

641
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,470
Greetings, I'm Yanle's deputy envoy Ma Zhiwen!

642
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,680
Deputy Envoy?

643
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,140
Ma Zhiwen.

644
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,430
Who allowed you to be Yanle's deputy envoy?

645
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,570
Your Highness.

646
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,449
Who allowed you to stand up?

647
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,090
Your Highness.

648
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,850
Deputy Envoy Kang is... no longer around.

649
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,350
According to the hierarchy, isn't it...

650
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,810
Deputy Envoy Kang is gone,

651
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,420
but I'm still here.

652
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,030
Yes.

653
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,570
You should've requested me to take charge.

654
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,670
Instead,

655
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,340
not only did you fail to consult me,

656
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,400
you even appointed yourself to the position.

657
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,150
I wouldn't dare.

658
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:39,179
It was all arranged by Viceroy Long.

659
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,760
The document is already on its way.

660
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,900
On its way?

661
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,710
Yes.

662
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,550
Si Niang.

663
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,520
Yes.

664
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,500
Have the document returned.

665
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,389
Yes.

666
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,159
No, no, Si Niang!

667
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,230
Don't do that!

668
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,739
Your Highness, this is...

669
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,210
An imperial decree can't be revoked.

670
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,190
I was afraid of disturbing your peace,

671
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,470
so I didn't dare bother you.

672
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,430
How could I not have visited you, right?

673
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,350
I should've visited you...

674
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,320
Enough, enough!

675
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,470
Forget it.

676
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,060
Everyone, you may rise.

677
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,480
Who allowed you to stand up?

678
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,380
Compile all recent affairs of Yanle Embassy

679
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,490
into a written report

680
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,910
and submit it for my review.

681
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,580
-Yes!
-Yes!

682
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,550
You.

683
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,220
Bring me a blanket.

684
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,660
What do you need a blanket for?

685
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,210
How dare you question my orders?

686
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,220
I wouldn't dare.

687
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,530
I'll go get it now.

688
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,450
Right away.

689
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,740
Take care, Your Highness!

690
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,480
Ah Shu.

691
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,890
Although this is very warm,

692
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,780
the timing isn't quite right.

693
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,780
What if someone sees us?

694
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,800
San Niang, Si Niang.

695
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,100
Find a way to hold Ma Zhiwen back.

696
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

697
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,520
Wait.

698
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,890
You didn't need to rush off.

699
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,570
It's fine.

700
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,450
It's fine.

701
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,280
Sifang Pavilion's runners all live nearby.

702
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,670
Where should we start?

703
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,880
Qing's house is the closest.

704
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,140
Let's start with Qing.

705
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,430
We've searched everywhere

706
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,860
except here.

707
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,130
Is Uncle Kang this good at hiding things?

708
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,360
If he's really this good at hiding,

709
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,770
maybe we should just forget about this list.

710
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,140
Yuan Mo!

711
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,990
We're at this point.

712
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
It must be in here.

713
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,470
No.

714
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,490
I'm not afraid.

715
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,820
It's out of respect for the deceased.

716
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,210
Well then...

717
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,540
I-I'll pay my respects.

718
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:19,920
Okay.

719
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,630
I'll do it.

720
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,390
Long Beina.

721
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,690
Long Beina.

722
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,270
Don't you remember me?

723
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,140
Don't blame me.

724
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,800
Please.

725
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,550
We were forced into this.

726
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,100
If you're really upset about it,

727
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,890
talk to Deputy Envoy Kang.

728
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,410
Talk to him.

729
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,340
It's really not our fault.

730
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,580
We have friends on the other side too.

731
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,510
Don't be afraid.

732
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,430
This lid is sealed shut.

733
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,390
H-How do we open it?

734
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,890
Cremation is the norm in Yanle.

735
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,190
The ashes are sealed in ceramic urns.

736
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,390
If you want to open it,

737
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,400
you can only...

738
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,130
Then... we should follow Yanle's customs.

739
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,310
No problem.

740
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,290
Long Beina's done much evil anyway.

741
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,590
We need not be soft-hearted towards him.

742
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,310
Why don't you do it?

743
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,690
Didn't you say you won't be soft-hearted?

744
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,220
I don't feel right about it.

745
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,350
I'll do it then.

746
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,360
I just remembered something.

747
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,640
We have a custom in Yong.

748
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,120
Respect the deceased above all.

749
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,850
Let's follow Yanle's customs.

750
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,000
You do it.

751
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,530
You do it.

752
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,750
Don't be polite, you should do this.

753
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,310
I'm not being polite.

754
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,250
You two are compatriots.

755
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,440
It's inappropriate for an outsider like me.

756
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,040
You do it.

757
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,790
-You do it.
-You do it. You've paid your respects.

758
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,020
San Niang, Si Niang.

759
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,910
I'll just...

760
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,850
Just hand it to me.

761
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,150
I...

762
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,050
I'd better hand it to the princess personally.

763
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,480
You see,

764
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,390
I had some minor misunderstandings with the princess.

765
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,600
This is a good opportunity

766
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,040
for me to get closer to her

767
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,530
and gain her forgiveness.

768
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,300
Fine, fine.

769
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,130
You won't let me, huh?

770
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,010
Fine, fine.

771
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,130
Your Highness!

772
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,970
Shut up!

773
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,620
Your Highness!

774
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,220
Shut up!

775
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,570
What's that sound?

776
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,700
Miss, have some tea.

777
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,630
Granny.

778
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,140
Your eyesight is poor, yet you still work outside?

779
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,350
I can't rely on Qing alone.

780
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,800
I found a job as a laborer in a dye house.

781
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,090
The pay isn't high,

782
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,090
but the foreman gives us workers

783
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,950
the damaged and defective dyed clothes.

784
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,420
Luckily, Qing is doing well for himself.

785
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,210
He once told me

786
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,720
he's working hard now

787
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,080
so you can have a better life in the future.

788
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,000
How rare.

789
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,130
Who would've thought

790
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,240
a chance encounter

791
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,320
would be better than blood ties?

792
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,180
Granny.

793
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,990
Qing isn't your biological child?

794
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,670
My child was indeed named Qing.

795
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,840
On our way to Yong,

796
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,230
he went to fetch water for me.

797
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,500
I waited for a long time,

798
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,580
but he never came back.

799
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,310
I know

800
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,430
the real Qing

801
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,250
is probably dead.

802
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,250
Luckily,

803
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,920
this young man who was passing by

804
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,250
was kind-hearted.

805
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,550
He treated me like his own mother.

806
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,580
We came to Yong together.

807
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
After spending some time together,

808
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,940
I started calling him Qing.

809
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,420
By the way,

810
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,920
don't tell him I told you all this.

811
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,650
I'm afraid he might overthink it.

812
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,490
Don't worry, granny.

813
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,760
Don't worry.

814
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,720
Mother!

815
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,650
Mother!

816
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
I bought you your favorite donut...

817
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,790
Retainer Wang?

818
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,690
Chief Secretary Yuchi?

819
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,990
Why are you here?

820
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,660
We were just checking travel passes in the area.

821
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,050
We ran into your mother and came to lend a hand.

822
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,380
That's very kind of you.

823
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,980
By the way,

824
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,190
have you seen Wu and Ah Fu?

825
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,640
Wu's house is over there.

826
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,550
Ah Fu's place isn't far.

827
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,880
Just around the corner.

828
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,180
But I don't know where he's been lately.

829
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,430
Haven't seen him since the Lantern Festival.

830
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,230
He's missing?

831
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,280
I hope nothing's happened to him.

832
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,190
Let's go check it out.

833
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,620
Okay.

834
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:32,790
We're leaving.

835
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,270
We're leaving.

836
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,110
Already?

837
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,350
Come visit when you have time.

838
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:35,660
Okay.

839
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,720
Take care.

840
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,620
Mother, come, let's go.

841
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,820
Let me help you inside.

842
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,950
Here, smell this. It's freshly fried.

843
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,150
Wang who fries the donuts was in a good mood today.

844
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,410
He gave me an extra one.

845
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,560
Is that so?

846
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,020
-Here, sit.
-Here.

847
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,070
Try it.

848
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,220
It's fragrant and crispy.

849
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,680
I waited for quite a while.

850
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,630
Qing.

851
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,950
Have some too.

852
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,210
It's fine, Mother. You eat.

853
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,750
I'll get you water.

854
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,470
Okay, okay.

855
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,550
Mother.

856
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,500
Have some water.

857
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,260
Oh, right.

858
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,100
Where did you say

859
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,130
Ah Fu went?

860
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,280
Wasn't he about to get married?

861
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,760
Why's he missing?

862
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:17,950
I've no idea.

863
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,710
Mother, drink your water.

864
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,350
Don't choke.
