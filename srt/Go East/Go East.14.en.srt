12
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,630
That means we've found the right target.

Speaking of which,

94
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,870
how could you go to Red Lotus Society without telling me?

95
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,670
What about...

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,140
Just the two of you?

100

I mean

103

count me in.

115

My cousin's family forced me to join the Red Lotus Society.

116

It was only after

117
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,800
meeting you that I realized we were all deceived.

118
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,750

and live well in Changle with them.

120
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,950
By the way,

121
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,980
my cousin told me

122
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,440
there might be

It wasn't you, right?

142
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,910
So what if it was me?

143
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,470
The refugees are missing,

144
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,320
but Jingzhao Prefecture doesn't want to be implicated.

145
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,650
So I had to do it for them.

146
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,180
Didn't my father say

147
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,800
to go ahead if I were to break into Red Lotus Society alone?

148
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,710
So I did.

She said she must take care of the refugees' issue.

158

But this won't do.

Stay at a high place nearby

193
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,440
to watch the exits.

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,650
Once someone is taken out,

195
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,470
immediately inform

196
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,930
Ah Shu and Yuchi Hua who will be hiding here.

197
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,590
-Yes!
-Yes!

198
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,050
Wang Yubin,

199
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,230
Li Fei, Chen Xiaoshan.

200
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,510
Yes.

201
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,480
Take some clerks

202
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,150
to guard these two alleys.

203
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,270
Prepare to respond anytime.

204
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,930
-Yes!
-Yes!

205
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,940
Last time, Yuan Mo and I sneaked into Red Lotus Pavilion.

206
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,880
So this time, it'll still be us infiltrating to find a chance

207
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,740
to communicate with you outside.

208
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,610
Got it?

209
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,520
-Yes!
-Yes!

210
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,910
For this mission,

211
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,390
count us in.

212
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:09,910
An Xiuyi.

213
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,350
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,480
I admit what you said makes sense.

215
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,490
Helping the refugees benefits the five states' alliance.

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,460
I also want to make amends.

217
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,000
Susu.

218
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,870
I've never seen

219
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,450
such a detailed map.

220
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,550
Making amends with just a map?

221
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,080
Everyone has maps.

222
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,050
How is it different from ours?

223
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,910
Don't embarrass yourself.

224
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,210
Am I sincere enough?

225
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,400
Welcome.

226
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:53,950
I will

227
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,190
leave this alley

228
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,690
to you two.

229
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,340
Wait, one more thing.

230
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,640
When Wang Kunwu and I

231
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,180
were in Red Lotus Pavilion,

232
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,550
we noticed they were all refugees.

233
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,750
So when we go there,

234
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,790
we'll have to disguise ourselves.

235
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,570
Disguise?

236
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,990
How?

237
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,080
It's not too late for regrets.

238
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,580
If I regret it, I'll take your last name.

239
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,760
Shen is handsome.

240
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,230
Isn't this nice?

241
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,780
Yes.

242
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,850
Beautiful.

243
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,350
So beautiful.

244
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,890
It's your turn. Come on.

245
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,080
Are you done laughing?

246
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,330
Is this necessary?

247
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,140
Also,

248
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,420
why does this beard stink?

249
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,280
I made it with Inebriation Restaurant's ink.

250
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,550
The funds are tight.

251
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,460
Don't mind it.

252
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:00,840
You...

253
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,600
An Xiuyi.

254
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,880
You requested

255
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,360
to join our operation.

256
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,420
Don't make any trouble.

257
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,550
And don't regret it.

258
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,300
Fine, I'll stick it.

259
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,950
I prepared these for you.

260
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,120
This is a wound cream.

261
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,230
If you get hurt, it can relieve the pain

262
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,290
and heal the wound.

263
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,310
This is knock-out powder.

264
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,390
If you inhale it, you'll faint.

265
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,920
This is the antidote.

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,950
Take one pill in advance and you'll be fine.

267
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,950
This is a good one.

268
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,630
Are you... worried about me?

269
00:14:59,270 --> 00:14:59,810
I...

270
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,890
I... I'm...

271
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,250
I'm just afraid of you screaming in pain

272
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,580
such that I can't sleep.

273
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,970
Poppet.

274
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,350
Please bless all of us to have a safe trip

275
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,370
and destroy Red Lotus Society

276
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,770
to save all the refugees.

277
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,980
Otherwise, I'll turn you into wine.

278
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,150
-You hear me?
-I’m the Snake God Poppet.

279
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,710
How dare you threaten me?

280
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,680
I'll bite you to death!

281
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,830
Ah Shu.

282
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,110
I got it.

283
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,930
That's good.

284
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,230
I know why the Magic Vase can speak.

285
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,350
Why?

286
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,940
If I'm not mistaken,

287
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,980
it should be recorded here.

288
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,190
Here.

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,920
There are people from the desert with the exotic skill

290
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,290
of speaking without moving their mouths.

291
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,270
Only their abdomens move.

292
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,300
It's called...

293
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,240
ventriloquism.

294
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,480
Ventriloquism?

295
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,240
There are 27 copper coins in the bag.

296
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,600
I remember now.

297
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,750
Chen Xinliang was beside it when the Magic Vase spoke.

298
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,230
And his belly went like this.

299
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,230
It rose and fell.

300
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,950
Looks like catching Chen Xinliang

301
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,290
is the key to saving the refugees.

302
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,390
I know the secret of the talking Magic Vase.

303
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,020
What is it?

304
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,020
Ventriloquism.

305
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,600
Ventriloquism?

306
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,120
Yes.

307
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,480
How did you know?

308
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,490
It's recorded in my father's

309
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,510
"Sifang Annals."

310
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,680
Stretch your arms out straight.

311
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,540
Everyone is ready.

312
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,730
I wonder how An Xiuyi is doing.

313
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,550
Don't worry.

314
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
He prepared the map.

315
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
He can't get lost.

316
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,300
I think it is...

317
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,630
or maybe not.

318
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,880
Is it or not?

319
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,370
This alley is as complex as a spider web,

320
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,720
and there are houses built illegally by commoners.

321
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,750
This map doesn't match at all.

322
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,850
It's almost time.

323
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,410
If we still can't find it, we'd be humiliated.

324
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,570
It's just some illegal construction,

325
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,230
but it's such a hindrance at this critical time.

326
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,140
Thank you for coming.

327
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,170
In today's banquet,

328
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,660
on Red Lotus Immortal's behalf,

329
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,680
the Magic Vase will select the truly devout believers among you

330
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,040
to go to the mecca.

331
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,470
All my believers...

332
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,660
Focus on his abdomen.

333
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Will be blessed.

334
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,190
The chosen ones

335
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
will leave the sea of suffering

336
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,270
and ascend to the paradise.

337
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,890
It's really ventriloquism.

338
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,190
What Red Lotus Immortal means

339
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,150
is the most devout believers will be chosen

340
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,950
to go to the mecca

341
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,020
to enjoy eternal bliss.

342
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,350
Red Lotus Immortal is almighty!

343
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,870
Red Lotus Immortal is almighty!

344
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,750
In the cycle of destiny,

345
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,760
everything is predetermined.

346
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,330
My good men and women,

347
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,160
wait patiently for the selection.

348
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,580
I was chosen!

349
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,190
I was chosen!

350
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,570
Thank you for your blessing, Immortal.

351
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,540
Thank you for your blessing, Immortal.

352
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,690
I was chosen too!

353
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,710
I was chosen too!

354
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,040
I was chosen too!

355
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,670
I was chosen too!

356
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,510
I was chosen too!

357
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,730
I was chosen too!

358
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,490
Thank you, Red Lotus Immortal!

359
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,160
Stretch your arms out straight.

360
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,090
W-What is this?

361
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,010
Holy water.

362
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,250
For you to enjoy the Immortal's blessing.

363
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,030
Do you remember the holy water at the door?

364
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,290
It's mixed with honey,

365
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,650
so it attracts the butterflies.

366
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,940
Go over. Hurry.

367
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,640
What are you doing?

368
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,100
Don't come to me. Go to him.

369
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,280
What did I say?

370
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,690
It's mixed with honey,

371
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,980
so the butterflies...

372
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,990
Sir, I...

373
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,390
M-Maybe I’m a spare option...

374
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,360
Congratulations, Chosen Ones.

375
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
Please come forward.

376
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,440
Please follow me.

377
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,910
I will take you to the mecca.

378
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,180
Is Shen sending a signal?

379
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,870
It's that way. Let's go.

380
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,280
Let's go.

381
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,310
This way!

382
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,210
Stop!

383
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,570
Jingzhao's Legal Advisor is here!

384
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,160
Everyone in the carriage, get off now!

385
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,300
Everyone, get off!

386
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,590
We are here to save you.

387
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,810
Legal Advisor.

388
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,740
The two carriages behind are old and weak believers.

389
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,660
Where are you taking them?

390
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm just a runner.

391
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,560
I was paid to send them home.

392
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,390
Home?

393
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,430
Yes.

394
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,220
My home is not far away.

395
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,550
Red Lotus Immortal

396
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,890
took the people he chose away.

397
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,070
None of us were chosen,

398
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,800
so we've to just go home.

399
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,980
Oh no, we followed the wrong carriage.

400
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,720
They mustn't have gone far.

401
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,270
Let's go back to Red Lotus Pavilion.

402
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,140
Send them home!

403
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,830
-Yes!
-Yes!

404
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,450
Stop struggling.

405
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,200
You're poisoned by Black Wind Powder.

406
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,060
You can't move.

407
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,280
Take him away alone.

408
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,610
Don't let others see it.

409
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,580
-Yes.
-Yes.

410
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,060
Why is there no window?

411
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,300
We'll suffocate to death.

412
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,540
You are undocumented in Changle City.

413
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,710
It’d be troublesome if you were interrogated.

414
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,190
It's also for your safety.

415
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,860
Please.

416
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,970
I-I'm afraid of the dark.

417
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,900
Don't be afraid.

418
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,650
You won't be alone.

419
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,670
I-I... I like to be alone.

420
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,170
I-I'm not going.

421
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,220
Are you going in or not?

422
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
I... I'm not going.

423
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,470
Wait, I'm really afraid of the dark.

424
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,920
I'm afraid of the dark.

425
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm afraid of the dark.

426
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,320
Master.

427
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,280
Where's the other one?

428
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,540
It's settled.

429
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,200
You found the hunting dogs.

430
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,020
This is your reward.

431
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,770
Thank you, Master.

432
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,280
Go watch Red Lotus Pavilion.

433
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,610
More people will come.

434
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,540
We have the most detailed map,

435
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,670
yet we got lost.

436
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,840
West Court's people will mock us tomorrow.

437
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,420
Actually you don’t need to care too much about what they think.

438
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,800
How can I not care?

439
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,000
My East Court is clearly superior to West Court.

440
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,530
But since Wang Kunwu and Yuan Mo came,

441
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,110
they keep trying to dominate us.

442
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,170
It's so maddening.

443
00:28:59,170 --> 00:28:59,850
It's him?

444
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,880
Let's go.

445
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,420
Why isn't it moving?

446
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,170
Be careful, Young Master!

447
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,990
Goodness!

448
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,950
Don't push!

449
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,070
Stop!

450
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,600
Don't fight for it!

451
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,390
I have an idea.

452
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,060
The light of the Magic Vase is out

453
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,600
and the dragon head is gone.

454
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,940
What's going on?

455
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,500
Ah Shu, what are you looking at?

456
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,800
There must be a mechanism in this vase.

457
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,260
It's just inconspicuous.

458
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,360
Who are you? Come out!

459
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,790
Come out!

460
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,450
Xiao'e?

461
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,220
Why are you here?

462
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,930
Yuan and the guys were taken away by Chen Xinliang.

463
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,330
Where were they taken to?

464
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,860
I don't know.

465
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,670
We can't stay here for long.

466
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,200
Let's go.

467
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:45,810
Okay.

468
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,060
Don't move.

469
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,900
Where are Yuan Mo and the guys?

470
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,790
Ah Shu, why are you...

471
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,450
Don't move!

472
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,910
If you move, I'll turn you into a hedgehog.

473
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,390
Ah Shu.

474
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,420
On the Magic Vase, there's Black Wind Powder that makes people faint.

475
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,750
There's the same residue on your clothes.

476
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,800
You're from Red Lotus Society?

477
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,650
Get up. Hurry.

478
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,640
Come on. Go.

479
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,690
Just tell me what it is.

480
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,380
Go.

481
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,990
Why did you wake me up in the middle of the night?

482
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,580
Just tell me what it is.

483
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,360
Mr. Yu.

484
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,810
Yuan Mo and Wang Kunwu...

485
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,950
are missing.

486
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,140
Missing?

487
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,440
W-What do you mean?

488
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,390
They were arrested with the refugees.

489
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,140
Arrested?

490
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,850
Weren't you guarding outside?

491
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,140
No, they were too cunning.

492
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,290
We were tricked.

493
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,790
You...

494
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,460
This...

495
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,190
is my fault.

496
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,540
Susu and I lost our way

497
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,230
and failed to guard Red Lotus Pavilion's back door.

498
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,830
Mr. Yu!

499
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,430
Mr. Yu!

500
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,220
-Mr. Yu!
-Yu! Yu! Wake up!

501
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,460
-Mr. Yu!
-Wake up, Yu! Wake up!

502
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,460
-Yu!
-Mr. Yu!

503
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,530
Wake up.

504
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,260
He's awake.

505
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,460
Why are you still surrounding me?

506
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,960
Go to Jingzhao Prefecture! Search the whole city! Find them!

507
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,660
-Yes!
-Yes!

508
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,450
Mr. Yu!

509
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,890
Mr. Yu, I'll stay with you.

510
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,130
For what?

511
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,280
You go too! Go!

512
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,480
Go! Go!

513
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,470
If anything happens to Yuan Mo,

514
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,670
how can I explain to his deceased father?

515
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,160
We're finally here.

516
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,830
[Green Wave Villa]

517
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,540
Green Wave Villa.

518
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,160
Son, look inside.

519
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,400
This is the mecca.

520
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,510
So these houses

521
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,840
were bestowed on us by Red Lotus Immortal.

522
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,750
Look up.

523
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,230
This...

524
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,390
So many houses.

525
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,670
Look! Look at that house.

526
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,930
These houses are all ours.

527
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,080
We have a home now!

528
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,910
We don't need to wander anymore!

529
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,710
Great!

530
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:09,580
Great!

531
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,510
Go quickly!

532
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,560
That's great!

533
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,620
Great!

534
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,480
Go quickly!

535
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,310
That's great!

536
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
These houses are all for us, right?

537
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,670
-Right.
-Are they all for us?

538
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,050
Of course they're yours.

539
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,760
However,

540
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,550
you need to make an offering to Red Lotus Immortal.

541
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,060
Wait...

542
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,120
Isn't this the mecca?

543
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,870
Why do we still have to pay?

544
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,929
Why did you hit him?

545
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,690
To help you come to your senses.

546
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,659
If your worship's sincere,

547
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,480
give me...

548
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,719
the money.

549
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,940
I have no money!

550
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,800
I want to go home!

551
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,000
We all want to go home!

552
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,990
He's dead?

553
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,360
Someone was beaten to death. He's dead!

554
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,210
Run! Run!

555
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,090
Run!

556
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,600
Stop hitting me!

557
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,750
Master.

558
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,940
Are the men and women locked up separately?

559
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,990
Yes, all the women are here.

560
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,840
Take off their shoes.

561
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,460
I'll check them one by one.

562
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,060
Master.

563
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,480
What are you looking for?

564
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,720
I can help.

565
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,490
Yes, yes.

566
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,490
-Stay away!
-Stay away!

567
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,690
It's fun.

568
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,200
You...

570
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,280
A hunting dog?

571
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,600
A government official.

572
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,350
Why do you call us that?

573
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,020
When we arrived in Yong,

574
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,180
we were like prey,

575
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,540
being chased and driven away.

576
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,010
Those officials

577
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,630
are the hunting dogs who did that to us.

578
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,620
I'm not a hunting dog.

579
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,540
Neither are you the prey.

580
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,770
We are humans.

581
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,720
We are the same.

582
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
Come on.

583
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,390
I have medicine for wounds.

584
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,360
Who wants it?

585
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,700
Here.

586
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,620
Take it.

587
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,220
It can relieve the pain. Take it.

592
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,560
Get more medicine for wounds.

593
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,940
And get us two pepper flatbreads each.

Dream on.

Don't you want to sell us

596

597
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,340
Look at us.

598
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,310
We are all listless, weak, and sick.

599
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,880
Will anyone pay to buy such slaves?

600
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,620
When we're full

601
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,180
and recovered,

602
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,240
you can sell us for at least ten times the price.

603
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,800
Wait!

604
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,290

[Jingzhao Prefecture]

00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,480
if you don't want to suffer.

608
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,100
Is the law of Yong

609
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,820
conducted with interrogational torture?

610
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
What's your relationship with Red Lotus Society?

611
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,880
Where were the refugees transported to?

612
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

613
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,670
I was deceived by Red Lotus Society too.

614

616
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,940
You're smart.

617
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,540
You know what to say to protect yourself.

618
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,030
Unfortunately,

619
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,490

How do you explain

622
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,260
this Black Wind Powder?

623
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,010
My cousin is seriously ill.

624
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,430
I got this medicine from a doctor.

625
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,520
What? It's called Black Wind Powder?

626
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,060

I'm from Yanle.

629
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,830
If Yanle Envoy finds out

630
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,990
I'm wrongfully detained,

631
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,430
they won't let it go.

632
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,060
I advise you to let me go sooner

633
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,460
to prevent conflicts between the two states.

634
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,420

She's so difficult.

639
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,560
By the way,

640
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,830
any news from Ji and the guys about the ship?

641
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,470
Not yet.

642
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
What should we do?

643
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,550
Could Yuan Mo and Wang Kunwu

644
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,020
be in danger?

645
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,030
Yuan Mo said we mustn't panic,

Xiao'e is

648
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,270
the only clue we have now.

649
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,510
Let's think about

650
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,170
what else can make her speak.

651

[Sifang Pavilion]

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,420
Deputy Envoy Kang, you came uninvited.

654
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,560
You're even...

655
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,150
being unreasonable.

656

657
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,240
If it weren't for something important,

658
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,120
I wouldn't have come uninvited.

659
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,800
What is it about?

660
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,590
A Yanle citizen was detained by Jingzhao Prefecture

661
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,480
for no reason last night.

662
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,590

663

Look at him.

664
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,160
Look at him.

665
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,710
Deputy Envoy Kang, you're really well-informed.

666
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,040
But this matter's not settled yet.

667
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,950

669
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,760
Also, as far as I know,

670
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,490

00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,980
leading to the refugees going missing.

672
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,590

673
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,000
Yanle's the one

674

You must've got things wrong.

677
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,030
Do you have any evidence about

679
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,260
to make the refugees disappear?

680
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:17,110
According to the agreement between Yong and Yanle States,

681
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,000
if Yong State can’t find

682
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,960
incriminating evidence in 24 hours,

683
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,400

684
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,190

That is to say, the deadline is 8 a.m. tomorrow.

If you still

687
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,770
won't let her go without evidence,

688
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,880
Yanle has no choice but to

689
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,240
reconsider our agreement.

690
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,980

We mustn't release her.

695
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,380
Are you sure she'd confess

00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,960
These people are obsessed with money.

703
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,160
They won't refuse it.

704
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,420
So what if they agree?

705
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,830
In the end, we'd still become slaves.

If we can buy some time,

707
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,490

00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,870
Does the government care about us?

The government

710
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,790
can't wait for us to disappear!

711
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,110
No.

712
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
What's the most important thing now?

713
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,040
It's unity.

714
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,710
As long as we unite,

715
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,890
we can definitely defeat those villains

716
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,020
and regain freedom.

It's medicine.

721
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,620

00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,110
I didn't expect I'm so famous.

727
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,780
Even the ringleader of Red Lotus Society knows me.

728
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,110
Not only do I know you...

729
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,710

What happened to you, Wang Kunwu?

733
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,340
I'm poisoned by Black Wind Powder.

734
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,070
I can't move.

735
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,310
What happened?

736
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,420
It's Xiao'e.

737
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,950
Two smart alecks.

738
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,660
Actually, I know

739
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:57,350
you can't just be

740

All your men wear hoods.

Their boots have thicker soles,

743
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,930
with deeper treads.

744
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,630
This must be a habit developed from

745
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,330
resisting the desert's wind and sand all year round.

746
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,730
You come from the desert,

00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,270
yet you dare to stir up trouble in Changle.

748
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,510
Plus, you're skilled in ventriloquism, mechanisms,

749
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,290
