00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,840
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,510
Greetings, Vice Minister An. I'm Ah Shilan, Princess Yanle.

4
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,550
Ms. Ah Shilan.

5
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,150
If I'm not mistaken,

6
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,630
just two hours ago,

7
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,940
you were still a wanted criminal in our Yong State.

8
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,280
During the transfer process,

9
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,210
your carriage was ambushed, and you barely escaped.

10
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,600
How is it that

11
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,930
you've suddenly transformed

12
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,990
into Princess Yanle?

13
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,540
Vice Minister An,

14
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,750
what do you mean by that?

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,829
Ah Shilan is now

16
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,230
the recognized royal bloodline of our Yanle.

17
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,910
From the royal court

18
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,110
to the common people,

19
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,770
everyone is excited about the princess's appearance.

20
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,030
Yet you claim the princess is a criminal.

21
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,380
Where's your evidence?

22
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,840
The ambush on Ah Shilan's carriage

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,590
is still under investigation.

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,310
Yong State was transferring her as a suspect due to her questionable identity.

25
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,970
We also strongly suspect that

26
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,440
she's secretly colluding with The Faceless organization.

27
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,950
At this critical moment,

28
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,630
she escaped our custody and ended up working for you.

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,100
Deputy Envoy Kang,

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,430
if you say there's no connection between all this,

31
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm afraid that's hard to believe.

32
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,250
First, you suspect the princess of conspiring with The Faceless,

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,710
and then you suspect my involvement as well.

34
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,710
Vice Minister An,

35
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,140
you can't make accusations based solely on speculation.

36
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,470
I'll say it again.

37
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,280
Where's your evidence?

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,790
Ms. Ah Shilan,

39
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,390
haven't you known Ah Shu for many years

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,540
and you're like sisters?

41
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,430
Why are you now siding with the villains?

42
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,710
If you're in a difficult situation,

43
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,579
or if you're being coerced,

44
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,790
you don't need to be afraid.

45
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,190
This is the Ministry of Rites of Yong State.

46
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,390
We will protect your safety.

47
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,050
You won't be harmed in any way.

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,910
You even came to our Sifang Pavilion seeking protection before.

49
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,040
Why have you gone back on your word now?

50
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,310
Wang,

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,270
I did indeed go to the Sifang Pavilion for protection.

52
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,210
But that day, Viceroy Long and I had a misunderstanding.

53
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,120
Now the misunderstanding has been cleared up.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,670
He has promised to ensure my safety.

55
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,810
Retainer Wang,

56
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,350
did you hear that clearly?

57
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,750
Yong State need not concern itself with this matter anymore.

58
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,330
Vice Minister An,

59
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,990
I've come today to inform you of something.

60
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,190
Recently,

61
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,120
I've found

62
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,720
the long-lost Princess Ah Shilan in Changle.

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,120
I will escort her back to our homeland, Yanle, soon

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,530
to reunite with the people of Yanle.

65
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,830
I've come to inform you of this today

66
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,230
to ensure that Yong State won't use any excuse to obstruct us,

67
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,190
and to urge your state to issue a document as soon as possible

68
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,230
to recognize Yanle's

69
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,350
Princess Ah Shilan's legitimate identity and status.

70
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,790
Deputy Envoy Kang.

71
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,350
Many years ago, one of Yong's Sifang Envoy

72
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,330
died in the desert to save Princess Yanle,

73
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,920
and the princess went missing after that.

74
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,830
Given this, our Yong State should approach this matter cautiously

75
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,750
to ensure the Sifang Envoy's sacrifice wasn't in vain.

76
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,150
Before Ah Shilan's identity is confirmed,

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,660
with all due respect, Yong will not admit it.

78
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,890
Vice Minister An.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,270
I'll give you five days.

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,010
If we don't receive

81
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,270
the official letter in reply from you in five days,

82
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,620
I will escort Princess Ah Shilan

83
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,270
back to Yanle at my discretion.

84
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,870
If there's any obstruction,

85
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,470
it will be considered a declaration of war!

86
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,430
Princess Ah Shilan,

87
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:46,870
please.

88
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,870
I'm so furious!

89
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,510
The fake has become real,

90
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,410
while the real has become fake.

91
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,070
Deputy Envoy Kang brought up the will of the Yanle people

92
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,790
and the attitudes of envoys from various states.

93
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,150
This really put the Ministry of Rites in a tough spot.

94
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,870
Why didn't you keep Deputy Envoy Kang here

95
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,310
to get an explanation from him?

96
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,030
Knowing that Ah Shilan is fake,

97
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,910
why would he acknowledge her as the princess?

98
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,840
Uncle Kang must have had no choice.

99
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,070
Ah Shilan was right there at the time.

100
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,910
If his attitude wasn't firm,

101
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,470
it would have aroused suspicion.

102
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,270
That's right.

103
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,350
Ah Shilan still doesn't know

104
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,720
that Deputy Envoy Kang was the Uncle who protected Ah Shu.

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,990
It would be dangerous to show any flaws in front of her.

106
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,380
The Man in White wouldn't let Deputy Envoy Kang off the hook.

107
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,550
So you're saying

108
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,320
this is all part of the Man in White's plan?

109
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,550
But what use does he have for a fake princess?

110
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,200
Do you remember what An Xiuyi said?

111
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,470
As long as they can keep Yanle in check,

112
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,520
command Yanle,

113
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,880
and extinguish the hope of all rebels,

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,240
then for them,

115
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,050
whether the princess is fake or real

116
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,250
makes no difference.

117
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,560
What Long Tuqi wants is

118
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,820
a puppet who can bear the princess title.

119
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,430
And this Ah Shilan

120
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,200
is the puppet they've carefully crafted.

121
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,250
I just don't understand.

122
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,690
Why is Ah Shilan working for the Man in White?

123
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,760
We grew up together.

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,290
How did she become one of The Faceless overnight?

125
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

126
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,630
-Slow down.
-Thank you, thank you so much.

127
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

128
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,960
Take this.

129
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,050
Take it.

131
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

132
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

133
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,670
-Careful.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,710
I have something to tell you.

135
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,260
Get down.

136
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,750
Who are you? Get down.

137
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,409
Let go of me.

138
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,240
Ah Shilan, I need to talk to you.

139
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
-Leave.
-Let go of me!

140
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,640
Release her.

141
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,110
Didn't you hear what I said?

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,820
Follow me.

143
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,140
Stay outside. Don't come in.

144
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,780
-Yes.
-Yes.

145
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,990
Ah Shilan.

146
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,200
The Man in White forced you to impersonate the princess, didn't he?

147
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,590
Ah Shu.

148
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,880
Stop lying to yourself.

149
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm no longer the Ah Shilan I used to be.

150
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,800
I am one of The Faceless.

151
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,830
The Man in White is my master.

152
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,190
I willingly serve him.

153
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,550
Why?

154
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,780
To survive.

155
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,890
To take revenge.

156
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,810
Only he can help me take revenge.

157
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,830
Take revenge?

158
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,440
For whom?

159
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,590
Ah Shilan.

160
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,730
What exactly happened?

161
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,690
Do you really want to know?

162
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,150
Of course I do.

163
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,790
You're like a sister to me.

164
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,410
Do you remember the day you left the village?

165
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,270
Right after you left,

166
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,270
Long Tuqi's general, Mutu,

167
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,350
surrounded the village with the Dragon Cavalry.

168
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,890
They demanded to know your whereabouts.

169
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,830
But how could we have known?

170
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,850
In a fit of rage, Mutu went on a killing spree.

171
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,640
Kill!

172
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,860
Kill!

173
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,800
Hurry up, hurry up!

174
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,670
Mother! Mother!

175
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,790
Mother!

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Remember,

177
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,190
no matter what happens, don't come out.

178
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,510
Go, quickly!

179
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:27,990
Hide well.

180
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,960
Quick, get inside!

181
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,890
Get inside, now!

182
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,050
The entire village...

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,200
113 people,

184
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,690
including my parents,

185
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,150
all died miserably under the blades of the Dragon Cavalry.

186
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,630
Only I survived.

187
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,750
All of this is because of you.

188
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,630
If you hadn't come to our village,

189
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,580
if you hadn't abandoned us to save yourself,

190
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,270
how would they have died?

191
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,150
How would I have become one of The Faceless?

192
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,910
How would I have ended up in this godforsaken place,

193
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,510
pretending to be a princess?

194
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,180
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,310
I'm sorry, Ah Shilan.

196
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,950
I didn't know so much happened after I left.

197
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,670
It's my fault everyone suffered.

198
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,790
I've let you down.

199
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,070
But...

200
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,620
But please, stop working for the Man in White.

201
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,530
Your vendetta is my vendetta.

202
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,790
I will definitely find a way to avenge everyone.

203
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,670
My master will naturally avenge me.

204
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,980
Don't be foolish.

205
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,880
Long Tuqi and the Man in White are in cahoots.

206
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,150
Long Tuqi killed your parents.

207
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,400
He killed everyone in the village.

208
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,290
What you're doing isn't revenge.

209
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,140
You're helping him instead.

210
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,270
You'll only hurt more people this way.

211
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,300
Have you ever cared about those who died?

212
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,990
Fatty.

213
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,260
Huo Ligu, Ah Linge,

214
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,910
my parents,

215
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,910
and all those villagers.

216
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,230
And those who died in the military rebellion back then.

217
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,960
Have you ever cared about them?

218
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,380
You're running away.

219
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,620
You're in Changle,

220
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,540
in the most prosperous city in the world,

221
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,600
living freely as a citizen of Yong!

222
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,670
You...

223
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,030
You abandoned your people to suffer.

224
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,700
Long Tuqi killed your parents.

225
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,150
So many people died because of you.

226
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,830
What have you done for your parents?

227
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,690
What have you done for your people?

228
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,840
You've done nothing.

229
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,920
What right do you have to criticize me?

230
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,790
[Yanle Embassy]

231
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,490
My Lord.

232
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,810
Do you know your fault?

233
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,690
I acknowledge my wrongdoing.

234
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,830
I shouldn't have met Ah Shu without permission.

235
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,290
Please punish me, My Lord.

236
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,790
Why did you do it?

237
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,960
There's hatred in my heart.

238
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
I had to let it out.

239
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,510
Very well.

240
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,470
Remember this hatred.

241
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,100
It will make you stronger.

242
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,150
It will also make The Faceless stronger.

243
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,350
I will heed your teachings, My Lord.

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,610
Here.

245
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,440
Try it quickly.

246
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,470
I just learned how to make it.

247
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,450
Still thinking about Ah Shilan, huh?

248
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,400
I went to see her today.

249
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,270
Yuan Mo.

250
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,350
Can you help me think of a way

251
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,270
to prove that I'm Princess Yanle?

252
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,630
Fatty.

253
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,350
Huo Ligu.

254
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,940
Ah Linge.

255
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,550
When I left,

256
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,960
they were only ten years old

257
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,110
when they...

258
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,640
If it weren't for me, they wouldn't have died.

259
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,950
That's why Ah Shilan hates me so much.

260
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,190
She chose to serve the Man in White

261
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,230
instead of listening to a word I said.

262
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,960
It's not because of you, Ah Shu.

263
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,870
You're also a victim of this tragedy.

264
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,310
Long Tuqi is the one who deserves to die a thousand deaths.

265
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,110
Yuan Mo,

266
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,900
Ah Shilan is the only survivor from the village now.

267
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,200
I can't watch her walk towards irredeemable ruin.

268
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,170
Only by proving that I am the true Princess Yanle

269
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,480
will Ah Shilan become a useless pawn.

270
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,420
Only this way can we have a chance

271
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,450
to rescue her from the Man in White.

272
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,230
Are you sure about this?

273
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,670
I've made up my mind.

274
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,530
If I didn't know what happened in Huangsha Village,

275
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,470
I could still have muddled through and kept running away.

276
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,589
But now,

277
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,390
if I pretend that nothing happened,

278
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,109
can I even call myself human?

279
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,740
Alright.

280
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,510
I'll help you.

281
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,070
Thank you.

282
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,710
I told you.

283
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,040
No matter what happens,

284
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,350
I'll face it with you.

285
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,250
Alright, stop crying.

286
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,940
Let's eat.

287
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,270
Try this soup I made.

288
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,760
I've been practicing for a long time.

289
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,740
The five-day deadline is approaching.

290
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,030
Apart from the Vanessa tattoo on Ah Shu's foot,

291
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,570
is there any other evidence

292
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,200
that can prove her identity?

293
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,710
Yuan Mo has requested a day off today.

294
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,820
He should be searching,

295
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,150
but there's no news yet.

296
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,190
Then we need to find evidence quickly.

297
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,350
Otherwise, Ah Shilan

298
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,680
will be taken back to Yanle by Kang Yunhai.

299
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,950
Have something to eat.

300
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,610
You've been thinking all day.

301
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,550
I'm not hungry yet.

302
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,450
You must eat.

303
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,350
You need energy to think.

304
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,180
It would be great if we could ask Uncle Kang.

305
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,710
But he's being watched by the Man in White now.

306
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,270
Going to him would expose his identity.

307
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,390
Ah Shu.

308
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,280
Think carefully again.

309
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,450
Besides the Vanessa tattoo,

310
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,750
did Deputy Envoy Kang mention

311
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,350
anything else about the princess's identity?

312
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,000
Step in the mud.

313
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,340
Step in the mud.

314
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,960
Step, step in the mud.

315
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,230
Step in the mud.

316
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,500
Step in the mud.

317
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,590
Mud.

318
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,920
Ah Shu.

319
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,640
Uncle.

320
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,600
Come, follow me.

321
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,330
Ah Shu.

322
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,570
I have told you many times.

323
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,730
You must never let anyone see your ankles.

324
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,860
Have you forgotten?

325
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,990
I haven't forgotten.

326
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,210
But they are my friends.

327
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,930
Even friends are not allowed.

328
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,270
This Vanessa tattoo is a totem that proves your identity.

329
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,330
Do you understand?

330
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,150
I understand.

331
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,420
Uncle Kang told me that

332
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,430
I have the proof of my identity on me.

333
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,900
But he was referring to the Vanessa tattoo.

334
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,230
What else could it be?

335
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,680
But this evidence can't prove that I'm the princess.

336
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,870
Exactly.

337
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,630
With just this one piece of evidence,

338
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,030
Ah Shilan can't sufficiently prove

339
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,430
that she is the real Princess Yanle either.

340
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,030
What have you thought of?

341
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,270
The Vanessa tattoo is your maternal clan's totem.

342
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,370
Many people must have seen it, right?

343
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,270
Yes, that's right.

344
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,870
That's it.

345
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,830
This means that the Vanessa tattoo

346
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,590
has been at risk of being misused from the beginning.

347
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,790
Deputy Envoy Kang must have known this.

348
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,080
So there must be other evidence on you.

349
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,030
Ah Shu,

350
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,990
can you carefully recall the circumstances

351
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,000
of that day again?

352
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,760
Tell me about it.

353
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,130
Don't miss any details.

354
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,910
That night,

355
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,720
everything was calm.

356
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,030
I was playing at home

357
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,810
when Uncle Kang suddenly arrived.

358
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,150
He grabbed my hand and brought me to the backyard.

359
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,820
Ah Shu.

360
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,840
I don't know who leaked the news,

361
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,750
but Mutu is searching for you everywhere with his men.

362
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,990
Take this with you.

363
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,670
Press this mechanism if you're in danger.

364
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,550
The mechanism is here.

365
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,280
Do you see it?

366
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,350
Yes.

367
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,150
Good.

368
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,710
Never let it leave your body.

369
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,430
Got it?

370
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,120
Got it.

371
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,320
Hold on to it.

372
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,790
Uncle.

373
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,830
Ah Shu.

374
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,230
The proof of your identity is with you.

375
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,990
Got it?

376
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,120
Got it.

377
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,950
Remember.

378
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,150
Don't ever come back.

379
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,150
Go.

380
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,470
Go!

381
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,750
I see.

382
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,550
Besides the Vanessa tattoo,

383
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,010
there's something else you've always had with you.

384
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,870
The mechanism box?

385
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,300
But how can it prove my identity?

386
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,630
There's something inside.

387
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,690
Silver needles.

388
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,350
That's right.

389
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
No, that's not it.

390
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,850
What's wrong?

391
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,070
The weight is off.

392
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,710
There should be something else inside.

393
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,950
You're right.

394
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,310
I've never noticed it before.

395
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,110
But there's no opening.

396
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,470
Can it be opened?

397
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,360
It's probably very difficult.

398
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,320
But don't worry,

399
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,020
I'll take care of it.

400
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,230
-No, no, no.
-Let me.

401
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,680
Stop.

402
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,670
Give me a chance. I'll try again.

403
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,430
What's there to try?

404
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,520
It must be inside.

405
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,370
Just smash it open.

406
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:10,810
No!

407
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,190
I'm sure I can open it!

408
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,360
-I can open it!
-Let go!

409
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,670
-Stop trying.
-Calm down.

410
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,220
Move!

411
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,070
-I can unlock it for sure! Don't smash it!
-Three, two, one.

412
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,550
Stop!

413
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,340
It's open.

414
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,050
I summoned you here today

415
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,960
because we received an official letter from Yanle.

416
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
Yong hereby officially confirms

417
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,080
the identity of Princess Ah Shilan

418
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,000
and grants permission for the Yanle envoy

419
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,100
to choose a date to escort the princess back to Yanle.

420
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,070
Ah Shilan,

421
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,590
I hope that after you return to Yanle,

422
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,950
you will still keep the people of both states in mind

423
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,350
and strengthen the friendship between Yanle and Great Yong.

424
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,030
I will not fail Vice Minister An's trust.

425
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,170
Now, I, An Yuandao, Vice Minister of Yong's Ministry of Rites,

426
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,830
will deliver the official letter to the envoy of Yanle.

427
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,340
Don't do that!

428
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,400
Ah Shilan is not Princess Yanle!

429
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,830
Vice Minister An.

430
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,960
Fellow envoys.

431
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,790
I have found the evidence to prove

432
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,390
that the real Princess Yanle

433
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,550
is someone else.

434
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,410
I, Princess Yanle, Longshuang Yueshu,

435
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,000
pay my respect to you, Vice Minister An.

436
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,550
Ms. Ah Shu,

437
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,990
what exactly is going on here?

438
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,810
My name is Longshuang Yueshu.

439
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,560
I am the daughter of the 17th King of Yanle.

440
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,870
I was adopted and raised in a village since childhood.

441
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,930
This Ah Shilan is actually the daughter of a farmer from the same village.

442
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,970
She gained my trust

443
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,250
and secretly copied the mark on my foot.

444
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,850
Then, she stole my life story

445
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,880
and attempted to deceive Yong into recognizing her as Princess Yanle

446
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,380
so she could collaborate with Long Tuqi

447
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,710
and jointly rule Yanle.

448
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,900
You said Ah Shilan copied the mark on your foot.

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,080
If that's the case,

450
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,930
do you have the same mark on your foot?

451
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,990
She does!

452
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,750
She does, it's really there!

453
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,950
Vice Minister An, please judge fairly.

454
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,320
She copied my mark

455
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,080
and is now falsely accusing me.

456
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,630
I must have truly lived too long

457
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,230
to encounter such a situation.

458
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,510
Both sides have presented a Princess Yanle

459
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,900
and they both have the same royal mark.

460
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,390
Are we supposed to have them fight it out

461
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,040
to determine which one is real?

462
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Good suggestion.

463
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,950
Silence.

464
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,850
Let me ask you,

465
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,400
what other evidence do you have

466
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,250
to prove your identity?

467
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,440
What?

468
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,660
This is my evidence.

469
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,470
I've never seen this before.

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,590
Wait.

471
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,750
This is the personal seal of the late King of Yanle.

472
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,840
The seal of the late King of Yanle?

473
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,990
Hasn't it already fallen into Long Tuqi's hands?

474
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,120
What you're referring to is the official seal of Yanle.

475
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,180
This one, however,

476
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,530
is my father's personal seal.

477
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,240
My mother once took me on a diplomatic mission to Yanle.

478
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,650
I had the chance to meet the late King of Yanle.

479
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,510
I can confirm that this is indeed his personal seal.

480
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
Vice Minister An.

481
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,950
In my father's work,

482
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,070
the "Sifang Annals", it is recorded that

483
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,870
when the late King of Yanle was still a prince,

484
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,430
he held multiple positions.

485
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,160
Thus, he combined all the seal inscriptions into one seal.

486
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,420
This resulted in this multi-faced seal.

487
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,270
After he ascended to the throne,

488
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,930
this multi-faced seal became his personal seal

489
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,690
and he always kept it with him,

490
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,820
never letting it out of his sight.

491
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,550
Ms. Ah Shu's possession of the late King of Yanle's personal seal

492
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,510
is sufficient proof

493
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,870
that she is indeed the real Princess Yanle.

494
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,110
Ah Shilan.

495
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,040
Do you have anything else to say?

496
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:51,790
Guards!

497
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:52,920
Yes, sir.

498
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,140
Take this woman who impersonated the princess into custody.

499
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,990
Hand her over to Jingzhao for interrogation.

500
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,520
Yes, sir.

501
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,010
Honorable envoys,

502
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,690
although today's ceremony did not proceed as planned,

503
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,480
we have at least witnessed together

504
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,530
the appearance of the real Princess Yanle.

505
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,800
Yong will surely choose another auspicious date

506
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,860
to officially submit the documents,

507
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,470
recognizing Longshuang Yueshu

508
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,930
as the real Princess Yanle.

509
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,880
Mr. Yu.

510
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,830
Yes.

511
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,080
Ms. Ah Shu,

512
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,810
please keep this safe.

513
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,290
No,

514
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,930
I mean, Princess Longshuang.

515
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,030
Yuan Mo

516
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,660
found evidence that Ah Shu is the princess.

517
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,150
It's truly a timely solution to our urgent problem.

518
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,870
Indeed.

519
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,330
We can finally give the envoys from the five states an answer now.

520
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,510
But Vice Minister An,

521
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,400
once Ah Shu's identity as a princess is revealed,

522
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Long Tuqi won't let her off easily.

523
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,630
We need to come up with a plan

524
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,690
to deter the old scoundrel from harming the princess.

525
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,610
Vice Minister An,

526
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,150
Mr. Yu,

527
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,850
Princess Longshuang requests an audience.

528
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,010
-Princess Longshuang.
-Princess Longshuang.

529
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,490
Greetings, Vice Minister An and Mr. Yu.

530
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,450
Your Highness, there's no need for formalities.

531
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,050
Please, have a seat.

532
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,510
Please.

533
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,950
The situation is urgent.

534
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,750
I have an unreasonable request.

535
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,290
Well, please go ahead.

536
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,120
I want to request Yong

537
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,010
to grant a special pardon to Ah Shilan.

538
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,830
[Jingzhao Prefecture]

539
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,290
I want to talk to her alone.

540
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,630
You may leave now.

541
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,110
Yes.

542
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,000
This is your pardon.

543
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,230
Yong has accepted my request.

544
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,130
As long as you reveal the identity of the Man in White

545
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,260
and provide clues about The Faceless,

546
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,270
Yong will pardon your crimes.

547
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,780
I knew you would come.

548
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,180
You think by doing this,

549
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,440
I would be grateful to you?

550
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
I don't need your gratitude.

551
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,350
I just want to save you.

552
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,640
I can't bear to see you so misguided anymore.

553
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,510
Ah Shilan.

554
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,550
Just reveal the identity of the Man in White,

555
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,080
and we can pretend none of this ever happened.

556
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,800
We can go back to how things were before, okay?

557
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,830
Like before?

558
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,320
You can be like before...

559
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,830
Because you never saw

560
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,430
how those people died.

561
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,630
I can't.

562
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,110
Whenever I close my eyes,

563
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,190
I can see the Dragon Cavalry,

564
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,610
the dead villagers,

565
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,330
and my parents.

566
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,680
The old Ah Shilan is dead.

567
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,140
The current Ah Shilan

568
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,250
will never betray her master.

569
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,870
Ah Shilan.

570
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,130
Is it worth it for the Man in White?

571
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,830
My Lord promised me

572
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,030
he would definitely avenge me.

573
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,870
I trust him.

574
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,080
You can't trust him.

575
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,320
Why can't I trust him?

576
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,150
What right do you have to lecture me?

577
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,050
Are you worthy?

578
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,040
Should I trust you instead?

579
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,750
You're not doing these

580
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,469
for me.

581
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,750
You just want to ease your conscience a bit.

582
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,750
Isn't that right?

583
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,230
Ah Shilan, what are you doing?

584
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,260
Ah Shu.

585
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,540
I've been waiting for you to come.

586
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,030
Let me tell you,

587
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,020
even if I, Ah Shilan, die,

588
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,780
I will never forgive you!

589
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,230
Ah Shilan!

590
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,670
Why did you do that?

591
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,520
I've long lost the will to live.

592
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,740
I... I miss my father so much.

593
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,970
I miss my mother so much.

594
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,470
Ah Shilan, why are you doing this?

595
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,270
Heaven... bless Princess Longshuang.

596
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,790
Why did you do that?

597
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,990
I got the pardon!

598
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,770
I came to save you!

599
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,730
Why did you do that?

600
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,800
Step in the mud.

601
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,870
Step in the mud.

602
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,940
Step, step in the mud.

603
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,200
Step in the mud.

604
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,320
Step in the mud.

605
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,050
Step, step in the mud.

606
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,030
Step, step in the mud.

607
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,780
Why aren't you playing?

608
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,740
I... I don't like stepping in mud.

609
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,920
Me neither. It's so dirty.

610
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,910
Let's play together from now on.

611
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,180
Okay. My name is Ah Shu.

612
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,750
And you?

613
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,310
My name is Ah Shilan.

614
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,300
Look.

615
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,820
What's

616
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,630
this?

617
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,000
It's a bamboo dragonfly.

618
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,190
I'll teach you how to play with it.

619
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,670
Sure!

620
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,860
Be it decreed:

621
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,510
The late King of Yanle swore an oath of alliance with Yong,

622
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,270
to forge an everlasting friendship between our states.

623
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,110
Princess Yueshu, though young, is gentle and virtuous,

624
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,620
growing to embody grace and nobility.

625
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,860
Therefore, let it be known to all under heaven:

626
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,850
We hereby bestow upon her the title of Princess Longshuang,

627
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,250
with an estate of one thousand households,

628
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,210
and grant her a mansion in Changle.

629
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,660
Let the relevant authorities carry out this decree.

630
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,890
[Sifang Pavilion]

631
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,330
Where can we go to reason with them?

632
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,990
To think that Ah Shu is actually Princess Yanle.

633
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,190
I even sold fake rouge with her.

634
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,440
What kind of friendship is this?

635
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,810
We even helped her move house.

636
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,840
Logically speaking,

637
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,940
shouldn't we be able to ask for some kind of reward?

638
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,400
If Yuan Mo and Ah Shu have a falling out in the future,

639
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,140
it could become a major diplomatic issue, right?

640
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,820
Don't you think so?

641
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,110
Retainer Wang.

642
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,970
Retainer Wang.

643
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,350
What Ah Shu?

644
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,120
She's called Princess Longshuang.

645
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,090
Yes.

646
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,030
You boys.

647
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,930
From now on, mind your manners when you see the princess.

648
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,590
If anyone dares to be disrespectful again,

649
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,630
I'll punish you.

650
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,770
Yes.

651
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,880
Where's Yuan Mo?

652
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,560
Yuan Mo and Ah-

653
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,200
Princess Longshuang went to pay respects to Ah Shilan.

654
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,230
This tree is revered as a sacred tree by the people of Yanle in Yong.

655
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,010
The land of Yanle State is covered with yellow sand.

656
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,230
They have great reverence for plants and trees.

657
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,890
After a loved one passes away,

658
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,160
the people of Yanle will come to this sacred tree to pray for blessings.

659
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,990
Fatty,

660
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,720
Huo Ligu,

661
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,230
rest in peace.

662
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,140
Ah Shilan,

663
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,150
the things you left unfinished,

664
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,760
I will complete them for you.
