[Episode 8]

4
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,789
What is willow shooting?

5
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,820
It's a game

6
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,630
where you hang a pigeon cage up

7
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,150
and shoot it with a dart.

8
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,000
If you hit it,

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,440
the cage will fall and crack,

10
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,040
and the pigeon will fly away.

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
It's often played in the palace.

12
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,190
Ah Shu.

13
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,340
Yuchi.

14
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,690
We're watching flowers in the garden.

15
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,420
I didn't expect to see you guys.

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,310
This is my sister, Suqin.

17
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,570
Greetings, everyone.

18
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,510
Hua.

19
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,910
You're just in time.

20
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,630
Why don't we play together?

21
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,030
Sure.

22
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,850
It's more interesting to shoot willow in groups.

23
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,050
We from the West Court will form a group.

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,610
There are only three of us.

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,990
You outnumber us.

26
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,680
We should draw lots to decide the players.

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,540
It's only fair.

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,570
It's okay. I'm not playing.

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,950
I'll just watch you play.

30
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,210
Let them play with you.

31
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,720
This guard of mine has never played this before.

32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,280
What?

33
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,550
The Yong people are afraid of losing

34
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,280
and don't even dare to compete?

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,040
Nonsense.

36
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,320
Okay. Let's draw lots.

37
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,070
Let's switch.

38
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,630
Switch.

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,550
I'm not in good form today.

40
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,350
Let's switch.

41
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,210
Respect the rules of the game.

42
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,650
Do you really want me to play?

43
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,290
Kunwu,

44
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,420
we may lose half a year's salary.

45
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,820
Relax. Just do your best.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,070
You're too relaxed.

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,020
Each player has three shots.

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,150
The team that frees more pigeons wins.

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,390
Everyone.

50
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,800
I'll start the game.

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,350
Nice shot!

52
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,680
He got it. He got it!

53
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,079
Nice shot, Yikuan!

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,230
Is he the scholar from Yanle who has six tops?

55
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,310
Ah Shu,

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,190
what does that mean?

57
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,080
It means Young Master Mu

58
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,760
has top grades in all six arts.

59
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,670
Miss.

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,760
Hang up three cages for me.

61
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,710
-Great!
-Great!

62
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,980
Yanle people are indeed good at shooting darts.

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,909
They never miss.

64
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,530
Are you sure he's never played this before?

65
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,860
The first round is over.

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,150
One to three.

67
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,659
Great!

68
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,770
We still have a chance.

74
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,800
I'll go help Yuan Mo.

75
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,470
Please.

76
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
After you.

77
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,670
Very good.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,430
You're really a master of it.

79
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,990
You…

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,470
Calm down, Young Master Long.

81
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,270
You missed.

82
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,150
Yuan Mo will miss as well.

83
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,790
Yuan Mo.

84
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,260
It's your turn.

85
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,890
I'm a sharpshooter!

86
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,150
Yuan Mo!

87
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,730
What are you targeting? Do you want to kill someone?

88
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,920
My hand slipped.

89
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,430
Sorry.

90
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,270
Sorry. My hand slipped.

91
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,600
He said he's a sharpshooter.

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
Nice shot!

93
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,390
He hurt himself.

94
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,830
Yuan Mo.

95
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,420
Just quit.

96
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,440
It's not too late to tap out.

97
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,430
Kunwu,

98
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,340
I can't do it.

99
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,890
Sorry for letting you down.

100
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,150
Just throw the dart.

101
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,590
I'm really a sharpshooter!

102
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,990
Great!

103
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,430
-Two cages fell.
-Nice shot!

104
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,670
The third round is over.

105
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,310
Two to zero.

106
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,110
Great!

107
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,429
Four to five in total.

108
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,429
Amazing! Amazing!

109
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:33,909
Great!

110
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,830
You broke the rules.

111
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,990
The rule is that each person gets three shots,

112
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,990
but there's no rule about the order of the shots.

113
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,300
Kunwu beat you with only two darts in your round.

114
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,350
So he threw the third dart in this round.

115
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,550
What's the problem?

116
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,640
That stupid pigeon!

117
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,790
It's just a game.

118
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,470
There's no need to kill it.

119
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,270
You pariah.

120
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,600
How dare you defy me!

121
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,030
Stop!

122
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,600
Stop!

123
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,420
Let him go, or I'll go hard on you!

124
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,990
Let's go.

125
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,960
Stop!

126
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,030
You haven't apologized!

127
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,790
Apologize?

128
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm the son of the Viceroy of Yanle.

129
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,080
How can I apologize to a pariah?

130
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,910
In terms of family background,

131
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,870
no one has ever outdone me.

132
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,890
If you don't apologize to him,

133
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,290
I'll ask the soldiers of the Yuchi family

134
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,060
to turn your house upside down.

135
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,940
Let's go.

136
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,870
Retainer An.

137
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,660
Are you okay?

138
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,260
Don't forget.

139
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,070
You need to pay half a year's salary.

140
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,430
It's half a year's salary.

141
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,760
Rest assured. I'll pay.

142
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,990
All you think about is money.

143
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm not like you.

144
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,920
You're so generous!

145
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,260
Young Master, have some soup.

146
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,310
I've captured that stupid pigeon

147
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,110
and killed it.

148
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,970
It should've behaved.

149
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,530
It tastes good.

150
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,730
I'm afraid someone has played dirty.

151
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,310
I found that the pigeon

152
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,240
had been drugged with Yanle's unique frenzy powder.

153
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,320
It was someone from Yanle?

154
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,140
It was her,

155
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,120
the girl who stalked me?

156
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,310
Her figure is very similar to the person

157
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,910
who eavesdropped outside the door that night.

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,430
After the annual exam tomorrow, go find An Xiuyi.

159
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,110
Tell him to get someone to look into that girl

160
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,710
and find out who she is.

161
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,230
Yes.

162

The annual exam is coming.

163
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,440
Master, should you do some reading and revision?

164
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,640
Put on an act at least,

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,990
so it won't look too bad for Viceroy Long.

166
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,600
No need.

167
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,320
Don't worry.

168
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,670
I'm well-prepared.

169
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,110
I can ace the exam.

Somehow, I'm feeling restless

171
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,210
and really want to get some exercise.

172
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,770
Go get my sword.

173
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,050
Master.

174
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,610
Master, stop.

Master, stop.

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,220
What's wrong with Master?

183
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,430
He's so strange.

184
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,900
He must be exhausted after this.

185
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,600
Looks like I have to prepare pigeon soup again tonight.

186
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,390
Pigeon soup?

187
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,590
Long Ge bought a pigeon today.

188
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,440
He had killed it, so I stewed it.

189
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,800

190
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,670

The Ministry of Rites has given a directive.

193
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,150
The annual exam will start today.

194
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,310
The Sifang Pavilion is to verify

195
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,430
the exam permits of scholars from all states.

196
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,310
In collaboration with the Jingzhao Prefecture,

197
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,550
we're to maintain order both inside and outside of the exam hall,

198
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,810
ensuring the annual exam goes smoothly.

199
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,320
Is everyone clear?

200
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,380
Yes!

201
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,000
Get back to work.

202
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,740
Yes.

203
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,890
Scholars, please come in.

204
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,810
Come in. Line up. One at a time.

205
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,960
Sang Muli.

206
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,760
Next.

207
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,080
Ming Yang.

208
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,110
Next.

209
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,270
Take a look.

210
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,380
Young Master Mu,

211
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,880
stay calm during the exam.

212
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,140
After you pass the exam with flying colors, you can marry my cousin.

213
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,400
-I'll do my best.
-Hua.

214
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,680
Out of the way!

215
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,190
Yikuan.

216
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,450
What's wrong with you?

217
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,030
Yuchi Hua.

218
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,630
Are you okay?

219
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,230
I'm fine.

220
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,560
Don't waste your time.

221
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,200
It's useless even if you win first place.

222
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,850
The annual exam is about to begin.

223
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,250
Don't cause any trouble.

224
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,480
Yikuan.

225
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,420
Don't let someone like that upset you

226
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,080
and affect your performance.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,460
Don't worry. I won't.

228
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,380
The annual exam begins.

229
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,290
[Director Bai of Literature Hall]

230
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,830
He's not young anymore.

231
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,670
Shen.

232
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,470
Ah Shu.

233
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:48,910
What are you doing here?

234
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,550
Ji.

235
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,760
I heard you guys are on duty today.

236
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,790
It's so hot.

237
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,630
I bought you some ice creams.

238
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,180
Come and share them.

239
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,630
Thank you. It's great.

240
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,690
Everyone gets one.

241
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,280
Don't grab. One for each.

242
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,470
Wait.

243
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,420
200 wen each.

244
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,810
Are you robbing me?

245
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,170
You don't have to buy it.

246
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,750
Why is it that I have to pay while they can freeload?

247
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,320
-Who are you talking about?
-Who are you talking about?

248
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,580
I just like it this way.

249
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,800
Do you want it or not?

250
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,540
Fine. 200 wen.

251
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,270
Give it to me.

252
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,870
I've earned 200 wen so easily.

253
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,160
It's not so hard to make money.

254
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,130
I can get 21 strings very soon.

255
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,120
I'm leaving.

256
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,030
Bye.

257
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,830
Bye, Ah Shu.

258
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,510
Yikuan.

259
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,120
Suqin.

260
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,110
I've asked Hong Ye to make a reservation at Inebriation Restaurant.

261
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,020
-Long Ge.
-Let's celebrate for you later.

262
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,100
The carriage is not back yet.

263
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,560
-We have to wait for a little while.
-Long Ge!

264
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,180
I don't want to wait here. Let's take a walk.

265
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,630
Young Master. Young Master.

266
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,470
Come. Look at these flowers.

267
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,670
Yikuan, look.

268
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,430
Suqin.

269
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,980
I just remembered that I have some urgent matters to attend to.

270
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,960
Go back by yourself.

271
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I'll be back soon.

272
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,970
You're a man. How can you attack a weak girl like me?

273
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,330
You made me restless all day.

274
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,270
You're everything but a weak girl!

275
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,830
You actually found it out.

276
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,240
But I only remember drugging the pigeon.

277
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,590
Have you eaten it and gotten influenced too?

278
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,150
You…

279
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,810
Who on earth are you?

280
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,590
What's your issue with me?

281
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,670
I'll tell you if you can catch me.

282
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,390
Stop!

283
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,930
Come and get me.

284
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,750
Run faster!

285
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,310
Stop!

286
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,430
My eyes!

287
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,310
You brat.

288
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,340
You're so stupid

289
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,580
as to be set up so easily.

290
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,940
This is for letting your slave hurt me.

291
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,990
This is for insulting a girl.

292
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,190
This is for bullying around.

293
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,030
And this

294
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,670
is for being the son of Long Tuqi

295
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,230
who is a cancer to both the country and its people.

296
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,510
Sooner or later, I'll make him pay myself.

297
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,350
You brat.

298
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,310
After I become an official of Yong,

299
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,590
I'll kill your whole…

300
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,310
Brat, what did you make me eat?

301
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,630
It's the most lethal poison in the world.

302
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,750
I made it myself.

303
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,540
Do you think I'll buy it?

304
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,200
Touch the spot above your ribs under your elbow.

305
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,880
Put a little pressure on it.

306
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,280
What's wrong with me?

307
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,870
Do you believe it now?

308
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,110
Listen carefully.

309
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,790
Give me one string by the end of every month

310
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,310
and kowtow to me as you do to your mother.

311
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,670
Then I'll give you the antidote in installments.

312
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,910
That's the Zhangmen acupoint.

313
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,840
Anyone will hurt when pressing it.

314
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,780
Young Master.

315
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,910
It's been an hour.

316
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,440
Maybe that Long Beina

317
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,130
has forgotten about you.

318
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,120
Young Master An.

319
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,640
Have you seen Young Master Long?

320
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,810
Is he not with you?

321
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,190
No. I'm looking for him too.

322
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,590
Someone died over there!

323
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,790
Someone died!

324
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,370
Move aside!

325
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,030
Young Master.

326
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,520
It's her.

327
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,420
It must be her.

328
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,480
You know who killed him?

329
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,800
The maid of Yuan Mo from the Sifang Pavilion!

330
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,110
She's the only one who has this poison!

331
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,000
Ah Shu?

332
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,750
It feels so good to have vented my anger.

333
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,050
I can get

334
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,990
20 strings soon.

335
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,300
Yuchi.

336
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,470
Why are you here?

337
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,430
[Sifang Pavilion]

338
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,760
Young Master Long died in Yong.

339
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,530
Yong must seek justice for him,

340
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,140
or Yanle won't let it go!

341
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,550
We're very sorry

342
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,870
about Young Master Long's death.

343
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,710
But you're just his bodyguard,

344
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,410
not the envoy of Yanle.

345
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,920
You can't speak for Yanle.

346
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,550
If Yanle really wants Yong

347
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,310
to seek justice for him,

348
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,340
the Viceroy of Yanle has to send an envoy

349
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,980
to submit related documents

350
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,730
before we discuss it.

351
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,550
Mr. Yu is right.

352
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,170
This concerns the relationship between the two countries.

353
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,990
The etiquette must not be neglected.

354
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,720
You'd better send a letter back

355
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,000
to ask the Viceroy for instructions.

356
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,470
Xiuyi.

357
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,630
What should we do?

358
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,740
The peace between Yong and Yanle

359
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,150
has always been fragile.

360
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,270
Now that this has happened,

361
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,790
I'm afraid we'll fall out with each other.

362
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,310
At this point,

363
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,270
we have to bring the murderer to justice

364
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,310
to appease Yanle.

365
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,110
The murderer?

366
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,550
How could Ah Shu be the murderer?

367
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:37,950
My god.

368
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,910
Ah Shu stalked Long Beina

369
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,990
before he died.

370
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,190
She had ulterior motives

371
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,190
and is the major suspect.

372
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,920
Impossible!

373
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,910
Ah Shu wouldn't kill anyone.

374
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,950
Yuan Mo.

375
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,080
Ah Shu is good at using poison.

376
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,810
She left some powder at the scene.

377
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,140
How do you explain that?

378
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,030
Ah Shu is indeed a bit naughty

379
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,990
and loves fiddling with herbs.

380
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,150
But she's kind by nature.

381
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,430
It's not what you think!

382
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,160
Before we have solid evidence,

383
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,660
Ah Shu is not the murderer.

384
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,940
Right. Yu,

385
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,190
I need to see Ah Shu.

386
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,660
Mr. Yu.

387
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,550
Yuan Mo can't see Ah Shu.

388
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,070
The victim is a scholar from Yanle.

389
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,670
Yong should assist in the investigation.

390
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,670
But Yuan Mo and Ah Shu are very close.

391
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,950
He should not get involved.

392
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,630
An Xiuyi.

393
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,670

395
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,390
A lot is at stake.

396
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,360
To be on the safe side, you can't see Ah Shu.

397
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,920
Mr. Yu.

398
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,750
I'm willing to work with the Jingzhao Prefecture to investigate this case.

399
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,310
No.

400
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,960
Ah Shu is close with those at the West Court.

401
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,800
I think

402
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,230
you should let the East Court take charge of this case.

403
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,070
An Xiuyi.

404
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,370
Just a friendly reminder.

Don't burn all your bridges.

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,150
I'm just doing my job impartially.

407
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,950
Enough.

408
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,550
We'll…

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,390
do as Retainer An said.

Keep an eye on Yuan Mo for me.

413
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,270
He can't get involved.

414
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,670
I really don't want anyone to tell me

415
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,990

Are you worried about Ah Shu?

418
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm not worried about her.

419
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,120
I'm worried that I can't collect the debt she owes me.

420
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,750
You're worried sick.

421
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,100
Stop playing cool.

422
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,590
Ah Shu is such a nice girl.

423
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,030
She bought us ice creams when it was hot.

424
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,650
I don't believe she'd have killed him.

425
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,250
Exactly.

426
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,630
An Xiuyi doesn't allow us to see Ah Shu,

427
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,550
but we can help him find clues.

428
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,060
As long as the real murderer is found,

429
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,720
Ah Shu can be proven innocent.

430
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,610
Right.

431

Where are you going?

433
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,760

434
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,670
Great.

435
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,820
I want to pee too.

436
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,780

Yes.

you want to kick me out?

522
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,470
Yeah.

523
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,630
Someone told me

524
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,870
he saw Ah Shu fighting with Long Beina.

525
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,470
Then they entered the alley.

526
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,420
Later, Long Beina died.

527
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,750
I was told the same.

528
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,150
Did Ah Shu really…

529
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:17,910
No.

530
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,990
It exactly proves that Ah Shu isn't the murderer.

531
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,850
Think about it.

532
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,610
If Ah Shu were the murderer,

533
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,990
why would she have drawn so much attention before the murder?

534
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,920
You have a point.

535
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,680
I've asked the coroner.

536
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,730
Because of the powder over his eyes,

537
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,860
Long Beina couldn't see anything before he died.

538
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,110
And he was beaten hard before he died.

539
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,750
There are many bruises over his body.

540
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,950
But it was the wound on the back of his head that killed him.

541
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,350
Kunwu…

542
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,240
What?

543
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
You can investigate it, but I can't?

544
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,500
Retainer Wang may be a bit stern,

545
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,850
but he's a very nice guy.

546
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,630
Yeah.

547
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,780
Ah Shu likes you a lot.

548
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,230
You didn't let her down.

549
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,390
Enough. Stop praising me.

550
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,790
We need to find a way to clear Ah Shu's name.

551
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,170
The fatal wound is on the back of his head.

552
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,960
It means

553
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,070
the murderer attacked him from behind.

554
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,330
If Ah Shu had blinded Long Beina,

555
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,730
why would she have bothered to go behind him?

556
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,450
Since you're sure that the murderer is someone else,

557
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,790
you have to find evidence and catch the murderer as soon as possible.

558
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,990
I'm in charge

559
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,950
of all the matters in the Sifang Pavilion now.

560
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,500
If this really has something to do with someone at the Sifang Pavilion,

561
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,510
people will say I'm an inept leader.

562
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,270
Hold on.

563
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,080
Shouldn't you be the one to find evidence?

564
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,750
Wait, wait.

565
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,790
I'm just kidding.

566
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,030
Just kidding.

567
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,880
You didn't ask me to find evidence,

568
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,790
but won't I take the initiative to do it?

569
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,750
Of course I will.

570
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,240
Hurry. Take me to see Ah Shu.

571
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,420
There's a conflict of interest.

572
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,860
You can't meet Ah Shu.

573
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,910
This is the rule of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

574
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,250
Then why did you bring me here?

575
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,970
I have my own rules.

576
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,150
I see.

577
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,280
What rules?

578
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,840
Wait.

579
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:56,950

590
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,590
She's in the cell next to yours.

This is not against the rules of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

598
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,790
I'm innocent.

You've got me in trouble again and again.

604
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,550
You can use a few days in prison.

605

I knew I couldn't rely on you.

Stop arguing.

Is this a place for arguing?

You can argue all you want after you get out.

What a surprise.

610
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,320
You were put in prison so soon.

How do you feel?

612
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,390
It's much better than staying in the same room with you.

Okay.

614
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,410
Looks like I shouldn't have bothered to bring this.

615
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,550
It's a waste now.

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,280
I melted rouge in the water

620
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,870
and then put it in a bottle

621
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,470

You threw the herbal powder at Long Beina, didn't you?

634
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,630
Why did you mess with him?

635
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,310
I just wanted to make money from him to pay you back

636
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,440
so that we could move into a new house as soon as possible.

I'm looking for Long Beina's file.

You said he's not allowed to see Ah Shu.

You didn't say he can't check Long Beina's file.

Wasn't he perfectly fine at the annual exam yesterday?

752
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,740
Where did you go

753
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,110
after the annual exam yesterday?

754
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,560
Are you officials from the Jingzhao Prefecture?

755
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,080
Do you have a decree from the magistrate of Jingzhao?

756
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,620
Don't be so serious, Ms. Bai.

757
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,350
I'm just asking…

758
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,150
You're not officials and don't have a decree.

759
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,070
Please forgive us for not telling you anything.

760
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,600
Hong Ye.

761
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,590
See them out.

762
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,150
Yes.

763
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,830
Wait.

764
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,270
Suqin.

765
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,430
I'm a man of integrity.

766
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,770
If I refuse to talk,

767
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,310
it'll appear that I have something to hide.

768
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,070
Yesterday, after the annual exam,

769
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,400
Suqin came to pick me up.

770
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,390
She also sent Hong Ye to Inebriation Restaurant

771
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,750
to make a reservation for celebration.

772
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,350
But the topic of the annual exam this year intrigued me very much,

773
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,630
so I went back to Literature Hall halfway

774
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,960
to write a new article.

775
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,310
I kept writing from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.

776
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,550
Then I left.

777
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,350
You said you stayed in Literature Hall.

778
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,540
Do you have a witness?

779
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,400
Director Bai of Literature Hall can testify for me.

780
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,510
This is the article Yikuan wrote.

781
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,120
The one who rules the country

782
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,020
should regard his people as the foundation.

783
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,730
The one who governs the country

784
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,990
should regard talent as the foundation.

785
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,530
Even people of the humblest origins

786
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,790
can have great talent.

787
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,950
Yikuan wishes

788
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,380
that all the impoverished scholars in the world

789
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,980
could have the chance to achieve their ambitions.

790
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,780
Director Bai.

791
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,210
When Mu Yikuan wrote this article,

792
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,480
were you there the whole time?

793
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,790
I wasn't there the whole time,

794
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,260
but it's already very challenging

795
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,820
to conceive this article and write it down

796
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,270
within two hours.

797
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,810
I don't think he had the time

798
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,780
to commit murder.

799
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,190
Then in your eyes,

800
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,630
what kind of person is Mu Yikuan?

801
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,150
Yikuan is dedicated to studying

802
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,210
and good-natured.

803
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,830
He never holds grudges against anyone,

804
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,630
let alone mess with Long Beina.

805
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,630
I intend to let him teach

806
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,850
in Literature Hall after the annual exam

807
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,910
and marry my daughter, Suqin, to him.

808
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,830
Yikuan.

809
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,050
What's wrong?

810
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,850
Are you unwilling to marry me early

811
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,000
as Father asked?

812
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,230
Of course not.

813
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,950
It's just that I want to give you a grand wedding

814
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,010
after I succeed in the imperial exam.

815
00:39:59,370 --> 00:39:59,970
Yikuan.

816
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,810
I don't care if you're successful.

817
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,040
I just want to be your wife as soon as possible.

818
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,270
My Lady.

819
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,620
Someone's selling pears over there.

820
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,150
Let's go buy some pears.

821
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,750
Okay.

822
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,350
I'll be right back.

823
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,150
Let's go.

824
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,470
Madam.

825
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,200
How much is the pear?

826
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Two wen each.

827
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,510
These big pears are fresh and delicious.

828
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,530
Move!

829
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,670
Move!

830
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,990
Move!

831
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,500
Move!

832
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,650
The horse has been startled. Get out of the way!

833
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,330
Suqin!

834
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,600
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

835
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,330
I'm fine.

836
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,510
Good.

837
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,540
Hong Ye.

838
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,790
A-Are you okay?

839
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,910
Come on. Get up.

840
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,110
Let's go see a doctor.

841
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,860
Be careful.

842
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,570
Ji and the others should be back soon.

843
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,660
Long Tuqi, the Viceroy of Yanle,

844
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,470
has been informed of the death of Long Beina.

845
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,700
Yanle's delegation is rushing here day and night to seek justice.

846
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,230
They'll arrive in Changle in ten days at most.

847
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:24,910
By then,

848
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,830
if we still haven't found anything,

849
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,110
Ah Shu will be the only suspect

850
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,000
and be executed according to the law.

851
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,190
Then I'll break into the prison

852
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,110
and get her out!

853
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,660
Ah Shu couldn't have killed him.

854
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,870
There must be other clues.

855
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,360
Ah Shu is very good at using poison.

856
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,850
Who on earth is she?

857
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,520
Why do you trust her so much?

858
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,110
Ah Shu is very pitiful.

859
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,370
She just wants to gain a foothold in Changle.

860
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,580
But on her way here,

861
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,390
she must have gone through a lot.

862
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,470
I don't know her past,

863
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,360
but the scars and wounds on her body

864
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,510
told me

865
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,250
she must have been through a lot of terrible things.

866
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,230
Wounds?

867
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,390
She wouldn't tell me about them.

868
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,390
I won't force her.

869
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,590
Everyone has a past they don't want to talk about.

870
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,530
You don't talk about your past either.

871
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,520
They're back.

872
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,500
Have you found anything?

873
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,970
Give it to me.

874
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,590
No. You…

875
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,940
Leave some for him.

876
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,010
After Mu Yikuan arrived in Changle,

877
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:36,990
what was the first thing he did?

878
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,910
Take a guess.

879
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,570
What was it?

880
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,910
-He learned willow shooting.
-He learned willow shooting.

881
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,770
And he learned it in three months.

882
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,700
That's all?

883
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,790
When Mu Yikuan first met Bai Suqing,

884
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,790
he saved her like a hero.

885
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,810
On the shooting range,

886
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,020
darts were flying like rain.

887
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,650
Mu Yikuan threw one dart after another

888
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,790
and never missed.

889
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,860
At this time, Bai Suqin accidentally entered the shooting range

890
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,350
and saw a dart flying straight towards her.

891
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,090
At this critical moment,

892
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,830
Mu Yikuan came to her rescue

893
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
like a superhero.

894
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,350
At this moment, Bai Suqin's world

895
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,280
seemed to have stopped.

896
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,310
All she could see was Mu Yikuan.

897
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,300
That's what they told me.

898
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,630
I'm just retelling the story.

899
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,790
Alright. Let go of me, Ji.

900
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,430
-Let go.
-Let's keep acting.

901
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,360
Close your eyes.

902
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,310
Let go of me!

903
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,390
I asked you to find evidence.

904
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,550
Why did you go to Inebriation Restaurant?

905
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,950
Inebriation Restaurant

906
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,280
is near the crime scene.

907
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,890
The murderer has to eat, right?

908
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,510
And I heard that

909
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,820
murderers usually go back

910
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,270
to the crime scenes after the murders.

911
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,020
I just wanted to try my luck

912
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,830
to see if I could run into the murderer.

913
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,790
So did you run into the murderer?

914
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,510
No.

915
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,510
I wasn't so lucky.

916
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,320
By the way…

917
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,910
can you pay for the meal?

918
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:18,990
You…

919
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,790
Sorry. It was written just now.

920
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:23,830
It stinks.

921
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,150
I-It's the smell just now.
