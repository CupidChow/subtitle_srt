00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,380
[Princess's Mansion]

4
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,400
Longshuang Yueshu!

5
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,280
What are you doing?

6
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,770
-Without...
-Step aside!

7
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,320
Longshuang Yueshu,

8
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,630
don't go too far!

9
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,280
Commander Mu, what makes you so angry?

10
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,780
How dare...

11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,430
How dare you ask me to empty the chamber pot!

12
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,350
Why not?

13
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,780
I know why you asked me to serve you.

14
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,040
You hate me.

15
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,540
Back then, you hid in Huangsha Village.

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,610
I killed everyone in the village.

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,500
You want to get close to me.

18
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,750
Come on!

19
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,750
I'll grant your wish!

20
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,180
I'm not the one who wants to kill you.

21
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,890
It's Man in White.

22
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,150
I just want my throne back.

23
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,750
You actually told me what you really want.

24
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,490
Aren't you worried that I'll tell Viceroy Long?

25
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,660
You won't.

26
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,670
Why?

27
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,680
Are you willing to spend your whole life under Long Tuqi's command?

28
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,030
Are you trying to drive a wedge between us?

29
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,590
I'm loyal to Viceroy Long.

30
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,190
But what happened in the end?

31
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,790
He asked you to be my servant.

32
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,060
I'm a defenseless woman.

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,610
He wants someone to keep an eye on me.

34
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,090
But does that person have to be you?

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,140
Don't you think it occurred to him

36
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,360
that you don't want to demean yourself or be humiliated?

37
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,020
Or he doesn't care at all.

38
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,000
Think about it.

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,130
You've been loyal to Long Tuqi for so many years.

40
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,590
But what have you got in return?

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,710
Since Man in White entered the city,

42
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,950
Long Tuqi has listened to him in everything.

43
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,230
Man in White fears your rank and status.

44
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,290
He has always wanted to get rid of you.

45
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,360
Has Long Tuqi ever alienated Man in White for you?

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,760
Or you're the person

47
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,920
who has been alienated.

48
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,140
You're in charge of the Dragon Cavalry.

49
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,030
I have the people's support.

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,190
If we work together,

51
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,030
what will happen?

52
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,700
Do you think I can be easily fooled?

53
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,110
I'll tell Viceroy Long

54
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,029
every word you said.

55
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,990
He will ask me to kill you by that time.

56
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,150
It's easy to kill me.

57
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,990
Who can stop you now?

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
But it's not that easy to kill Man in White.

59
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,550
I'll give you a chance.

60
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,190
Let me show you

61
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,870
my sincerity in working with me.

62
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,760
What is this?

63
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,460
There's a camp of The Faceless

64
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,430
located ten miles east of the capital.

65
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,220
Man in White's best men

66
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,150
are in the camp.

67
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,670
I prepared a gift.

68
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,470
Please accept it.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,190
You will need it in the future.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,880
Where

71
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,590
did you get this map?

72
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,220
It's not your concern.

73
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,390
The tableware and the food are on the table.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,980
It depends on you whether you want to eat.

75
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,670
Is the food...

76
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,120
poisonous?

77
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,000
You can send someone to verify it first.

78
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,480
It won't be too late to kill me if there's anything wrong.

79
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,370
But let me remind you.

80
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,470
This is a perfect chance to weaken Man in White.

81
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,390
It depends on you whether you can seize it.

82
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,150
Go find out

83
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,390
if there are members of The Faceless there.

84
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,820
Yes.

85
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,270
Commander Mu!

86
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,630
What did you find?

87
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,310
Go empty the princess's chamber pot now.

88
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,790
What?

89
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,040
M-Me?

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,570
But...

91
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,300
I haven't whipped you for a long time, right?

92
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,230
I'll go now.

93
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,950
According to the map,

94
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,560
I really found a camp of The Faceless.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,020
About 50 people are there.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,590
Take a team of the Dragon Cavalry's elite soldiers

97
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,390
to launch a sneak attack now.

98
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,320
Kill all of them.

99
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,870
Remember,

100
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,220
disguise as bandits.

101
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,680
Yes.

102
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,880
[Royal Court]

103
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,630
Mutu,

104
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,390
a camp of The Faceless was attacked.

105
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,510
Do you have anything to do with it?

106
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,570
The Dragon Cavalry

107
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,040
would never take action without my order.

108
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,090
What evidence do you have?

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,440
How dare you slander me!

110
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,490
The Faceless has many enemies.

111
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,970
You were attacked by bandits,

112
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,710
but you're blaming the Dragon Cavalry.

113
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,270
There has been no grudge between The Faceless and bandits.

114
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,030
Why would they do that?

115
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,190
Have you forgotten?

116
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,830
Bandits are thieves,

117
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,510
just like you.

118
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,310
Mutu.

119
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,990
You should know the consequences of deceiving me.

120
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,230
Please allow me to personally investigate if there's anyone

121
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,150
of the Dragon Cavalry missing.

122
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,440
Who do you think you are?

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,190
You want to frame the Dragon Cavalry.

124
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm going to kill you!

125
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,740
Stop arguing!

126
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,170
How many times have I told you?

127
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,190
Longshuang Yueshu, that lowly woman, is still alive!

128
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,110
Instead of figuring out a way to get rid of her,

129
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,350
you're arguing here!

130
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,550
Mutu,

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,490
discipline your men well.

132
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,210
Otherwise, I will take back the Dragon Cavalry!

133
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,830
Yes.

134
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,680
As for The Faceless,

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,840
I'll give you some money as compensation.

136
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,110
Just consider this matter the doing of bandits.

137
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,070
Yes.

138
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,770
I'll take my leave.

139
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,929
Commander Mu, no need to stand on ceremony.

140
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,620
You leave too.

141
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,110
Yes.

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,160
I didn't expect your information to be so accurate.

143
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,420
The Faceless has always been mysterious.

144
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,580
Only Viceroy Long and Man in White

145
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,710
know the locations of the camps.

146
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm very curious.

147
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,070
Princess,

148
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,030
how did you get that map?

149
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,350
Don't ask anything you shouldn't ask.

150
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,090
If I tell you everything,

151
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,860
there won't be any need for us to cooperate.

152
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,560
You have a point.

153
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,550
This is just the beginning,

154
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,070
yet you're so excited.

155
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,230
Then how do you plan to celebrate

156
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,280
the future victories?

157
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,470
Come on. A toast

158
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,330
for the good start.

159
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,570
It's a pleasure working with you.

160
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,270
When I first met you that day,

161
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,870
I thought you were just a weak woman.

162
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,390
But after getting along with you,

163
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,540
I found that you are

164
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,120
quite ambitious.

165
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,470
More surprisingly,

166
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,830
you actually can let bygones be bygones

167
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,090
and become friends with me, who you hate.

168
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,120
Who is your friend?

169
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,590
Although you're sitting here in front of me now,

170
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,870
I still want to kill you.

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,170
But I have no choice.

172
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,160
I need a helper to take the throne back.

173
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,940
I just chose you

174
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,940
over powerless Man in White.

175
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,990
I advise you to know your place.

176
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,960
Our collaboration is for mutual benefits.

177
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,570
After I ascend the throne,

178
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,040
you'll have your cavalries, and I'll have my people.

179
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,630
We'll stay out of each other's way.

180
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,800
I'll give you the fame and wealth you deserve.

181
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,220
But when you should bow your head,

182
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,910
I advise you to do that.

183
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,990
Your words are not pleasant to hear,

184
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,880
but you are right.

185
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,710
Princess,

186
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,070
when should we

187
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
take action next time?

188
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,390
I've asked the Dragon Cavalry to get ready.

189
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,570
We can launch a night attack anytime.

190
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,070
You're already making arrangements for me?

191
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,070
You go back first.

192
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,870
I'll let you know

193
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,930
when the time is right.

194
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,790
Okay.

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,550
You're the boss.

196
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,470
Princess,

197
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,040
goodbye.

198
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,630
San Niang.

199
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,270
Tell Yuan Mo...

200
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,680
Master.

201
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,540
I found this in the carriage.

202
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,140
I didn't see the person who put the letter in it.

203
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,450
[Let's talk in the private room of Quicksand Restaurant tomorrow]

204
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,550
Sir, please.

205
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,220
It's a pity that the explosion last time

206
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,150
didn't kill you.

207
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,170
So you want to kill me here?

208
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,880
I don't have the ability

209
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,110
or the mood.

210
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,260
You can rest assured and sit down.

211
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,430
I want to make a deal with you.

212
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,220
A deal?

213
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,570
You lost elite soldiers.

214
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,880
How are you feeling?

215
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,380
You did it.

216
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,190
I told you.

217
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,460
If I'm that capable,

218
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,950
you would have died long ago.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
Your camp was destroyed by Mutu.

220
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,840
The people in the city are spreading the news.

221
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,770
It's just a camp.

222
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,580
There's nothing to be afraid of.

223
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,220
Really?

224
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,190
You've been the leader of The Faceless in the desert for decades.

225
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,950
You should hate the feeling of failure.

226
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,030
Did you ask me out

227
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,150
just to mock me?

228
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,400
Just cut to the point.

229
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,130
I want to kill Mutu.

230
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,610
Are you interested?

231
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,340
Why?

232
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,680
Do you hold a grudge against him?

233
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,510
I don't.

234
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,650
But the princess does.

235
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,760
Back then, Mutu killed everyone in the village where the princess was.

236
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,090
I promised the princess

237
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,290
I'll help her take revenge.

238
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,300
Good idea.

239
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,720
But I'm not interested.

240
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,620
Goodbye.

241
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,870
Goodbye forever.

242
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,680
What did you say?

243
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,700
Maybe I'll never see you again.

244
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,870
What a pity.

245
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,190
Come on.

246
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
Kill me.

247
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,710
If you kill me, you'll die sooner.

248
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,030
The camps of The Faceless are so hidden.

249
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,790
But Mutu managed to find one.

250
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,950
It means he has gained

251
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,070
very accurate information.

252
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,110
The city is now under the control of the Dragon Cavalry.

253
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,450
Members of The Faceless can't enter the city,

254
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,370
and the news can't be sent out.

255
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,950
It won't take long

256
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,750
for Mutu to destroy your camps

257
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,340
one by one.

258
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,070
In the end, The Faceless

259
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,700
can only be at the mercy of him.

260
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,270
I'm here because I have a way

261
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,710
to get rid of Mutu once and for all.

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,230
But you are pointing a knife at my neck.

263
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,880
Is it appropriate?

264
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,630
The Faceless killed your father.

265
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,750
Why should I believe that you will cooperate with me?

266
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,070
Because you and I both are pitiful guys having no choice.

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,550
When my parents were killed,

268
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,800
I was only six years old.

269
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,440
Come to think of it,

270
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,990
you were

271
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,120
only seven or eight years old at that time.

272
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,430
I believe you killed my parents

273
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,280
and joined The Faceless

274
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,440
because you had no choice.

275
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,020
Because no one is born evil.

276
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,080
You just wanted to survive.

277
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,580
Xiao'e told me about you.

278
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,960
You wandered around in the desert.

279
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,270
I lost my parents.

280
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,030
The root cause

281
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,550
is the rebellion started by Long Tuqi.

282
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,940
It disrupted the former peace.

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,280
Long Tuqi

284
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,950
is our common enemy.

285
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,580
You said

286
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,940
you want to make a deal.

287
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,510
Kill Mutu.

288
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,230
It's very simple.

289
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,980
You just need to do one thing for me.

290
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,630
Grain?

291
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,810
You all have grain?

292
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,839
Yes.

293
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,829
Yes.

294
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,329
It's Princess Longshuang.

295
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,760
It's Princess Longshuang!

296
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,220
The grain must be from Princess Longshuang.

297
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,820
Since she's back,

298
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,590
our lives will be easier.

299
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,460
Yes.

300
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,470
Yes. Our lives will be easier!

301
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,410
I asked you to guard the granary, but look what happened!

302
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,200
The granary?

303
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,450
What happened to the granary?

304
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,600
Early this morning,

305
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,950
every family in the capital received government grain.

306
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,850
Now everyone in the city is saying God bless Princess Longshuang.

307
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,140
As the commander of the Dragon Cavalry,

308
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,100
you don't know?

309
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Viceroy Long,

310
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,910
I've been keeping an eye on the princess in Princess's Mansion these days.

311
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,640
I really don't know about this.

312
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,160
I have never ordered anyone

313
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,270
to open the granary to distribute grain.

314
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,530
I guess my subordinates opened the granary behind my back.

315
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,270
I failed to discipline them well.

316
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,270
Please punish me.

317
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,990
The Faceless was attacked last time.

318
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,320
You said bandits did it.

319
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,230
This time,

320
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,890
you want your subordinates to be the scapegoat.

321
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,800
Impressive.

322
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,920
Viceroy asked you to keep an eye on the princess.

323
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,550
You really are dedicated.

324
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,550
You don't even know the granary was robbed.

325
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,490
How can we believe you?

326
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,550
Now the person who wants to distribute grain the most in the city

327
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,060
is Princess Longshuang.

328
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,080
You've been keeping an eye on her for a long time.

329
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,730
Could it be...

330
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,000
she has persuaded you to support her?

331
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,310
He's slandering me.

332
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,670
I'm the commander of the Dragon Cavalry.

333
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,670
Why would I surrender to that bitch?

334
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,230
Viceroy Long,

335
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,100
I have something important to tell you.

336
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,470
Go ahead.

337
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,230
I saw with my own eyes

338
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,070
Commander Mu delivered a lot of gifts...

339
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,090
to Princess's Mansion a few days ago.

340
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,590
Mutu.

341
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,410
Is that true?

342
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,690
I wanted to bribe that bitch.

343
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,790
Commander Mu,

344
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,250
the situation will get worse if you continue to lie.

345
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,230
According to my observation,

346
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,760
recently, Commander Mu...

347
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,230
has changed his attitude towards Princess Longshuang.

348
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,030
He asked about her health and...

349
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,820
and often stayed in the princess's room

350
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,040
to drink and chat.

351
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,830
He's totally different from how he was before.

352
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,360
Everyone in Princess's Mansion can prove it.

353
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,750
I think it's strange,

354
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,600
so I came to tell you the truth.

355
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Viceroy Long, w-when you punish me,

356
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,180
please show mercy.

357
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,920
Bastard!

358
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
-Enough!
-You...

359
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,910
Mutu,

360
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,490
I'll only ask you one thing.

361
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,800
Did that bitch ask you

362
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,360
to open the granary and distribute grain?

363
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,030
He did it.

364
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,160
He set me up.

365
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,300
I launched a sneak attack on his camp,

366
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
so he set a trap to take revenge on me!

367
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,680
So it wasn't bandits who launched a sneak attack on my camp.

368
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:19,930
Guards!

369
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,880
Viceroy.

370
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,270
-Viceroy, it's not like that.
-Take him away!

371
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,790
-Viceroy.
-Put him in jail!

372
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,910
That's not true!

373
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,820
Viceroy, please spare my life!

374
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,020
I'm innocent!

375
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,630
Ah Bili.

376
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,920
You leave too.

377
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,150
Viceroy Long, thank you for not punishing me.

378
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,840
Viceroy Long,

379
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,640
I want to personally interrogate Mutu.

380
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Give me one night.

381
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,080
I will find out the truth about the grain distribution.

382
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,310
Okay.

383
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,980
He passed out.

384
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,830
Can't you see?

385
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,280
Commander Mu, why are you so stubborn?

386
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,850
Tell me the truth as soon as possible,

387
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
so that I can report to Viceroy Long.

388
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,020
I was careless and fell into your trap.

389
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,090
I wouldn't call it a trap.

390
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,570
Put the saddle on the right horse.

391
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm helping you relieve your pain.

392
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,790
If you had told me earlier

393
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,000
who ordered you to open the granary secretly,

394
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,230
I wouldn't have been so cruel to you.

395
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,270
It was you.

396
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,210
You secretly opened the granary.

397
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,870
Why are you so stubborn?

398
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,170
I confess!

399
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,570
I confess.

400
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,200
That bitch,

401
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,500
Princess Longshuang Yueshu, forced me to distribute grain.

402
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,090
Commander Mu,

403
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,830
do you know why

404
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,150
you end up like this?

405
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,870
Because you're stupid.

406
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,030
Since we both work for Viceroy Long,

407
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,580
let me teach you.

408
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,770
If you say the princess ordered you to do that,

409
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,670
you'll be sentenced to death for betraying Viceroy Long.

410
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,230
But if someone bribed you

411
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,220
and asked you to open the granary,

412
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,910
the matter's nature will be different.

413
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,000
Maybe Viceroy Long will show mercy

414
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,160
and spare your life.

415
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,230
You mean...

416
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,610
someone from Yong State?

417
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,590
Who?

418
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,110
Give me a name.

419
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,910
The Sifang Envoy,

420
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,030
Yuan Mo.

421
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,780
You mean

422
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,330
Yuan Mo, Yong State's Sifang Envoy,

423
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,820
couldn't bear to see some people of Yanle suffering from the shortage of clothes and food,

424
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,760
so he bribed you with a large sum of money and asked you to open the granary secretly

425
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,070
to distribute grain to them.

426
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,670
Yes or no?

427
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,270
Yes.

428
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,020
But I didn't receive bribes.

429
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,370
Don't worry about this.

430
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,660
You just need to tell me

431
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,880
if there really is a sum of money,

432
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
where would you put it?

433
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,370
If there...

434
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,030
really is a sum of money,

435
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,290
of course I'd put it...

436
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,270
in the basement of the backyard.

437
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:03,930
Okay.

438
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,540
Very good. Very honest.

439
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,470
Look.

440
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,230
You'll find a way out

441
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,350
if you view things

442
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,080
from a different perspective.

443
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,370
I'm really doing my best to help you.

444
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,950
You were a prestigious commander.

445
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,710
These subordinates don't want

446
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,550
to see you end up with the punishment

447
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,080
of the nine familial exterminations either.

448
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,830
Right?

449
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,590
Commander Mu.

450
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,940
Stamp your fingerprint and you can be free.

451
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,390
Release me now.

452
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,410
What?

453
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,480
Release me.

454
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,200
I told you

455
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,330
you're free.

456
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Everyone in this world suffers.

457
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,780
Only ghosts can be free.

458
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,460
You did a good job.

459
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,270
My Lord,

460
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Commander Mu always

461
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
beat or cursed us.

462
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,940
I... I'm a lowly person,

463
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,380
but I couldn't stand it either.

464
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,750
I had no choice but to...

465
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,980
To betray him.

466
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,340
This is not betrayal.

467
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,200
This is called turning over a new leaf.

468
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,810
Work for me from now on.

469
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
I won't treat you poorly.

470
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,790
Yes!

471
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,540
I'm willing to serve you.

472
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,870
I will do my best!

473
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,390
Ah Shilan,

474
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,290
I fulfilled my promise to you.

475
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,460
I finally killed Mutu

476
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,160
and avenged everyone in the village.

477
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,220
This is the money found in the basement

478
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,600
of Mutu's backyard after interrogating him last night.

479
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,750
We were wrong.

480
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,380
[The 20th year of Anping]

481
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,900
The real mastermind

482
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,280
is Yuan Mo, Yong State's Sifang Envoy.

483
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,790
These are the physical evidence.

484
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,630
Mutu...

485
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,990
was the witness.

486
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,230
He had been through a lot with me all these years.

487
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,260
I treated him well.

488
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,270
But he colluded with Yuan Mo and betrayed me

489
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,300
for such little money.

490
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,820
Maybe he committed suicide because he felt

491
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,990
too ashamed to face you.

492
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,580
Enough.

493
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,030
Don't mention this matter again.

494
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,560
Viceroy,

495
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,070
Yong State's Sifang Envoy

496
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,740
openly interfered with Yanle's court affairs,

497
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,740
bribed an official, and disturbed our people's lives.

498
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,380
Viceroy,

499
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,850
we can't let him off easily.

500
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,050
Yuan Mo.

501
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,350
In my opinion,

502
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
we should seal the Yong Embassy now

503
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,220
and arrest Yuan Mo.

504
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,120
No hurry.

505
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,190
He can't escape.

506
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,660
Right now, the Dragon Cavalry in the capital lacks a leader.

507
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,410
We should stabilize the morale first.

508
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,750
You made a great contribution by finding out the traitor.

509
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,580
What reward do you want?

510
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,770
I dare not ask for any reward.

511
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,370
I just want... to serve you aboveboard.

512
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,150
What do you mean by aboveboard?

513
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,940
I've led The Faceless as bandits for many years.

514
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,860
I've been tired of wandering in different states,

515
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,980
being despised, and hiding.

516
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,800
All these years, I've been loyal to you.

517
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,320
I found that you're very bold and resolute.

518
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,490
I'm willing to do anything for you in the future.

519
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,090
I just hope you can grant me a position,

520
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,730
so that I can prove my worth

521
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,450
in the royal court.

522
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,410
You have a point.

523
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,900
I admire your resourcefulness very much.

524
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,360
Now that Mutu is dead,

525
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,350
I'll let you lead the Dragon Cavalry.

526
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,310
What do you think?

527
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,870
The Dragon Cavalry should only be loyal to you.

528
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,510
Except you, no one else in Yanle

529
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,950
is qualified to lead the Dragon Cavalry.

530
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,850
Besides, I don't have the ability to lead an army.

531
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,610
I just hope

532
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,790
you can allow the remnants of The Faceless to enter the city

533
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,050
and be your bodyguards

534
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
to protect you every day.

535
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,550
In this way, we won't need to wander around

536
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,550
and we won't be considered as bandits anymore.

537
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,110
Since you want to serve me

538
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,070
aboveboard,

539
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,520
I appoint you as the Capital Governor.

540
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,850
You can go to the court to discuss with the officials.

541
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,330
The remnants of The Faceless can be free

542
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,640
to enter or exit the capital from today onwards.

543
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,300
They are at your disposal.

544
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Thank you, Viceroy Long.

545
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,710
[Yong Embassy]

546
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,430
Mutu deserved it.

547
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,020
Ah Shu has fulfilled her wish.

548
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,270
I know you're always full of ideas.

549
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,710
But I didn't expect that

550
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,170
you managed to make Man in White work for you.

551
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,460
People like Man in White

552
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,620
don't have principles. They only care about benefits.

553
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,770
As long as the price offered is attractive enough,

554
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,500
he won't care who he works with.

555
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,000
Bad news, Sifang Envoy!

556
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,490
Man in White and his men have surrounded the Yong Embassy.

557
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,450
Stop!

558
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,390
Stop!

559
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,790
Stop right there!

560
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,750
After him!

561
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,580
Why did you break into the Yong Embassy

562
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,250
with so many people?

563
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,290
Yuan Mo, Yong State's Sifang Envoy,

564
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,000
you bribed Mutu, the commander of the Dragon Cavalry, with a large sum of money

565
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,830
and asked him to open the granary secretly. You violated Yanle's law.

566
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,630
Under the order of Viceroy Long,

567
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,370
I'm here to arrest you and put you in prison for interrogations.

568
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,550
He who has a mind to beat his dog

569
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,080
will easily find his stick.

570
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,300
The Yong Embassy had been uninhabited for a long time.

571
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,380
It smelt of mildew.

572
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Finally, you guys came to live here.

573
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,630
But now, it's going to be closed again.

574
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,520
Yuan Mo,

575
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,380
did it occur to you that this would happen

576
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,850
when you came to me for cooperation?

577
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,360
You planned this

578
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,150
long ago, right?

579
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,470
I just played it by ear.

580
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,910
What a pity. You think you're smart.

581
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,840
You actually wanted me to help you.

582
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,950
You thought I would

583
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,590
get rid of Mutu as planned

584
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,710
and then be at your disposal.

585
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,980
The purpose of your trip

586
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,380
is not to get rid of Mutu.

587
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,460
Your targets are me,

588
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,610
Viceroy Long,

589
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,350
and Yanle's royal court.

590
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,870
You're the winner.

591
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,980
Whatever you say is right.

592
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,070
Guards.

593
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,910
Yes!

594
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,030
He works for you?

595
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,280
Put everyone in the Yong Embassy in jail.

596
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,890
They'll be punished later.

597
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,650
Stop!

598
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,950
I am Yong's Sifang Envoy.

599
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,920
Your behavior today

600
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,650
shows Yanle's disrespect to Yong.

601
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,090
Yong will not sit by and do nothing.

602
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Yuan Mo,

603
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,139
you're finally on the same path as your father.

604
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,030
You like to meddle

605
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,489
in Yanle's affairs like your father, right?

606
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,960
Let's just

607
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,480
bury them in Yanle's sand.

608
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,440
Viceroy,

609
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,620
Yuan Mo can't die yet.

610
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,000
Why?

611
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,070
Yuan Mo and Longshuang Yueshu love each other.

612
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,800
If we keep Yuan Mo as a hostage,

613
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:29,710
Longshuang Yueshu will do anything you say.

614
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,070
In the name of Longshuang Yueshu,

615
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,340
you can gather the people.

616
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,650
Then you can make her announce in public

617
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,210
that she's willing to rule Yanle with you

618
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,679
and make her ask the people to submit to you.

619
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,219
We can kill him

620
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,889
when the time is right.

621
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,360
That's exactly what I want.

622
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,489
Draft a document

623
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,409
and ask that lowly woman to memorize every word.

624
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:52,830
Yes.

625
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,960
Move.

626
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
I said move!

627
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,430
Soldiers of the Dragon Cavalry, listen up.

628
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,560
All of you, retreat.

629
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Yes.

630
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,830
What did you do to Yuan Mo?

631
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,120
Don't worry.

632
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,510
He'll live.

633
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,190
I can't believe the leader of The Faceless

634
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,520
has become the Capital Governor of Yanle.

635
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,030
Is there still law?

636
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,390
I should thank you for this.

637
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,580
If you hadn't come up with the idea of cooperating with Mutu

638
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,900
and hadn't asked Yuan Mo to contact me secretly,

639
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,480
I wouldn't have been able

640
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,740
to get rid of Mutu within such a short time

641
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,040
or put Yuan Mo in prison.

642
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,150
Yuan Mo is Yong State's Sifang Envoy.

643
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,280
He represents Yong.

644
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,200
Imprisoning Yuan Mo is equivalent to declaring war on Yong State!

645
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,390
So what?

646
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,100
Yong State is hundreds of miles away.

647
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,830
Even if they dare to attack us,

648
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,990
they'll be exhausted when they arrive.

649
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,790
I'll wait at ease for their exhausted army.

650
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,990
I'm sure they can't go back.

651
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,230
You're provoking Yong State for no reason.

652
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,860
You even want to start a war.

653
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,310
You're crueller than Long Tuqi!

654
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,090
Yes.

655
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,720
I'm cruel.

656
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,550
And now, I'm going to make Yuan Mo know

657
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,660
how cruel I am.

658
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,280
No.

659
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,900
What?

660
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,590
You don't want him to get hurt?

661
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,120
Don't hurt Yuan Mo.

662
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,590
I can promise you not to hurt him.

663
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,100
But before that,

664
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,560
you have to do something for me.

665
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,460
Why is Long Tuqi here?

666
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,750
So many people.

667
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,830
So many people.

668
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,490
Yes.

669
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,410
Silence, everyone!

670
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,700
Viceroy Long, please.

671
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,790
Citizens of Yanle,

672
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,230
I know

673
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,490
you've misunderstood me

674
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,240
all these years.

675
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,130
But for Yanle, I bit the bullet.

676
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,120
I've never defended myself.

677
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,250
Now, thanks to the late lord's blessing,

678
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,950
we've finally

679
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,980
taken back Princess Longshuang,

680
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,070
who had been missing for years.

681
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,460
Today, the princess is going to

682
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,270
explain to you and clear the misunderstanding.

683
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,710
Yuan Mo's life depends on you.

684
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,570
Princess, please.

685
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,630
Citizens of Yanle,

686
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,310
I am Longshuang Yueshu, the daughter of the late lord.

687
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,400
Since the establishment of Yanle,

688
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,560
Yanle's royal family

689
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,140
has seen 18 generations.

690
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,550
There's a rumor that

691
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,910
I'm the only one left in Yanle's royal family

692
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,020
and the royal bloodline is on the brink of extinction.

693
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,300
As the saying goes, life is unpredictable,

694
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,360
and those with virtue shall prevail.

695
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,410
It's not easy to govern the state.

696
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,570
Only by choosing someone virtuous and capable

697
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,480
to rule Yanle with me

698
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,340
can Yanle thrive again.

699
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,910
Ridiculous.

700
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,320
These words of extreme disloyalty

701
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,140
are from this rebel.

702
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,910
Long Tuqi slaughtered members of the royal family,

703
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,310
killed loyal officials,

704
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,820
and oppressed the people!

705
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,110
He's not moral

706
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,510
or virtuous!

707
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,600
How dare you!

708
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,620
Guards! Drag her away!

709
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,750
Drag her away!

710
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,860
He doesn't deserve to rule Yanle.

711
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,830
Citizens of Yanle,

712
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,600
if Long Tuqi stays alive,

713
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,460
we can never live a peaceful life.

714
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,420
Am I right?

715
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,660
-Yes!
-Yes!

716
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,940
Overthrow Long Tuqi!

717
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,840
How dare you!

718
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you trying to start a rebellion?

719
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,620
-Murder!
-Murder!

720
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,680
Long Tuqi is dead.

721
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,510
Murder!

722
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,630
Long Tuqi...

723
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,340
Long Tuqi is dead.

724
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,730
Long Tuqi is dead.

725
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,190
The rebel, Long Tuqi, is dead.

726
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,810
Drop your weapons if you want to live.

727
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,900
Citizens of Yanle,

728
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,030
sorry for startling you.

729
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,650
I killed this rebel

730
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,070
in front of everyone

731
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,270
for Yanle's royal family.

732
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,500
I did it to end the oppression in Yanle

733
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,860
and restore Yanle to its rightful order.

734
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,520
He's right.

735
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,150
Golden seals. Two golden seals.

736
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,840
Why are there two golden seals?

737
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,170
They both have a golden seal.

738
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,780
I am the son of the late lord

739
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,880
and Princess Longshuang's elder brother,

740
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,090
Longshuang Xiuduo.

741
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,080
Is that true?

742
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,240
He's the prince?

743
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,780
I grew up in a courtyard outside the royal court.

744
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,530
But in my body,

745
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,910
I have the blood of the royal family.

746
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,500
Today, we enforced justice on behalf of Heaven.

747
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,270
We avenged our father

748
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,930
and killed the evil man for the people.

749
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,060
From today onwards,

750
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,120
Yanle will be ruled by the royal family again.

751
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,700
I, Longshuang Xiuduo,

752
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,830
will help my sister, Longshuang Yueshu,

753
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,310
rule Yanle again

754
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,710
and make your lives better.

755
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,240
We'll do our best for Yanle's peace

756
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,120
and prosperity.

757
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:44,870
-Great!
-Great!

758
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,140
You shouldn't sit there.

759
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,120
I'm the only man left in the Longshuang family.

760
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,740
I am more qualified to sit here than you.

761
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,930
I checked the royal family tree.

762
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,260
Your name is not on it.

763
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,050
It's just a name.

764
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,030
I'll ask someone to add my name.

765
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,520
And it will be added before your name.

766
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,280
According to the etiquette of Yanle,

767
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,900
you're not qualified to be included in the royal family tree.

768
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,830
Why?

769
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,500
We both are Father's descendants.

770
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,930
I am your elder brother.

771
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,130
Why can't I?

772
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,630
Your mother was the Yue Clan's princess,

773
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,770
but my mother was a maid in the palace.

774
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,970
You were the apple of Father's eye from the moment you were born.

775
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,460
He cared about you so much.

776
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,790
But I was exiled.

777
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,540
I can't even be included in the royal family tree!

778
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,640
I don't believe it.

779
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,970
I can change

780
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,500
the royal family tree as I like.

781
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,970
God bless the lord!

782
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,240
We both are Father's descendants.

783
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,390
Just because of our different backgrounds,

784
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,390
our identities and lives were completely different.

785
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,850
When I saw the flower carriage,

786
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,190
I told myself that one day,

787
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,720
I'll sit in that flower carriage

788
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,870
and make everyone in Yanle see me.

789
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,520
For this,

790
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,800
I have endured hardships for 20 years.

791
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,390
Now,

792
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,380
no one can stop us anymore.

793
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,520
Ah Shu.

794
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,420
You did so many bad things

795
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,860
and killed so many people

796
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,270
just for this?

797
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,100
As long as I can achieve my goal,

798
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,750
killing a few people is nothing.

799
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,490
I'm very grateful that God made me become a member of The Faceless.

800
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,940
But you grew up in the courtyard in the capital.

801
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,340
How did you join The Faceless?

802
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,940
At that time, you were just over a month old.

803
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,110
Long Tuqi started a rebellion and hunted for members

804
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,910
of the royal family everywhere.

805
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,450
I went through a lot to have a narrow escape.

806
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,070
Who's there?

807
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,720
Show yourself!

808
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,720
Have you seen a couple riding horseback?

809
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,990
Tell me

810
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,250
and I'll make you a member of The Faceless.

811
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,070
Come.

812
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,870
You found them.

813
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,170
You do it.

814
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:13,420
You actually...

815
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,670
If it were not you in his arms,

816
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,510
maybe

817
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,520
I wouldn't have told The Faceless his whereabouts.

818
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,280
But he swapped you.

819
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,870
That's why you survived.

820
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,650
You didn't want me to live.

821
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:34,950
But this is also good now.

822
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,990
You can win people's support for me.

823
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,180
It can save me a lot of trouble.

824
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,050
Speaking of winning people's support,

825
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,600
you told Ah Shilan you're the prince, right?

826
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,530
That's why she believed

827
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,950
you would take revenge for her.

828
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,590
That's why she worked for you so devotedly!

829
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,390
I fulfilled my promise.

830
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,330
You didn't do it for Ah Shilan!

831
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,470
You killed Long Tuqi for your own selfish desire.

832
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,350
You killed him because you want to become Yanle's lord!

833
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,650
So what?

834
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,890
The result is the same.

835
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,340
What's important is that Long Tuqi is dead!

836
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,880
No one can stop me.

837
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,910
Now that you have taken control of Yanle

838
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,670
and got everything you want,

839
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,870
I only have one request.

840
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,240
Can you let Yuan Mo go?

841
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,520
Let him go back to Yong with the delegation.

842
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:50,670
I'll stay

843
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,190
as a hostage.

844
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,090
He's the one you love.

845
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,190
How can I imprison him forever?
