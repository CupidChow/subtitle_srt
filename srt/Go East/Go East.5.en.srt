[Go East]

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,690
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,009
Mr. Yu,

5
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,840
I need your help for something.

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
Okay.

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,240
As long as the case can be closed as soon as possible,

8
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,200
go ahead.

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,360
The murderer has been confirmed,

10
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,310
but the motive is still unclear.

11
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,750
To be on the safe side,

12
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,260
the Jingzhao Prefecture temporarily restored everyone's freedom.

13
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,490
First, so we can keep an eye on the murderer this way.

14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,580
Second, so I can ask you

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,410
about the reasons and consequences of Wei Yunqi's rebellion case back then.

16
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,750
Wei Yunqi?

17
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,350
Is this case closely related to him?

18
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,710
Very.

19
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,160
What a coincidence.

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,300
I didn't expect to meet you two here.

21
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,160
The Governor has just died,

22
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,500
yet you're already in such a good mood

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,950
and came to listen to music at Ruyi Pavilion?

24
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,870
As you all know,

25
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,190
there has been a major incident in my family recently.

26
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,829
I felt depressed,

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,470
so I came here to listen to music and relieve my sorrows.

28
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,120
I still have a lot to deal with at home.

29
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,040
I shall take my leave.

30
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,870
Butler Jiang,

31
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,490
since you're here,

32
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,040
have some tea before you go.

33
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,480
Unfortunately,

34
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,210
I'm not feeling well today.

35
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,170
I'm afraid I can't entertain you.

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,150
Please leave.

37
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,070
Ms. Hua,

38
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,990
why are you in such a hurry to kick us out?

39
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,030
Feeling guilty?

40
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,270
What do you mean?

41
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,290
Are you suspecting me?

42
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,240
He's not suspecting you.

43
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,520
He's saying that you and him,

44
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,630
both of you are the murderers.

45
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,050
What you said is really interesting.

46
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,860
Butler Jiang and I were in our room all night.

47
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,990
How could we kill someone?

48
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,460
Could it be that we could clone ourselves?

49
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,260
You don't need clones.

50
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,550
You just need a secret passage.

51
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,660
Doesn't there happen to be one in the pavilion?

52
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,780
It's a coincidence.

53
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,960
I was just lucky.

54
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,680
When the underground tunnel's floor was moved,

55
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,370
this leaf happened to have fallen down.

56
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,830
We followed this leaf

57
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,779
and found the secret passage.

58
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,720
We surveyed along the secret passage.

59
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,760
The exit on the other end

60
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,450
was inside the guest room you stayed in that night.

61
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,830
Let me show you a magic trick.

62
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,210
Watch carefully.

63
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,470
This was what happened that night.

64
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,870
From the moment I fell,

65
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,830
what you saw was no longer me,

66
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,430
but it.

67
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,320
This was what we discovered in the secret tunnel.

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
It's the puppet you used that night.

69
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,470
This puppet's body looks similar to

70
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,400
Butler Jiang's.

71
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,590
Butler Jiang,

72
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,670
you were in charge of arranging the guests' rooms.

73
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,030
That night, you were also the one who asked

74
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,960
to keep an eye on Ms. Hua in her room.

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,110
You put the prepared puppet in the guest room

76
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,690
and hid in the secret passage afterward.

77
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,250
It's flawless.

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,850
What else do you have to say?

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,159
That's right.

80
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,830
I killed him.

81
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,230
It has nothing to do with Ms. Hua.

82
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,230
She was threatened by me.

83
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,830
She didn't dare to report me.

84
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,100
You finally admit it.

85
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,480
Unfortunately,

86
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,130
you didn't tell the truth.

87
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,550
When Cao Huo died,

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,560
I noticed your reaction was abnormal.

89
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,030
If I'm not mistaken,

90
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,230
you have blood-induced dizziness.

91
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,470
So it's impossible for you

92
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,530
to have killed the Governor alone and leave unscathed.

93
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,159
The only explanation is

94
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,430
you were covering for the murderer.

95
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,170
And the real murderer...

96
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,580
No, it's not her.

97
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,620
I killed the man.

98
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,790
She was playing the pipa all night.

99
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,200
Everyone heard it.

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,150
You could've been the one playing the pipa.

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,409
Jiang,

102
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,730
I appreciate your kindness.

103
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,120
Yes, I killed Dou Chun.

104
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,900
That night, I sneaked into Mid-lake Pavilion through the secret passage.

105
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,940
Dou Chun drank the wine that Jiang drugged in advance

106
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,560
and fell into deep slumber.

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
I raised my dagger and stabbed him hard.

108
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,190
General,

109
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,190
Madam,

110
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,880
Ruomei,

111
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,330
I've finally avenged you.

112
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,190
We asked Mr. Yu to review the files.

113
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,800
You're the qin master who taught in Wei's Mansion before, right?

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,270
Yes.

115
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,180
It's understandable for Ms. Hua to avenge the Wei family.

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,630
Then why did Butler Jiang do this?

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,980
Before I worked with Dou Chun,

118
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,830
I was a servant of the Wei's Mansion.

119
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,670
The missing armory case happened at that time.

120
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,630
General Wei was investigating in private

121
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,960
and found that this case

122
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,550
was very likely related to Dou Chun.

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,910
One day,

124
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,620
Cao Huo, who was Dou Chun's deputy at the time,

125
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,640
stole a secret letter from me

126
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,570
that a colleague gave General Wei.

127
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,850
That letter recorded the amount of weapons.

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
In order to protect himself,

129
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,570
Dou Chun used this letter as incriminating evidence

130
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,860
[Ten years ago, Dou Chun's military tent]

131
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,290
and framed General Wei for rebellion.

132
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,160
Who gave you this letter?

133
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,320
The content of the letter was fabricated to frame me.

134
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,950
I'm not afraid of death.

135
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,370
[General Wei Yunqi]

136
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,150
Go ahead.

137
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,070
Okay.

138
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,590
Cao Huo,

139
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,220
fulfill his wish.

140
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,600
He executed Wei Yunqi

141
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,050
without the court's approval

142
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,540
and seized the Wei family.

143
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,210
[Wei Ruomei, daughter of Wei Yunqi]

144
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,110
Madam Wei heard that her husband and son had died.

145
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,710
Mother!

146
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,510
She committed suicide.

147
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,320
Mother!

148
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,670
Daughter Wei Ruomei...

149
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,570
Let go of me!

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,310
Even the servants of the committee and the qin master of Wei's Mansion...

151
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,390
You will die a horrible death.

152
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,590
-were also implicated.
-Take her away.

153
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,390
In order to take revenge,

154
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,670
I pretended to sell my master out for glory.

155
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,270
I worked hard to flatter Dou Chun.

156
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,310
It took me ten years

157
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,790
to gain his trust

158
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,230
and became the butler of Dou's Mansion.

159
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,640
Dou Chun, Cao Huo...

160
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,170
Shouldn't people like them die?

161
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,370
Shouldn't people like them be killed?

162
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,850
These people have done many bad things,

163
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,780
yet they enjoyed wealth and glory.

164
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,060
General Wei's entire family was killed

165
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,550
because of these people!

166
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,070
Where is the justice?

167
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,870
So you decided to join hands.

168
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,560
You rejected Ji's recommendation

169
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,720
and chose a house with a secret tunnel.

170
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,350
Then, as the butler,

171
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,480
you enticed Cao Huo to use the Soul-restoring Incense as a gift.

172
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,590
Then you used Cao Huo's trait of not liking the heat

173
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,320
and gifted him ice mixed with Dragon Scale Grass.

174
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,750
Everything was planned perfectly.

175
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,480
Cao Huo would kill Dou Chun in public

176
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,790
and get executed for murder.

177
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,990
But unexpectedly,

178
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,640
Dou Chun killed Cao Huo instead,

179
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,590
so you had to carry out the second plan.

180
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,840
You went to the Mid-lake Island through the secret passage in your room

181
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,840
and killed Dou Chun.

182
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,000
You're right.

183
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,670
So what?

184
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,670
We took revenge.

185
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,850
We planned to leave unscathed

186
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,920
after our plan was completed.

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,830
But now, it seems

188
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,170
it will be impossible.

189
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,390
I have something

190
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,460
to ask of Yuan Mo and Retainer Wang.

191
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,830
Clear the Wei family's name.

192
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Please clear the Wei family's name.

193
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,450
Please get up.

194
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,280
Please get up.

195
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,140
Sorry.

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,190
We can't agree.

197
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,070
Mr. Tan is here!

198
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,910
Assistant Minister Tan.

199
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,810
Yuan and Retainer Wang,

200
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,150
please forgive me for coming uninvited.

201
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,560
I've been following this case.

202
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,170
I heard you caught the real culprit.

203
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,400
Leave this case to me.

204
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,270
Guards!

205
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,950
-Yes.
-Yes.

206
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,090
Take the criminals away.

207
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,750
-Yes.
-Yes.

208
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,910
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

209
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,690
Dou Chun committed such a serious crime.

210
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,490
He kept it a secret for ten years.

211
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,960
If it weren't for Jiang Wu and Ms. Hua,

212
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,790
Dou Chun would have continued keeping it a secret.

213
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,580
How ridiculous!

214
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,550
They killed Dou Chun.

215
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,870
They are heroes.

216
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,110
How could they be treated as criminals?

217
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,250
It's a fact that they also committed murder and broke the law.

218
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,370
We can't let it slide out of sympathy.

219
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,480
How dare you speak for Dou Chun?

220
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,230
I'm not.

221
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,570
You even refused to clear the Wei family's name.

222
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,230
I really can't help with that.

223
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,470
You just don't want to get yourself into trouble, right?

224
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,270
I helped solve the case and found the murderer,

225
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,350
and it's my fault?

226
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,930
The Wei family's case is not that simple.

227
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,630
Didn't Yu also say

228
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,430
that it's fine not to mention a decade-old case?

229
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,750
Don't blame Mr. Yu.

230
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,150
Don't forget who you are.

231
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,230
Yes, I'm a maid.

232
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,960
But I'm ashamed of being a coward's maid.

233
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:12,870
I'm full.

234
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm done drinking.

235
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,670
You...

236
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,270
Kunwu,

237
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,670
tell me.

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,610
How hard is it for me to make money?

239
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,390
The current case has just been solved.

240
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,390
Now, I have to overturn

241
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,870
a case from 10 years ago?

242
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,470
You offended the masses this time.

243
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,410
Yuchi Hua is also dissatisfied with you.

244
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,400
It's uncertain if you can

245
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
get the money now.

246
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,690
Forget it. I'm done eating.

247
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey.

248
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,260
Do I owe you all something?

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,650
Ji,

250
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,180
investigate a house for me.

251
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,430
No.

252
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,630
Okay.

253
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,080
I'll tell your wife that you keep money

254
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,680
hidden from her every month.

255
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,880
Don't tell her.

256
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,810
Are you going to investigate it or not?

257
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,560
Fine.

258
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,990
Let's go.

259
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,680
Where are you going?

260
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,060
None of your business.

261
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,450
How dare you!

262
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,890
According to the contract,

263
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,860
you have to tell you master if you go out for personal reasons.

264
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
I just added it in.

265
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,020
What if you commit a crime outside?

266
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,420
I'll have to take responsibility for it.

267
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,530
This is to protect the master's rights.

268
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,280
Tell me. Where are you going?

269
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,180
Yuchi is on leave today.

270
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,930
We're going to the West Market.

271
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,950
I thought it'd be something important.

272
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,070
Perfect timing.

273
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,880
I helped her solve a case.

274
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,300
She hasn't given me the money she promised me.

275
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,580
Go get it for me.

276
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,940
Then, I'm not going.

277
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,330
Go get the money yourself.

278
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,740
You're ignoring the old case.

279
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,950
You're cold-blooded and cowardly.

280
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,800
She hates you as much as I do now.

281
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,230
Maybe she's thinking about whipping you.

282
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,090
How about this?

283
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,530
You tell her first

284
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,640
that I'm working on the old case.

285
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,510
Can't do it.

286
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,130
Have you ever thought

287
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,150
that getting the money would be good for you too?

288
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,380
We'd have money to spend.

289
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,940
No.

290
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,440
How about this?

291
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,750
As long as you get the money,

292
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,790
I won't stop you

293
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,920
if you go out with her again.

294
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,520
Never.

295
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,170
Still not going.

296
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,830
The West Market is so expensive.

297
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,360
I have no money to buy stuff.

298
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,330
Money?

299
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,140
Here, take it.

300
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,270
How can I use your money?

301
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,700
Just take it.

302
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,270
As long as you can get the money for the case,

303
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,950
this is nothing.

304
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,080
You're right.

305
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,990
This is nothing.

306
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,060
I understand.

307
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,720
It's still not enough, right?

308
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,970
You can have it all.

309
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,070
You asked me to go.

310
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,350
You forcefully gave me the money.

311
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,990
Alright.

312
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,030
Go now.

313
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,790
Hurry up.

314
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,270
Fighting with me?

315
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,440
My Lady,

316
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,860
let me hold the whip.

317
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,280
It's inappropriate for girls

318
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960
to go shopping with this.

319
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,320
Mr. Huang,

320
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,000
cut to the chase.

321
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,480
You're just afraid that people will think I'm too fiesty

322
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,170
and I won't be able to get married, right?

323
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,610
If I can't get married,

324
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,450
I'll stay with my father forever.

325
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,910
Nonsense.

326
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,670
How can a girl not get married?

327
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,860
If I don't meet someone I love,

328
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,590
I'd rather die alone.

329
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,680
Mr. Huang,

330
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,110
you haven't gotten married either.

331
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,590
My Lady,

332
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,850
why are you

333
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,870
talking about me again?

334
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,930
Thank you, sir.

335
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,220
Yuchi!

336
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,560
Ah Shu!

337
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,830
You're so pretty.

338
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
You're pretty every day.

339
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,990
You're so sweet.

340
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,170
Yuan Mo is really lucky

341
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,310
to have such a sweet maid like you.

342
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,980
I get angry

343
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,590
whenever I think of this.

344
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,530
Do you want to vent your anger?

345
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,190
You have an idea?

346
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,020
That's a good idea.

347
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,480
Mr. Huang?

348
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,720
Please go back to the mansion.

349
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,290
Okay.

350
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,070
[Yuchi's Mansion]

351
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,910
The money is here.

352
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,370
Go ahead.

353
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,090
This is a little beyond expectation.

354
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,140
Ms. Yuchi is too kind.

355
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,030
We agreed on three taels of gold.

356
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:57,790
This...

357
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,590
It's indeed three taels of gold.

358
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,130
Three taels of gold converts to 30,000 copper coins.

359
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,990
My Lady didn't break her promise.

360
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,930
How about this?

361
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,130
I'll get a carriage.

362
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,310
Please help me get those guys

363
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,950
to help me

364
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,480
carry this to the carriage.

365
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,300
Young man,

366
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,990
My Lady said

367
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,540
whoever helps you move the case

368
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
will be whipped.

369
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,450
I'm sure you know her temper.

370
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,220
We can't help you.

371
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,110
Go ahead.

372
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,720
Let's go.

373
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,270
Yuchi Hua.

374
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,290
I knew

375
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,910
it wouldn't be easy to get the money.

376
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,030
Unfortunately, we weren't there.

377
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,560
We didn't see Yuan Mo in such a pathetic state.

378
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,670
No need.

379
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,630
It's so fun just listening to Mr. Huang's description.

380
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,070
He arranged the carriage driver and laborers in advance,

381
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,590
but per your order,

382
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,790
I didn't let them in.

383
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,080
He could only nudge the case out

384
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,220
inch by inch.

385
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,160
It took four hours

386
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,060
to transport the case of copper coins out of the mansion.

387
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,070
He was exhausted.

388
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,080
This is so satisfying.

389
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,770
Ah Shu,

390
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,110
it's all thanks to you.

391
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,840
I'll buy you whatever you like.

392
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,180
No need.

393
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,110
You brought me here to try

394
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,340
all of the rouge.

395
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,940
I'm already very satisfied.

396
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,940
Look.

397
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,610
This smells good.

398
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,070
It smells good.

399
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,520
Let's look over there.

400
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,670
Boss, how much is it?

401
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,220
That much?

402
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,630
I'll give you a discount.

403
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,590
100 wen.

404
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,080
Okay.

405
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,390
Okay.

406
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,360
Is selling rouge this profitable?

407
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,870
Where have you been? Why'd you get back so late?

408
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,870
What happened?

409
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,670
I got set up.

410
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,910
Set up?

411
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,590
Usually, you set others up.

412
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,180
How did you get set up this time?

413
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,590
It must be karma.

414
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,900
You're inhumane.

415
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,830
I'm already in this state.

416
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,300
It's your fault for always threatening me

417
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
with my hidden money.

418
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,440
Why are you here?

419
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,950
Didn't you ask me

420
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,880
to investigate that house for you?

421
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,470
I asked a broker for you.

422
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,460
This house was sold to Dou Chun

423
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,460
through them.

424
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,480
There was no problem with the deal.

425
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,580
But before the deal was made,

426
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,550
an important figure

427
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,350
repeatedly visited this house.

428
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,350
I was right.

429
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,670
It really is him.

430
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,120
My Lord,

431
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,420
Yuan Mo and Wang Kunwu request to see you.

432
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,090
Let them in.

433
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:58,680
Yes.

434
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,830
Greetings, Assistant Minister Tan.

435
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,870
Assistant Minister Tan.

436
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,930
Please have a seat.

437
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,590
To be honest,

438
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,890
we're here for Dou Chun's case.

439
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,110
Aren't the murderers already arrested?

440
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,910
Yes.

441
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,520
But there's something

442
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,820
I still don't understand.

443
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,610
Can you give me some pointers?

444
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,050
What don't you understand?

445
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,960
Jiang Wu lived in the region west of Liupan Mountain for a long time

446
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,550
and came to Changle recently.

447
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,750
How did he coincidentally

448
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,870
find this house with a secret tunnel?

449
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,250
Back then, General Wei was framed

450
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,230
because someone wrote him a secret letter

451
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,580
that exposed Dou Chun.

452
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,290
Who wrote the letter?

453
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,140
I remember you were an official in the region west of Liupan Mountain at that time too.

454
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,620
So, I wanted to ask you

455
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,470
if you know something.

456
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,590
At that time, I was a nobody.

457
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,290
How could I know anything?

458
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,950
This Xiezhi paperweight

459
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,550
is carved so realistically.

460
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,250
The Xiezhi is an ancient magical beast. It symbolizes

461
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,020
distinguishing right from wrong, and being fair and selfless.

462
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,150
Do you use this to reflect on yourself?

463
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,840
This was a gift from a good friend of mine.

464
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,160
It's just a paperweight. There's nothing strange about it.

465
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,390
Coincidentally,

466
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I found the same kind of paperweight

467
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,950
among the relics of your good friend.

468
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,850
Your good friend

469
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,950
was Wei Yunqi.

470
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,750
I did some investigations in private.

471
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,480
I found that before the Governor moved in,

472
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,350
you'd visited

473
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,110
the mansion repeatedly.

474
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,790
With all due respect,

475
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,700
you're an uncorrupted official.

476
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,300
You can't afford such a mansion.

477
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,870
You also took away

478
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,750
Jiang Wu and Ms. Hua as soon as I

479
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,960
found the true murderers.

480
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,890
You said it was for interrogation,

481
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,430
but it was actually to protect the witnesses, right?

482
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,030
So, I had to search through the relics

483
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,560
of General Wei.

484
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,950
Yuan Mo,

485
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,590
you are really smart.

486
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,990
That's right.

487
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,230
I was the one who wrote the secret letter

488
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,070
to General Wei.

489
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,910
I was also the one who arranged for Dou Chun

490
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,280
to move into this mansion.

491
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,320
You know the truth now.

492
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,460
What do you plan on doing?

493
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't plan to do anything.

494
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,750
This is just because

495
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,610
I took 30,000 coins from Yuchi Hua

496
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,560
to help her find out the truth.

497
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,120
That's why I'm here, disturbing you.

498
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,820
You're quite trustworthy with promises.

499
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,190
I don't really care

500
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,590
about keeping promises.

501
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,660
I just didn't want to

502
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,030
let down all these coins.

503
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,940
Yuan Mo,

504
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,750
no wonder they call you a mad genius.

505
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,960
My Lord,

506
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,660
some soldiers are here.

507
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,000
Got it.

508
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,950
Tell them to wait for a moment.

509
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,640
Yes.

510
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,050
Assistant Minister Tan.

511
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,650
Kunwu,

512
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm no longer the assistant minister.

513
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,600
I have one last thing to tell you.

514
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,870
Both of you have sharp eyes.

515
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,680
If you work together,

516
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,900
it will be a blessing for Yong.

517
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,940
Goodbye.

518
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:36,450
[Moon Among the Pines]

519
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,660
[Tan's Mansion]

520
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
How did you know he was

521
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,790
in cahoots with Jiang Wu?

522
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,990
Jiang Wu and Ms. Hua

523
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,600
asked me to clear General Wei's name.

524
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,720
They were very passionate.

525
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,400
But when Assistant Minister Tan took them away,

526
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,920
they were strangely calm.

527
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,430
You know, Assistant Minister Tan is the assistant minister of the Ministry of Personnel.

528
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,510
He's the only one who has the chance and ability

529
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,070
to clear General Wei's name,

530
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,640
but they didn't show any intention

531
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
of pleading to him.

532
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,480
The only explanation is

533
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,150
that they knew Assistant Minister Tan.

534
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,030
They knew

535
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,910
Assistant Minister Tan planned to do this.

536
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,540
What about you?

537
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,190
How did you realize something was wrong with Assistant Minister Tan?

538
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,260
I didn't think there was something wrong.

539
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,390
Last time when we met at Ruyi Pavilion,

540
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,470
I figured out a lot of things while drinking.

541
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,840
He told me I could go to him whenever I ran into trouble.

542
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,900
I wanted to clear General Wei's name,

543
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,230
so I came to him.

544
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,010
I didn't expect him to have planned this for so long.

545
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,600
I have truthfully reported my crime

546
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,600
to the Minister of Justice.

547
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,880
The minister also agreed to my request.

548
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,680
Dou Chun's case and Wei Yunqi's old case

549
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,960
will both be judged impartially.

550
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,510
You were the main writer of the Anping Law.

551
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,720
Everyone knows it.

552
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,330
In the people's heart,

553
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,220
you are the Anping Law,

554
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,880
while the Anping Law

555
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,150
is the foundation of the law of Yong.

556
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,070
If the people find out

557
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,460
that you are a murderer,

558
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,110
the dignity of the Anping Law

559
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,570
will be greatly affected.

560
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,960
The law code that was created with a decade of effort

561
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,360
and achievements through the ages

562
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,430
will become nothing but a name.

563
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,770
You're wrong.

564
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,790
What?

565
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,190
No one

566
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,040
can't demolish the dignity of the Anping Law.

567
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,180
It's not only 12 chapters and 500 clauses of law,

568
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,110
but it also represents the people's will.

569
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,120
Chapters can be changed

570
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,650
and clauses can be deleted,

571
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,190
but the people's will can't be shaken.

572
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,020
Crimes must be punished.

573
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,990
This is an immutable principle.

574
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,370
I know that very well.

575
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,710
How can I deceive myself?

576
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,410
He deliberately didn't plead guilty

577
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,990
just to see how smart I am.

578
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,590
And you

579
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,210
came to see him off, right?

580
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,410
I just didn't expect Assistant Minister Tan

581
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,300
would turn himself in to clear General Wei's name.

582
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,980
A good official who contributed to the country

583
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,430
has fallen.

584
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,990
Not necessarily.

585
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,370
Assistant Minister Tan's confession can shake the court

586
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,970
and spark public discourse.

587
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,310
Only in this way

588
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,590
can the court be made

589
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,790
to reinvestigate Wei Yunqi's rebellion case,

590
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,690
return justice to the Wei family,

591
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,580
protect the dignity of the law,

592
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,480
and comfort the will of the people.

593
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,250
So, do you think

594
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,280
this is beneficial to the country and the people?

595
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,510
The will of the people...

596
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,420
What's wrong?

597
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,870
Assistant Minister Tan said the same thing.

598
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,200
He values you very much.

599
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,330
I hope you won't let him down.

600
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,350
He values me?

601
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,840
For what?

602
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,280
Wang Kunwu,

603
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,790
you haven't explained clearly

604
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,130
about why you went mad last time.

605
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,460
Tell me more.

606
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,240
[Sifang Pavilion]

607
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,090
Colleagues,

608
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,780
Vice Minister An has reported to the court.

609
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,420
Wang Kunwu, retainer of Sifang Pavilion's West Court,

610
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,500
helped investigate the murder

611
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,240
and cleared an old injustice.

612
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,080
It's a great merit.

613
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,150
The Ministry of Rites specially granted him 10 taels of silver as a reward.

614
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,560
Retainer Wang, come forward now.

615
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,100
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

616
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,790
Great! Great!

617
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,830
The West Court

618
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,830
has gained pride with the Ministry of Rites this time.

619
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Of course,

620
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,140
the colleagues of the East Court also made contributions.

621
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,160
Especially Retainer An Xiuyi,

622
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,850
who guarded Dou's Mansion tirelessly day and night

623
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,450
and prevented more murders from happening.

624
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,880
This is your reward.

625
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,370
Sir,

626
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,110
I'm flattered.

627
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,970
Retainer An, you deserve it.

628
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,260
Everyone, please keep up the good work.

629
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,560
This can be considered a merit?

630
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,600
I've never heard of having someone die on their watch

631
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,680
be counted as a merit.

632
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,270
Yeah.

633
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,860
What are you talking about?

634
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,990
Nothing.

635
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,970
I just can't stand some people

636
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,510
who have the nerve to take credit despite messing up.

637
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,590
Say that again?

638
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,710
Why can't I say it again?

639
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,670
What's wrong?

640
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,950
Are you crazy?

641
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,150
You're proud of this?

642
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,530
What are you doing?

643
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,950
This is a celebration party. Why do you have to do this?

644
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,410

645
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,160

-Yes.
-Yes.

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,000
listen carefully.

649
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,810
Don't blame others

650
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,950
for looking down on you if you're unskilled.

651
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,490

654
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,550
Congratulations, Retainer Wang.

655
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,960
From now on, let's wait and see.

656
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,990
Thank you, Retainer An.

657
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,120
The West Court will always be waiting.

658
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,910
Admit that you're not as good as the West Court.

659
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,970
Everyone has worked hard these days.

660
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,990
Everyone has a share of these ten taels of silver.

661
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,310
This is not appropriate.

662
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,110
This is our duty.

663
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,760
You don't want it? Okay.

664
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,470
I want it.

Let's go!

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,330
Ji, don't run!

667
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,690
Ji, wait for me!

668

keep one of the certificates?

After all, it's an honor from the Ministry of Rites.

672
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,910
Keep what?

673
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,700
We rely on real skills.

674
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,750
Our achievements are in our hearts.

675
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,170
What's the use of these false titles?

676
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,110
Then this certificate...

677
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,910
Just like before. Throw it away.

Since the case of Governor's murder has been solved,

683
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,310
can we release the foreign merchant suspect

684
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,310
we caught before?

685
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,620
Foreign merchant?

686
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,140
What foreign merchant?

687
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,630
Can anyone give me some water?

When did you come in?

694
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,110
I came long ago.

695
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,870
Usually, you smell the fragrance of wine

696
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,510
and come out before I even arrive at the door.

697
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,550
But today...

698
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,430
No wonder.

-Don’t touch it.

Look at this yard.

Danger lurks everywhere.

715
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,690
Stop looking.

00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,050
Why are you here so late?

717
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,150
To treat you to a drink.

This time,

721
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,960
it's indeed a bit better than before.

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,280
I'm here to thank you.

728
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,850
You have a conscience.

729
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:53,790
Good wine.

730
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,630
Good wine.

731
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,590
Come on.

732
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,860
Speaking of which,

733
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,520
there is indeed a small thing.

734
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,460
What did I say?

735
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,190
Forget it.

736
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,190
For the sake of this flagon of wine,

737
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,070
go ahead.

738
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,590
Join Sifang Pavilion and help me.

739
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,160
Where are you going?

740
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,350
Why do you leave whenever we talk about this?

741
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,070
Sit down.

742
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,870
The official robe of Sifang Pavilion

743
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,880
is better than your civilian clothes, right?

744
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,920
Stop, Yu.

745
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,350
Am I someone who cares about clothes?

746
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,880
I recommended you because you're good at this.

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,580
Many people can't join even if they want to.

748
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,290
Fine.

749
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,330
Even if I go,

750
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,650
where do you plan on putting me?

751
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,590
The East Court?

752
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,360
An Xiuyi of the East Court is arrogant.

753
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,470
He doesn’t like me and I don't like him.

754
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,330
The West Court?

755
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,670
The West Court has one who loves houses

756
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,870
and one who loves cosmetics.

757
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,990
If you add in someone who loves wine and money,

758
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,510
it'll just be a rabble.

759
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,910
Wang Kunwu will go crazy.

760
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,640
Excuses!

761
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,010
Those are all excuses.

762
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,710
Brat, I know you well.

763
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,040
You've been whiling your days away for years.

764
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,920
Ultimately,

765
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,190
you still can't let go of your parents' matter.

766
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,030
Yuan Mo,

767
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,350
I watched you grow up.

768
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,360
I really don't want you to live like this anymore.

769
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,060
If your father were alive,

770
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,380
he wouldn't want to see you like this either.

771
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,730
You are his only child in this world.

772
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,350
Do you know high his expectations were for you?

773
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,870
He hoped you could grow up to be like him,

774
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,250
living up to what you've learned...

775
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,330
And serve the country.

776
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,190
How many times have you said that?

777
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
He told you all this.

778
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,220
I didn't hear it.

779
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,870
I only know

780
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,370
that he left home when I was very young.

781
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,330
He got my mother killed in the desert with him

782
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,770
and left me to grow up alone in Changle.

783
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,780
He was a Sifang Envoy.

784
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,310
He had to represent Yong in other states.

785
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,270
But in the end?

786
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,420
What did he get in the end?

787
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,770
What did the Sifang Pavilion and the court

788
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,050
do for him in the end?

789
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,440
How many people can remember his name?

790
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,450
You want me to work for Sifang Pavilion?

791
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,090
Sure.

792
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,550
Pay me per case.

793
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,510
You want me to work tirelessly for Sifang Pavilion like a fool?

794
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,350
No way.

795
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,020
Yuan Mo!

796
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,360
How many times have I told you?

797
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,460
Don't throw your trash onto my bed.

798
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,090
If you keep throwing your stupid wine bottles—

799
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,110
Mr. Yu, you're here?

800
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,390
I didn't know.

801
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,270
Hello, Mr. Yu.

802
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,540
Hello.

803
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,610
You two

804
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,640
live in the same room?

805
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,070
Yes.

806
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:02,590
No.

807
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,590
No, no, no.

808
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,920
What do you mean?

809
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,650
Yuan Mo,

810
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,700
you're not a kid anymore.

811
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,790
You must take responsibility

812
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,900
for these things between a man and woman.

813
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,590
Wait.

814
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,350
No, it's like this.

815
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:13,990
Yu, listen to me.

816
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,790
-I...
-Tell me.

817
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,070
My house...

818
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,520
Our house is too small.

819
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,870
It's too small. I think...

820
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,790
Stop explaining.

821
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,230
Your excuse really

822
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,570
sounds like an excuse.

823
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Mr. Yu,

824
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,190
it's not what you think.

825
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,100
-Right.
-No, no.

826
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,510
Sorry, Ms. Ah Shu.

827
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,440
I disturbed you.

828
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,230
It's late. I should go back.

829
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,470
You two, drink up.

830
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,270
You young people keep drinking.

831
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,750
Tell him.

832
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,480
What should I say? You say it!

833
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,250
Hey, Yu!

834
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,180
You ruined my reputation.

835
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,190
Do you have one?

836
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,850
Alright, cut the crap.

837
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,660
There are no outsiders now.

838
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,710
Wash the wine cups you used.

839
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,030
Put out the light within 30 minutes.

840
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,360
Don't disturb my sleep.

841
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,210
Take it.

842
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,760
You...

843
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,890
I can't stand it anymore.

844
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,630
I have to rent a bigger house and move out.

845
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,760
Maybe I'll get rich first

846
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,290
and move out of your pigsty.

847
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,140
Your tone is...

848
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,550
Fine.

849
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,020
Fine.

850
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,200
Yong State's wine is a bit less bitter

851
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,700
and a bit sweeter than

852
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,910
the desert's wine.

853
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:39,970
My Lord.

854
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,990
Dou Chun is dead.

855
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,650
In the future,

856
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,780
it won't be that easy to get Yong's armory

857
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,180
in the future.

858
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,900
There is more than one rat in the world.

859
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,100
You're worrying too much.

860
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,440
Moreover, Dou Chun's death

861
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,110
brought us a pleasant surprise.

862
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,290
My Lord, do you mean Tan Lin?

863
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,200
We failed to kill Tan Lin,

864
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,720
but he died

865
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,430
by the law he made.

866
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,890
Isn't this heaven’s will?

867
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,700
Yong State's talents are whittled down and they're in troubled times.

868
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,560
Only this way can we have a chance.

869
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,790
The person who solved this case

870
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,070
was from Sifang Pavilion again.

871
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,280
Sifang Pavilion?

872
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,750
Interesting.

873
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,510
My Lord,

874
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,700
a letter from Yanle.

875
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,370
Viceroy Long wants to meet you.

876
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,910
It seems that I will have to enjoy

877
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,510
the prosperity of Changle City another day.
