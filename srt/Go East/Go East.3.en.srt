[Episode 3]

4
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,310
If that girl found out

5
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,160
that she had actually become my maid,

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,620
she would beat me to death.

7
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,030
My cherished fine wine

8
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,650
would be gone too.

9
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,050
What is this?

10
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,060
Ah Shu!

11
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,430
-Ah Shu!
-Why are you sneaking around?

12
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,690
Let me explain, Ah Shu.

13
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,830
Let me explain. Calm down.

14
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,360
This is the Changle household registration?

15
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,900
Kind of.

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,230
Really?

17
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,910
Does that mean I'm a Changle resident now?

18
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,180
You could say that.

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,950
Really?

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,290
Great!

21
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,270
I'm a Changle resident now!

22
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,530
Yuan Mo, you're amazing!

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,370
You really did it.

24
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,480
It's so exquisite.

25
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,870
Which two of these characters represent my name?

26
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,290
You don't know the Yong language?

27
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,020
Stop joking around. Which two?

28
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,970
These two.

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,230
These two?

30
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,230
You really don't know Yong's characters?

31
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,050
These two!

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,230
They're pretty.

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
Now that I've taken care of it,

34
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,470
about my wine...

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,550
My wine.

36
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,200
How is it? Do I write well?

37
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,820
[Ah Shu]

38
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,829
I'll teach you later.

39
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,340
Are you going to charge me for that?

40
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,160
What kind of person do you think I am?

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,810
Not a good person anyway.

42
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,900
Now that I'm a registered resident,

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,440
I'll start looking for a house tomorrow.

44
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,150
I don't want to

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,900
share a room with you anymore.

46
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,390
Tomorrow?

47
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,020
Isn't that a bit too rushed?

48
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,630
Ji from Sifang Pavilion

49
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,680
is good friends with a real estate agent
who handles property rentals and sales in Changle City.

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,720
He is my friend.

51
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,720
How about this?

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,450
Give me your registration, and I'll do it for you.

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,620
I can't let it out of my sight, not even for a moment.

54
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,450
I won't waste my breath arguing with you.

55
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,470
Yuchi invited me to go shopping.

56
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,270
Wait, wait, wait!

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,660
Yuchi Hua?

58
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,270
Aren't you afraid...

59
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,130
Afraid of what?

60
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,910
I'm a legal resident now.

61
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,490
I can shop with whoever I want.

62
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,420
Yes. Right.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,390
Remember,

64
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,089
don't let her see your registration.

65
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,670
She's always believed you were my maid.

66
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,060
It could cause problems if she looked into it further.

67
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,630
Got it.

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,130
What?

69
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,200
I want money.

70
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,390
You promised to

71
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,600
buy me two sets of clothes

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,950
from the most expensive dress store in Changle City.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,070
You have to keep your promise.

74
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,270
Didn't I already buy you clothes?

75
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,830
Look at the clothes you're wearing...

76
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,490
Not enough!

77
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,790
Alright, alright.

78
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,409
These.

79
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,900
These should be enough...

80
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,710
Thank you for coming. Take care.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,659
Yuchi,

82
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,070
you look so beautiful in women's attire.

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,190
What?

84
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,230
Isn't the official uniform of Jingzhao Prefecture nice?

85
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,390
You look heroic in your uniform, and now you look beautiful.

86
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,320
It's different.

87
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,870
How did that scoundrel, Yuan Mo,

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,160
find such a sweet maid like you?

89
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,310
Madam!

90
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,950
Here.

91
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,530
Pick another set for my sister.

92
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,120
Okay.

93
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,230
No need.

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,470
Why not?

95
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,410
Yuan Mo doesn't want to spend money on you.

96
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,650
Then I'll buy them for you.

97
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,690
It's a waste to buy more clothes

98
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,080
than I can wear.

99
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,160
Well, I've been looking for

100
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,880
a suitable house recently.

101
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,270
What? Yuan Mo is moving?

102
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,190
It's better to be quiet,

103
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,030
but with good food and entertainment nearby.

104
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,030
The kind where you can buy everything

105
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,030
and it's convenient to go anywhere.

106
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,780
So, you're looking for tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle.

107
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,940
It doesn't need to be too close to the center.

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,710
I mean tranquility, not proximity to the city center.

109
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,870
But these requirements are easy to meet.

110
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,390
I'm known

111
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,070
on every street in Changle.

112
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,750
Later, I'll find you a good real estate agent.

113
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,810
I guarantee you'll get the best deal.

114
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,030
Thank you, Yuchi.

115
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,150
You're so nice.

116
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,850
Madam.

117
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,490
Look.

118
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,160
Butler Jiang, you're here.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,910
Are the clothes for the Dou family's servants ready?

120
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,230
They've been ready for a long time.

121
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,510
You are really busy

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,910
[Butler of Dou's Mansion, Jiang Wu]

123
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,370
handling purchases and procurement every day.

124
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,950
Be careful.

125
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,390
Which wealthy family's order is that?

126
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,590
Such a large order.

127
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,750
Governor Dou Chun of the region west of Liupan Mountain is about to return to the capital to report on his duties.

128
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,230
Boss Lady, they're all here.

129
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,950
This should be the butler coming ahead

130
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,150
to get everything ready for his master.

131
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,350
Okay. Take care.

132
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:25,900
Let's go.

133
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,710
I'll take you to the real estate agent, Beard Wang.

134
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,230
I'll make sure he gives you the best deal.

135
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,910
Yuchi,

136
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,030
you're busy.

137
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,550
Just introduce me to him,

138
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,600
and I'll look at the houses myself.

139
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,680
Ji! J...

140
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,690
What are you doing?

141
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,360
Military training.

142
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,530
You have no idea.

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,830
Ever since Wang made his contributions,

144
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,180
Mr. Yu hasn't been able to control him.

145
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,470
I thought he still had a shred of humanity left in him.

146
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,390
I didn't expect him to torture us

147
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,390
more than ever.

148
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,300
Gosh, this is too much.

149
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,020
It's a good thing the Sifang Pavilion doesn't want me.

150
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,430
Well, I came to you for something serious.

151
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,560
Help me find a house.

152
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,160
I have to run errands for you?

153
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,750
I'm already like this, and you still want me to help you?

154
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,880
Run errands? I can't even run anymore.

155
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,230
I quit!

156
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,780
Every morning,

157
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,620
we have to do this physical training thing.

158
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,510
I don't attract girls with my physical strength.

159
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,310
Exactly!

160
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,210
Shen,

161
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,690
I heard you had a spare room.

162
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,190
No.

163
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,230
Only for a few months!

164
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,750
No.

165
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,630
I'm in trouble.

166
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,070
No, no.

167
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,910
Don't stop!

168
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,450
Retainer Wang,

169
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,750
if this continues, people could die!

170
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,910
Those who can't complete the training

171
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,350
will have their salaries deducted!

172
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,950
If you fail to complete it every day, I'll deduct your salary every day!

173
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,980
Until it's all deducted!

174
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,840
Retainer Wang,

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,790
if I don't bring home any money,

176
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,950
my wife will kick me out.

177
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,310
If this keeps up,

178
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,430
I won't be able to afford my face cream anymore.

179
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,270
Get up!

180
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,909
Squat walk!

181
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,670
If you can't complete the training,

182
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,390
your salary will be completely deducted!

183
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,630
Listen to your boss. Come on.

184
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,290
Let's do it.

185
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,070
Retainer Wang.

186
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,730
Squat walk!

187
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,390
What's gotten into you?

188
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,450
Since I, Wang Kunwu, joined the army,

189
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,650
I've never had a soldier who was a loser.

190
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,980
Our West Court isn't made up of losers either!

191
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,310
Repeat!

192
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,310
We're not losers.

193
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,380
Our West Court can also host foreign envoys,

194
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,910
facilitate business coordination,

195
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,920
and arrange for people from all directions.

196
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,590
Arrange for people from all directions.

197
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,890
Sooner or later, our West Court

198
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,000
will become the real ace of the Sifang Pavilion!

199
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,260
What are you doing?

200
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,070
Are you trying to rebel?

201
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,929
Retainer Wang,

202
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,260
do you really want us to be like the East Court?

203
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,350
Then I've got a bone to pick with you.

204
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,870
We don't even get paid half as much as they do,

205
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,830
yet we have to do just as much work?

206
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,750
Guys!

207
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,190
We'd rather be losers

208
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,030
if we don't get a raise!

209
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,640
You...

210
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,780
Retainer Wang,

211
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,550
listen to me.

212
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,140
It won't work

213
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,830
if you expect them to work as hard as they can for you,

214
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,090
based on some slogans.

215
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,720
Why are you still here?

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,740
Didn't I tell you

217
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,510
that no outsiders

218
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,250
are allowed to enter the Sifang Pavilion at will?

219
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,430
If you dare come again,

220
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,300
I'll have you tied up and sent to Jingzhao Prefecture for punishment!

221
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,390
Calm down. Look, the chickens are crowing because of you.

222
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:11,990
Calm down.

223
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,880
This is awkward.

224
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,480
They all saw it.

225
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,310
Are you training?

226
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,550
No matter how hard you train,

227
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,150
it's useless.

228
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,120
So, has another delegation arrived in Changle?

229
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
Governor Dou Chun has returned to the capital to report on his duties.

230
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,670
An Xiuyi went to the city gate

231
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,200
to welcome him with his men.

232
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,670
But he's right.

233
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,860
It's useless no matter how hard you train.

234
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,150
When you can let your West Court

235
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,390
arrange accommodation for the commanders of the border provinces,

236
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,050
that would truly demonstrate your capability.

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,220
You just said you want to borrow a house, right?

238
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,070
Yes. Yes.

239
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,590
If any of you dare to help him,

240
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,950
pack your stuff and go!

241
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:07,810
Go on!

242
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,210
Well, what?

244
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,540
Take a look.

245
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,500
Okay, I'll take this house.

246
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,190
I can pay you the deposit now.

247
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,660
Could you add some furniture

248
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,630
and plants to the house?

249
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,360
Don't worry.

250
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,190
Since you are Ms. Yuchi's friend,

251
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,630
just let me know if you need anything.

252
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,630
Thank you.

253
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,980
By the way, Miss,

254
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,230
please show me

255
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,200
your household registration document.

256

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,910
this is your Registrations of Maid certificate.

260
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,030
It says here that the head of the household is your master, Yuan Mo.

261
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,360
Registration of Maids?

262
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,950
If you want to rent or sell a house,

263
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,410
you'll need the seal of Yuan Mo, your master.

264
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,700

272
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,240
Your little maid spent this much

273
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,470
in our store.

274
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,910
She came with her registration document.

275
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,440
Our boss wouldn't have sold to her otherwise.

Oh no. I'm screwed.

Why are you running?

278
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,450
You haven't paid us yet.

279
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,790
She's just a maid.

280
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,240
How could you sell whatever she wants?

281
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,480
The items she bought are things

282
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,480
our shopkeeper can hardly sell a few of in a year.

283
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,270
Pay up!

Don't touch it!

285
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,850
This isn't an ordinary plant.

286
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,260
If you get pricked by it

287
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,350
and its juice enters the wound with only a little,

288
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,790

I'm going to plant some oleanders there.

What do you think?

00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,030
That registration document is a misunderstanding.

Stay back! Stay back!

321
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,660
I'll only ask you three questions!

322
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,720
Who are you? Where do you come from? Where are you going?

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,280
You see?

324
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,580
Any non-Yong citizen who wants to settle in Changle

325
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,650
must answer these three questions.

326
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,550
You can't even answer any of them.

327
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,020
How could you possibly become a legal resident here?

328
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,580
As long as you register as a maid,

329
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,990
you're

330
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,060
a legal resident here in Changle City.

331
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,740
You know it?

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,620
Not only that,

I'm responsible for your daily life.

If you want to do something, I have to help.

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,570
Most importantly,

340
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,720
once you have me as your master,

341
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,710
no one can trace your identity anymore.

342
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,630
After one year,

343
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,550
you also have the right to remove your own status as a maid.

344
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,610
All you need is my signature and seal,

345
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,990
and you'll be free.

346
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,600
So, I should thank you.

347
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,910
You don't have to.

348
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,900
Just keep that snake away from me.

349

Also,

350
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,980
it'd be even better

351
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,070
if you could return

352
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,330
those strange plants.

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Press your fingerprint.

374
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,270
Sign it now?

375
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,600
I have to find someone to change some clauses

376
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,470
and go over the contract.

377
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,670
You want to go over it?

378
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,830
You want to change clauses?

379
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,180
I was just saying.

380
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,030
I trust you 100 percent.

381
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,320
Then sign it.

382
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,670
Every part of my body is aching.

383
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,600
Not a single part feels good.

384
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
Shen,

385
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,850
go pay the bill.

386
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,420
Okay.

387
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,350
Wait.

388
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,530
Why is it always me?

389
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,470
Don't you know me?

390
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,910
My salary for this month

391
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,670
is for my kid's teacher.

392
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Next month. I'll pay next month.

393
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,840
It's not that I don't want to pay.

394
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,230
I can't even hold coins in my hand.

395
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,270
Don't look at me.

396
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,510
My wallet was emptied by my maid long ago.

397
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,910
No wonder the East Court despises us.

398
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,440
Being poor is the No. 1 reason.

399
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,950
A poor man's ambitions are limited.

400
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,390
Well, it's not like we'd ever

401
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,400
get to do some lucrative jobs anyway.

402
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,260
Go pay the bill.

403
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,270
Boss,

404
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,580
I'll pay for this table.

405
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,910
-Retainer Wang.
-Retainer Wang.

406
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,410
Sit.

407
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,450
No need to thank me.

408
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,940
You're right.

409
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,670
Having Governor Dou Chun

410
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,400
choose our West Court to handle his affairs

411
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,110
would demonstrate true capability.

412
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,040
Can you do it?

413
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I will handle as much as I'm paid for.

414
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,770
Money is not a problem.

415
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,420
The point is that An Xiuyi is one step ahead.

416
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,280
Since you gave me enough money, this matter is on me.

417
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,510
But I'm just curious.

418
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,540
Why did you suddenly come around

419
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,590
and decide to compete with the East Court for this lucrative job?

420
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,970
They all say that living in Changle City is not easy.

421
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,030
But I didn't expect

422
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,620
that the people of our West Court would soon

423
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,020
be unable to afford a few bowls of lamb soup.

424
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,920
Well, Retainer An is an old Changler.

425
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,470
His father, Vice Minister An,

426
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,470
is the top boss of our Sifang Pavilion.

427
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,210
The An family is connected to everyone.

428
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,190
Moreover, they're family friends with the Governor.

429
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,070
It's unlikely

430
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,020
we can snatch food from their mouths.

431
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,740
An Xiuyi is not a big shot.

432
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,830
But we can find

433
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,990
a real big shot.

434
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,320
Ten copper coins a day.

435
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,339
So, I can make three strings of coins a year.

436
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,260
I'll save enough money and leave this hellhole sooner or later.

437
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,240
You want to save money?

438
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,970
I have a good chance for you to earn some.

439
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,720
What chance?

440
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,099
Aren't you close to Yuchi Hua?

441
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,540
Invite her to Ruyi Pavilion.

442
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,980
[Ruyi Pavilion]

443
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,270
Yuchi, you don't mind my low status

444
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,780
and still treat me as your sister.

445
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,550
Here's to you.

446
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,390
Thank you.

447
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,310
Duke Er was indeed brave back then.

448
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,170
But that was when he was young.

449
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,920
My father?

450
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,830
How long has it been since he led a troop?

451
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,830
In recent years, he hasn't even achieved anything in the military.

452
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,070
Now he is just a useless old man.

453
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,730
You can't say that.

454
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,290
How dare I disrespect Duke Er?

455
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,310
It's Wang and Yuan Mo.

456
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,310
Should we call...

457
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,460
I didn't say that.

458
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,710
The East Court said that!

459
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,090
The East Court?

460
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,000
Governor Dou Chun is about to come back

461
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,670
to Changle, causing all this.

462
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,060
Guess what they said?

463
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,990
They said that in all of Changle City,

464
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,910
the Governor would only value Retainer An.

465
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,460
Wasn't the Governor

466
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,540
once a subordinate of Duke Er back in the day?

467
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,350
So what?

468
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,880
The An family is closer to the Governor than Duke Er?

469
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,930
So, they said that to me.

470
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,270
Ridiculous!

471
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,080
Man, you know it too.

472
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,130
I am here to make contributions.

473
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,100
The West Court must do its best!

474
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,660
This time, we have to take on the task of

475
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,270
receiving the Governor from the East Court!

476
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,270
No way.

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,190
The East Court has a backer.

478
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,070
What does the West Court have?

479
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,110
The Governor wouldn't choose you.

480
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,550
Just drink.

481
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,960
The Governor would never choose the West Court!

482
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,610
-Yuchi.
-I'll go to my father now

483
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,470
and teach the East Court a lesson.

484
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,530
[West Court]

485
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,370
This is the West Court.

486
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,670
How is it?

487
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,120
Look.

488
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,480
All right, you can go now.

489
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
That is Ji.

490
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,950
This is Shen.

491
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,750
You must be Ah Shu, right?

492
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,590
I heard you saved Assistant Minister Tan.

493
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,120
So good to finally meet you.

494
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,840
You two are here!

495
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,070
You two find a place to sit first.

496
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm busy.

497
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,790
I'll treat you to tea tonight.

498
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,970
You guys just focus on our work. Don't worry about me.

499
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,320
It's so lively here.

500
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,670
It's just like the West Market.

501
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,110
Come here often if you like.

502
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,930
Don't always go to the West Market and spend all your money.

503
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,500
Everyone, you're busy with work?

504
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,110
Yu.

505
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,270
Call me "Mr. Yu."

506
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,430
Mr. Yu.

507
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,640
You're Miss Ah Shu, right?

508
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,660
See? She has excellent manners.

509
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,030
Come to the Sifang Pavilion with Yuan Mo if you have time.

510
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,350
You saved Assistant Minister Tan's life,

511
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,210
so we're honored to have you here.

512
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,590
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

513
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,350
You're welcome.

514
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,810
Is there any important matter that you need to address, Mr. Yu?

515
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,190
Wang,

516
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,280
you know Governor Dou Chun very well, right?

517
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,070
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

518
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,200
You must be kidding.

519
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,950
How could I get to know the Governor?

520
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,040
That's right. You flatter him.

521
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,880
How can he...

522
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,460
Alright.

523
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,750
We're talking about business.

524
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,710
You take Miss Ah Shu to see what is over there.

525
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,260
Go.

526
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,910
Fine. Let's go.

527
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,720
You really don't know him?

528
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,740
It's not important.

529
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,450
Let's talk about it later.

530
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,960
Everyone, put aside what you're working on for a moment.

531
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,290
I have an announcement.

532
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,820
From now on, the West Court of Sifang Pavilion

533
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,220
will officially take over the arrangements
for Governor Dou Chun's return to the capital.

534
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,020
Did you hear me?

535
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,500
I just...

536
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,740
What are you all doing?

537
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,030
Shouldn't you all be very happy and excited

538
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,550
upon hearing this news?

539
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,470
Mr. Yu,

540
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,720
you can see

541
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,510
how busy we are.

542
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,450
Yeah.

543
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,910
Besides, how can we take on

544
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,030
such an important job?

545
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,390
We can only handle things like stamping official seals,

546
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,920
helping the envoys find lost items,

547
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,230
and running errands.

548
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,440
Other than that, we are really not capable of anything.

549
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,030
Enough.

550
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,190
Do you think I want to leave this task to you?

551
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,070
The Governor appointed you himself

552
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,800
to have you, the West Court, handle his business.

553
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,580
Isn't this the money bag lost by Yuluo's envoy?

554
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
Can you see it?

555
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,620
The people of Yuluo are so rich.

556
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,640
I've got to get it to the envoy right away.

557
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,170
Stop!

558
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,870
What a show.

559
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,210
Why didn't you throw it in my face?

560
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,870
Your face is not on the ground.

561
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
It's all about money, right?

562
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
I know it.

563
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,570
If you get this job done,

564
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,270
I'll double your bonus!

565
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,910
Why...

566
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,850
It's really not about money.

567
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,550
This was East Court's task,

568
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,200
and now we're going to do it.

569
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,090
Then who will be responsible for

570
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,790
all the work in the West Court?

571
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,430
The East Court can handle your work.

572
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,800
Wait a moment.

573
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,070
Come in, all of you.

574
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,240
Hand over your work.

575
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,180
I can't let you do that.

576
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,510
Come on. Come on.

577
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,590
Please go to the Yuluo Embassy later.

578
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:20,860
Sister,

579
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,830
I have other important work to do.

580
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,190
I really don't have time to organize these.

581
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,190
Look it up in the dictionary if you don't know the word.

582
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,590
You...

583
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,110
You have to use concentrated feed.

584
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,300
Inspect all the travel passes carefully.

585
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
It'd be a big deal to let a spy escape.

586
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,190
Man,

587
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,250
all these documents need to be filed.

588
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,310
Wang,

589
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,360
I don't care what you did.

590
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,270
But this is not over.

591
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,470
What?

592
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,720
Only you, East Court, can host the Governor?

593
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,610
Retainer An,

594
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,710
that is the horse of the envoy from Mobei.

595
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,230
Hurry up and bathe it.

596
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,040
Be careful not to let it kick you in the face when you're bathing it.

597
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,430
Listen up, people of the West Court!

598
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,230
Come with me!

599
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,020
Yes!

600
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,630
Here, this is for you.

601
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,670
Take it. Take it.

602
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,940
Hold the chicken carefully.

603
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,270
Here.

604
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,950
Take it.

605
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,750
It's all yours.

606
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,240
Take it.

607
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,670
I'll leave it to you.

608
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,190
Finally, this day has come.

609
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,520
Here.

610
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,270
This is for you.

611
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,790
Take it.

612
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,860
[East Court]

613
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,710
This is where the real work is done.

614
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,680
Come here! Come here!

615
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,590
Taking over the Governor's accommodation arrangements is just the beginning.

616
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,940
What the East Court can do,

617
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,670
we, the West Court, can also do!

618
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,570
Yes!

619
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,810
Ji,

620
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,470
you're the one who knows real estate agents the most.

621
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,000
Go find a suitable mansion.

622
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,710
Remember,

623
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,750
it must be grand and spacious.

624
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,190
Shen,

625
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,260
you go and find out about Dou's family's preferences,

626
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,100
buy furniture and items for the mansion,

627
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,390
and find suitable craftsmen to renovate the mansion.

628
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,790
You three, go find some capable and courteous people

629
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,050
to serve the Governor.

630
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,980
Remember,

631
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,070
check their backgrounds.

632
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,330
They must be reliable.

633
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,320
As for the rest, find your desks and start working!

634
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,110
Yes!

635
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,710
Don't push!

636
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,700
Line up! Line up!

637
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,110
Retainer An,

638
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,530
we just let those losers from the West Court

639
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,680
snatch away the task of arranging the Governor's accommodation?

640
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
We can't just accept it.

641
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,110
I'll have them

642
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,950
give the task back!

643
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,910
Can you hurry up?

644
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,400
Does it really take that long to get a stamp?

645
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,750
And you two have time to chat here.

646
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,150
We've been waiting for a long time.

647
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,510
Can't you see that there are many of us queuing up here?

648
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,860
Yeah!

649
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,270
You...

650
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,370
What?

651
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,470
Hurry up and stamp it.

652
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,070
Or I'll file a complaint against you with the Ministry of Rites.

653
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,700
Yes, complain against him!

654
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,950
I have to file a complaint. How do you do things?

655
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,010
Switch.

656
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,110
Young Master, I've asked around.

657
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,190
It was Yuchi Hua who made the connection,

658
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,450
and Duke Er stepped in.

659
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,310
No wonder.

660
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,060
Wang Kunwu...

661
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,810
Looks like I really underestimated him.

662
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,750
Ji! J...

663
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,430
Oh my God.

664
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,320
Ji.

665
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,420
Gosh, you...

666
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,320
It's only been a few days, Shen.

667
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,700
How did you all become like this?

668
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,870
Yuan Mo,

669
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,700
you have no idea.

670
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,370
I've been living hell for the last half month.

671
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,250
I've shown Butler Jiang

672
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,420
no fewer than 20 houses all over the city.

673
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,780
But he didn't choose any of them.

674
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,730
The most annoying thing is that he told me today

675
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,270
that the Governor had already set his heart on

676
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,230
and chosen a residence.

677
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,830
They even moved in today.

678
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,780
I've gone to a lot of trouble

679
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,970
selecting many beautiful maids.

680
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,770
In the end, they either said that the maids had unclear backgrounds

681
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,610
or that they were too weak.

682
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,370
And the gardens I chose were criticized for not knowing anything about soil properties

683
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,610
or how to tend plants.

684
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,760
All in all, they're not satisfied with anything.

685
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,690
Poor me, running all over the city.

686
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,810
My skin has been ruined by sun exposure!

687
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,350
Poor us!

688
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,600
We didn't earn a penny,

689
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,580
yet we've done a lot more than before.

690
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,120
Yuan Mo,

691
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,350
why did you

692
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,570
have to get us

693
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,510
such a tough job?

694
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,090
Why are you blaming me?

695
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,190
How come it's not your fault?

696
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,260
It's all your fault!

697
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,590
Why are you all so down?

698
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,990
Get up, all of you!

699
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,900
It's our duty

700
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,840
to arrange accommodations for officials.

701
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,500
We have to fulfill any request

702
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,880
the Governor makes.

703
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,060
Understand?

704
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

705
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,280
Get to work!

706
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,880
Kunwu,

707
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,570
calm down.

708
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,190
Well,

709
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,590
since the Governor has moved into his residence,

710
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,310
shouldn't you pay me now?

711
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,820
You pay me

712
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,710
so that I can pay my little maid.

713
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,770
I'll give it to you...

714
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,850
as soon as I get my paycheck.

715
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,710
Your paycheck?

716
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,670
Well, what's your paycheck enough for?

717
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,190
You...

718
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,710
Butler Jiang sent the invitation himself.

719
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,030
Tomorrow, the Governor will host a housewarming banquet

720
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,150
and has invited me as a token of his appreciation.

721
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,350
I can take you with me.

722
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,440
Stop it. I...

723
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,550
I have nothing to do with it whatsoever.

724
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,160
I don't work at the Sifang Pavilion.

725
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,890
There will be plenty of good wine there tomorrow.

726
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,220
[Welcome]

727
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,720
Good for you.

728
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,830
You want to use someone else's fine wine to settle your own debts, right?

729
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,590
Wang Kunwu,

730
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,360
you've changed.

731
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,150
So, are you going or not?

732
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:37,910
Go to hell.

733
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:39,870
Fine.

734
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,950
It's your choice not to come.

735
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,990
Didn't I tell you?

736
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,600
Go.

737
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,900
I'll go.

738
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,710
Welcome. Welcome.

739
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,470
Please leave your weapon here.

740
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,020
Ms. Yuchi is here.

741
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,910
The Governor has been waiting for you.

742
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,830
Take it.

743
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,920
Please leave your weapon here.

744
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,350
How is Duke Er?

745
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,470
He's fine.

746
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,370
That's good.

747
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,400
The Governor is still thinking

748
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,840
about when he can pay his respects in person.

749
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,780
That's very nice of him.

750
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,950
Come in, please.

751
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,550
Please.

752
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,430
Servants, welcome them inside.

753
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,230
Butler Jiang.

754
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,810
Retainer Wang.

755
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,050
Thank you for your help these days.

756
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,100
Please leave your weapon here.

757
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,670
Okay.

758
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,670
Please.

759
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,770
Governor, cheers!

760
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,860
Governor,

761
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,070
a toast to you.

762
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,980
[Cao Huo, Chairman of the Mobei Chamber of Commerce]

763
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,780
[Governor, Dou Chun]

764
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,990
He is so tall and strong.

765
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,550
He doesn't look like a Yong,

766
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,690
but someone from the grassland.

767
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,550
You're right.

768
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,490
Cao Huo is from Mobei.

769
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,760
He wandered to Yong when he was young.

770
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,570
Because of his bravery and skill in battle,

771
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,750
he became the Governor's subordinate.

772
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,510
Now, with his connection to the Governor,

773
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,150
he doesn't need to fight anymore.

774
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,550
He's now in charge of all merchants from Mobei in the West Market.

775
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,730
He's considered the leader

776
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,980
of the people from Mobei in Changle City.

777
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,780
Governor,

778
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,630
to repay your kindness in promoting me,

779
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,830
I have specially prepared something rare for you.

780
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,710
Okay.

781
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,350
What is this?

782
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,260
What is this?

783
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,430
Everyone, have a look. Do you know this?

784
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,690
[Businessman, Guan Feng]

785
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,590
Is this the Soul-restoring Incense from the Western Region?

786
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,890
That's right.

787
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,670
This is a mysterious incense that was lost during the reign of Emperor Wu,

788
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,270
called the Soul-restoring Incense.

789
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,540
Emperor Wu favored Concubine Li.

790
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,040
After Concubine Li passed away,

791
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,910
Emperor Wu ordered the sorcerer to burn the Soul-restoring Incense,

792
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:00,280
so he could fall asleep by smelling the incense at night
to ease the pain of missing her every day.

793
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,290
What a rare thing.

794
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,640
Jiang Wu.

795
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,900
Light it

796
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,740
so that all guests can enjoy it.

797
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,430
Maybe we can all dream of a pretty girl tonight.

798
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,150
Do you know what Soul-restoring Incense is?

799
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,860
According to ancient books,

800
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,180
when Emperor Wu was alive, the Western Regions offered
the Soul-restoring Incense as tribute.

801
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,950
Emperor Wu used it and he thought it was good,

802
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,480
leading to increasingly ridiculous rumors.

803
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,590
It was said that patients who smelled it could recover instantly,

804
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,000
and the dead would come back to life.

805
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,690
Fortunately, there are no dead people here.

806
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,690
Otherwise, it'll be a problem if they come back alive.

807
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,630
It's just ordinary incense.

808
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,140
These merchants made up the story

809
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,290
to sell incense at an inflated price.

810
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,210
It really has a special fragrance!

811
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,440
Mr. Cao, you're so thoughtful.

812
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,500
It's worth the trip here today, everyone!

813
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,990
That's right. Yes.

814
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,630
Butler Jiang,

815
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,640
how can we not have any beauties at the banquet today?

816
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,240
Don't worry, Mr. Cao.

817
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,690
They've even invited the famous Ms. Hua here?

818
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,310
[Ms. Hua]

819
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,070
The butler is really going all out.

820
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,290
Bravo!

821
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,870
It's said

822
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,050
that only the guest who gets Ms. Hua's fan

823
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,260
can have a drink with her.

824
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,830
You're so lucky, Governor.

825
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,590
Yes.

826
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,840
Governor, a toast to you.

827
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,830
Okay.

828
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,670
Everyone,

829
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,700
let's have a drink together.

830
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,800
Cheers.

831
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,720
Cheers!

832
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,950
Thank you, Governor.

833
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,970
What happened?

834
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,030
What's going on?

835
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,550
Governor,

836
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,080
it's so hot today.

837
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,270
I think there's a rainstorm coming.

838
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,450
Come on, guys.

839
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,490
Let's light up the candles again.

840
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,480
Beauty, let's continue.

841
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,410
Here.

842
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,610
Someone is here!

843
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,320
Chairman Cao?

844
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,070
Give me back my head!

845
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,719
Mr. Cao, well...

846
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,139
Give me back my head!

847
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,540
Give me back my head!

848
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,940
Give me back my head!

849
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,790
Give me back my head!

850
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,520
Give me back my head!

851
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,630
It's him. It's him!

852
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,380
General Wei is back!

853
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,830
General Wei is back!

854
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,730
Everyone, don't panic!

855
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,120
The Advisor of the Ministry of Justice of the Jingzhao Prefecture is here!

856
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,450
Everyone, don't panic!

857
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,770
There is a murder here.

858
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,630
From now on, close all gates to the mansion!

859
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,390
No one is allowed to leave

860
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,630
until we get to the bottom of this!

861
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,620
Why...

862
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,550
Why can't we leave?

863
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:42,870
Yes.

864
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,230
There is a murder.

865
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,190
Let's run!

866
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,630
When Cao Huo died, you cried out that a ghost had possessed his body,

867
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,960
and you said he was back.

868
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,030
Who is "he" that you were referring to?

869
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,030
Don't you know it?

870
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,410
Wei Yunqi.

871
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,460
Anyone who knows the Governor and Cao Huo knows that.

872
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,380
Back then,

873
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,340
General Wei Yunqi

874
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,790
wanted to rebel.

875
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,630
It seems that Governor Dou

876
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,360
beheaded Wei Yunqi himself.

877
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,460
Do you still remember

878
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,030
the curved sword in Cao Huo's hand?

879
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,220
That's the Drifting Clouds Sword.

880
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,390
It was originally Wei Yunqi's sword.

881
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,670
After the Wei family was destroyed,

882
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,100
it fell into Cao Huo's hands.

883
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,070
Doesn't the Soul-restoring Incense have the power

884
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,910
to bring the dead back to life?

885
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,100
Now, Cao Huo was killed with Wei Yunqi's sword.

886
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,510
Obviously,

887
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,090
it was Wei Yunqi's ghost coming back for revenge.

888
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,830
You also believe in the theory of a ghost seeking revenge?

889
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,040
I saw Cao Huo go crazy with my own eyes.

890
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,970
I have to believe it.

891
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,590
Where are you taking me?

892
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,120
Hurry up.

893
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,880
Where are you taking me?

894
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,670
Up, up!

895
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,510
You want to get out of here?

896
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,390
Cut the crap. Hurry up.

897
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,510
It'll be too late if someone finds out.

898
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,180
Hurry, hurry up.

899
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,670
You're really carefree.

900
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,190
Yuchi and Wang are still investigating the case.

901
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,670
One is working at the Jingzhao Prefecture,

902
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,870
and the other is at the Sifang Pavilion.

903
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,150
Of course, they have to stay to investigate the case.

904
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,190
What did we come for?

905
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,880
We're here for free booze.

906
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,310
If we don't go now, when will we?

907
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,900
Didn't you see how scary that scene was?

908
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,990
Hurry up. Get up!

909
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm not leaving.

910
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,440
The Soul-restoring Incense can cause people to lose their minds.

911
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,790
I've never seen this type of poison before.

912
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,100
I want to see what it is.

913
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,870
Let's go and check Cao Huo's body.

914
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,910
Are you crazy?

915
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,600
I'm trying to avoid it,

916
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,950
and you want to check the body.

917
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,790
Are you going or not?

918
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,990
No, if you want to go, you can go by yourself.

919
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,870
Don't forget

920
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,670
you also inhaled the Soul-restoring Incense.

921
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,070
Maybe in a while,

922
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,500
you'll be just like Cao Huo

923
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,830
and be possessed by some ghost passing by!

924
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,280
With me by your side,

925
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,750
I might be able to detoxify you.

926
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,120
Otherwise, you've seen Cao Huo's ending.

927
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,170
Forget what I said if you're not afraid of death.

928
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,590
Wait.

929
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,160
How can I trust you on your own?

930
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,830
His eyes are bloodshot, with a deranged look,

931
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,140
and his nails are blackened.

932
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,180
He was poisoned.

933
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,880
You mean, someone poisoned Cao Huo?

934
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,150
But we all inhaled the Soul-restoring Incense.

935
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,230
Why was Cao Huo the only one who went crazy?

936
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,830
Because he was possessed by Wei Yunqi's ghost.

937
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,650
Wei Yunqi?

938
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,990
General Wei was famous all over the country.

939
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,010
It's a pity that he tried to rebel in the end.

940
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,870
The rest of the rebels were annihilated by Dou Chun.

941
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,970
Every old friend of the Governor

942
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,900
knows about it.

943
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,910
So you believe it too...

944
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,950
Of course not.

945
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,170
But we've questioned all the guests here.

946
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,980
Other than the history between the Governor and Wei Yunqi,

947
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,030
we didn't get any valuable clues.

948
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,490
All the guests have removed their weapons at the door.

949
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,470
How did the Drifting Clouds Sword appear at the banquet?

950
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,580
You said someone poisoned Cao Huo.

951
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,810
Do you have evidence?

952
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,480
I think we need to go to a place.

953
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,380
[Cao's Mansion]

954
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,620
Any clues?

955
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,620
We've checked the entire Cao's mansion.

956
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,110
There's no hint of any poisons.

957
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,840
Not even a packet of rat poison.

958
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,160
Yuan Mo,

959
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,070
what are you doing?

960
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,410
I've found an important clue.

961
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,060
Why are there two buckets of water by the bed?

962
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,990
This is an ice locker,

963
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,190
with ice in it.

964
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,460
Now, it has all melted into water.

965
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,460
We also have one at home to cool down.

966
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,560
You

967
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,930
rich people.

968
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,010
So,

969
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,850
Cao Huo was afraid of heat.

970
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,420
Indeed.

971
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,300
I saw him unbutton his shirt

972
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,530
at the banquet yesterday

973
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,530
due to the heat.

974
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,430
That's right.

975
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,510
He was fat.

976
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,370
When we checked his body yesterday,

977
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,130
his collar was open too.

978
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,780
What?

979
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,670
Don't you always like

980
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,030
those strange poisons?

981
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,450
Check if it's poisonous.

982
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,180
I don't smell anything unusual.

983
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,950
Wait.

984
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,790
There seems to be

985
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,740
a faint smell of Dragon Scale Grass.

986
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,250
What Dragon Scale Grass?

987
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,640
It's an herb to repel mosquitoes.

988
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,080
Mosquitoes are all affected by it.

989
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Cao Huo was not a mosquito.

990
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,030
He wouldn't have become so violent and killed people

991
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,230
after smelling the Dragon Scale Grass.

992
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,420
What if coupled with the Soul-restoring Incense?

993
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,070
You mean,

994
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,320
he inhaled the Dragon Scale Grass first

995
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,210
and then the Soul-restoring Incense,

996
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,940
which caused him to lose his mind and kill people?

997
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
And as long as the ice melts into water,

998
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,430
it won't take long for it to evaporate with the water

999
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,330
and disappear without a trace.

1000
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,070
It's the best way

1001
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,710
if you want to poison Cao Huo.

1002
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,360
In that case,

1003
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,830
the Dragon Scale Grass is the most suspicious.

1004
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,510
But this is just our speculation.

1005
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,990
We can't prove

1006
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,420
that the combination of Dragon Scale Grass and Soul-restoring Incense

1007
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,830
can cause people to lose their minds

1008
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,950
or even kill.

1009
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,580
This is most likely a poisoning

1010
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,500
targeting the chairman of the Mobei Chamber of Commerce.

1011
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,970
Let's go back to Sifang Pavilion

1012
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,370
and report this to Mr. Yu.

1013
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,810
You three find a way to prove it.

1014
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,480
[East Court]

1015
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,210
Wait...

1016
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,810
Why did you light the Soul-restoring Incense?

1017
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,060
You've gone too far, haven't you?

1018
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,150
What exactly do you want?

1019
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,950
Let go of me!

1020
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,630
Yuan Mo.

1021
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,820
Calm down.

1022
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,540
I think Ah Shu's idea is feasible.

1023
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,190
She is skilled in medicine,

1024
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,840
so she can control the dosage.

1025
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,910
If you really break free from the bondage,

1026
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,970
I still have a whip.

1027
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,630
I won't let you be crippled.

1028
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,470
You're bullying me!

1029
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,470
Let go of me!

1030
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,420
Hurry up, Ah Shu!

1031
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,620
Hurry! Let go of me!

1032
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,370
My esteemed master,

1033
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,730
to confirm the effectiveness of combining

1034
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,930
the Dragon Scale Grass and the Soul-restoring Incense,

1035
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,590
I'm sorry to put you into this.

1036
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,390
Wait!

1037
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,760
Why did you grab so many of them?

1038
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,190
Shouldn't you be controlling the dosage?

1039
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,150
There are too many!

1040
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,150
My small body can't take this!

1041
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,750
Ah Shu!

1042
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,910
A bit less, please.

1043
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,790
That is too much!

1044
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,990
E-E-Enough!

1045
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,060
Ah Shu!

1046
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,150
Ah Shu! Ah Shu!

1047
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,520
This is already the dosage after control.

1048
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,730
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

1049
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:26,540
Yuchi.

1050
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,330
Let's do it.

1051
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,710
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

1052
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,320
Don't worry.

1053
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,670
I had a long chat with Yu.

1054
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,910
I'm thirsty.

1055
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,320
-No!
-No!

1056
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,960
Why does this water taste so funny?

1057
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,110
What are you doing?

1058
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,220
Oh no!

1059
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,790
Oh no. We're screwed.
