[Go East]

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,940
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,590
Fire!

4
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,590
Yuan Mo!

5
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,229
Fire! Fire!

6
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:54,910
Yuan Mo.
No.

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,009
Nothing's on fire.

8
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,110
I'm making you lung cleansing soup.

9
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,240
It'll be ready soon.

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,680
You know how to make soup?

11
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,010
It's easy.

12
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,290
The doctor said

13
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,120
it will be ready when three bowls of water bowl down to one.

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,780
Ignore the bitterness later.

15
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,400
If your condition worsens,

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,360
it will cost me so much money in the future.

17
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,420
Enough, stop cooking.

18
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,850
We would be choked to death before the soup is ready.

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,460
You can't put the stove here.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,270
When the wind blows,

21
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,870
the smoke goes into the room.

22
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,960
What's wrong?

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,460
The fire spark got into my eyes.

24
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,140
Let me see.

25
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,710
Look up.

26
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,620
Don't move.

27
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Don't move.

28
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,000
Does it hurt?

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,950
Is it okay now?

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,400
N-No.

31
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,290
It still hurts.

32
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,870
Well...

33
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,110
B-Blow it again.

34
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,410
I still feel discomfort.

35
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,720
You're fine.

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,710
I-I'm not.

37
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm almost blind.

38
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,150
Move the stove.

39
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,310
Are you going to leave me like this?

40
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,170
Your smoke is choking me to death.

41
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,520
Brothers.

42
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,280
The Man in White is here in Changle.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I’m one step closer to avenging you.

44
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,180
Boring.

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,720
Do you have eyes on your back?

46
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,480
My sword is just very polished.

47
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,950
You like to come here too?

48
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,760
My brothers and I used to drink here often

49
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,550
before we left Wuzhou.

50
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,620
What kind of people were they?

51
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,860
Jin was like me.

52
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,650
We both are orphans.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,270
Chen Xiong

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,660
just want to earn military merits

55
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,180
and get married.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,270
Yang Li eat a pancake for two meals.

57
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,250
He wants to save his military pay

58
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,020
for his mother.

59
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,750
My father said

60
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,130
there are no heroes in the army

61
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,690
but ordinary people who dare to stand up.

62
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,790
They all say

63
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,190
you got your brothers killed

64
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,370
that's why you were demoted here.

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,260
I don't believe it.

66
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,370
I don't think you're that kind of person.

67
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,950
Am I not?

68
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,910
We received a tip-off that day.

69
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,170
That The Faceless would plunder a caravan.

70
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,270
They followed my plan

71
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,690
and joined the caravan.

72
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,440
We successfully dispelled the first attack.

73
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,650
But unexpectedly,

74
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,100
we were surrounded by the Man in White instead.

75
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,990
Wang, run!

76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,760
Jin!

77
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,990
The men were captured by

78
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,900
the Man in White to save me.

79
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,590
I thought I could escape,

80
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,900
but I was shot by an arrow and fell off the horse.

81
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,159
The Man in White killed Jin and the others in front of me.

82
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,930
He thought I would die in the desert.

83
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,690
But I refused to back down

84
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,010
and walked out with my last breath.

85
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,470
So, did I get them killed?

86
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,500
It's both true

87
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,670
and not true.

88
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,050
Just like how you can't

89
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,440
see both sides of this sword at one time.

90
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,920
They joined the army with me.

91
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,400
All these years,

92
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,830
I haven't slept well a single night.

93
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,440
I have been wanting to avenge them.

94
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,070
I think that if avenge them,

95
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,680
I can have less guilt

96
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,679
in my heart.

97
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,150
Don't think too much.

98
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,039
Since revenge can make you sleep better,

99
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,590
just do it.

100
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,490
I'll do it with you.

101
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,550
Jin!

102
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,910
Chen Xiong

103
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,510
Yang Li!

104
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,890
Your good brother, Wang Kunwu,

105
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,390
misses you all every day!

106
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,350
He will kill the Man in White

107
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,310
and avenge you!

108
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,510
From now on,

109
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,870
I, Yuchi Hua, will help Wang Kunwu

110
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,230
to achieve his wish!

111
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,750
Do you hear that?

112
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
I told them for you.

113
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,540
They can hear it.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Thank you.

115
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,230
You're welcome.

116
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,290
Cheer up.

117
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,560
We can search again if the clues lead to a dead end.

118
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,620
We'll be doomed if we lose our morale.

119
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,070
Let's go back to Sifang Pavilion.

120
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,110
Xiao'e.

121
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,100
Chen Xinliang is dead now.

122
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,410
You are free.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,930
Unfortunately,

124
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,050
it's too late.

125
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,250
Did you know your master Chen Xinliang is The Faceless?

126
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,870
When he was in Yong State,

127
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,830
he only wanted to use the Magic Vase to win the trust of the people

128
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,230
to scam money out of them.

129
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,450
Later on, he joined The Faceless.

130
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,510
One one hand, they protected him.

131
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,570
On the other, he helped them trade slaves to earn money.

132
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,080
Then you must know the Man in White.

133
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,510
He is the leader of The Faceless.

134
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,710
We call him Master.

135
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,690
What else do you know

136
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,310
about the Man in White?

137
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,990
No one has seen his real face.

138
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,790
I've only heard about him

139
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,670
from my master.

140
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,680
There hasn't been a day of peace in Mo these years.

141
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,130
Countless orphans

142
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,960
became the new blood of The Faceless.

143
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,880
But in order to survive,

144
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,910
they have to kill each other.

145
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,910
Only the strongest can survive.

146
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,430
I don't know

147
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,330
what Terror Boy did

148
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,110
to make the people in The Faceless

149
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,190
obey him.

150
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,950
No one knows

151
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,310
how he looks

152
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,770
and how old he is now.

153
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,010
Chen Xinliang once told us

154
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,810
even if we don't look for the Man in White,

155
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,340
he will come looking for us.

156
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,260
Do you know what this means?

157
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,640
I only know that the Man in White is a man of his word.

158
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,860
Will he come to Changle now?

159
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,520
If he really comes to Changle,

160
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,280
he will definitely make a move.

161
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,390
Oh right.

162
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,470
Master had been acting suspiciously lately.

163
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,950
He seemed to be looking for someone for the Man in White.

164
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,010
Looking for someone?

165
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,090
I just vaguely heard that

166
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,050
Master seemed to pay special attention to

167
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,470
those young girls who were abducted to the Red Lotus Society.

168
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,470
I don't know much

169
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,560
about the other things.

170
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,360
If we want to find out the real purpose of the Man in White,

171
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,450
we need to settle down the refugees

172
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,100
and investigate them one by one.

173
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,280
My goodness.

174
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,350
Yuan Mo, is that you?

175
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,630
You're reading?

176
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,750
I remember my father mentioned

177
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,010
refugee settlement in "Sifang Annals."

178
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,630
It's here.

179
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,040
The previous dynasty had issued three strategies for refugees to settle down.

180
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
However, they were

181
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,350
regretfully ineffective.

182
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,320
I don't understand what you're saying.

183
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,540
Drink it while it's hot.

184
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,470
I'm going to bed.

185
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,610
[Archive Room]

186
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,070
Did you find it?

187
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,230
It's not this.

188
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,230
Hurry up.

189
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,490
This isn't right either.

190
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,630
Can you do it?

191
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,160
Are you sure you can find it?

192
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,990
Aren't you from the military?

193
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,600
Why are you so weak?

194
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,080
What does this have to do with the military?

195
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
Don't you know how heavy you are?

196
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,500
All right.

197
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,340
Put me down.

198
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,090
Where are the files on refugee settlement?

199
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,550
I've memorized them.

200
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,010
You used me as a ladder?

201
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,560
Isn't the ladder broken?

202
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,750
If it's not broken, it's better than you.

203
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,030
I...

204
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,550
Let's get down to business.

205
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,990
I've looked through ways that refugees were settled in the past

206
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,140
and my father's "Sifang Annals."

207
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,820
I found that there are two difficulties.

208
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,070
What is it?

209
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,150
First,

210
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,990
it's how to let the refugees have a legal identity of Yong

211
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,170
and live in peace.

212
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,050
Second,

213
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,710
these refugees are from different countries.

214
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,880
How can they not interfere with each other's matters

215
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,010
and cause disputes.

216
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,090
But if we hand out our identity documents to the refugees,

217
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,810
it will surely arouse criticism from all states,

218
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,850
saying that Yong is overstepping

219
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,030
and is interfering with the internal affairs of each country.

220
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,690
Haven't you figured out a way?

221
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,400
Write it down for me.

222
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,960
The refugees are all in the recuperating center.

223
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,590
We don't have enough manpower.

224
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,650
I'll look for Mr. Yu

225
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,220
and ask him to recruit more people to help.

226
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,820
Did you bring the token?

227
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,190
Yes, of course.

228
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,330
They're all here so early.

229
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,080
They're all here. Well...

230
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,940
Done.

231
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,150
Stop right there.

232
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,860
Stop coming forward.

233
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,970
There's a pond behind us.

234
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,000
Y-Yeah.

235
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,360
Why are you hiding?

236
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,500
We've heard that you're powerful.

237
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,550
But I didn't expect you to be so powerful that you–

238
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,480
Can kill, right?

239
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,490
How does it feel?

240
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,330
Is it scary?

241
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,820
I heard that when the knife goes in,

242
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,160
the blood can spray metres away.

243
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,910
Yes, more than tens of metres away.

244
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,030
Do you want to try?

245
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,950
Do you want to try?

246
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,470
No, no. We'll stop asking.

247
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't you have better things to do?

248
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,530
I advise you

249
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,510
to pay more attention to yourself.

250
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,430
I heard that the West Court is recruiting new people.

251
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,320
Isn’t that good news?

252
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Yeah.

253
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,940
The West Court is so busy.

254
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,920
It’s time to recruit new people.

255
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,390
Right.

256
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:36,880
Right?

257
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,480
I've already made it so blatant.

258
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,080
Do you still not understand?

259
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,480
What does she mean?

260
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,530
Recruiting new people...

261
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,780
Recruiting new people?

262
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,460
One will only see the new recruits smile,

263
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,180
but not the old staff cry.

264
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,850
Retainer Wang doesn't want us anymore.

265
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,950
Let's go.

266
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,190
Let's go.

267
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,109
Yuan Mo, let's go eat.

268
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,670
You guys go. I'm not eating.

269
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,300
Yuan Mo!

270
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,530
What are you doing>

271
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,030
It's lunch break.

272
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,750
Let's take a break.

273
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:25,950
Here.

274
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,569
You haven't eaten, have you?

275
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,170
Look, this is the roasted lamb leg from Inebriation Restaurant.

276
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,300
And lamb wonton from Xiao's shop.

277
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,070
It's lamb broth too. Try it.

278
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,870
Come on.

279
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,220
Have a taste.

280
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,210
We have Lihuachun and Wuyunjiang. Take your wine pick.

281
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,070
Try this first.

282
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:43,630
Here.

283
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,390
Here.

284
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,340
Nice wine.

285
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,580
How big is the mistake you made?

286
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,140
You're asking me to clean up the mess for you?

287
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,590
Don't say that.

288
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,120
We are brothers.

289
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,950
Yeah.

290
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,770
Besides,

291
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,030
you and Retainer Wang just escaped danger.

292
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,630
Right?

293
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,240
Shouldn't we celebrate?

294
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,190
So generous?

295
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,580
We have to let people in Retainer Wang know

296
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,790
that our West Court is as close as family.

297
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,890
No one can be left behind.

298
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,450
Right, Ji?

299
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,500
Yes, no one can be left behind.

300
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,340
What are you two trying to say?

301
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,970
Say it.

302
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,500
Yuan Mo.

303
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,310
Have you heard that

304
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,650
the West Court is recruiting new people?

305
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,770
Everyone.

306
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,540
Go to the council chamber.

307
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,750
Mr. Yu has something to announce.

308
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,280
Hurry.

309
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,620
Yuchi Hua of Jingzhao Prefecture is no inferior to men.

310
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,390
She led the army into the enemy's den

311
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,030
to kill the bandits and save the refugees.

312
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,350
She is promoted to the Chief Secretary to the Ministry of Justice of Jingzhao Prefecture.

313
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,550
She will assist in all security matters

314
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,550
of Changle City.

315
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,960
Congratulations, Chief Secretary.

316
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,330
I've been doing these things.

317
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,570
Whether I get promoted or not,

318
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,850
I will keep doing it.

319
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,910
As expected of Duke Er's daughter.

320
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,140
Bold and broad-minded!

321
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,730
Next is for the East Court.

322
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,490
An Xiuyi, the East Court retainer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sifang Pavilion,

323
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,810
risked his life to protect the refugees.

324
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,070
For this he's awarded with an increase of his monthly salary by 200 mace.

325
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,190
Mr. Yu, I...

326
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,940
Take it.

327
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,460
Throw it away.

328
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,620
Yes.

329
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,020
Wang Kunwu, the West Court retainer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sifang Pavilion,

330
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,220
and Yuan Mo

331
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,800
saved the refugees.

332
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,990
They were brave and conscientious.

333
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,780
They're awarded with an increase of their monthly salary by 200 mace

334
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,240
as a token of appreciation

335
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,030
What about the others in West Court?

336
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,050
The others also took part in the operation,

337
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,630
but made some mistakes

338
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,560
and almost let the head of the bandits escape.

339
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,620
So they aren't awarded nor punished.

340
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,140
They're definitely going to chase us away.

341
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,880
I hope these rewards

342
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,290
will encourage everyone.

343
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,670
The refugees haven't been settled.

344
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,980
There's still a long way to go to the Five States Conference.

345
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,640
You should cherish your honor

346
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,990
and stay calm.

347
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,990
Yes!

348
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,260
Take care, Magistrate.

349
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,960
No need to see me off.

350
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,800
Okay.

351
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,960
Why are you being so mysterious?

352
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,570
Yu.

353
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,400
What's wrong?

354
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,910
Don't you think something is missing in these rewards?

355
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,370
You've grown up.

356
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,540
You think that the imperial court's reward is too little?

357
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,620
It's an increase of your monthly salary by 200 mace.

358
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,320
How about this? I'll call Lord Lin here and you tell him.

359
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm not talking about me.

360
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
I'm talking about Ah Shu.

361
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,830
Listen.

362
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,040
Without her,

363
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,510
I would've died without a complete body.

364
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,230
How could you say that?

365
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,200
Your lips have to be smacked.

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,340
Hey, I'm being serious.

367
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,070
You're not allowed to say that.

368
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,840
Look.

369
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,170
Ah Shu isn't an official.

370
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,060
But she has helped

371
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,490
Sifang Pavilion a lot.

372
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:35,970
Yes.

373
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,150
She made a huge contribution this time, right?

374
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,550
Shouldn't we give her something in return?

375
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,930
Shouldn't we give her a surprise?

376
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,010
You need to know

377
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,720
what she wants the most.

378
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,790
She wants...

379
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,170
She just wants Changle’s household registration.

380
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,310
But I know...

381
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,350
it can't be done easily.

382
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,160
It can be.

383
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,430
It can be?

384
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,100
It used to be difficult,

385
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,960
but this time, Ah Shu

386
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,780
made a great contribution

387
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,150
entering Green Wave Villa.

388
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,010
Let me tell you.

389
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,180
As long as a foreign personnel who made contributions

390
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,440
wants to apply for Changle’s household registration,

391
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,370
they have priority.

392
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,110
Really?

393
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,910
That's great.

394
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,840
Ah Shu will be so happy if she knows.

395
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,750
How about this?

396
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,620
I'll write a commendation letter to the Ministry of Revenue.

397
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,150
And then

398
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,150
bring me your master-servant documents.

399
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,820
To do this,

400
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,840
your master-servant relationship has to be dissolved first

401
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,040
before it can be done.

402
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,050
Why are you spacing out?

403
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,390
I-I...

404
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,950
Let me think about it.

405
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,150
Let me think about it.

406
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,690
You almost got killed

407
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,200
at Green Wave Villa this time.

408
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,260
In the end, you only got a small increase in your salary.

409
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,070
Yet Advisor Yuchi got promoted to the Chief Secretary.

410
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,360
This is so unfair.

411
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,450
The reward depends on credit.

412
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,340
It's not about who was in danger or who suffered.

413
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,170
Hua did strategize well this time.

414
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,460
She deserves the reward.

415
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,870
You started out

416
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,030
as a clerk in Sifang Pavilion.

417
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,970
You made it so far working tirelessly for years.

418
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,970
Yet Advisor Yuchi

419
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,780
is able to do everything thanks to her father's tokens.

420
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,290
She treats everything lightly.

421
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,410
-How can she be compared to you–
-Enough.

422
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,270
Don't say things like that again.

423
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,290
Let her say it.

424
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,530
It's right.

425
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,600
I got those tokens

426
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,960
thanks to my father.

427
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,180
But I don't take things lightly.

428
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,860
Everything I do

429
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,340
is worthy of those tokens.

430
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,580
Because I know

431
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,280
from the day I was born,

432
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,430
I would be judged with more prejudice.

433
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
If I don't do well,

434
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,440
not only do I embarrass myself,

435
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,070
but also my father.

436
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,980
Hua.

437
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,310
Susu didn't mean it that way.

438
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,440
Don't get her wrong.

439
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,700
Susu is under you.

440
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,580
Of course she's on your side.

441
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
I won't hold her accountable for it.

442
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,740
But I hope

443
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,710
you can stay clear-headed at all times.

444
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,480
Don't be blinded by

445
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
others' admiration.

446
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,580
[Yuchi's Mansion]

447
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,520
Master,

448
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,830
are you very happy today?

449
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,140
What's there to be happy about?

450
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,120
It's just overturning the Red Lotus Society.

451
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,860
At her age,

452
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,390
I'd already won many wars.

453
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,980
How can you compare yourself to your daughter?

454
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,660
Master, you are really something.

455
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,590
What did you say?

456
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,790
I said were really something back then.

457
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,150
Of course!

458
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,100
Unfortunately,

459
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,350
I only have a daughter.

460
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,490
She's not young anymore,

461
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,960
but she still makes me worry.

462
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,220
But I think Miss

463
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,490
is better than all the aristocrats' children in Changle City.

464
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:20,930
No.

465
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,230
We can't let her go on like this.

466
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,400
The greater her contribution,

467
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,070
the more ambitious she is.

468
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,090
It will be hard for her to get married in the future.

469
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,380
I'm back!

470
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,900
My Lady, you're back.

471
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,230
Hurry up. Master has been waiting for you.

472
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
These are all my favourites.

473
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,350
You're never home.

474
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,000
Where did you go this time?

475
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,550
What do you mean?

476
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,680
I was saving the refugees. It was something seriousl.

477
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,480
The higher-ups even rewarded me.

478
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Eat up.

479
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,220
Master prepared these for you.

480
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,540
I don't care if you

481
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,180
wander around out there.

482
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,910
I even support you for some things.

483
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,110
But I have to care about your marriage.

484
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,350
Why are you bringing that up again?

485
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,950
I'm talking about Wang Kunwu.

486
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,940
You seem to care about his safety.

487
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,500
What?

488
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,340
Father, why do you say that?

489
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,900
Hey.

490
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,720
Is he interested in you?

491
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,590
If you're interested, go on.

492
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,590
If not,

493
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,550
don't waste your time on him.

494
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,790
I'm not eating anymore.

495
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,780
I just came back and that's all you talk about?

496
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,570
Annoying.

497
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,110
My Lady.

498
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,840
So annoying.

499
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,350
Master.

500
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,510
Do you have to bring this up?

501
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,180
Look.

502
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,210
These dishes were made for nothing.

503
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,350
You were just rewarded

504
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,570
and now you're here to play with stones?

505
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,460
What's the use of getting rewards?

506
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,340
What's the use

507
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,200
of performing well?

508
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,350
He can't see it at all.

509
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,810
He just wants to marry me off.

510
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,150
I can see that

511
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,170
Duke Er loves you very much.

512
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,100
But he's just like others.

513
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,630
Just because I'm a woman,

514
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,560
he thinks making contributions and having a career is useless.

515
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
In his eyes,

516
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,110
everything I do is nonsense.

517
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,060
But he never interfered with you, right?

518
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,780
I think

519
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,190
be it in Jingzhao Prefecture or Sifang Pavilion,

520
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,590
even without his orders,

521
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,550
no one would dare assign

522
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,550
tiring and dangerous tasks for you.

523
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,790
But it's been a while.

524
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,330
Has anyone stopped you

525
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,900
from doing anything you wanted to do?

526
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,680
Sometimes,

527
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,640
what people think is different from what they say.

528
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,240
I guess Duke Er is just like you.

529
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,290
He's tough on the outside but soft on the inside.

530
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,090
He's extremely proud of you,

531
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,860
but would say things that are not that nice.

532
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:08,580
Hey.

533
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,710
Why do you always take his side?

534
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,190
He keeps forcing me to get married.

535
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,850
Why don't you talk about that?

536
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,750
I used you as a shield

537
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,460
to fool my father.

538
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,410
He seems to take it seriously.

539
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,140
He kept asking about you today.

540
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,060
But I...

541
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,430
didn't lie to Duke Er.

542
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,250
What?

543
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,850
I told him last time

544
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,960
that there's nothing between us.

545
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,820
I hope he can respect your choice.

546
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,820
Did you really say that?

547
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,930
I don't want to lie.

548
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,140
Lie?

549
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,080
Was it really a lie?

550
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,750
Didn't you just say

551
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,430
sometimes what people say

552
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,810
is not what they think?

553
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,750
I thought...

554
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,520
You could've also said we are friends.

555
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
There's no need for such a clean cut.

556
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:28,860
I'm leaving.

557
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,750
Don't stay around too long.

558
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,150
You're on duty tomorrow.

559
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,160
[Household Registration Contract]

560
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,170
You're back.

561
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,700
What are you doing?

562
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,770
Nothing.

563
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,530
The settlement document for the refugees to be presented to the Ministry of Rites

564
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,460
is almost ready.

565
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,140
Can those refugees get a household registration in Changle?

566
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,980
I’m afraid not.

567
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,550
But they can stay here for the time being.

568
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,120
It'll save them a lot of trouble.

569
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,460
They don't have to hide

570
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,090
or be easily cheated by bad guys.

571
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,840
I thought they could become a Changle resident.

572
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,320
But this is good enough.

573
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,730
What are you waiting for? Write it.

574
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,910
Ah Shu.

575
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,070
If...

576
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,160
I mean if.

577
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,260
If you can get a household registration in Changle,

578
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,670
will you...

579
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,140
move out?

580
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,710
Of course.

581
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,470
I will not only move out,

582
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,960
but also find the biggest and most beautiful house

583
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,480
in Changle to live in.

584
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,040
What's wrong with my house?

585
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,690
What's not wrong about it?

586
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,630
It's so small.

587
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,840
It has to be divided into two with a curtain.

588
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,250
I have to sleep while listening to your snore.

589
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,130
It's so noisy.

590
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,070
Hey!

591
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,190
Why do you need to live in a huge house by yourself?

592
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,510
It would feel so empty.

593
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,520
You can't annoying people too.

594
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,040
Isn't it good

595
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,290
to live with me here?

596
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,190
At least you have someone to talk to.

597
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,470
I have Poppet with me.

598
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,930
Who wants to live with you?

599
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,900
I'll be free sooner or later.

600
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,830
Hey!

601
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,760
What?

602
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,230
Go on with your writing.

603
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,190
I don't care.

604
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,600
You haven't paid off the debt.

605
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,150
You're not allowed to leave.

606
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,150
Fine.

607
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,810
I'll leave after that.

[Sifang Pavilion]

609
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,330
The registration of refugees

610
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,950
is really a heavy workload.

611
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,210
It'll take at least three to five days.

612
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,170
What are you two doing?

613
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,930
Retainer Wang.

614
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,990
This is the list of refugees

615
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,310
we collected overnight.

616
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,430
[Refugee Registration]

617
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,240
They are listed based on their region, age,

618
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,000
and gender.

619
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,880
All the refugees in Changle are recorded in here.

620
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,280
Just like the West Court.

621
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,710
Right. We must stay together.

622
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,790
Many of these refugees are suffering.

623
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,110
But we will hold their hands

624
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,470
and comfort their broken hearts,

625
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,190
just like a family.

626
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,210
Yes, family.

627
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,890
Retainer Wang.

628
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,520
Staying together is the most important thing for a family, right?

629
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,010
What are you talking about?

630
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,380
What family?

631
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,190
Get back to work.

632
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,420
Go.

633
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,100
Go.

634
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,110
Why are they being so strange?

635
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,150
They have been oddly proactive.

636
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,830
They heard that we are recruiting new people.

637
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,060
They are afraid you would fire both of them.

638
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,390
That's not true.

639
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,090
I told Mr. Yu that there are too many refugees.

640
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,680
We could hire a few servants to help them with the registration.

641
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,320
I see.

642
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,910
Let me tell them that

643
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,250
and have them not worry.

644
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,600
It's good for them to have a sense of crisis.

645
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,990
Wang Kunwu.

646
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
You're terrible.

647
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,800
As influenced by you.

648
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,170

649
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,190
if there are any suspicious people.

650
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,040
Can this Man in White

651
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,719
really come and go without a trace?

652
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,870
As long as he is in Changle,

653
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,550
he will give himself away.

654
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,810
The thing is, who is he looking for

655
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,530
in Changle?

656
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,230
Ms. Ah Shu, please.

658
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,110
Xiao'e.

659
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,090
Why did it suddenly become so severe?

660
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,550
Take your medicine.

661
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:54,960
Here.

662
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,370
It's useless.

663
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,060
I've taken it today.

664
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,760
I don't have much time left.

665
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,790
Thank you for visiting me.

666
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,010
Xiao'e,

667
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,600
do you have any unfulfilled wish?

668
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,290
I can help you.

669
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,120
Thank you.

670
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,490
The outside world is so lively.

671
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,680
Is this your first time at the market?

672
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,990
I heard that by setting a river lantern on this river

673
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,830
and making a wish,

674
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,930
River God will bless you.

675
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,420
I only hope

676
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,870
the refugees in Changle City

677
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,660
will no longer be homeless.

678
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,340
In that way, the sins I've committed in this life will be reduced.

679
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,870
Ah Shu.

680
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,710
In my next life,

681
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,050
I don't want to be reincarnated as a human.

682
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,220
Being a human is too tough.

683
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,550
If possible,

684
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,660
I want to be a fish in the river of Changle City

685
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,840
or a flower on the tree.

686
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,610
I just want to be free.

687
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,800
God,

688
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,840
I sincerely wish

689
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,000
that Xiao'e will be in peace

690
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,140
and free in her next life.

691
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,190
Isn't it fun?

692
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,800
Let me see.

693
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,130
Push it forward.

694
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,880
Look.

695
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,630
Father.

696
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,390
That lantern is so beautiful.

697
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,260
I bought it especially for you.

698
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,040
Make a wish.

699
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460

This might be a relief for Xiao'e.

714
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,830
Xiao'e never had a free life.

715
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,880
Her best age

716
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,390
was spent in the dark Magic Vase.

717
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,080
If I were her,

718
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,510
I would make a wish that I won't be human again in my next life.

719
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,090
Ah Shu.

720
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,870
You're different from her.

721
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,400
You are free.

722
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,180
You may not understand, Yuan Mo.

723
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,710
Rather than being trapped in a cage,

724
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,860
being trapped by fate is every more painful.

725
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,000
But you're right.

726
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,550
Compared to Xiao'e,

727
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,880
I'm considered lucky.

728
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,750
Xiao'e hadn't even turned 16.

729
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,680
In Yanle, she's not even considered an adult.

730
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,750
How was your coming-of-age ceremony like?

731
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,990
I don't even know which day I was born.

732
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,740
Let alone having a coming-of-age ceremony.

733
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,390
You scared me.

734
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,460
Why didn't you many any sound?

735
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,870
Mr. Yu.

736
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,220
This is a plan for the refugees' settlement.

737
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,420
Retainer Wang asked me to pass it to you.

738
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,610
Y-You drafted it?

739
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,050
To rule by law,

740
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,080
they can choose freely...

741
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,780
Not bad.

742
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,790
Brat,

743
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,540
I was right about you.

744
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,880
I'll report it to the Ministry of Rites for approval right now.

745
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,770
This is great.

746
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,390
Yu.

747
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,230
Didn't you say

748
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,270
you need identity documents to submit the application

749
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,870
for Ah Shu's Changle household registration?

750
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,230
I brought them.

751
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,730
You've made up your mind?

752
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,810
Ah Shu used to be your maid.

753
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,720
It’s up to you to let her go.

754
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,800
But with Changle's household registration,

755
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,430
she can leave you anytime.

756
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,290
Although she didn't tell me specifically,

757
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:40,770
I know

758
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,100
to become a Yong,

759
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,510
she has done a lot.

760
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,770
Freedom is more important to her than anything.

761
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,690
I can't keep her by my side

762
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,230
because of my selfishness.

763
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,580
All right, don't worry.

764
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,370
Leave it to me.

765
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,360
But I have a word of advise.

766
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,070
When flowers bloom, one should pluck them promptly.

767
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,320
Don't back down at the critical moment.
