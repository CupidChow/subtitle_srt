My colleagues in West Court,

the annual exam for foreign scholars is around the corner.

173
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,740
The Central Secretariat has ordered us

174
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,090
to cooperate with the Ministry of Personnel

175
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,910
to review the scholars' academic status and qualifications

176
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,310
before approving them for the exam

177
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,030
so that the annual exam goes smoothly.

178
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,260
Even foreign scholars can take the annual exam?

179
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,300
Good question.

180
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,110
Because Yong is receptive of global talents.

181
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,930
Not only can foreign scholars take the exam,

182
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,220
the top-scoring ones can also become officials in Yong.

183
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,930
But the quota is limited.

184
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,090
The competition is fierce.

185
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,960
So this matter

186
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,950
is the most important job of West Court.

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,550
Mr. Yu.

192
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,430
That's unkind of you.

193
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,310
Well...

194
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,510
I will personally take charge of West Court

195
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,230
and handle the work with you.

196
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,870
Shouldn't you be content?

197
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,660
That's right.

198
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,180
Keep your spirits up.

199
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,660
Keep your spirits up!

200
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,510
Maybe the next Minister of Rites

201
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,540
would be one of them.

202
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,130
Among these sixth-rates?

203
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,210
What do you mean?

204
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,470
Sixth-rates are bottom of the barrel in all six arts.

205
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,790
Long Beina.

206
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,850
He's the son of a rich and powerful man in Yanle.

207
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,180
Right, so what are you complaining about?

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,910
Stamp it.

209
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,530
This is also a sixth-rate.

210
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,910
What do these foreign scholars

211
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,120
think of Yong?

212
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,450
Retainer Wang.

213
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,600
Don't be emotional with your work.

214
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,720
Look.

215
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,670
He is a royal of Xiyuan.

216
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,800
With this alone,

217
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,520
shouldn't he be approved for the annual exam?

218
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,830
Whether he passes or not

219
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,360
would depend on his abilities.

220
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,260
Go on.

221
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,310
Ah Shu, it's time to eat.

222
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,750
Thank you, Ling Xiao.

223
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,230
Don't mention it.

224
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,750
I'm sorry about the past.

225
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,630
Forget it.

226
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,580
Take it that we got acquainted through fighting.

227
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,510
But don't worry.

228
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,710
I'm just staying for a few days.

229
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,190
I won't disturb you for too long.

230
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,630
Just stay here in peace.

231
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,620
Eat up.

232
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,670
I'm so hungry.

233
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,350
Isn't it good?

234
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,710
Yes.

235
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,380
Did you quarrel with Young Master Yuan?

236
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,790
Don't mention him.

237
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,310
What's wrong?

238
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,630
Ling Xiao. Ling Xiao!

239
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,670
Young Master Long is here. Come and serve the guest.

240
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,070
Ling Xiao.

241
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,310
Are you not feeling well?

242
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,650
Every time Young Master Long comes,

243
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,160
I've to serve him no matter what.

244
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
Young Master Long? Which one?

245
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,820
The son of Yanle's viceroy.

246
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,620
You won't know even if I tell you.

247
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,850
-Xiao.
-What’s wrong?

248
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,310
Xiao, that man...

249
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,670
It's fine.

250
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,350
You may leave. I’ll handle it.

251
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,260
Young Master Long.

252
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,060
Young Master Long.

253
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,680
Why are you unhappy?

254
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,270
Who made you angry?

255
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,600
Luckily, not a drop spilled.

256
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,200
Thank you.

257
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,030
Drink up. Drink up.

258
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,940
Enjoy the diarrhea later.

259
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,380
Young Master Long!

260
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,310
What are you doing?

261
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,300
Young Master Long!

262
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,450
Young Master Long!

263
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,390
Young Master Long.

264
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,050
I'm not feeling well today.

265
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,620
Young Master Long!

266
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,660
Let's see how unwell you are.

267
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,350
No, Young Master Long.

268
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,350
No, Young Master Long!

269
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,410
If you obey me,

270
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,230
you could be the viceroy's wife!

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,500
Who's that?

272
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,340
Move!

273
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,440
[Ruyi Pavilion]

274
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,770
What a wet blanket.

275
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,430
Young Master.

276
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,680
Did you see them clearly?

277
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,480
A little girl.

278
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,400
I've already taught her a lesson.

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,330
You are a noble man.

280
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,980
There are many who want to harm you.

281
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,510
You need to be more careful.

282
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,430
She's just a thief.

283
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,260
I'm not afraid of her!

284
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,390
Young Master.

285
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,810
What's wrong?

286
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,350
What's wrong?

287
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,310
Are you okay?

288
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,990
Are you okay?

289
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,610
Young Master!

290
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,020
Get me a pair of pants!

291
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,850
Pants?

292
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,300
Get some pants!

293
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,660
It's been two days.

294
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Ah Shu hasn't come back for two days.

295
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,910
Since she didn't take you away,

296
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,630
I thought she just went out for a walk.

297
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,190
I...

298
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,790
Did I get it wrong?

299
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,480
Search your conscience and tell me;

300
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,910
Were my words too harsh?

301
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,570
Were they?

302
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,610
What do you mean?

303
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,080
I was angry too.

304
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,190
I was very angry

305
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,270
and upset.

306
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,260
Besides, it was her fault first.

307
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,850
What's wrong with some complaining?

308
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,430
Fine.

309
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,200
Let's say my words were too harsh.

310
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,550
What should we do now?

311
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,210
Should I go out to find her?

312
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,800
Say something.

313
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,190
Fine. You won't tell me?

314
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,170
I won't go then.

315
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,530
If she gets into trouble,

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
someone will come accuse me.

317
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,080

Hang in there. I'll get you some medicine.

378
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,760
Wait...

379
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,010
Remove the hidden weapon first.

380
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,750
Hidden weapon.

381
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,860
Right, the hidden weapon.

382
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,700
The hidden weapon. Right.

383
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,060
Hidden weapon.

384
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,600
Do you see it?

385
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,430
The wound is too small.

386
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,730
I can't find the hidden weapon. I...

387
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,790
Gouge out my flesh.

388
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,400
What?

389
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,520
Or I'll die.

390
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,030
If you b-bleed too much,

391
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,110
you'll die too.

392
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,830
Suck it out.

393
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,430
Okay.

394
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,350
Is it appropriate?

395
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,610
What are you thinking?

396
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,160
Use this.

397
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,060
Hang in there.

398
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,790
Is it here?

399
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,280
Lower.

400
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,300
Okay.

401
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,240
It might hurt. Bear with it.

402
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,260
You'll be fine.

403
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,440
Yuan Mo.

404
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
I should be the one apologizing.

406
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,430
If it weren't for me,

407
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,960
you wouldn't have got hurt.

408
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,010
I was... I was too unreasonable that day.

409
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,390
I didn't mean to kick you out.

410
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,120
I was just being spiteful. I...

411
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,600
I put you in prison.

412
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,920
Anyone would get angry.

413
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,660
Is your job...

414
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,530
tough?

415
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,950
It's worse than death.

416
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,020
Fortunately, I get a salary.

417
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,250
It's here.

418
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,390
It's coming out. Hang in there.

419
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,320
Hang in there.

420
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,560
Ah Shu.

421
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Ah Shu!

422
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,840
Ah Shu!

423
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,160
It's hot.

424
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,590
Thank you.

425
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,770
For what?

426
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,500
Have you forgotten

427
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,850
that in this house,

428
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,360
you are the real master?

429
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,130
Then why isn't the servant satisfied

430
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,210
with the master's redecoration of the home?

431
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,150
You know what?

432
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,950
It reminded me

433
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,010
to find you by setting off fireworks.

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,330
The painting's not bad.

435
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,050
Don't paint again.

436
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,770
Are you mocking me?

437
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Is it that bad?

438
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,490
Why are there two people?

439
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,790
Didn't you say you wanted to live alone?

440
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,710
How was it?

441
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,110
Was it quiet enough without me at home?

442
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,670
Why do you hold grudges so pettily?

443
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,390
If you hadn't insisted on selling fake rouge,

444
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,270
I wouldn't have been so angry.

445
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,910
Why do you have to go out to make money?

446
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,990
Am I not good to you?

447
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,860
I’m used to it.

448
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,000
This is how I’ve been on my way to Changle.

449
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,790
Only when I have money

450
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,660
will I not be anxious.

451
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,790
Fine.

452
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,360
How about this?

453
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,150
Help me out and I will

454
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,170
record them.

455
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,130
I'll pay you at the end of the month.

456
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,400
Then you won't have to go out to make a scene...

457
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,160
t-to make a living.

458
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,470
Ah Shu.

459
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,790
I've been wanting to ask you this.

460
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,360
The wound on your...

461
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,130
Back...

462
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,970
Sleep well.

463
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,650
You're home,

464
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,350
so sleep in peace.

465
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,090
Silly fool.

466
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,570
It's not like I can't move.

467
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,250
[Exclusively for Ah Shu's prescription creation]

468
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,400
Why did he write that?

469
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,800
Do you think I care to sit here with you?

470
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,270
Oh no. I'm screwed.

471
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,220
I'm late. I'm late.

472
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,250
Will this work?

473
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,130
The annual exam is coming.

474
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,630
If I fail the exam and am sent back home,

475
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,190
how should I explain to my parents?

476
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,640
-I know.
-That's right.

477
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,650
Don't worry.

478
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,570
I've made a deal with Ji and Shen.

479
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,700
With this,

480
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,830
they'd get us the certificates of commendation.

481
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,460
This...

482
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,680
Ji and Shen?

483
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,190
Yes.

484
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,670
Certificates of commendation?

485
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,450
Yes.

486
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,620
I can't write any more.

487
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,540
Take your time.

488
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,740
From Dongyuan.

489
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,950
From Xiyuan.

490
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,340
Yanle.

491
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,280
Impossible.

492
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,090
They are waiting.

493
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,660
What are you doing?

494
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,150
Let me see.

495
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:20,790
None of your business.

496
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,740
-Leave.
-None of your business.

497
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,000
None of your business.

498
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,960
Bravo.

499
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,960
You sure are bold.

500
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,610
How dare you collude with foreign scholars to forge certs?

501
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,350
That's not true!

502
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,130
Who forged what?

503
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:31,610
Fine.

504
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,290
I'll talk to Wang Kunwu.

505
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,110
Let's talk things out nicely.

506
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,500
Come, have a seat.

507
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,750
Come, have a seat.

508
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,420
It's not forgery.

509
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,980
Check it out for yourself.

510
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,150
See?

511
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,350
Samaritan from Changle?

512
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,280
Acted bravely for a just cause?

513
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,970
Missing persons notice?

514
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Guardian of the clear river?

515
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,540
How's this not forgery?

516
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,710
Who'd believe this?

517
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,830
Their parents can't read the Yong language.

518
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,850
You're making dirty money, you know?

519
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,240
How is it dirty money?

520
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,820
This thing

521
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,810
can help those repatriated scholars

522
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,300
cheer their parents up.

523
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,970
Besides,

524
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,820
Shen is a master of forgery.

525
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,350
He can imitate the handwriting and seals of famous figures.

526
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,270
It's even more real than the real deal.

527
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,130
How much are you selling them for?

528
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,970
Not much.

529
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,190
50 wens.

530
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,740
50 wens?

531
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,540
50 wens must still be reported to Wang Kunwu.

532
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,220
100 wens.

533
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,750
Kunwu.

534
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,900
No... 150!

535
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,950
Well...

536
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,300
200 is the maximum,

537
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,660
or we don't get profits.

538
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,050
200 is reasonable.

539
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,590
Come on.

540
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
200 wens per cert?

541
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,530
Five certs mean one string of coins.

542
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,160
I saw a dozen or so waiting outside!

543
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,220
Alright, alright.

544
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,300
Sit down.

545
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,900
Sit.

546
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,130
Yuan Mo, buddy...

547
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,080
If you keep it a secret,

548
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,820
we'll count you in.

549
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,960
We must help the scholars

550
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,990
maintain

551
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,230
family harmony.

552
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,630
Here.

553
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,810
Write it.

554
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,010
Begin.

555
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,280
-Not pocketing found money!
-Not pocketing found money!

556
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,900
Neat handwriting.

557
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,710
I want it!

558
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,790
I want it!

559
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,430
Everyone will get one!

560
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,550
Calm down. Line up.

561
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,230
Give me one!

562
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,710
Line up or we won't sell it!

563
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,230
One by one. Everyone has a share.

564
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,750
Okay, pay up.

565
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,220
Mine.

566
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,750
And mine.

567
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:56,990
Yours.

568
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,630
Take the one on the floor.

569
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,360
That's mine.

570
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,170
Wait!

571
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,260
Missing persons notice?

572
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,530
Take it or leave it.

573
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,350
If there's a problem, can we exchange it?

574
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:04,990
Yes.

575
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
What's your name?

576
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm from Sifang Pavilion's West Court.

577
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,190
I'm Wang Kunwu.

578
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,030
I need to pee.

579
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,670
Excuse me.

580
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:27,910
Me too.

581
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,350
Me too.

582
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,010
Stop there!

583
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,530
West Court's Wang Kunwu, right?

584
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,520
They're all here.

585
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,180
Still warm.

586
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,720
As members of Sifang Pavilion,

587
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,040
you did such a thing

588
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,370
out of greed.

589
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,980
Just like profiteers!

590
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,770
If you aren't punished severely,

591
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,500
how could we defend Sifang Pavilion's prestige?

592
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,210
Retainer Wang.

593
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:57,650
Mr. Yu.

594
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,040
I...

595
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,390
Have you forgotten our promise?

596
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,340
Punish them severely.

597
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,930
Absolutely!

598
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,140
You are so ridiculous!

599
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,840
You three will be

600
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,130
fined three months' salary each!

601
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,170
A-And circulate a notice of criticism throughout East and West Courts!

602
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,390
What's wrong?

603
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,900
I lost money that I earned.

604
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,130
You've recovered?

605
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,100
When I'm so skilled at concocting antidotes, that's a given.

606
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,900
That's right.

607
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,250
By the way,

608
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,890
I also wanted to ask you

609
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,370
why you got attacked by a hidden weapon.

610
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,460
A playboy bullied Ling Xiao.

611
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,150
I couldn't stand it, so I got into a fight.

612
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,350
A playboy?

613
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,360
Which playboy?

614
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,910
I'll go teach him a lesson!

615
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,600
Forget it.

616
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,390
What will you do with your uncoordinated limbs?

617
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,790
Pay me my monthly salary.

618
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,930
I'll let him off for now.

619
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
What monthly salary?

620
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,020
Tomorrow is the first day of the lunar month.

621
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,740
I've been cleaning

622
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,900
and serving tea.

623
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,850
I won't ask for much.

624
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,050
One string is enough.

625
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,410
Settling accounts?

626
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,070
Okay. Sure, sure.

627
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,440
Let me calculate things with you.

628
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,340
20 strings for victim compensation.

629
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,020
50 wens for daily breakfast.

630
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,400
520 wens for the lounge chair and umbrella.

631
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,100
I won't count the emotional distress

632
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,910
from imprisonment.

633
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,910
Including miscellaneous stuff,

634
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,290
you still owe me 21 strings and 272 wens.

635
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,920
Pay up.

636
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,960
Yuan Mo.

637
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,540
Is this how you treat a patient who just recovered?

638
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,270
You're recovered all the same.

639
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,380
Shouldn't we settle the accounts clearly?

640
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:56,940
Pay up.

641
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,430
Fine!

642
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,820
Let me calculate things with you too.

643
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,820
I helped you track down Kudel,

644
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,890
and

645
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,880
I saved your life in Nanshan.

646
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,970
How much are those?

647
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,050
Plus those miscellaneous things...

648
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,430
Yes.

649
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,720
I didn't think it through.

650
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,760
I didn't think it through.

651
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,620
How about this?

652
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,700
Round it down.

653
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,690
You still owe me 21 strings.

654
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,210
Pay up.

655
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,470
Is your life just worth 272 wens?

656
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,830
Besides,

657
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,590
I'm your maid anyway.

658
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,620
How can we calculate these wages?

659
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,970
Stop pushing me to the edge.

660
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,870
Since you violated our agreement

661
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,510
and put me in prison,

662
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,730
we were no longer master and servant.

663
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,990
We're just creditor and debtor.

664
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,190
Ouch...

665
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,550
My wound...

666
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,340
Sure. Keep acting.

667
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,220
You still have to pay me back.

668
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,500
How long will it take to pay this much back?

669
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,940
Don't be anxious. Just pay it back slowly.

670
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,800
Look.

671
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,140
Laundry, cooking,

672
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,530
cleaning, and massages all count.

673
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,200
I'll pay you at the end of every month.

674
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,239
The more work you do, the higher the wage.

675
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,400
What if I don't pay you back?

676
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,060
Then even if I've to scratch my entire face,

677
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,590
I'll make sure you have a taste of prison life.

678
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,080
Morning, Creditor.

679
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,949
You have a job now.

680
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,949
You need to arrive at Sifang Pavilion on time.

681
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,469
I'm providing you with a wake-up service.

682
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,350
10 wens each. It's cheap.

683
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,350
I can't hear you.

684
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,950
50 wens for breakfast.

685
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
How are a few pancakes worth 50 wens?

686
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,870
No problem.

687
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,250
Eat outside if this is too expensive for you.

688
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,650
But I don't know if

689
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,030
you'll make it to work on time.

690
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,140
It's only 50 wens.

691
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,290
I can afford it.

692
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,050
Even so,

693
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,510
it'll take at least six or seven years

694
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,240
for you to pay everything back.

695
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,440
Delicious.

696
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,430
10 wens.

697
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,450
20 wens.

698
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,350
30 wens.

699
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,360
Hey!

700
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,660
I've... I've already paid.

701
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,510
10 wens to go.

702
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,640
50 wens.

703
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,710
What is this again?

704
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,490
My creditor is distinguished.

705
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,370
How can you walk to Sifang Pavilion?

706
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,310
I set up a sedan to pick you up every day.

707
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,760
500 wens back and forth.

708
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,590
I walk faster

709
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,870
than them carrying me.

710
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,610
No problem.

711
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,650
The wake-up service can commence an hour earlier.

712
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,530
10 wens extra.

713
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,260
I don't need it.

714
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,730
Don't follow me. Stop.

715
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,750
Don't follow me. It's too high-profile.

716
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,350
Stay away from me. Stay away.

717
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,530
Did you make this?

718
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,560
500 wens per month.

719
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,990
If the rouge you make sells well,

720
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'll pay you more.

721
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,420
So you're willing to hire me?

722
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,880
Come to work tomorrow.

723
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,990
By the way, there's one more thing.

724
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,860
Instead of researching my formulas at the shop,

725
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,340
can I do it at home?

726
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,390
I'd like a little more freedom.

727
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,960
Okay.

728
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,180
But you have to buy the raw materials yourself.

729
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,870
No problem.

730
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,150
I will work hard.

731
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,680
Thank you, Boss.

[Literature Hall]

Mr. Huang.

734
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,110
Every year, when the annual exam is near,

735
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,400
there will always be incompetent scholars from different states

736
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,760
scheming to curry favor

737
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,910
for a passing grade to stay in Yong.

738
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,230
This tea shop is their usual hangout spot.

739
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,630
[Mu Yikuan]

740
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,790

Suqin.

742
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,580
Give it to me.

743
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,750
My Lady.

744
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,940
Isn't that Young Master Mu?

745
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,860
Why are you here?

746
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,550
[Bai Suqin]

747
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,970
I came to see you.

748
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,230
What do you want to eat later?

749
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,430
My cousin is here too.

750
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,750
I heard Director Bai has agreed

751
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,210
to your cousin's marriage with the lower-status Mu Yikuan.

752
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,620
As long as my cousin is happy,

753
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,250
status doesn't matter.

754
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,750
Besides, Mu Yikuan

755
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,870
is much better than those playboys.

756
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,390
He's from a poor family but well-educated.

757
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,190
He excels in all the six arts.

758
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,490
Director Bai made an exception by accepting him into Literature Hall.

759
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,740
Though he's from Yanle,

760
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,270
he admires Yong's culture.

761
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,770
He came all the way here to study.

762
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,460
He even named himself Mu Yikuan, a Yong name.

763
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,180
Hong Ye and I came

764
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,880
to choose fabrics for the wedding outfits,

765
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,370
[Maid, Hong Ye]

766
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,500
so I came to see you on the way.

767
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,750
Let's go.

768
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,190
If only every foreign scholar

769
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,990
could be like Mu Yikuan.

770
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,800
[Sifang Pavilion]

771
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,440
Have you heard?

772
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,860
When I went to relieve myself,

773
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,170
I heard East Court's people saying

774
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,170
that An Xiuyi is meeting Long Beina.

775
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,700
Long Beina?

776
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
That sixth-rate?

777
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,800
The annual exam is around the corner.

778
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,400
If An Xiuyi is meeting him...

779
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,290
Get it?

780
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,550
Is East Court also trying to make a quick buck?

781
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,920
It’s possible.

782
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,610
Just do your job well.

783
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,050
Others’ business has nothing to do with West Court.

784
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,060
How does it not?

785
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,030
An Xiuyi's meeting with a foreign scholar before the annual exam.

786
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,640
If it involves money,

787
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,710
it's not just East Court

788
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,860
but the entire Yong court that will be humiliated!

789
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,430
What will the other states

790
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,860
think of Yong then?

791
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,870
Yes...

792
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,140
Where did he go?

793
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,800
Two taels for this.

794
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,000
Smell it.

795
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,630
Thank you.

796
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,320
Come again next time.

797
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,130
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

798
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,370
Retainer Wang, are you following me?

799
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,440
This lady has been following me too.

800
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,200
Wait, you...

801
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,050
Why are you following them?

802
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,090
My previous wound

803
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,820
was caused by his subordinate.

804
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,420
Retainer An.

805
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,970
Can you explain

806
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,490
what's in this box?

807
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,350
Why should I?

808
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,100
I followed you all the way.

809
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,210
You had nothing in your hands.

810
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,150
After you met Young Master Long,

811
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,820
this box appeared in your hands.

812
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,140
I have to suspect it.

813
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
That's right.

814
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,110
I followed him all the way too.

815
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,170
This brocade box was originally his.

816
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,640
What is this called?

817
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,590
Caught red-handed.

818
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,880
You suspect I'm taking bribes from Young Master Long?

819
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,630
If not,

820
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,380
why don't you prove your innocence?

821
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,270
Open it.

822
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,350
A row of fine daggers as a gift.

823
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,680
They must be expensive.

824
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,230
In Yanle, these are toys.

825
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,500
I asked Young Master An out to shoot willows in the suburbs.

826
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,620
We used Yong's bows and arrows last time.

827
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,150
This time, we'll use Yanle's flying daggers.

828
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,070
So this is called bribery in Yong.

829
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,550
Retainer Wang.

830
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,000
Do you know what willow shooting is?

831
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,380
It doesn't matter if you don't.

832
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,340
If you beg me,

833
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,510
I can teach you.

834
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,220
Do I need you to teach me?

835
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,060
So you know how.

836
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,680
Do you dare to compete?

837
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,160
Sure!

838
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,490
There's a reward.

839
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,840
Wait, wait.

840
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,110
Don't act tough.

841
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,120
Willow shooting is a palace game.

842
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,970
You can't beat these nobles.

843
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,110
Half a year's salary.

844
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,110
Deal.
