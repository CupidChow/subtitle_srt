00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,820
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,050
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

4
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,880
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

5
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,920
You four, go over there.

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,580
-Yes!
-Yes!

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,500
Arrest him!

8
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,470
There's nothing to see!

9
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,550
He caused trouble while drunk.

10
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,670
He's now under Jingzhao's arrest.

11
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,470
Disperse!

12
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,070
Take him away.

13
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:18,750
Go!

14
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,850
What are you doing? Pay for my wine!

15
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
My wine!

16
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,460
It's him.

17
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,270
Disperse!

18
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,870
-Everyone, quickly disperse!
-Disperse!

19
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,510
Disperse!

20
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,470
You'll die with me!

21
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,250
Run! It's a poison bomb!

22
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,220
Stone!

23
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,390
Who are you?

24
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,940
Yuan Mo from Sifang Pavilion.

25
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,340
I have urgent business with the princess.

26
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,140
Let him in!

27
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:16,930
-Yes!
-Yes!

28
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,529
Yuan Mo, why are you here?

29
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,130
Yuchi Hua.

30
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,149
I thought you weren't coming.

31
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,610
Man in White will detonate

32
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,030
self-made poison bombs in Changle.

33
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,560
What?

34
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,720
Sifang Pavilion and Jingzhao's soldiers

35
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,590
are investigating it.

36
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,110
But it's very dangerous here.

37
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,190
I suspect their real target is Ah Shu.

38
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,880
We should evacuate the crowd first.

39
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,040
Everyone, please stop.

40
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,290
There's an emergency now.

41
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,900
Please do as I say.

42
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,800
Return to your rooms and close all doors and windows.

43
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,470
Take care of the elderly and young.

44
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,990
No matter what you hear later,

45
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,030
do not come out.

46
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,260
Understand?

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,070
Let's all listen to the princess.

48
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,830
Hurry, go!

49
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,550
Back to your rooms!

50
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,880
-Hurry, go!
-Hurry, go!

51
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,400
Ah Shu.

52
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,050
This place is remote.

53
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,720
If something happens, rescue will be difficult.

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,850
We should leave too.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,530
Let's go.

56
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,830
Your Highness.

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,320
Poison bombs have exploded in the market.

58
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,360
There are casualties.

59
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,750
I've been ordered by Magistrate Lin

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,100
to dispatch Jingzhao troops there to assist.

61
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,070
Dispatch the men away?

62
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,270
What about the princess' safety?

63
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,710
There aren't enough men in the city.

64
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm just following orders.

65
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,700
Hua.

66
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,710
Let them go.

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,510
Don't worry, with you and San Niang,

68
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,420
we'll be fine.

69
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,420
Leave six men here!

70
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
The rest can go with you.

71
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,980
Yes.

72
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,090
The rest, follow me!

73
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,750
-Yes!
-Yes!

74
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,080
Ah Shu.

75
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,270
Let's leave now.

76
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,800
Let's go.

77
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,150
Put out the fire.

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,190
I wonder how the people in the market are doing.

79
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,300
Don't worry.

80
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,659
Wang Kunwu and the others will surely catch The Faceless members

81
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,990
and protect the people.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
But as for you,

83
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,210
I have a feeling...

84
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,160
Man in White deliberately caused chaos throughout the city

85
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,600
as a diversion.

86
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,750
The carriage's stopped.

87
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,750
Why's it stopped?

88
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,270
Cover the windows!

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,830
Okay.

90
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,750
This carriage won't hold out for long.

91
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,390
If this continues, we'll all die here.

92
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,940
San Niang.

93
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,070
Let's charge out together.

94
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,140
It's our only hope.

95
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,750
No!

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
It's stopped.

97
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
Help has arrived.

98
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,380
Stay here.

99
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,320
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

100
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,160
We're safe now.

101
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,430
Come down.

102
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,980
-Greetings, Your Highness!
-Greetings, Your Highness!

103
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,070
I, Longshuang Yueshu, thank you for saving my life.

104
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,160
May I ask who you are?

105
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,200
Ah Shu.

106
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,750
They're my undercover agents in Changle

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,280
for emergencies like this.

108
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,750
Uncle Kang.

109
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,000
I was late.

110
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,169
Please forgive me.

111
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,100
Thank you, Uncle Kang.

112
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,470
Thank you all for tonight.

113
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,320
Your Highness.

114
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,800
Man in White is severely injured and on the run.

115
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,830
You're not in immediate danger for now.

116
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,310
Well,

117
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,010
please escort the princess back home.

118
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,730
I'll summon you again if needed.

119
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,390
-Yes!
-Yes!

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,660
Deputy Envoy Kang.

121
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,610
There are still The Faceless members in the city.

122
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,190
Please be careful as well.

123
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,790
Yuan Mo is right.

124
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,050
Let them escort you back home first.

125
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,030
How about

126
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,730
two people stay with me?

127
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,370
Okay?

128
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,210
San Niang.

129
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,720
Please, Your Highness.

130
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,470
Then please be careful.

131
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,180
Go quickly.

132
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

133
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,530
[Princess's Mansion]

134
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,270
I, Lin Zuocheng, welcome Princess Longshuang back home.

135
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,840
Thank you for your trouble.

136
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,310
How are the people on the streets?

137
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,750
Rest assured, Your Highness.

138
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,470
The Faceless members with poison bombs

139
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,470
have been eliminated by the troops.

140
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,150
Except for a few who inhaled the poison and needed treatment,

141
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,060
everyone else is safe and sound.

142
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,190
Stone.

143
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,490
Where's Stone?

144
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,800
How's Stone?

145
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,400
Wang.

146
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,760
What happened to Stone?

147
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,210
To protect the people around him,

148
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,630
Stone hugged a poison bomb into a warehouse.

149
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,080
My condolences, Your Highness.

150
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,500
Fortunately, Yuan Mo discovered where the poison bombs were headed in time,

151
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,150
minimizing the casualties

152
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,350
in Changle City.

153
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,070
Uncle Lin.

154
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,630
Can the Jingzhao troops

155
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,020
stay at Princess's Mansion to protect her for now?

156
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,620
Alright.

157
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,210
Stay at the Princess's Mansion.

158
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,200
You must ensure her safety.

159
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,120
-Yes!
-Yes!

160
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,360
Thank you, Magistrate Lin.

161
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,330
It's my duty.

162
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,110
I won't disturb you any further.

163
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,660
I'll take my leave.

164
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,770
Tonight...

165
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,650
We'll all be here with you.

166
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,050
You may leave now.

167
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,230
Ah Shu.

168
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,870
Don't be too sad.

169
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm thinking...

170
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,320
Jingzhao's soldiers,

171
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,430
Yuan Mo's parents,

172
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,450
and Uncle Kang and the others.

173
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,000
So many people risking their lives for me.

174
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,910
Is it worth it?

175
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,310
Even if you were a nobody,

176
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,720
my father would still have saved you.

177
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,270
He often said

178
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,170
a true man wants nothing

179
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,560
but a clear conscience.

180
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,350
I think everyone's the same.

181
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,120
They just did what they thought was right.

182
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,950
So everything tonight

183
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,860
was for me.

184
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,790
Kang Yunhai, oh, Kang Yunhai.

185
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,970
You've made it so hard for me to find you.

186
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
You should know

187
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,670
the consequences of betraying Viceroy Long.

188
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,170
I can die here.

189
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,830
But can you let the princess go

190
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,950
and let her live in peace?

191
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,000

378
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,790
he would be sad.

379
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,950
Uncle Kang.

380
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,310
You haven't worn the robe I bought for you, have you?

381
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,680
I don't know if you liked it.

382
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,580
Yuan Mo said Changle's winters are very cold.

383
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,630
Sometimes it even snows heavily.

384
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,170
With a fur robe,

385
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,070
you'd be a bit warmer.

386
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,220
And those boots...

387
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,900
If you wear them in winter,

388
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,900
your feet won't be cold.

389
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
I remember you once said

390
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,389
that when you were young,

391
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,360
your greatest wish was to travel the world and visit all states.

392
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,980
If it weren't for me,

393
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,929
you'd have fulfilled that wish long ago, wouldn't you?

394
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,389
Uncle Kang.

395
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,270
You'd worked too hard in this life.

396
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,640
In the next life, let's be family again.

397
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,000
Then, Yuan Mo and I

398
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,810
will take you to travel the world.

399
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,910
From Yueying to Yuluo,

400
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,800
then to Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

401
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,210
We'll never be separated again.

402
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,310
Uncle Kang.

403
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,500
Rest in peace.

404
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,010
I'll take good care of myself too.

405
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,920
Don't worry about me.

406
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,910
I promise you...

407
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,470
I will live well.

408
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,060
Some day...

409
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,510
we'll find the Man in White

410
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,940
and avenge you.

411
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,510
Uncle Kang wasn't wearing blue clothes.

412
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,060
Could it be from the killer?

413
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,930
[Yanle Embassy]

414
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,140
Deputy Envoy Kang was fine just yesterday.

415
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,260
To think we'd receive such news today.

416
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,660
He was such a good person.

417
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,280
I just don't know

418
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,460
who'll take his position next.

419
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,470
They said the replacement is on the way.

420
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,530
Let's wait and see.

421
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,900
Ma Zhiwen?

422
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,990
Advisor Ma?

423
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,430
Why are you back?

424
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,540
Yes.

425
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,890
Didn't Deputy Envoy Kang transfer you away from Yanle Embassy

426
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,890
and send you home?

427
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,030
-Long live Viceroy Long!
-Long live Viceroy Long!

428
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,690
Everyone in Yanle Embassy, listen to my orders!

429
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,430
Former Deputy Envoy of Yanle, Kang Yunhai,

430
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,260
appeared loyal to Viceroy Long

431
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,760
but was secretly colluding with Yong State for personal gain.

432
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,070
His crime is unforgivable!

433
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,870
No way.

434
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,990
How could this be?

435
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,690
Impossible! Absolutely impossible!

436
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,350
How could Deputy Envoy Kang be a traitor?

437
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,710
Don't think you can deceive us

438
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,870
with a fake token!

439
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,550
Don't believe him!

440
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,460
Deputy Envoy Kang couldn't be a traitor!

441
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,140
Ma Zhiwen!

442
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,200
You scoundrel! Scoundrel!

443
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,130
Let go of me!

444
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,090
Whether you believe it or not,

445
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,120
it's now an irrefutable crime.

446
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,630
By order of the Yanle court,

447
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,670
I'll enter the Yanle Embassy now

448
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,200
to assume the position of Yanle's Deputy Envoy.

449
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,510
I'll set things right and turn the tide.

450
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
From now on,

451
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,740
don't call me Advisor Ma.

452
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,870
Call me Deputy Envoy Ma.

453
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,730
-Yes, Deputy Envoy Ma.
-Yes, Deputy Envoy Ma.

454
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,290
Now that I'm the deputy envoy,

455
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,290
I won't treat you poorly.

456
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,790
Get up.

457
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,810
All of you, get up.

Compile a report on the embassy's recent events

461
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,080
and submit it to me for review and approval.

462
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,000
Alright?

463
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,800
-Okay.
-Yes.

464
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,670

465
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,590
Close the door.

466
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,990

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,460
My Lord.

468
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,170
How is it, Deputy Envoy Ma?

469
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,050
Are you satisfied with your new position?

470
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,760
Yes.

471
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,560
Extremely satisfied!

472
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,730
I thank Viceroy Long for his great kindness.

473
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,010
Thank you for your trust, My Lord.

474
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,030
Without you two,

475
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,520
I wouldn't be where I am today!

476
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,470
I spared your life.

477
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,980
But from now on,

478
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,490
you must know whom to be loyal to.

479
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,900
You are now Deputy Envoy Ma.

480
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,790
Don't kneel to everyone you see.

481
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,060
Act like a deputy envoy, understand?

482
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,760
Yes.

483
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,890
Go on.

484
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,340
Sit there.

485
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,150
That's where you should be sitting.

486
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,750
Go.

487
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,890
That's right.

488
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,370
There's something I want to ask you.

489
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
When you were by Kang Yunhai's side,

490
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,880
did you notice if

491
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,390
he had any contact with the old ministers loyal to

492
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,650
the late king of Yanle?

493
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,990
I...

494
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,140
had never noticed.

495
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,070
So that means

496
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,790
you don't know

497
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,990
about a blood letter jointly signed by the old ministers?

498
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,390
I don't.

499
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,770
Kang Yunhai was very discreet.

500
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,450
He wouldn't let me know about these things.

501
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,200
However, there is one thing that's very strange.

502
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,320
Tell me about it.

503
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,320
I once caught Kang Yunhai secretly going out.

504
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,990
I asked him where he was going.

505
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,800
He said he was going to look for ancient scores.

506
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,360
But I knew he was lying.

507
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,500
He went somewhere.

508
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,670
Where?

509
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,190

00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,360

Next, you'll bark.

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,920
Bark?

519
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,780
Bark until Changle is turned upside down

520
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,300
and in utter mayhem!

521
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,050
I understand.

522
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,830

He was like a father to her.
