I've really thought it through.

190
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,600
I know you care about me,

191
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,440
but don't worry.

192
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,710
I really know what I'm doing.

193
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,290
Just leave this matter to me.

194
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,630
Leave this matter to you?

195
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,590
I've been looking after you for over ten years,

196
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,990
and now you're telling me to leave it to you?

197
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,320
You little rascal.

198
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,750
What are you doing?

199
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,150
These are the classics I've collected for you.

200
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,920
They contain records of customs and traditions of various states,

201
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,350
astronomy, geography, official systems, and military organizations.

202
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,910
Memorize them before the exam.

203
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,830
They'll definitely be useful.

204
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,980
Isn't this too much?

205
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,560
What do you mean by too much?

206
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,990
I was already late in getting these.

207
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,390
An Xiuyi took two large boxes of books and records before me.

208
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,320
These are just what he left behind.

209
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,590
What's the use of studying?

210
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,350
You need to learn and apply it practically.

211
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,270
Can he really memorize

212
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,430
and finish reading all of them?

213
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,710
Why do you care about what he does?

214
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,670
Even glancing at it is better than not looking at all.

215
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,470
Who says so?

216
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,240
It's all useless.

217
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,040
That's all...

218
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
An Xiuyi is already so outstanding,

219
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,470
yet he's still working hard.

220
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,670
Now look at yourself.

221
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,920
You're still talking about becoming a Sifang Envoy to accompany me to Yanle.

222
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,840
Do you think you can outperform An Xiuyi like this?

223
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,900
Fine, I'll memorize it. Is that okay?

224
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,420
Yueying is 2,800 li west of Changle,

225
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,210

226
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,700
and 400 li north to south.

It has a total of eighteen cities.

228
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,830
Besides the written tests on language, diplomacy, and customs,

229
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,790
the Sifang Envoy selection also includes a physical fitness test.

230
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,400
A weakling can't represent Yong as an envoy.

231
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,790
If you encounter villains on the way,

232
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,070
a Sifang Envoy must master the skills to kill bandits and protect oneself.

233
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,670

234
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,040
Yes.

235
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,060
One.

236
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,560
Two.

237
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,570
Three.

238
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,330
Four.

239
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,950
Five.

240
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,520

Again.

243
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,589
The Mobei grasslands

244
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,290
are vast and boundless,

245
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,650
with cattle, sheep, and...

246
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,630
Cattle, sheep, and horses

247
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,109
in countless numbers.

248
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,400
I can understand it now!

249
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,630
If that Duomi dares

250
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,670
to write you love letters again in the future,

251
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,430

252
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,220
On land, a wolf.

253
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,550
In water, a dragon.

254
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,350
One.

255
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,190
Two.

Three.

257
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,550
Four.

258
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,390
Five.

259
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,220
Six.

Seven.

261
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,630
Yuluo borders Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

262
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,880
The Bulu River serves as the boundary.

263
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,350
-The citizens of Yuluo and the two states often cross the border without permission,
-Poppet.

264
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,230
causing friction.

265
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,110
I'm familiar with this part.

266
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,510
The disputes between Yuluo and the two states

267
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,990
were resolved with the help of our Sifang Pavilion.

268
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,720
You're familiar with it?

269
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,940
An Xiuyi knows it even better.

270
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,250
This matter was actually handled by An Xiuyi.

271
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:16,890
Continue.

272
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,430
There were three areas of conflict.

273
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,820
The first one...

274
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,410
[Sifang Pavilion]

275
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,140
This year's competition

276
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,430
is much more intense than previous years.

277
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,190
Indeed.

278
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,510
Retainer An

279
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,860
has been contemplating becoming a Sifang Envoy for how many years now?

280
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,790
This time, in order to avenge Susu,

281
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,490
he must win first place.

282
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,790
In that case,

283
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,320
doesn't Yuan Mo have no hope at all?

284
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,370
I don't think so.

285
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,880
Ah Shu has been intensively training Yuan Mo

286
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,190
for months now.

287
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,550
For Ah Shu's sake,

288
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,190
Yuan Mo will probably fight with all his might.

289
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,790
Whether he can succeed or not

290
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,450
depends on his own fortune.

291
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,850
I think he still has a chance in the written test,

292
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,650
but as for martial arts...

293
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,760
Can Yuan Mo's small build really handle it?

294
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,390
Why are you resorting to personal attacks?

295
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,710
Yuan Mo will fight for the honor of the West Court.

296
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,310
Alright.

297

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,350
Are we betting or not?

300
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,030
Of course we are!

On behalf of Yuan Mo, I thank you.

311
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,520
No need for that.

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,790

No need for formalities.

321
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,670
Isn't it annoying to be so formal all the time?

322
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,750
Won't you let me rest for a while?

323

Ah Shu,

328
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,910
is it because you've become a princess

329
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,930
that you have endless money to spend,

330
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,990
or is it that you have such confidence

331
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,710
in Yuan Mo?

332
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,390
It's not about believing in Yuan Mo

333
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,310
but about believing in true feelings.

334
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,430
I was just joking.

335
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,670

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,350
if everyone is betting on the same side?

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,830
Just follow your delegation

375
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,310
to Yanle together?

376
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,790
Is this your first day at the Sifang Pavilion?

377
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,590
Go and check.

378
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,710
Has Yong ever had a precedent

379
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,310
of sending two Sifang Envoys to the same state?

380
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,910
There are so many neighboring states.

381
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,840
Wouldn't that be a waste of talent?

382
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,270
Mr. Bai is here, here he comes!

383
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,190
He's coming out, he's coming out!

384
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,650
The teacher is coming out!

385
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,690
Director Bai.

386
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,920
Next,

387
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,710
I will announce

388
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,430
the top three candidates for the Sifang Envoy selection exam this round.

389
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,240
They will be determined by the Ministry of Rites

390
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,840
to represent Yong as envoys to various states.

391
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,030
The one who takes first place

392
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,630
will also become the special envoy

393
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,300
escorting Princess Longshuang back to Yanle.

394
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,310
Who will receive this honor?

395
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,980
Let's wait and see.

396
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,750
The third place goes to...

397
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,490
Cheng Jingyao.

398
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,070
I got third place!

399
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,750
I actually got third place!

400
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,870
Congratulations, congratulations!

401
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,070
Thank you, everyone.

402
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,890
Thank you, thank you.

403
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,570
Next, we will announce the second place.

404
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,130
He is...

405
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,410
Yuan Mo!

406
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,230
Yuan Mo, Young Master Yuan.

407
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,020
Yuan Mo, Yuan Mo!

408
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,340
Alright, it's you, Yuan Mo!

409
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,270
Yuan Mo, you're amazing!

410
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,510
Great! Yuan Mo, you're amazing.

411
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,640
Wonderful. Yuan Mo.

412
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,690
Yuan Mo!

413
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,910
Yuan Mo, Yuan Mo!

414
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,750
Congratulations, congratulations!

415
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,680
That's amazing!

416
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,300
Congratulations!

417
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,860
[No.1: An Xiuyi]

418
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,510
[Yuan Mansion]

419
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,790
Si Niang.

420
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,030
Has the Lingxi wine you ordered from Inebriation Restaurant

421
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,830
arrived yet?

422
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,300
It'll be here in about an hour, Your Highness.

423
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,230
That's perfect.

424
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,920
I can still make a bowl of fish soup.

425
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,120
Yuan Mo said it was delicious last time.

426
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,790
I'll show off my skills again today

427
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,720
and surprise him.

428
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,780
Your Highness.

429
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,520
How can you cook by yourself?

430
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,080
What's wrong with that?

431
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,940
Today is the day Yuan Mo's results are announced.

432
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,950
Of course we should celebrate properly.

433
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,590
San Niang.

434
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,810
Go check if the meat in the pot is ready.

435
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,340
Alright.

436
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,670
Set the table again.

437
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,020
I have important matters to discuss with Vice Minister An.

438
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,080
It won't take long.

439
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,350
You... let me in.

440
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,310
Let him in.

441
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,750
I was in a hurry, Your Excellency.

442
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,810
Please forgive me.

443
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,320
I came here...

444
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,890
I came here to boldly

445
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,720
ask for another chance.

446
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,550
You mean the Sifang Envoy selection exam?

447
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,840
I know this is against the rules.

448
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,750
But I can't care about that anymore.

449
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,370
I used to be...

450
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,980
Someone who knew some street tricks,

451
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,670
a good-for-nothing who hung around the streets all day.

452
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,750
I had no idea what it meant

453
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,790
to 'spread the imperial voice and virtue to all directions.'

454
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,640
Later, when I entered the Sifang Pavilion,

455
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,990
I still didn't strive to improve myself.

456
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,650
I focused all my energy on gaining petty profits

457
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,340
and just barely scraping by.

458
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,430
My father once pointed at the "Changle" sign

459
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,760
on the city gate and said

460
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,780
that it was the reason for his diplomatic missions.

461
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,990
I didn't understand the meaning then.

462
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,450
But now I understand.

463
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,640
Sifang Envoys travel around the world

464
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,900
for the lasting happiness of Yong and its people,

465
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
and even for the lasting happiness of the whole world.

466
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,430
It's just that I couldn't get the top score.

467
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,310
I lost the chance to go on a mission to Yanle.

468
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,380
That's why I've come to ask Vice Minister An

469
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,710
to make an exception and let me take the exam again.

470
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,120
You keep talking about the lasting happiness of the world.

471
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,310
If you truly care about the world,

472
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,210
wouldn't any diplomatic mission serve the purpose?

473
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,760
Why does it have to be Yanle?

474
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,230
I know you have feelings for Princess Longshuang.

475
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,910
If a man has true feelings,

476
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,120
he should be brave enough to speak them out.

477
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,180
It's not shameful.

478
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,710
Vice Minister An, you see right through me.

479
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,510
I indeed have personal motives.

480
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,870
Princess Longshuang is the most important person in my life.

481
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,150
Both for public and personal reasons,

482
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,090
I want to personally accompany her back to Yanle.

483
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,150
But this personal desire is not all that's in my heart.

484
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,410
I know the importance of our homeland.

485
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,860
I'm willing to carry on the will of my ancestors,

486
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,120
even if it means facing death nine times.

487
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,430
Moreover, the methods to restrain Yanle

488
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,760
have been rehearsed in my mind many times.

489
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,450
If I miss this opportunity,

490
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,810
it would be a great pity.

491
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,100
Retainer An.

492
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,110
What do you think?

493
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,790
It doesn't matter.

494
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,270
No matter how many times he takes the exam,

495
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,800
the result will be the same.

496
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,910
Alright.

497
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,590
Since Retainer An agreed so readily,

498
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,300
I'll give you one last chance

499
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,720
and an additional test.

500
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,140
Within 30 minutes,

501
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,960
the two of you will write an essay on the spot,

502
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,830
discussing strategies for the diplomatic mission to Yanle.

503
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,360
Whoever's proposal is better

504
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840
will represent Yong

505
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,740
as the Sifang Envoy to Yanle.

506
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,730
Thank you, Vice Minister An.

507
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,910
Time... time was pressing,

508
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,020
so the handwriting is a bit messy.

509
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,860
I have reviewed both of your essays.

510
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,750
In my opinion, we should adopt

511
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,130
Retainer An's proposal.

512
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,870
Thank you, Vice Minister An.

513
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,560
I have no regrets.

514
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,720
I leave Ah Shu in your care.

515
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,040
I wish you a smooth journey.

516
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,020
I take my leave.

517
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,110
Yuan Mo,

518
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,630
the desert nights are very cold.

519
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,360
You must bring plenty of warm clothes.

520
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,800
The people of Yanle are difficult to deal with.

521
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,660
Your martial skills are average,

522
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,940
so you must be extra careful.

523
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,310
Vice Minister An,

524
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,990
I don't understand. Please enlighten me.

525
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,990
What I mean is,

526
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,380
I will submit a memorial to the court.

527
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,350
In ten days,

528
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,920
you will be the Sifang Envoy of Yong,

529
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,830
leading a delegation to escort Princess Longshuang

530
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,030
back to Yanle.

531
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,490
What?

532
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,510
Didn't you just say...

533
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,290
That you were adopting An Xiuyi's proposal?

534
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,580
[Send Yuan Mo]

535
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,510
This is his proposal.

536
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,790
I came here for this very purpose.

537
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:26,929
Why?

538
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,030
Becoming a Sifang Envoy...

539
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,199
Hasn't it always been your dream?

540
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,530
That's right.

541
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,840
It was indeed my dream.

542
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,040
But the moment I actually passed the exam to become a Sifang Envoy,

543
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,840
I realized

544
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,940
that I seemed to have taken the exam just to come out on top,

545
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,540
not because I truly wanted to serve as an envoy.

546
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,040
All these years,

547
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,210
I worked so hard,

548
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,750
constantly striving to improve,

549
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
seemingly just to prove to the world

550
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,000
that I, An Xiuyi,

551
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,690
without relying on a prestigious family background

552
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,750
or guidance and support from others,

553
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,070
could achieve success

554
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,130
through my own efforts alone.

555
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,710
But Susu's sudden departure

556
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,480
made me realize

557
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,170
that I had missed out on a lot

558
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,550
and lost a lot as well.

559
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,060
If one lives their entire life solely for an obsession,

560
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,890
ignoring the important people around them,

561
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,800
there will come a day

562
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,920
when they will regret it deeply.

563
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,780
Yuan Mo.

564
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,490
Although from the very beginning,

565
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,290
I didn't think much of you.

566
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,030
You're lazy in body and mind, ignorant of basic knowledge,

567
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,430
and you never get up early unless there's profit.

568
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,550
You're gluttonous and lazy, small-minded, and never put in effort.

569
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,550
Wait, wait, wait.

570
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,220
Why don't you just say 'but' already?

571
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,320
But, at this moment,

572
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,360
you are more suited to be the Sifang Envoy of Yong than me.

573
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,220
Do you really not regret it?

574
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,420
What do I have to regret?

575
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,230
Once you've tasted the sand of the great desert,

576
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,090
you might be the one with regrets.

577
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,410
As for me,

578
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,940
I've been used to eating fine grains since childhood.

579
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,140
I can't stomach sand.

580
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,430
Besides,

581
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,820
Susu is still in Changle.

582
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,500
I don't want to be too far from her.

583
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,090
Good luck to you.

584
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,270
Stop being so stubborn.

585
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,840
Stop being so stubborn.

586
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,420
I found most of them.

587
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,220
I'm only missing

588
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,000
your appointment letter as Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

589
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,740
It's really such a pity.

590
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,600
I personally issued it to you.

591
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,400
But I just can't find it.

592
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,720
These were all thrown away.

593
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,010
Why did you retrieve them?

594
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,760
These are not just pieces of paper.

595
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,250
These are years of memories.

596
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,750
Look at this one.

597
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,500
This is the contract from when you refused to come to the Ministry of Rites

598
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,700
and insisted on becoming a clerk at the Sifang Pavilion.

599
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,040
At that time,

600
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,750
you had just come of age.

601
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,750
And that one.

602
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,470
That's the first honor you received

603
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,380
after becoming a retainer in the East Court.

604
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,800
You were nearly twenty then.

605
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,950
I know.

606
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,490
in your eyes, I'm a father obsessed with the imperial court

607
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,390
who lacked affection for you.

608
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,330
But I've closely witnessed

609
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,090
every step of your growth.

610
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,300
Each of these commendations and awards

611
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,520
was personally signed by me.

612
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,700
In all these years at the Ministry of Rites,

613
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,070
I've signed countless documents.

614
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,590
But the ones that made my hand tremble as I signed my name,

615
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,750
were only these.

616
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,430
You're right.

617
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,030
If a person is too obsessed,

618
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,020
they will lose many things.

619
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,790
But it's hard to have the best of both worlds.

620
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,160
Over the years,

621
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,570
I've devoted myself to Yong's foreign affairs,

622
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,570
sparing no effort.

623
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,720
My biggest regret is

624
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,130
failing to accompany you as you grow up.

625
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,530
As your father,

626
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,880
I apologize to you.

627
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,840
The matters between us

628
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,500
can't be resolved with just an apology.

629
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,550
The lost time can't be made up.

630
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
I've grown up too.

631
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,670
I don't ask for your companionship.

632
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,220
If you truly have the heart,

633
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,510
go to my mother's grave more often

634
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,870
and keep her company.

635
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,670
Sifang Envoy.

636
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,520
Young Master.

637
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,830
Shall I dispose of them for you as usual?

638
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,050
An important envoy for communication and exchange.

639
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,880
Therefore, it requires the most rigorous

640
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,320
tests and selection.
