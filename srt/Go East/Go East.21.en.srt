00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,860
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,910
For the success of this alliance ceremony,

4
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,430
all of you have contributed a lot.

5
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,750
But the greatest merit

6
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,390
goes to East Court's Retainer An.

7
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,880
This alliance strategy

8
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,120
was first proposed by Retainer An.

9
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,790
He also faciliated the initial alliance

10
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,150
among Yuluo, Dongyuan, and Xiyuan.

11
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,919
He deserves commendation.

12
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,880
By Ministry of Rites' order, the East Court is rewarded with 50 taels of silver ingots

13
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,170
and An Xiuyi is promoted to Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

14
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,190
Xiuyi.

15
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,150
I know you've been working hard for years

16
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,790
to become the Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

17
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,990
Congratulations on realizing your dream.

18
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,790
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

19
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,620
I won't let you down.

20
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,150
Don't thank me yet.

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,300
Today,

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,570
I invited a special guest

23
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,530
to award you this honor.

24
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,350
Look who's here.

25
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,970
-Greetings, Vice Minister An.
-Greetings, Vice Minister An.

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,710
Rise.

27
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,510
Please have a seat.

28
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,880
No foreign affair is too small.

29
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,480
Thank you, Vice Minister An.

30
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,050
Sifang Envoys

31
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,550
are the key to

32
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,690
communicating with other states.

33
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,120
So they've to be thoroughly vetted.

34
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,970
In this alliance process,

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,000
West Court exposed Yanle's conspiracy,

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,790
facilitated the Mobei alliance,

37
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,320
destroyed the den of drugs,

38
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,120
and won the trust of Yuluo Envoy.

39
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,350
After Ministry of Rites' review,

40
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,350
the title of Supervisory Sifang Envoy has been added.

41
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,230
This honor belongs to Yuan Mo.

42
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,260
Me?

43
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,310
Supervisory Sifang Envoy?

44
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,270
Come forward.

45
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,230
Go.

46
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,630
No, no, Vice Minister An.

47
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,840
Don't joke around. I... I can't do it.

48
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,470
I can't do it. I can't.

49
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,270
Come forward!

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,560
How about... Wang Kunwu? He's up to it.

51
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,659
Or Y-Yuchi Hua?

52
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,110
Get up here!

53
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,830
Yuan Mo.

54
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,950
Your father Yuan Hanjing

55
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,630
was once a Sifang Envoy

56
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,770
who led Yong to the desert.

57
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,850
Now you're just one step away from your father's glory.

58
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,860
I hope you can keep making progress

59
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,850
so as not to disappoint

60
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,930
your country and colleagues.

61
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,510
Live up to your family name

62
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,480
and everyone's expectations.

63
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,830
I, Yuan Mo,

64
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,740
will remember your guidance.

65
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,820
Go.

66
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,840
Alright.

67
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,520
Award and praise are all in the past.

68
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,210
The past is the beginning.

69
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,210
Your future depends on your actions.

70
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,150
Go back to your work!

71
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,810
-Yes!
-Yes!

72
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,080
Xiuyi, see him...

73
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,950
Yuan Mo!

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,400
See Vice Minister An off.

75
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,600
Take care.

76
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,060
Kunwu, hang on.

77
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,890
Mingwei's transfer order

78
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,320
arrived in the morning.

79
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,900
Stop there.

80
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,150
Why are you back so late?

81
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm asking you!

82
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,970
Where's your letter of appointment?

83
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,910
I always come back at this time.

84
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,070
Did you just find out?

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,870
For all these years, be it rain or shine,

86
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,330
I was always the first to get to Sifang Pavilion

87
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,710
and the last to leave.

88
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,510
I worked so hard.

89
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,159
Have you ever acknowledged it?

90
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,070
You ignore my achievements

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,500
but criticize me when I make mistakes

92
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,790
and mock my failures.

93
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,710
I earned the title

94
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,370
of Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

95
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,680
But you had to crush me

96
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,210
with Yuan Mo at this moment!

97
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,980
I proposed the six states' alliance.

98
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,780
How dare you ask for the letter of appointment?

99
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,140
I'll tell you. I threw it away.

100
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,680
I don't care.

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,960
Threw it away? Might as well.

102
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,270
After hearing what you just said,

103
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,670
I'm more convinced that promoting you to Supervisory Sifang Envoy

104
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,419
is a mistake!

105
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:32,870
You...

106
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,030
The Sifang Envoys of Yong should be

107
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,150
broad-minded,

108
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,960
learning from other states

109
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,929
to supplement our state's flaws.

110
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
What applies to the state

111
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,830
also applies to the individual!

112
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,550
But you?

113
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,500
You can't even see or tolerate others' strengths!

114
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,900
How are you fit

115
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,810
to be the Supervisory Sifang Envoy...

116
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,410
Don't make it sound so grand!

117
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,910
Then tell me,

118
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,270
how's Yuan Mo fit for it?

119
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,870
Just because his father was a Sifang Envoy

120
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,400
who died in the line of duty?

121
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,590
You don't deserve to mention him.

122
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,810
You were right.

123
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,150
In this court,

124
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,990
there's no longer any father-son ties to speak of.

125
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,470
I'm responsible for how you turned out today.

126
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,870
But don't worry.

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,370
As long as I'm the vice minister

128
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,590
of Ministry of Rites,

129
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,820
you can forget about becoming a Sifang Envoy!

130
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,270
This is not only for Yong's sake

131
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,790
but also for your own good!

132
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,960
Good luck.

133
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,540
[From Mingwei Prefecture in Wuzhou:
[Imperial Guards' Commander Wang Kunwu,

136
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,270
You can now lift your head up high at home

137
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,920
and not worry about being kicked out by your wife.

138
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,870
Of course.

139
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,910
She can't wait

140
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,600
to have me at home every day.

141
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,030
Good one.

142
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,020

You're always putting stuff on your face.

145
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,880
You'll finally have a new name tag.

146
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,890
Of course.

147

151
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,170
Hey! What are you talking about?

-Retainer Wang!
-Retainer Wang.

-Retainer Wang's here.
-Retainer Wang.

155
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,650
So lively in the morning.

156
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,240
Didn't you ask me to share the reward with everyone?

157
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Everyone's happy after getting the money.

158
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,150
You deserve it.

159
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,410
You were so strict with us.

160
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,580
We always cursed you behind your back.

161
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,890
We were wrong.

162
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,550
That's right, Retainer Wang.

163
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,830
Without you,

164
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,810
West Court

165
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,950
would be disunited.

-That's right!
-That's right!

167
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,440
We should thank Retainer Wang.

168
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,040
Yes.

169
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,750
-Thank you, Retainer Wang!
-Thank you, Retainer Wang!

170
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,710
Don’t thank me.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,530
West Court's achievements

172
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,700
are due to everyone's efforts.

173
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,500
You made yourselves proud.

174
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,580
With or without me,

175
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,170
I believe everyone in West Court

176
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,790
would keep bettering yourselves.

177
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,430
Of course.

178
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,050
Yes.

The elegant color

184

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,660
Forget it.

190
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,520
This one then.

191
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,790
-My Lady.
-It's good.

192
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,440
My Lady.

193
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,160
I've brought Master's precious wine.

194
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,870
My Lady.

195
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,700
Where are you going today?

196
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,250
Wang Kunwu's treating us.

197
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,540
Mr. Huang.

198
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,780
Is he a good drinker?

199
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,750
I'll show him who's boss today!

200
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,290
So it's for Retainer Wang.

201
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,800
That's why you're

202
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,230
all dolled up.

203
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,320
Hua.

204
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,830
Father.

205
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,050
Come with me.

206
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,040
We need to talk.

207
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,950
The dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

208
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,770
Okay.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,630
Why aren't Yuan Mo and Ah Shu here yet?

210
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,580
Right.

211
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,510
Chief Secretary Yuchi isn't here either.

212
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,390
Well... um...

213
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,620
Let's wait a bit more.

214
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,100
-Let's wait.
-Let's wait.

215
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,670
No.

216
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,760
Everyone,

217
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,010
thank you for all your help.

218
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,830
I'm beyond grateful.

219
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,800
A toast to all of you.

220
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,810
Bottoms up.

221
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,130
Come on.

222
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,840
Bottoms up.

223
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,550
Bottoms up.

224
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,980
Sit, sit.

225
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:47,980
Ji.

226
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
You're older than me.

227
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,310
Why don't I call you Brother Ji?

228
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,910
No need. No need.

229
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,140
No need.

230
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,310
Brother Ji.

231
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,610
I've prepared some gifts

232
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,480
for your wife and children.

233
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,340
Please take it.

234
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,220
This...

235
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,840
This is too expensive.

236
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,990
I can't accept it.

237
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,300
Your wife will like it.

238
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,220
I'm not married yet.

239
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,960
I've nowhere to spend my money.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Don't stand on ceremony.

241
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,530
Thank you, Retainer Wang.

242
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,540
Shen.

243
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,440
You've suffered a lot.

244
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,190
Make sure you have heart-to-hearts with noble ladies

245
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,520
at appropriate venues.

246
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,400
Take note of propriety.

247
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,240
Yes, yes.

248
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,580
There's still remaining wormwood poison in your body.

249
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,020
I got medicine from a famous doctor for you.

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,870
This...

251
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,590
Thank you for your concern.

252
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,600
But I've asked Ah Shu...

253
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,260
Hey, hey...

254
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,510
Ah Shu just uses poison to counteract poison.

255
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,330
It's nothing compared to Retainer Wang's sincerity.

256
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:49,860
Right?

257
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,110
Yes, yes.

258
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,240
Thank you, Wang.

259
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,180
Thank you, Wang.

260
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,140
Saying your individual goodbyes?

261
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,920
What do you want to say to me?

262
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,920
Chief Secretary.

263
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Chief Secretary.

264
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,520
You're just in time.

265
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,000
Sit and have a drink.

266
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,300
Wang Kunwu.

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,800
How long will you hide it from us?

268
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,490
What?

269
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,060
What's going on?

270
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,050
You didn't say a word about such a huge matter.

271
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,510
What do you take me for?

272
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,090
What do you take us for?

273
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,510
You call us buddies,

274
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,740
but you don't treat us as so!

275
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,590
Well... What exactly happened?

276
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,070
What's Retainer Wang hiding from us?

277
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,380
-Right.
-Yeah.

278
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,710
The transfer order has been issued.

279
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,530
I'm returning to Mingwei Prefecture.

280
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,100
What?

281
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm leaving tomorrow.

282
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,740
-Wait...
-Tomorrow?

283
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,620
-So suddenly?
-So soon?

284
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,230
-What's going on?
-Why weren't we informed?

285
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,340
Did you hear that?

286
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,350
This is not a celebration

287
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,730
but a farewell party.

288
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,120
He wants to get everyone drunk

289
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,970
and then leave without saying goodbye.

290
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,280
This wine...

291
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,050
Wait.

292
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,200
-Retainer Wang.
-Retainer Wang.

293
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait...

294
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,830
Chief Secretary!

295
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,710
Come back!

296
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,970
Don't get involved!

297
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,690
Come here!

298
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,310
Wang Kunwu, stop there!

299
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,950
I haven't finished. Stop there!

300
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,660
What are you thinking?

301
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,950
I didn't mean to hide it from everyone.

302
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,950
I just didn't know how to bring it up.

303
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,940
So you've decided to leave?

304
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,109
It's a military order.

305
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,780
I must obey it.

306
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,790
What about you?

307
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,470
What do you want?

308
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,490
When I first came to Sifang Pavilion,

309
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,069
I was focused on earning merits

310
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,190
to leave this shabby place and return to the barracks as soon as possible.

311
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,869
But after

312
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,020
going through thick and thin with everyone,

313
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,100
now I've to leave.

314
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,320
Of course I can't bear to leave.

315
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,590
Besides, the clues of Man in White

316
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,250
has appeared in Changle City.

317
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,610
I...

318
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,520
What are you doing?

319
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,730
Since you want to stay,

320
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,840
it's easy to handle.

321
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,000
-Wang Kunwu!
-Wang Kunwu!

322
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,200
With just the two of you?

323
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
And me.

324
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,090
You can never be too cautious.

325
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,310
Wang.

326
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,600
This paralysis powder is my latest invention.

327
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,280
You didn't hold your breath this time, did you?

328
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,930
Your paralysis powder is not bad.

329
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,650
Isn't it?

330
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,870
Make a pose!

331
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,890
Come on.

332
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,510
Ah Shu.

333
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,690
Why's he burning?

334
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,060
What's in your paralysis powder?

335
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,320
Would he lose his mind?

336
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,870
The heat helps paralyze him.

337
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,110
Don't worry, Yuchi.

338
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,050
He probably won't be paralyzed.

339
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,040
Probably?

340
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,760
He's awake.

341
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,950
Thank you.

342
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,970
Don't mention it.

343
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,750
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome.

344
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,570
-Yeah.
-You’re welcome.

345
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,610
Eight generations of ancestors.

346
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,050
Kunwu, it's your fault.

347
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,750
Since you didn't want to leave,

348
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,580
we've to find a way to make you stay.

349
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,040
Right?

350
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,440
We're respecting your wishes.

351
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,760
Besides,

352
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,720
with how skilled Ah Shu is with poison,

353
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,580
you can lie for as long as you want,

354
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,690
even forever...

355
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,520
I mean, you can stay here forever.

356
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,890
But would this be

357
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,040
putting Mr. Yu in a tight spot?

358
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,630
No.

359
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,320
Yu doesn't want him to leave either.

360
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,470
So he told me about

361
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,890
the transfer order in advance.

362
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,820
But feigning sickness is just temporary.

363
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,330
We've to come up with ways

364
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,130
to keep him in Changle for good.

365
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,280
It’s okay. Just stay in bed

366
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,370
and be an idle patient.

367
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,430
Leave the rest to us.

368
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,050
Get lost.

369
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,600
Oh, come on.

370
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,120
Didn't you say you were made of steel?

371
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,750
Why are you acting like you're dying from a fever?

372
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,550
How can you indulge Yuan Mo

373
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,180
in carrying out such bad ideas?

374
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,500
Who cares if it's bad?

375
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,920
It worked, didn't it?

376
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,060
Let me ask you.

377
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,160
Apart from

378
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,030
avenging your buddies,

379
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,490
is there any other reason you want to stay?

380
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,710
I'd miss my West Court buddies.

381
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Excluding me?

382
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,500
What are you thinking?

383
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,870
How could I exclude you?

384
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,150
You gave them farewell gifts yesterday.

385
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,910
I got nothing.

386
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,030
What did you hide?

387
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,050
I don't know how to choose,

388
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,870
so I asked your cousin for help.

389
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,960
I didn't expect her to tell Duke Er.

390
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,390
Why didn’t you take it out last night?

391
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,850
Yesterday... I had no chance to.

392
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
Say this.

393
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,590
I'd miss you.

394
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,640
Stop it.

395
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,780
Stop what?

396
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,150
No one else is in the room.

397
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,330
Say it.

398
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,990
I want to hear it.

399
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,670
Softly.

400
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,700
I...

401
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:55,850
I...

402
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,370
Dr. Xu, this way please.

403
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,450
Yes, yes.

404
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,950
What should we do?

405
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,550
Dr. Xu.

406
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,860
[Yuchi's Mansion]

407
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,790
About what happened last time...

408
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,480
These are some supplements

409
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,350
as an apology.

410
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,240
I've recovered.

411
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,800
Just a misunderstanding.

412
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,550
Then...

413
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,300
Duke Er, you didn't have to.

414
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,680
You didn't have to.

415
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,330
Are you here today

416
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,740
to beg me to let Wang Kunwu

417
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,660
stay in Changle?

418
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,510
Yes.

419
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,990
In the whole Changle,

420
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
only you can make it happen, Duke Er.

421
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,840
Is he my son-in-law?

422
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,730
Is he related to me?

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,460
Why should I help him when he's nothing to me?

424
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,870
If there's nothing else,

425
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,280
Huang, see the guests out.

426
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,720
Okay.

427
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,760
Why are you laughing?

428
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,500
I was

429
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
wondering why I was beaten up.

430
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,120
So you've already taken a fancy to Kunwu.

431
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,320
But Kunwu hasn't confessed his feelings to Yuchi Hua.

432
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,690
That's why you've been holding a grudge.

433
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,630
Right?

434
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,720
Nonsense!

435
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,170
Who is he?

436
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
He's just a soldier.

437
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,070
He gives my daughter the cold shoulder.

438
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,060
So I should kick him out

439
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,480
to the end of the world!

440
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,590
Yes, yes.

441
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,370
It seems I've asked the wrong person.

442
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,270
Duke Er, I thought you were awe-inspiringly righteous,

443
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,430
so I wanted to

444
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,910
ask you to keep a meritorious soldier.

445
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,450
Who would've thought that you're just

446
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,440
thinking about love and marriage?

447
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,660
I made a mistake.

448
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,410
How dare you!

449
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,200
Watch your words with the duke!

450
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,470
Go on.

451
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,660
Do you think Wang Kunwu wants to stay in Sifang Pavilion?

452
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,430
We knew from the first day he came that

453
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,550
he's been dying to

454
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,880
return to the border to serve the country.

455
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,710
He has a personal vendetta

456
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,970
against The Faceless.

457
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
But it's true that

458
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,730
only by eliminating The Faceless

459
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,980
can Yong and the desert states

460
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,750
be free from danger.

461
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,930
The Faceless and Man in White are in Changle now,

462
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,790
successively conspiring to cause chaos.

463
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,920
But the court insists on transferring

464
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,320
Wang Kunwu back to the garrison to patrol.

465
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,900
I really don't get it.

466
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,200
As a soldier, he should go back to his post.

467
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,930
He'd do greater things

468
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,190
if he stays in Changle and Sifang Pavilion.

469
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,400
If the court can't make the best use of him,

470
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,720
why must we concede?

471
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,590
Duke Er.

472
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,230
Forgive me for interfering.

473
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,470
In my opinion,

474
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,390
Wang has feelings for Yuchi.

475
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,430
When Sifang Pavilion assisted Jingzhao

476
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,360
with solving Long Beina's murder,

477
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,350
the murderer Hong Ye sought revenge

478
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,150
by luring Yuchi and Ms. Bai into the ice cellar.

479
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,300
Yuchi almost died that time.

480
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:56,950
What?

481
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,440
Wang rescued Yuchi and kept her safe

482
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,760
by using

483
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,270
a military method to help her regain warmth.

484
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,210
Is that true?

485
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,890
She didn't want to worry you,

486
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,490
so she told me not to tell you.

487
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,910
So if you really

488
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,110
care about your daughter's happiness,

489
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,600
maybe you should give them more time.

490
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,050
Was I too harsh just now?

491
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,510
Will Duke Er accept it?

492
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,950
Will it backfire?

493
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,750
You learned new fancy words?

494
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,850
I'll teach you a new phrase.

495
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,780
It's called "perfectly apt."

496
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,610
You mean it was just right?

497
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,960
Our chemistry just now

498
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,030
was seamless.

499
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,750
Like a hand in glove

500
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,890
and even invincible.

501
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,030
I can't remember all these at once.

502
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,590
Speaking of which,

503
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,710
why did we have to beg Duke Er?

504
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,950
Yuchi could've told him herself.

505
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,320
The father and daughter

506
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,070
quarrel as soon as they meet.

507
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,890
Things could've turned south.

508
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,290
Then Wang Kunwu would really have to leave.

509
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,630
Dear gods, please bless us

510
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,030
so Duke Er changes his mind

511
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,230
and lets Wang stay.

512
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,310
Relax.

513
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,140
Wait for the good news.

514
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,710
I'm almost all recovered.

515
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,140
Do I still need to apply medicated wine?

516
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,170
Of course not.

517
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,610
You can't apply wine

518
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,910
on an external wound.

519
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,110
So you are...

520
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,520
Everyone's busy with strategizing so Wang can stay.

521
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,150
They all forgot about your promotion to Supervisory Sifang Envoy.

522
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,140
But I didn't.

523
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,130
Let's celebrate tonight.

524
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,700
Here.

525
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,300
A toast of Lingxi wine to you.

526
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,070
Congratulations.

527
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,510
You're one step away from becoming a Sifang Envoy

528
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,430
like Mr. Yuan.

529
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,510
I spent a fortune to get it

530
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,080
from Inebriation Restaurant.

531
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,630
How is it?

532
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,140
Delicious.

533
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,240
Don't be greedy.

534
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,620
You haven't recovered. Just one cup.

535
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,490
I'll listen to you.

536
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,850
Why are you so obedient today?

537
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,330
Are you unhappy?

538
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,500
Ah Shu.

539
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,680
I never wanted to be some Supervisory Sifang Envoy

540
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,070
or even the Sifang Envoy.

541
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,540
Why?

542
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,420
Your father was the Sifang Envoy.

543
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,530
He even saved Yanle's princess.

544
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,790
And how did he turn out?

545
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,620
He risked his life

546
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
and went far away,

547
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,030
only to never return.

548
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,680
His body was buried in the sand,

549
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,430
plunging his loved ones in agony.

550
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
I don't want to live like this

551
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,230
or experience

552
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,070
what my father had gone through.

553
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,440
How would it be the same?

554
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,150
Yuan Mo.

555
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Even if you became the Sifang Envoy,

556
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,280
you might not be dispatched to Yanle.

557
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,610
Even if you were,

558
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,310
Yong and Yanle's situation

559
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,830
is incomparable to the past.

560
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,490
How can you be so unambitious?

561
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,030
If staying in Yong

562
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,480
is being unambitious,

563
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,790
then so be it.

564
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,130
People of Yong always say

565
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,770
good men are ambitious.

566
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Why are you so desperate to stay in Yong?

567
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,110
Because you are here.

568
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,310
Ah Shu.

569
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,150
I really don't want to leave you.

570
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,130
When you got your household registration and said you wanted to move out,

571
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,190
I was so sad.

572
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,760
I used to live here alone.

573
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,760
I lived a carefree life.

574
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,990
I didn't care much.

575
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,800
Ever since I had you...

576
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,230
the yard's become full of life

577
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,910
and I'm enjoying life.

578
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Even the vine chair has a companion.

579
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,070
Actually, I didn't take you in.

580
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,660
It was you...

581
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,990
who gave me a home.

582
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Ah Shu.

583
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,070
Since

584
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,900
we have accepted each other,

585
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,910
don't we...

586
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,550
no longer need this curtain?

587
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,150
Ah Shu.

588
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,790
Don't you think this isn't very different

589
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,880
from having a curtain?

590
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,470
You're right.

591
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,990
Ah Shu.

592
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,240
It may be fine now,

593
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,710
but at night,

594
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,830
it gets really chilly.

595
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,630
Ah Shu.

596
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,580
I'm a little cold now.

597
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,530
Then...

598
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,630
Why don't we...

599
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,510
Sleep.

600
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,640
Okay.

601
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,350
I'll sleep.

602
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,360
What's wrong?

603
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,950
Nothing. It slipped off.

604
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,830
Is your injury getting worse?

605
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,240
-No, no.
-Let me see.

606
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,730
It's my right hand that's injured.

607
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,370
Then what's going on?

608
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,150
Nothing. It's just a stiff neck from sleeping.

609
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,950
Stiff neck?

610
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,060
Put it down.

611
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,110
I said put it down.

612
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:58,990
Here.

613
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,690
Careful, it's hot.

614
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,700
Is it hot?

615
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:33,760
[Huaiyuan Hall]

616
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,969
Mingwei Prefecture replied?

617
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,400
Kunwu.

618
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,070
What's wrong?

619
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,010
Did something happen?

620
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,630
Tell me.

621
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,450
Let's figure out a way to deal with it.

622
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,520
Mingwei Prefecture has made a decision.

623
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,270
I've to leave after all.

624
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,540
Okay.

625
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,570
I've no regrets.

626
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,910
Alright.

627
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,000
Stop pulling a long face.

628
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,860
Be happy.

629
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,390
Smile.

630
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,740
Stop crying.

631
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,660
West Court belongs to all of you.

632
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,760
I, Wang Kunwu, will be gone,

633
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,330
but you are still here.

634
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,760
Understand?

635
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

636
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,720
Louder!

637
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,750
-Yes!
-Yes!

638
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,370
Aren't you going to open it?

639
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,660
It doesn't make a difference.

640
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,080
Still, take a look.

641
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,670
After all, it's Mingwei's official document.

642
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,500
What's the difference?

643
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,200
They want me to set off immediately

644
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,950
without delay...

645
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,920
Revoked?

646
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,390
He fell for it!

647
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,180
Didn't he cry just now?

648
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,390
I don't know if others saw him,

649
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,310
but I did!

650
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,220
There are still tears in his eyes.

651
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,900
It's so glaring!

652
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,490
He fell for it!

653
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,610
You ganged up on me, huh?

654
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,990
You punks.

655
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:50,530
I...

656
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,370
Careful!

657
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,850
You punks!

658
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,740
Stop right there! Stop!

659
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,430
Careful!

660
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,850
-Retainer Wang, congratulations on staying in Sifang Pavilion's West Court!
-Retainer Wang, congratulations on staying in Sifang Pavilion's West Court!

661
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,580
Please continue to lead us...

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,120
-To become the best West Court!
-To become the best West Court!

663
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,330
Ah Shu will send the antidote over.

664
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,940
Once you're recovered,

665
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,900
remember to visit Duke Er.

666
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,460
He was a great help

667
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,210
in allowing you to stay.

668
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,960
You even sought help from my father?

669
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,030
Of course.

670
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,340
I can't get beaten for nothing, right?

671
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,730
Alright. Report to work tomorrow.

672
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,480
Don't forget. Don't be late.

673
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,540
I have a lot to discuss with you.

674
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,090
Don't go.

675
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,500
Since I resume work tomorrow,

676
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,830
shouldn't we

677
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,900
have some fun today?

678
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,110
Have some fun?

679
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,240
Our party at Inebriation Restaurant ended badly,

680
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,370
so I'll make up for it at Ruyi Pavilion!

681
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
Let's go make a reservation!

682
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,750
Let's go! Let's go!

683
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,790
Let's go!

684
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,470
Master.

685
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,990
Retainer Wang's here to see you.

686
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,090
Greetings, Duke Er.

687
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,680
Thank you for keeping me in Changle

688
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,030
so I can continue

689
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,860
to investigate the Man in White.

690
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,230
A little gift.

691
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Please accept it.

692
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,840
Are you feeling better?

693
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,870
I'm fine now.

694
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,240
That's good.

695
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,860
I heard you once saved Hua.

696
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,150
Yes.

697
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,880
With such petty skills, how will you arrest Man in White

698
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,780
and annihilate The Faceless?

699
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,430
Sorry.

700
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,790
Good fellow.

701
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,410
Quite impressive!

702
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,880
You're the first

703
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,510
to knock me back a few steps.

704
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,460
I didn't win.

705
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,660
But I didn't lose either.

706
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,960
Don't be modest.

707
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,220
You passed!

708
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,800
Pass what?

709
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,070
The trial of my heart.

710
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,380
You can discuss marriage with Hua.

711
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,010
Duke Er...

712
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,570
What?

713
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,900
You don't like Hua?

714
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,340
That's not what I meant.

715
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,740
Get along well then.

716
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,500
Huang, see him out!

717
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,820
Much stronger than Yuan Mo.

718
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,430
Retainer Wang, this way please.

00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,290
-Come on! Cheers!
-Cheers!

721
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,510
Retainer Wang.

722
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,870
I told you

723
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,630
West Court mustn't lose a single member.

724
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,130
Wasn't I pertinent?

725
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,800
Yes, we mustn't lose anyone.

726
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,490
Especially not our retainer!

727
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,140
Come on! Let's have another drink!

728
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,950
-Come on! Here's to keeping Retainer Wang!
-Keeping Retainer Wang!

-Cheers!
-Cheers!

730
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Come on, continue!

731
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,950
Come on!

732
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,910
One more cup!

733
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,470
Fill it up!

734
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,160
It wasn't easy to gather,

735
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,430
yet it's the same day as the West Court.

736
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,230
And we're even

737
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,600
so close to them.

738
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,870
So noisy!

739
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,610
It's just keeping a retainer.

740
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,270
Do they have to be this happy?

741
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,110
Wait.

742
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,700
Leave it open.

743
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,800
It's stuffy.

744
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,860
It's you!

745
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,200
Can't we change the subject?

746
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:09,930
Okay.

747
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,770
It's getting late.

749
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,950
My wife asked me to bring her some cakes.

750
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,030
If I don't buy them now, they'll be closed.

751
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,920
I'll take my leave.

752
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,950
Enjoy yourselves.

753
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,640
Okay.

00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,430
Goodbye.

755
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,860
Okay.

756
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,430
Get going then.

757
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,860
What did I eat?

758
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,230
I have a stomachache.

759
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,160
I have to go.

760
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,470
They... They're really...

761
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,340
It's fine.

762
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,520
Kunwu, let's drink.

763
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,080
Come on.

764
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,180
My wound suddenly hurts.

765
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,300
I must've drunk too much.

766
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,310
Did the wound crack?

767
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,030
I'll check it at home for you!

768
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,550
Okay.

769
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,600
Wang, we'll get going.

770
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,130
Bye.

771
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,880
Sorry.

772
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,590
Find an excuse.

773
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,890
Do something.

774
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,910
Are you two worried

775
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,770
you'll be late for work tomorrow?

776
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,720
Leave then.

777
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,780
-Go.
-Go.

778
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,210
What?

779
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,760
Why are they all gone?

780
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,560
What flawless cooperation.

781
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,850
I couldn't tell they were acting at all.

782
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,230
Acting?

783
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,690
You make it sound like I planned it.

784
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,960
I just...

785
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,440
You don't have to

786
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,250
go to such lengths to talk to me.

787
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,600
I just want to ask you...

788
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,530
Am I partially...

789
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,900
the reason you want to stay?

790
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,360
Yes.

791
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,020
I have you in my heart.
