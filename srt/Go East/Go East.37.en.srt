00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,920
[Go East]

2
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,830
[Episode 37]

3
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,170
What is this place?

4
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,990
Why did you bring me here?

5
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,770
Don't you want to see Yuan Mo?

6
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,490
He is in this room right now.

7
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,030
Ah Shu.

8
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,990
Yuan Mo.

9
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,829
-Yuan Mo!
-Ah Shu.

10
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,370
Ah Shu, get out of here!

11
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,350
-Hurry!
-Yuan Mo, are you okay?

12
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,410
Don't worry about me. Get out of here.

13
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,510
What are you doing?

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,460
You promised me you'd let Yuan Mo go.

15
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,630
I did promise you,

16
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,410
but I only promised to bring you here to see him.

17
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,410
I didn't promise you not to kill him.

18
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,470
Ah Shu!

19
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,980
Ah Shu!

20
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,070
Ah Shu!

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,080
Man in White!

22
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,550
Just come at me!

23
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,190
Don't hurt her!

24
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,660
Why would I hurt her?

25
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,610
She's my sister after all.

26
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,880
Are you okay, Ah Shu?

27
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,630
Ah Shu!

28
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,720
Man in White.

29
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,950
No.

30
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,590
Prince Xiuduo.

31
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,750
I beg you to let Yuan Mo go.

32
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,710
I'll give you whatever you want.

33
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,550
As long as you let him go.

34
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,750
Ah Shu, don't beg him.

35
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,990
It won't work.

36
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,680
He just wants to blow me up the same way I did

37
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,710
to avenge his men.

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,800
Yuan Mo.

39
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,410
Yuan Mo!

40
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,020
Ah Shu.

41
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,880
Ah Shu, listen to me.

42
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm grateful and content

43
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,510
to have met you

44
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,110
and fallen in love with you in this life.

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,390
Don't cry.

46
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,510
Promise me you'll move on with your life.

47
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,080
Promise me you'll fly out of the desert again

48
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,690
like a Vanessa

49
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,910
to embrace your freedom.

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,910
I'm begging you.

51
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,570
Please don't kill Yuan Mo.

52
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,110
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

53
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,140
I'm begging you.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,089
I'm begging you.

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm begging you.

56
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,950
Get up.

57
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,830
Take it.

58
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,670
Send him off.

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,540
No.

60
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,990
Take it!

61
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,430
Take it!

62
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,350
I want you to kill him with your own hands!

63
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,270
No!

64
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,990
Ah Shu!

65
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,230
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,150
I can't

67
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,030
fulfill my promise to you about the future.

68
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,630
If there's an afterlife,

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,230
don't be a princess.

70
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,870
I won't be some Sifang Envoy either.

71
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,310
Let's just be an ordinary couple.

72
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,130
In the next life,

73
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
I'll be with you forever.

74
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,710
No!

75
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,120
Ah Bili.

76
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,590
Yuan Mo!

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,250
Yuan Mo!

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,670
Yuan Mo!

79
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,470
Ah Shu!

80
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,590
How's the preparation for tomorrow going?

81
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,420
Don't worry, Your Highness.

82
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,620
Everything is ready.

83
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,430
Tomorrow, when you're on the parade with Her Highness,

84
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,230
I will disguise myself as a guard

85
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,140
and stab Her Highness in the carriage

86
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,790
in front of the people of Yanle, Your Highness.

87
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,150
Tomorrow, after the carriage stops,

88
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,360
I'll arrange guards to guard outside.

89
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,720
They won't stop you.

90
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,070
After it's done,

91
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,270
I'll close the case as Long Tuqi's remnants avenging him.

92
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,020
By then,

93
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,580
the people will hate Long Tuqi more and honor Her Highness.

94
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,780
Then, I'll come forward and turn the tide.

95
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,880
The people will be more convinced

96
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,400
that I am the chosen emperor.

97
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,750
As for you,

98
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,520
I'll give you a large sum of money afterwards

99
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,750
and send you back to your hometown to start a life in seclusion.

100
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,210
Thank you, Your Highness.

101
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,870
This is the carriage

102
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,000
Father took you to parade on back then.

103
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,030
I said

104
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,429
I'd get on this carriage one day

105
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,510
and let all the people of Yanle see me.

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,280
Now I finally got what I wanted.

107
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,669
Ah Shu.

108
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,960
Will you join me?

109
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,260
Let's go!

110
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:22,630
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

111
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,300
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

112
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,630
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

113
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,670
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

114
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,910
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

115
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,150
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

116
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,630
God bless Prince Xiuduo!

117
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,620
Alert!

118
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,070
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

119
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,270
God bless Prince Xiuduo! God bless Princess Longshuang!

120
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,030
If Father had arranged

121
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,290
to let us travel together in the carriage like this back then,

122
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,950
perhaps so many things wouldn't have happened.

123
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,970
Unfortunately, it's too late.

124
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,960
Yes.

125
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
It's too late.

126
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,710
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

127
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,910
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

128
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,030
God bless Princess Longshuang!

129
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,440
Get up.

130
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,120
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

131
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,590
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

132
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,990
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

133
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:42,030
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

134
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:52,710
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

135
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,230
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

136
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,630
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

137
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:08,590
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

138
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:17,270
God bless Princess Longshuang! God bless Prince Xiuduo!

139
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,670
This one

140
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,130
is for my father and mother.

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,720
This one

142
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,670
is for Uncle Kang.

143
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,410
This one is for my brothers and friends.

144
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,750
Murder! Murder!

145
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,080
Murder!

146
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,000
Run!

147
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,080
Murder!

148
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,960
I shouldn't have sworn to be your blood brother.

149
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,580
I didn't expect our promise to be fulfilled so soon.

150
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,530
Then fulfill it.

151
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,110
Okay!

152
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,150
Let's die on the same day then!

153
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,750
No more demoralizing words.

154
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,390
How is it?

155
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,330
We are not late, are we?

156
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,240
God bless Empress Longshuang!

157
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,460
God bless Empress Longshuang!

158
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,930
God bless Empress Longshuang!

159
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,310
God bless Empress Longshuang!

160
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,670
I'm so tired.

161
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,690
Your Highness.

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,480
You must watch your manners no matter how tired you are.

163
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,430
It's so heavy. Take it off.

164
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,790
-This...
-No. You can't take it off.

165
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,070
Let me lean on it for a while.

166
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,020
-Your Highness.
-Sifang Envoy of Yong, Yuan Mo, is here.

167
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,760
Yuan Mo!

168
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,860
Your Highness.

169
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,780
You're the ruler of a state now, Your Highness.

170
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,700
You need to behave in a manner befitting your position.

171
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,470
Okay.

172
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,330
I am Yuan Mo, Sifang Envoy of Yong.

173
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

174
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,920
Offer him a seat.

175
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,350
Yuan Mo.

177
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,390
I've finished reading the document.

178
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,390
You know exactly what I'm thinking.

179
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,500
You should watch your language too, Your Highness.

180
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,560
Alright. Alright.

181
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,780
I've finished reading

182
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,140
the document you presented, Sifang Envoy.

183
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,840
What's said in your document and your state's act of sending envoys

184
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,960
to help the two states get on good terms

185
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,560
is my wish as well.

186
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,490
I hope it can be carried out as soon as possible.

187
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,990
I'll definitely write a letter in reply to the Emperor of Yong.

188
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,310
The friendship between two states

189
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,660
lies in the friendship between the two peoples.

190
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,510
Besides me and the Emperor of Yong communicating with each other through letters,

191
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,110
I also want to enhance my relationship with the people of Yong.

192
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,030
I shall request the Emperor of Yong

193
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,330
to increase the scale of delegations and caravans.

194
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,340
That's not what I meant.

195
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:23,150
I'll also request His Majesty to send Yong's craftsmen to assist the construction of Yanle.

196
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,350
That's not it either.

197
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,470
Forgive my ignorance.

198
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,930
Please enlighten me, Your Highness.

199
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,860
What I meant is...

200
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,630
I...

201
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,040
What was I talking about?

202
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm so tired.

203
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,200
I can't even speak.

204
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,710
Your Highness.

205
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,670
Take it off already.

206
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,630
Get out.

207
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,110
Yes.

208
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,180
Little Maid.

209
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
Scummy.

210
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,520
Yuan Mo!

211
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,810
[Yong Embassy]

212
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,240
We should really thank all the envoys.

213
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,150
It's also thanks to Yuan Mo,

214
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,350
who started setting up the plan before the envoys departed.

215
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,870
I knew you like playing Go.

216
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,780
This should be

217
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,110
the biggest game

218
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,570
you ever played, right?

219
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,040
Distinguished envoys.

220
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
I, Yuan Mo, will lead the delegation

221
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,600
to escort Princess Longshuang back to Yanle very soon.

222
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,030
Long Tuqi wants to take this opportunity to harm Her Highness

223
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,150
in the name of welcoming Her Highness back to Yanle.

224
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,010
This trip will definitely be extremely dangerous.

225
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,680
I'd like to implore you, distinguished envoys,

226
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,150
to contact your respective embassies in Yanle

227
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,090
and arrange some men in advance

228
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,640
to give the Yong State a helping hand.

229
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,240
Don't worry, Sifang Envoy.

230
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,110
Everyone knows the ruthless ambition of Long Tuqi.

231
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,790
The state of Yuluo is willing to do our best to help.

232
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,830
We are all willing to do our best to help.

233
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,790
The envoys really didn't

234
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,820
let us down.

235
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,680
Dongyuan Envoy is here.

236
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,010
I'm Dongyuan Envoy. Greetings, Your Highness.

237
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,500
Greetings, Sifang Envoy.

238
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Please rise, distinguished envoy.

239
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,990
It's all thanks to you, who arranged

240
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,030
Dongyuan's clerks to dig a tunnel in advance,

241
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,270
that I survived.

242
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,800
I, Yuan Mo, would like to thank you, distinguished envoy.

243
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,270
You have no idea how dangerous it was.

244
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,590
I was almost scared to death.

245
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,510
I was so nervous that

246
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,170
I didn't even put on a good act.

247
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,150
Luckily, the two bros arrived in time.

248
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,550
Otherwise, you might not be able to see me.

249
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,790
Xiyuan Envoy is here.

250
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,280
Please.

251
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,270
I'm Xiyuan Envoy. Greetings, Your Highness.

252
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,020
Please rise, distinguished envoy.

253
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,100
I, Kunwu, want to thank you, distinguished envoy.

254
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,150
If it weren't for you who arranged some men from Xiyuan

255
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,030
to infiltrate the royal fleet of Yanle in advance

256
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,630
and let me replace the carriage coachman,

257
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,290
the assassination of Man in White wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

258
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,590
Envoy Wang.

259
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,410
Here's the coachman's outfit for tomorrow's parade

260
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,960
and my access badge to the royal court.

261
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,660
Enter through the west gate of the palace.

262
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,390
Thanks a lot.

263
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,710
You're welcome, Envoy Wang.

264
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,490
Please.

265
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,190
Yueying Envoy is here.

266
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,510
I'm Yueying Envoy. Greetings, Your Highness.

267
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,210
Welcome, distinguished envoy.

268
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,990
If it weren't for the porter from Yueying that you arranged

269
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,120
who opened the city gate in time,

270
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,600
our plan would have fallen short.

271
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,770
Yuluo Envoy is here.

272
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm Yuluo Envoy. Greetings, Your Highness.

273
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,260
Lord Li, please rise.

274
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,590
When the old officials of Yanle were imprisoned,

275
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,290
they were taken good care of by the jailors from Yuluo

276
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,420
thanks to your arrangements, Lord Li.

277
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,900
I, Longshuang Yueshu, would like to thank you for your help.

278
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,710
You flatter me.

279
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,860
It's my honor

280
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,870
to serve you, Your Highness.

281
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,720
Why did you thank everyone

282
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,070
but not me?

283
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,670
Prince Duomi.

284
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,050
Prince Duomi.

285
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,550
If you agreed to send troops

286
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,670
when we were in Mobei,

287
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,180
it would have saved us a lot of trouble.

288
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,380
You're right, Yuan.

289
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,790
But I'm not stupid.

290
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,750
Besides,

291
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,070
I gave you the information on

292
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,110
the compound of The Faceless, didn't I?

293
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,580
You destroyed Mutu.

294
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,860
I made a contribution to that, right?

295
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,080
Yes.

296
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,910
Thanks to your help, distinguished envoys,

297
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,670
Yanle is finally at peace now.

298
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,260
I, Yuan Mo, want to thank you again, distinguished envoys.

299
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,350
After all this,

300
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,820
I've figured out a lot of things.

301
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,910
Sifang Envoy's duty is not only traveling to different countries on mission,

302
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,870
but also uniting all parties

303
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,650
and bringing all parties together.

304
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,570
All states, big or small,

305
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,120
should build a world of shared peace.

306
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,660
Only in this way will the world be peaceful.

307
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,100
This time, we fought against Man in White together.

308
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,150
You've all made irreplaceable contributions

309
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,760
at the critical moment.

310
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,360
And I'm honored

311
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,110
to have united everyone.

312
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,790
By doing this,

313
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,470
the treaty among the six parties is not a dead letter anymore.

314
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,830
And you

315
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,950
have lived up to your identity as Sifang Envoy of Yong.

316
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,130
Cheers.

317
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,860
Bottoms up.

318
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,870
Cheers.

319
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,620
Raisins...

320
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,460
Not bad.

321
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,600
Prince Duomi.

322
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,550
Stop taking it down.

323
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,110
The dishes are getting cold.

324
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,040
What do you know?

325
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,230
Recently, I've been planning to travel around the world,

326
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,100
taste each state's food one by one,

327
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,940
and make a world cuisine guide

328
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,940
to promote tourism exchanges among states.

329
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,280
This is a great idea.

330
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,230
In the past, it wasn't easy to carry out exchanges with Yanle.

331
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,230
This way, it'll be more convenient.

332
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,580
By the way, Yuan Mo,

333
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,150
there's something I haven't been able to figure out.

334
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,010
Even if you planned ahead of time,

335
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,710
you and Empress Longshuang were in two different places after all.

336
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,580
Besides, the coordinators of each state

337
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,830
were only in contact with their respective embassies.

338
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,170
So how did you communicate with each other exactly,

339
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,730
and how did you break through layers of guards and became an assassin?

340
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,450
I'll ask someone to answer your question.

341
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,000
Please come in.

342
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,820
Greetings, everyone. I'm Ah Bili.

343
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,150
Isn't he from the Dragon Cavalry?

344
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,020
Ah Bili is indeed from the Dragon Cavalry,

345
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,630
but he neither works for Mutu

346
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,500
nor for Man in White.

347
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,110
He works for Deputy Envoy Kang.

348
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,570
Keep quiet.

349
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,390
Don't kill me.

350
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,510
Don't kill me!

351
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,110
Come here.

352
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,980
All right.

353
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,190
What's your name?

354
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,070
I'm Ah Bili.

355
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,870
They all call me Fatty.

356
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,220
I no longer have parents.

357
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,820
Don't cry.

358
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,270
Listen to me, Ah Bili.

359
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,140
Later, I'll take you to the royal court and teach you skills.

360
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,640
One day, we will make him pay with his blood.

361
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,270
Got it?

362
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,850
Okay.

363
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,510
Act like a man from now on.

364
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,390
Stop crying.

365
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,920
Let's go.

366
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,610
I didn't expect

367
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,370
that you were Empress Longshuang's childhood friend.

368
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,490
Not to mention you,

369
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,950
I didn't expect him to become so thin either.

370
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,270
Fortunately, he secretly came to me and we recognized each other

371
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,880
when he was watching me on Mutu's order.

372
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,110
And he managed to take the opportunity to contact the helpers of each state

373
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,430
and make sure they give us a hand at the corresponding time and place.

374
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,230
That's how our plan was carried out successfully.

375
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,720
Have a seat.

376
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,050
Thank you, Your Highness.

377
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,590
But to be honest,

378
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,390
Deputy Envoy Kang raised me in secret

379
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,350
and assigned me to work in the Dragon Cavalry.

380
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,640
I worked hard to show Mutu how capable I am.

381
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I got appreciated and trusted by him soon afterwards.

382
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,330
Before he undertook his mission to Yong State, Deputy Envoy Kang specially reminded me that

383
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,580
Long Tuqi relies on Man in White a lot.

384
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,360
He'd definitely come to the capital.

385
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,900
By then, I could take advantage of the antagonism between him and Mutu

386
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,300
and wait for the opportunity to take action.

387
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,240
Man in White saw Mutu beat and scold me,

388
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,550
so he approached me soon after that.

389
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,770
Although Deputy Envoy Kang is gone,

390
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,020
the "Go game" he set is still protecting Yanle

391
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,670
and us.

392
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,440
Distinguished envoys.

393
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,150
I have another request.

394
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,360
Now that Yanle's making a fresh start,

395
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,910
I hope Yanle

396
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,060
can join the alliance between Yong and the other states.

397
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,000
I hope the seven states can mend our fences, build our friendship,

398
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,330
and support each other.

399
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,360
Great.

400
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,630
That'll be great.

401
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,910
We were thinking the same thing.

402
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,840
Welcome aboard.

403
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,280
In that case,

404
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,800
all the states will rely on each other,

405
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,100
share mutual fate,

406
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,710
and seek peace

407
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,350
and long-term stability together.

408
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,070
This way,

409
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,020
I'll have no regrets.

410
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,310
Sifang Envoy.

411
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,350
What do you mean by that?

412
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,990
I, Yuan Mo, will resign from the position of Sifang Envoy of Yong.

413
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,410
W... Why?

414
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,150
Because in a month,

415
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,110
I will marry Empress Longshuang.

416
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,070
Come on. Congratulations.

417
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,790
Congratulations. Great news.

418
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,390
Congratulations.

419
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,270
Let's toast Sifang Envoy

420
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,720
and Empress Longshuang.

421
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,390
Come on.

422
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,030
Congratulations.

423
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,550
Cheers.

424
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,020
Congratulations.

425
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,640
I wonder if you have time next month.

426
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,350
I would like to invite you all

427
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,230
to attend our wedding.

428
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,790
It'll be held according to Yanle's customs.

429
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,770
It'll be very lively.

430
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,760
Sure. No problem.

431
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,430
[One month later]

432
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,510
-Congratulations.
-Welcome.

433
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,940
May happiness be with the two of you today and always.

434
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,550
Please come in.

435
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,070
Okay.

436
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,220
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

437
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,750
Let's get smashed tonight.

438
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,360
Welcome!

439
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:30,750
Please come in!

440
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,310
Okay.

441
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,710
Please come in!

442
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,340
Sifang Envoy.

443
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,380
Prince Duomi.

444
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,800
Be good to Ah Shu.

445
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,470
Otherwise, I'll snatch her from you.

446
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,170
Don't worry.

447
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,430
I won't give you that chance.

448
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,290
Please come in.

449
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,450
Don't drink too much.

450
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,020
Got it.

451
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
All the food I prepared for you today

452
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
is delicious.

453
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,120
-Yuan Mo.
-I must try it.

454
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,050
Look who's here.

455
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,910
Yu.

456
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,790
Yu!

457
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,310
Be gentle.

458
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,670
This old body of mine can't take it.

459
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,050
Alright.

460
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,830
Why did you come all the way here in person?

461
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,430
I have to come to your wedding

462
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,190
even if I have to risk my life.

463
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,200
How can I miss this major life event of yours?

464
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,380
Long time no see, Kunwu.

465
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,710
Guys. Guys.

466
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,310
Thank you all for being here.

467
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,090
By the way,

468
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,080
I have good news for you.

469
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,750
What is it?

470
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,280
After Ah Shu came back,

471
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,920
she submitted a document to Yong,

472
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,670
stating her intention to form an alliance with Yong and the other countries.

473
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,750
Yong has agreed.

474
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,960
The document in reply will arrive soon.

475
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,070
That document also details

476
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,480
the truth behind your parents' murder.

477
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,910
Now all the people of Yong know that

478
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,290
your parents were heroes.

479
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,430
Therefore, the court awarded your father

480
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,030
the title of Minister of Rites

481
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,750
and your mother the title of Madam Mingluo County posthumously.

482
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,270
They also renovated your family tomb.

483
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,820
Come on.

484
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,500
Mr. Yu.

485
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,490
This is the wine you asked for.

486
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,520
I didn't forget it.

487
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,250
I wanted to bring it back to you.

488
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,740
You've grown up, haven't you?

489
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,940
You're taking things so seriously now.

490
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,560
You brat, you know that

491
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,480
I only said it on purpose that day

492
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,030
because of all the demoralizing words you said about not coming back.

493
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,950
There'll be a lot of nice wine of Yanle at the wedding.

494
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,870
Who would drink this?

495
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,170
Right.

496
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,800
This is a gift from my son.

497
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,170
No one can touch it.

498
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,380
Yes. Sure.

499
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,860
Empress of Yanle, Longshuang, is here.

500
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,510
Ah Shu.

501
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,550
You're so beautiful.

502
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,020
What are you doing?

503
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,670
Don't all the grooms remove the brides' veil when they get married?

504
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,470
Nonsense.

505
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,310
That's the etiquette of Yong.

506
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,110
This is Yanle.

507
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,970
Of course you should marry Empress Longshuang

508
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,770
in accordance with Yanle's etiquette of wedding.

509
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,310
Ah Shu.

510
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,630
So what do people do at Yanle's weddings?

511
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,350
Shut up.

512
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,590
Ah Shu.

513
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,100
So we'll just stand here?

514
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,750
It's so awkward.

515
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,140
Isn't there an emcee who'll take us through the wedding process?

516
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,070
Be quiet.

517
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,570
Ah Shu, what is this about?

518
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,990
What are you waiting for?

519
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,590
Dance.

520
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,450
Dance...

521
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,900
Aren't...

522
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,890
Aren't we going to worship the heaven and earth?

523
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,030
Why should we do that?

524
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,630
Dance.

525
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,760
So we'll just dance?

526
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,560
There... There's no ritual?

527
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,080
This is our ritual.

528
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,590
Relax.

529
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,320
Yanle's weddings are not that complicated.

530
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,350
All we need to do

531
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,590
is to dance happily together.

532
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,130
Come on.

533
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,980
Really?

534
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,570
Then I'll dance freely.

535
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,660
Dance.

536
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,950
The happier we dance, the longer our happiness will last.

537
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,030
Got it.

538
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,870
[Six months later]

539
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,790
The imperial physician said you should walk more.

540
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,970
I'll walk with you.

541
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,470
Wang.

542
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,920
Yuchi.

543
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,800
Ah Shu.

544
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,510
Ah Shu.

545
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,150
Yuan Mo.

546
00:33:59,150 --> 00:33:59,870
Kunwu.

547
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,470
Are you going on patrol again?

548
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,950
Yes.

549
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,190
When will you come back from this patrol?

550
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,270
It depends.

551
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,480
Maybe three months.

552
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,690
Maybe six months.

553
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:17,500
Anyway, we'll definitely be back

554
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,100
before the baby is born.

555
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,290
