00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,670
Wait. What are you doing?

4
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,870
Give me back my money!

5
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,870
Give me back my money.

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,310
Give me back my money.

7
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,280
There's really money.

8
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,880
Awesome.

9
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,790
So much money.

10
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,110
There's really money!

11
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,320
Yeah, a lot of money.

12
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,610
So much.

13
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,470
30 wens.

14
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,740
It's really 30 wens.

15
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,980
The Red Lotus Immortal didn't lie.

16
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,520
So it's true.

17
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,670

you'll be rewarded.

20
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,230
The Red Lotus Immortal is all-powerful!

21
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,710
The Red Lotus Immortal is all-powerful!

22
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,820
The Red Lotus Immortal is all-powerful!

23
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,210
The Red Lotus Immortal is all-powerful!

24
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm furious.

25
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,990
They actually used money to manipulate people.

26
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,340
Have they taken everyone for a fool?

27
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,070
People are losing their minds.

28
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,270
I must destroy that Magic Vase!

29
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,640
Those people are indeed despicable.

30
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,750
But there are two things I don't understand.

31
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,360
First,

32
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,960
how could that Magic Vase talk?

33
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,700
Second,

34
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,990
how did they know

35
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,720
how much you got in your wallet?

36
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,710
That's not hard.

37
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,490
I know how much money you have in your wallet too.

38
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,880
Stop bragging.

39
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,380
Here.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,640
Tell me.

41
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,110

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,870
Really?

43
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,220
So mysterious.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,570
How did you do it, Ah Shu?

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,690
If you insist on knowing,

48
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,030
I can only say

49
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,430
I'm a professional.

50
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,990
Let's not talk about that.

51
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,360
Let's drink. Come on.

52
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,820
Practice makes perfect.

53
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,390
Here.

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,050
Cheers.

55
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,700
We were searched before entering the Red Lotus Pavilion.

56
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
It all made sense now.

57
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,760
So before we entered the Red Lotus Pavilion,

58
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,230
we had already been targeted.

59
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,310
But no one went missing last night,

60
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,640
and there was no danger.

61
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,850
Where are the missing people?

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,390
Maybe we have to keep an eye on them for a while.

63
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,190
But the next gathering is half a month later.

64
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,500
Alright. It's getting late.

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,060
Go have a rest.

66
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,800
Thank you for the drink.

67
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,970
Take care. You can see yourselves out.

68
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,770
What are you thinking?

69
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,610
I just don't want those refugees

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,650
to be cheated.

71
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,270
I used to be like them,

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,630
homeless and displaced,

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,490
toiling every day.

74
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,430
The few coins I had were only enough to last me for a day.

75
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,190
I have a home,

76
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,260
friends,

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,590
and a job in Changle now,

78
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,670
and I don't need to worry about food and clothing anymore,

79
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,800
but the days when I had to endure hunger

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,650
and live at the mercy of others…

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,650
I can never forget them.

82
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,710
Those people came a long way to Changle

83
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,420
to make a living in Yong,

84
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,870
but those frauds

85
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,909
want to take away their last hope.

Yuan Mo.

87
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,460
You want me

88
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,470
to save them from the Red Lotus Society?

89
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,570
You're so smart.

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,950
You can definitely figure a way out.

91
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,110
Since you've made progress in Mandarin recently,

92
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,150
I'll give it a try.

93
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,350
Great!

94
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,750
I knew there was nothing you couldn't do.

95
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,230
You're so nice!

96
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Yu, Yu.

97
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,510
Greetings, Mr. Yu.

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,770
What is it?

99
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,560
I have a big gift for you.

100
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,590
Knock it off.

101
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,130
A big gift for me?

102
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,510
I'd be grateful if you didn't cheat me out of all my money.

103
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,900
It's really a big gift.

104
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,110
You know about the Red Lotus Society, don't you?

105
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,340
Wang Kunwu has reported it to me.

106
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,940
The Jingzhao Prefecture will deal with it when they have time.

107
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,610
And when will that be?

108
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,110
Are you in a hurry?

109
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,730
Don't you always avoid trouble?

110
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,850
The refugees' case involves many states.

111
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,050
It's a thankless job.

112
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,760
Are you hiding something from me?

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,290
Refugees from different states have gone missing in Yong.

114
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,490
I'm worried that Yong's prestige will be affected!

115
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,750
Yong's prestige will be affected!

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,190
Drop the act.

117
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,990
You're not being honest with me.

118
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,270
Just tell me whether you'll work on this case or not.

119
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,790
I will,

120
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,510
but not now.

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,580
I have a more important task for you.

122
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,330
Form an alliance with all states in the desert

123
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,400
to fight against Yanle together.

124
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,530
The Ministry of Rites has approved An Xiuyi's proposal.

125
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,950
Long Tuqi covets the unclaimed oasis.

126
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,260
It has revealed Yanle's desire

127
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,520
to control the trade route in the desert.

128
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,870
An Xiuyi's proposal to form an alliance

129
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,400
can counterbalance Yanle.

130
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,990
It's a brilliant idea.

131
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,330
You're actually speaking for him?

132
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,429
I'm just telling the truth.

133
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:33,840
Wait.

134
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,669
So we'll just let those frauds of the Red Lotus Society get away with it?

135
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,330
Forming an alliance can wait,

136
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,309
but saving the refugees can't.

137
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,940
Let me ask you.

138
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,220
Where did the refugees come from?

139
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,430
Why have they come here?

140
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,620
They came from different states

141
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,820
to make a living here.

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,070
Then why didn't they

143
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,670
make a living in their hometowns?

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,590
They couldn't make a living in their own hometowns,

145
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,650
so they came to Yong for a better life.

146
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,600
So, the riot is the root cause of the refugees' misfortune.

147
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,990
The alliance can solve the refugees' problems at the source.

148
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,720
We work at the Sifang Pavilion.

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,940
Our priority now is to unite different states.

150
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,830
As for saving the refugees…

151
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,560
That's indeed the duty of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

152
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,090
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

153
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,290
[Jingzhao Prefecture]

154
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,620
Because I work at the Sifang Pavilion now,

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,680
I can't command the Jingzhao troops anymore?

156
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
Why?

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,090
Since you've been transferred there,

158
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,330
you're a part of the Sifang Pavilion now.

159
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,640
Plus, with the recent surge of refugees in the city

160
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,310
and the frequent occurrence of incidents,

161
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,830
I really don't have extra hands to help you.

162
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,270
So do you want me

163
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,470
to find the missing refugees by myself?

164
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,960
As long as you let me

165
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
command the soldiers of Jingzhao,

166
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,130
I promise I'll take down the Red Lotus Society

167
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,330
and bring all the refugees back safely.

168
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,510
The refugees joined the Red Lotus Society

169
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,550
to console each other.

170
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,380
I don't think it's a big deal.

171
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,460
The Red Lotus Society is deceiving people.

172
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,670
The refugees will be in danger if they get in too deep.

173
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,640
How is this not a big deal?

174
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,700
Let me ask you.

175
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,430
Did any of those refugees die?

176
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,660
Did any of them get hurt?

177
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,320
Did any of them lose property?

178
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,150
Did they report it to the government?

179
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,610
T-They've gone missing. How could they report it?

180
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,040
Yuchi,

181
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,070
Jingzhao received hundreds of cases every day,

182
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,470
big and small.

183
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,690
And we have to abide by the law in Yong.

184
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,450
You don't have solid evidence

185
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,710
and don't even know who the victims are.

186
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,110
You can't even build a case

187
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,840
against the Red Lotus Society.

188
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,420
It'll be too late when I can.

189
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,230
The Jingzhao Prefecture is responsible for the security of Changle,

190
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,710
but when it comes to refugees,

191
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,580
the Ministry of Rites and the Sifang Pavilion are responsible.

192
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,020
No foreign affair is too small.

193
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,980
If you can't handle it well, you'll be in big trouble.

194
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,470
If you don't help me,

195
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,730
I'll find a way myself.

196
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,620
You…

197
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,590
Please tell Duke Er

198
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,470
that I've done my best.

199
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,540
As long as she didn't take any soldiers from you,

200
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,080
Duke Er can be relieved.

201
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,390
[Archive Room]

202
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,900
Xiyuan is abundant in matsutake mushrooms?

203
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,360
Yuan Mo.

204
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
I recall that Xiyuan switched to tea cultivation

205
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,320
in the second year of Anping.

206
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,830
When was this information collected?

207
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,710
Is it accurate?

208
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,480
Kunwu,

209
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,150
aren't you worried about Yuchi Hua at all?

210
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,830
Can she pull it off alone?

211
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,600
Why don't we give her a hand?

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,240
Let's go help her.

213
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,080
Come on. Let's go help her.

214
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,030
Just do your job.

215
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,070
Why are you so proactive now?

216
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,070
Ji's half a month's rent

217
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,530
is such a good motivation?

218
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,920
I'm not doing it for money.

219
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,510
I may appear flippant,

220
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,130
but you have to believe that I'm a caring man.

221
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,830
I don't believe it.

222
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,470
Fine.

223
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,790
For Yong, I can…

224
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,730
Don't be weird!

225
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,190
I promised Ah Shu to help the refugees.

226
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,250
I don't want her to call me a deadbeat.

227
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,150
Find all the files we may need for the alliance.

228
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,830
We'll take them away.

229
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,430
Yes!

230
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,190
Don't miss anything.

231
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,790
Wait.

232
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,840
Retainer An.

233
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,910
The West Court needs those files too.

234
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,590
You guys?

235
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,550
Don't waste your time.

236
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,190
An Xiuyi,

237
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,930
you want to take all the credit again?

238
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,040
Although you proposed

239
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
to form the alliance,

240
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,140
the task was assigned by Yu.

241
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,490
The West Court should play a part in it too, okay?

242
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,930
You want to play a part?

243
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,910
Okay.

244
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,990
Let me ask you.

245
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,710
How are the relationships between the five states now?

246
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,750
What is the current system in each state?

247
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,550
What goods do they barter with each other?

248
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,150
What common interests do they share with Yong?

249
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,750
Kunwu.

250
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:46,990
Answer him.

251
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,290
You answer him.

252
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,230
You guys, d-don't make a mess.

253
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,600
You can't even answer such simple questions,

254
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,400
yet you think you can assist in forming the alliance.

255
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
You're so conceited.

256
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,150
Take the files away.

257
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes.

258
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,310
Kunwu.

259
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,870
You've really disappointed me!

260
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,870
You riffled through those files for so long.

261
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,990
How could you fail to answer all his questions?

262
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,390
You riffled through those files for a long time too.

263
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,910
Then you should've stopped them at least.

264
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,590
No need.

265
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,030
An Xiuyi reminded me.

266
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,590
We know very little about the five states now.

267
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,720
Just relying on those outdated files,

268
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,910
we can't find out the current situation of the five states.

269
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,390
We need to learn from someone who knows the five states

270
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,470
very well.

271
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,270
Give classes?

272
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,190
This is the best way to help people in the West Court improve their abilities

273
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,120
and understand the affairs of the five states

274
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,250
in a short time.

275
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,310
Yu.

276
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,890
You're perfect for this task.

277
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,390
Without my father,

278
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
you would've been the one

279
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,830
who was sent to Yanle.

280
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,170
Moreover, you receive the latest intelligence

281
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,650
every day,

282
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,550
which…

283
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,850
we don't have access to.

284
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,920
Yuan Mo is right.

285
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,320
It's useless to flatter me.

286
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,950
To give classes every day?

287
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,710
I'm not young anymore.

288
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,670
How can I handle that?

289
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,310
Yu!

290
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,830
Except for you,

291
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,630
in the whole Yong,

292
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,670
I can't think of anyone else

293
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,870
who is qualified to give these classes!

294
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,810
If you don't agree,

295
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,470
I'll go to the Ministry of Rites now

296
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,430
to find another teacher.

297
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,070
Go ahead.

298
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,200
The Ministry of Rites, right?

299
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
The Ministry…

300
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,740
[Discretion and Respect]

301
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,990
After thinking about it,

302
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,430
I'm very glad

303
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,230
that you're so willing to learn.

304
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,750
Since Retainer Wang has proposed it,

305
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,020
I'll report it to the Ministry of Rites right away

306
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,890
to apply for special funds for the teaching.

307
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,320
Wait for me to come back with good news.

308
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,520
He changed his mind so quickly?

309
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,750
No.

310
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,400
Yu has never taken any work so seriously before.

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
It doesn't feel real.

312
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,870
Come on. Welcome.

313
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,270
Come in with me.

314
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,860
Retainer Wang, this way.

315
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,470
Watch your step.

316
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,470
Come on in.

317
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,600
This way. Come here.

318
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,320
Retainer Wang,

319
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,470
someone has been waiting for you

320
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,080
for a long time.

321
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,790
Please.

322
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,720
This way, please.

323
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,390
Yu.

324
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,430
What took you so long?

325
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,500
Mr. Yu.

326
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,410
What does this mean?

327
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,150
Didn't you ask me to give you classes?

328
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,830
Here?

329
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,470
Where the classes are given is not important.

330
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,310
What matters is to learn and have fun.

331
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,790
Come on. Sit.

332
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,390
Sit.

333
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,870
Sit.

334
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,040
Guys, sit down.

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,480
Liu.

336
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

337
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,880
we won't sing songs tonight.

338
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,110
We'll tell stories and put on plays.

339
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,030
You won't be disappointed.

340
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,540
Great! Great!

341
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,610
Come on.

342
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,190
Coming.

343
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,590
I've saved a seat for you.

344
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,150
Have you memorized the teaching scripts?

345
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,150
Yes.

346
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,270
Please start your performance.

347
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,140
Okay.

348
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,350
The sun sets over the long river.

349
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,000
Crows fly in disarray.

350
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,480
All states vie for supremacy.

351
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,650
The five powers pit themselves against each other.

352
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,310
Brothers are at each other's throats.

353
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,230
Wars never end.

354
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,510
One state falls, and another rises.

355
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,829
This is…

356
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,630
the story of the desert!

357
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,829
Great! Great!

358
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,180
Tonight, we're going to tell the story

359
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,690
of the five states in the desert.

360
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,069
Originally,

361
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,069
there were only four states.

362
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,580
But the ruler of Yuan was old and feeble,

363
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,830
which led to his two sons

364
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,280
fighting for the throne.

365
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,110
The two brothers turned against each other.

366
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,590
They took up arms and staked their own claim.

367
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,470
Go away!

368
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,730
As a result, Yuan split into Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

369
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,510
So this is how Yuan split into two states.

370
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,270
Interesting.

371
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,160
Indeed.

372
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,990
You know what?

373
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,230
The people of Yuan don't want to fight against their own kind,

374
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,940
but someone keeps sowing discord

375
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,150
between the two states.

376
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,500
This man is no one else

377
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,750
but the Viceroy of Yanle, Long Tuqi.

378
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,310
So it's Long Tuqi

379
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,640
who has been sowing discord between them.

380
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,840
Great!

381
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,690
Great! Great!

382
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,670
Great!

383
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,440
In order to build an alliance with Mobei,

384
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,940
Yueying married their princess to the khan of Mobei.

385
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,540
It marked the start of…

386
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,670
This must be the story of the marriage alliance between Yueying and Mobei.

387
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,800
Unfortunately, fate had other plans.

388
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,510
Mobei's khan suddenly died.

389
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,460
Yueying's princess, left with no choice,

390
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,150
was then married to the new khan of Mobei.

391
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,250
But this new khan was

392
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,310
the princess' son in name.

393
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,470
The princess refused to marry him,

394
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,730
so the queen of Yueying asked the new khan

395
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,090
to return the princess.

396
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,790
Come out! Come out!

397
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,210
But the new khan wouldn't return her.

398
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,150
Therefore, Yueying cut ties

399
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,690
with Mobei.

400
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,320
The new khan

401
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,280
was nominally the nephew of the queen of Yueying.

402
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,200
After he married her sister,

403
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,540
it made him the queen's brother-in-law.

404
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,520
Long Tuqi wouldn't miss out on

405
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,010
such a great opportunity.

406
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,550
He told Yueying,

407
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,310
"To Yanle, the new khan of Mobei

408
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,310
is still the queen's nephew."

409
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,540
In the meantime, he told Mobei,

410
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,170
"Yanle supports the new khan

411
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,930
and thinks he should be treated as an equal to the queen of Yueying."

412
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,830
Originally, a river marked the boundary

413
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,090
between Yuluo and the two states of Yuan.

414
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,090
However, due to the rise and fall of the river,

415
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,290
disputes arose among the three states.

416
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,790
Therefore, Yuluo, Xiyuan, and Dongyuan

417
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,690
have been at loggerheads with each other.

418
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,580
Do it!

419
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,060
Kill him! Let's do it together.

420
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,980
Fight!

421
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,240
The five states are constantly in conflict.

422
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Long Tuqi has played a part in it.

423
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,070
Great!

424
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,390
Great!

425
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,460
Mr. Yu.

426
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,990
You barely said anything tonight.

427
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,370
All you've been saying is "great."

428
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,540
It's indeed great.

429
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,260
But I have to say,

430
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,860
it's a great idea, Yu.

431
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,310
You made everything easy to understand.

432
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,990
Great!

433
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,660
Great! Great!

[Sifang Pavilion]

435
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,750
We have to work together again?

436
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,150
That's what Mr. Yu wants.

437
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Where is Mr. Yu?

438
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,150
I have to confirm it with him myself.

439
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,550
If we have to work together on everything,

440
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,110
there's no need to divide us into two courts.

441
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,710
We might as well merge into one court.

442
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,110
Can't we work separately?

443
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,790
Exactly.

444
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,390
Why should we cooperate?

445
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,570
The West Court…

446
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,780
What can you guys do?

447
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,700
Sit down.

448
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,470
The West Court

449
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,370
is different now.

450
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,550
If you don't believe me, ask us anything

451
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,180
about the five states.

452
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,260
We don't know less than you do.

453
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,470
I've heard it.

454
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,750
Mr. Yu helped you.

455
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,510
You guys are so hard-working.

456
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,310
You actually went to the Ruyi Pavilion for lessons.

457
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,930
Where the lessons were given is none of your business.

458
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,580
Fine.

459
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,030
In that case,

460
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,810
the West Court has to show some sincerity.

461
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,430
Invite the envoys of the five states to the Sifang Pavilion in three days

462
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,030
to discuss the alliance together.

463
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,690
Do you dare?

464
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,870
Why should we do that?

465
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,530
Sit down.

466
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,030
Okay.

467
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,670
As long as Yong can form an alliance with the five states,

468
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,870
the West Court is willing to cooperate.

469
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,290
Then, we'll wait for you to bring us good news.

470
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,050
Let's go.

471
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,790
I was being tough.

472
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,030
Yet you said we'd cooperate.

473
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,190
It's all over.

474
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,750
Dongyuan is willing to fight against Yanle.

475
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,310
But the people of Yuluo cross the border

476
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,270
for fishing every time the river rises.

477
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,230
If you want me to attend the meeting,

478
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,390
the envoy of Yuluo has to stay 30 meters away

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,750

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,670
Yuluo has always respected Yong.

[Yuluo Embassy]

483
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,480
I shouldn't object to this.

484
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,540
But Dongyuan and Xiyuan

485
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,630
keep detaining my people.

[Lord Li, the envoy of Yuluo]

487
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,710
I don't want to see the envoys of those two states.

488
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,150
I'm fine with everything else.

My khan is the brother-in-law of the queen of Yueying.

491
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,920
So, I and the Yueying Envoy

[Lord Ao, the envoy of Mobei]

493
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,440

but the Yuluo Envoy will in no way agree to them.

517
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,940

Otherwise, they can't hear each other.

So the people of Yuan are proud to have a loud voice.

532

No wonder the two states can't make peace.

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,510
The Yuluo Envoy needs to be 30 meters away.

547

To meet the requirements of all the envoys,

548
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,150

to meet the requirements of all envoys at the same time,

561
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,120
you can take it as a joke.

Young Master An,

563
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,480
you proposed to form the alliance.

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,160
Even if Yuan Mo can help us make it,

565
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,720
the credit will still be yours in the end.

566
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,650
I'll pay you the money,

567
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,110
and you'll give me the drawing.

568
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,710
Generous.

569
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,170
He's so generous.

570
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,390
If we renovate this place according to your drawing

571
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,910
but still can't meet the requirements of the five envoys…

572
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,170
I'll give you a refund.

573
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,910
Ten times more.

Look.

The Xiyuan Envoy refuses

591
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,430
to sit at the same table as the Dongyuan Envoy.

592
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,950
So I've arranged for each envoy

593
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,630
to sit in a separate pavilion.

594
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,490
They won't sit together this way.

595
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,580
The demand of the Xiyuan Envoy can be met,

596
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,110
and the other envoys will be treated equally.

597
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,830
The Dongyuan Envoy requests

598
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,290
the Yuluo Envoy to be 30 meters away from him.

599
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,580
The diagonal of our garden

600
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,900
is exactly 30 meters long.

601
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,180
The Yueying Envoy wants to be held in higher regard

602
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,500
than the Mobei Envoy.

603
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,590
Then we'll build the Yueying Envoy's pavilion

604
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,990
on a platform.

605
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,680
The Mobei Envoy demands to be treated equally as the Yueying Envoy.

606
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,320
Then we'll make both his table

607
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,860
and chair higher.

608
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,270
This way, the Yueying Envoy

609
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,200
can sit higher than the Mobei Envoy

610
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,310
while she's right at his eye level.

611
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,110
What about the Yuluo Envoy?

612
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,390
He doesn't even want to meet

613
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,320
the envoys of Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

614
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,130
These five pavilions are like the five petals of a plum flower,

with Yong in the center

616
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,230
to connect the five states.

617
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,410
It's worth ten strings, isn't it?

618
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,280
It's a good plan,

619
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,030
but the envoys will be far from each other.

620
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,890
How can they talk with each other?

621
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,880
Do you expect them to talk face-to-face?

622
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,810
First of all, I'm very honored

You should know the relationships between the five states.

If we have a quarrel later,

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm afraid it'll be very embarrassing for the host.

You're right.

631
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,910
So we specially set

632
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,980
new rules for this meeting.

633
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,030

They'll pass your message to us.

Then the retainers of the East and West Courts

637
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,190
of the Sifang Pavilion will discuss them with their colleagues

638
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,110
and summarize your opinions

639
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,070

To become a public servant,

653
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,550
you have to be able to solve a problem like this.

654
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,610
I think they're almost done discussing.

00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,710
Let's go and see what the result is.

656
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,700
Dongyuan has no objection.

657
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,140
Xiyuan has no objection.

Envoys, you all have big hearts.

662
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,410
You've managed to form an alliance despite your differences.

663
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,060
It's not an easy thing to do.

664
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,240
At our first meeting, Yong and the five states

665
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,680
reached a preliminary consensus.

666
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,310

Dongyuan, Xiyuan, and Yuluo

684
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,350
Yong and the five states share a common cause

685
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,110
and will jointly fight against Yanle.

686
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,540
Yong and the five states will always be brothers.

687
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,550
It's essential for us to work together

688
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,070
for long-term survival.

689
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,470
Brothers?

690
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,970
Yueying's queen is the aunt of Mobei's khan.

691
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,220
You can't ignore seniority and call us brothers.

692
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,800
Is Yong going to help Mobei

693
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,230
humiliate Yueying?

694
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,760
Yueying won't sign

695

Aunt?

697
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,290
Yueying's princess

698
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,510
has married the new khan of Mobei,

699
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,590
which has made our khan the queen's brother-in-law.

700
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,150
Our khan

701
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,170
is no longer your queen's nephew.

702
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,170
Does Yueying mean

703
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,850
to look down on Mobei?

704
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,190
You…

705
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,270
Please calm down.

706
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,489
This is just the draft.

707
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,270
If there are any improper words in the agreement,

708
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,270
we can change them anytime.

709
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,070
You came here today

710
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,750
because you all approve of the alliance.

711
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,030
We're like brothers and must not turn against each other.

712
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,030
Otherwise, people will laugh at us.

713
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,270
Do you mean

714
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,030
you've been laughing at

715
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,159
Dongyuan and Xiyuan all this time?

716
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,989
Dongyuan won't sign such an agreement!

717
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,219
It's true that your rulers are brothers and have turned against each other.

718
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,550
He just said it out loud.

719
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,389
I'm not interested in the farce between Dongyuan and Xiyuan.

720
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,510
I just want to know when you'll release the people of Yuluo

721
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,739
who you detained for no reason.

722
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,820
Yuluo Envoy, stop talking nonsense!

723
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,370
Your people broke the rules and crossed the border first.

724
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,280
I knew it.

725
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,130
The Yuluo Envoy

726
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,040
is not here for peace talks!

727
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,880
All you think about

728
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,320
is business!

729
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,000
What's wrong with doing business?

730
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,190
It's better than being as poor as Xiyuan.

731
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,870
If war was declared,

732
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,020
Xiyuan wouldn't be afraid of you!

733
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,880
If we were to fight in war,

734
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,670
Yuluo wouldn't be afraid either.

735
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,350
Show some respect,

736
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,320
or I'll make sure you can't walk out of here alive!

737
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,630
Let me remind you.

738
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,650
This is the Sifang Pavilion of Yong.

739
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,850
If you dare to act out,

740
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,900
there'll be consequences.

741
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,740
Envoys,

742
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,100
please calm down.

743
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,530
We can talk.

744
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,150
There's nothing to talk about.

745
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,910
Relying on these scoundrels to fight against Yanle

746
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,700
is so ridiculous.

747
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,930
I'm leaving.

748
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,830
Scoundrels?

749
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,440
Don't go if you dare!

750
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,480
I don't think there'll be an alliance.

751
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,300
Let's go.

752
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:48,980
Let's go!

753
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,080
We're leaving too.

754
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,160
Everything was fine.

755
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,870
How did it end like this?

756
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,740
[Yanle Hall]

757
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,200
The five states in the desert have always been on bad terms.

758
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,990
There's only one reason why they've gathered together.

759
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,450
They want to target Yanle.

760
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,540
But the meeting didn't end well.

761
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,550
When the envoys of the five states left,

762
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,950
they were still arguing.

763
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,790
It didn't look like they had reached an agreement.

764
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,580
No matter what, we have to plan ahead.

765
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,050
Send a letter to the Viceroy

766
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,550
and tell him to send secret envoys to each state.

767
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,190
Yes.

768
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,100
Wait.

769
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,890
Among the five states,

770
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,690
Yuluo and Mobei are the most powerful.

771
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,910
But Yuluo and Yanle have been enemies for generations.

772
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,880
There's no wiggle room at all.

773
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,510
So Mobei is the most important for us.

774
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,430
Tell the Viceroy to win them over with great profits.

775
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,190
You asked for the full support of the Ministry of Rites

776
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,120
and the full cooperation of the Sifang Pavilion.

777
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
But how did it end?

778
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,510
You ruined the alliance plan!

779
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,790
You're of no help at all!

780
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,050
Vice Minister An, calm down.

781
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,060
Xiuyi didn't mean it to happen.

782
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,620
Don't defend him!

783
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,990
Let him take responsibility for his own mistake!

784
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:54,980
Don't worry.

785
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,770
You don't have to say it.

786
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,100
I won't get you involved and punished because of me.

787
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,030
What did you say?

788
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,480
When I did a good job,

789
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,750
you always pretended not to see it.

790
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,320
But when I made a small mistake,

791
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,250
you rushed here and criticized me.

792
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,240
All these years,

793
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,120
you've never cared for me.

794
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,430
So I don't need you

795
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,870
to take responsibility for me now.

796
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,390
I'll take responsibility for my own mistake.

797
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,390
I'll clean up

798
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,270
the mess I made.

799
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,550
Xiuyi…

800
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,190
Look at him.

801
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,550
That's no way to admit his mistake!

802
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,510
An, calm down.

803
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,990
He's young and proud. Don't take it to heart.

804
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,560
He…

805
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,250
Yuan Mo is here.

806
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,910
Vice Minister An.

807
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,450
You asked to see me?

808
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,870
Did you draw this painting?

809
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,270
Yes.

810
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,270
You're quite smart.

811
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,360
Thank you, Vice Minister An.

812
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,450
You must be smug,

813
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,610
so you still don't know

814
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,690
what is wrong with this arrangement.

815
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,690
Please enlighten me, Vice Minister An.

816
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,240
When the envoys of two states meet,

817
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,830
there needs to be special officials beside them

818
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,490
to explain and accurately convey what they say.

819
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,070
In this meeting,

820
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,550
you let the clerks of the East Court pass the messages.

821
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,830
If they misunderstood and distorted the original messages,

822
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,070
or omitted important information and caused misunderstandings between two states,

823
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,710
it'd be too late.

824
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,350
You're right.

825
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,860
The key to forming an alliance

826
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,990
is finding out

827
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,670
the fundamental interests of each state

828
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,040
and then hitting them where it hurts.

829
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,950
Before that,

830
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,920
any tricks will be in vain.

831
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,470
Remember.

832
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,710
No foreign affair is too small.

833
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,850
I'll keep that in mind.

834
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,390
Yuan Mo.

835
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,550
Your father was far more capable

836
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,710
at your age.

837
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,270
Since Vice Minister An just said that

838
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,320
no foreign affair is too small,

839
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,230
I do have a small matter to tell you.

840
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,750
An,

841
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,310
I guess this brat

842
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,920
is going to talk about the refugees and the Red Lotus Society.

843
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,030
Yes.

844
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,110
I'm afraid it's hard to form an alliance

845
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,110
with the five states in a short time.

846
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,750
Why don't we seize this opportunity

847
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,520
to help the refugees settle down

848
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
and win them over?

849
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,050
It might be helpful

850
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,300
for the future alliance.

851
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,390
He has a point.

852
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,580
Lin, the magistrate of Jingzhao,

853
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,240
has already thrown that hot potato to the Sifang Pavilion.

854
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,400
Get it done as soon as possible.

855
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,390
Don't cause me any trouble.

856
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,410
Yes.

857
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,620
He has no manners at all.

858
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,550
[Zhen'an Hall]

859
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,510
I need to do something today.

860
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,710
But first, it's not a task assigned by the Jingzhao Prefecture.

861
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,480
Second, it's not a mission from the Sifang Pavilion.

862
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,650
Third, I don't have my father's order.

863
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,790
I just want to seek justice

864
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,360
and let everyone know that

865
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,700
the Yuchi family is a noble family in Changle,

866
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,790
but we care about

867
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,380
the ordinary people very much.

868
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,990
Will you

869
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,990
help me today?

870
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,790
Yes!

871
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:44,700
Today, we'll wipe out the Red Lotus Society!

872
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,350
Let's go.

873
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,920
Yes!

874
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,310
The gate is over there.

875
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,440
Where are you going?

876
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,900
Wait.

877
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,660
Mr. Huang?

878
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,070
What do you want this time?

879
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,270
Duke Er has given his order.

880
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,350
The soldiers of Yuchi's Mansion

881
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,950
can drink and have fun at their will today

882
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,810
but can't step out of the mansion.

883
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,550
Does that old man

884
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,510
mean to get in my way?

885
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,540
Actually, Duke Er cares for you very much.

886
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,310
As long as you relent and say something nice…

887
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:13,840
Dream on.

888
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,310
I haven't gotten even with him for the election.

889
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,510
You want me to beg him?

890
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,880
Even if he doesn't give me any soldiers,

891
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,390
I'll still destroy the Red Lotus Society on my own.

892
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,400
Master said

893
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,510
he won't step in if you want to challenge the Red Lotus Society alone.

894
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,160
Hua, have some tea.

895
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,830
Don't be angry.

896
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,390
I'm so angry!

897
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,000
Father, Mr. Huang, and Lin

898
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,020
either refused to help or got in my way.

899
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,650
I won't let them stop me.

900
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,470
I must destroy the Red Lotus Society

901
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,930
and save all the refugees!

902
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,570
Are you really going to save the refugees?

903
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,380
Of course!

904
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,990
I have to show those chauvinist officials

905
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,470
that I can do great things

906
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,900
without their help!

907
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,230
If you're going to do it,

908
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,030
I'll help you.

909
00:42:59,190 --> 00:42:59,830
You?

910
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,210
Ah Shu,

911
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,350
with you, there are only two of us.

912
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,050
How can we wipe out the Red Lotus Society?

913
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,580
Its disciples can drown us with their saliva.

914
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,600
I have a plan.

915
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,490
Come, sit down.

916
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,350
Do you remember the guy

917
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,010
who we all thought was a plant?

918
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,830
His name is Chen…

919
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,880
Xinliang?

920
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:23,630
Right.

921
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,750
We can't deal with everyone,

922
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,550
but we can arrest

923
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,790
and interrogate him.

924
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,360
Maybe we can find a way to make a breakthrough.

925
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,360
You have a point.

926
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,130
Ah Shu.

927
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,720
You're so smart.

928
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,630
Hua.

929
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,390
Should we find a refugee to make some inquiries first?

930
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,030
Okay, let's split up.

931
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:51,790
Be careful.

932
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,830
Sorry.

933
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,110
Let me light it up for you.

934
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,490
It's okay.

935
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,980
My name is Ah Shu. What's your name?

936
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
My name is Xiao'e.

937
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,120
This is my first time here.

938
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,520
I don't know how it works.

939
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,990
The Red Lotus Immortal gave out money the other day.

940
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,870
You missed it.

941
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,290
Gave out money?

942
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,030
Really?

943
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,400
I heard it from others.

944
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,880
So I came to check it out.

945
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,110
I heard that the Red Lotus Immortal

946
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,610
is going to use magic to cure people tonight.

947
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,510
Really?

948
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,390
I can't wait to see it.

949
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,270
Donation.

950
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,950
Extend your arms.

951
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,520
Donation.

952
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,590
Extend your arms.

953
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,650
Every disciple has to donate.

954
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,650
Every disciple has to donate.

955
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,560
You guys promised to give me back more.

956
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,410
I want it now.

957
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,710
If you're not devout,

958
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,820
why have you come here?

959
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,030
Only when you are devout

960
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,280
can you be blessed.

961
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:10,350
Donate.

962
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,030
Ah Shu.

963
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,120
I have good news for you.

964
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:21,880
Ah Shu?

965
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,470
Ah Shu?

966
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,490
Where is she?

967
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:29,150
Ah Shu!

968
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:37,670
Oh no.
