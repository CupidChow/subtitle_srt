[Suburb Inn]

4
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,670
If Ah Shu plans to return to Yanle,

5
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,729
this is the inn she must pass through.

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,780
Gentlemen,

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,030
have you seen a girl?

8
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,950
She's about this tall and she's quite thin.

9
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,950
She's from Yanle.

10
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,880
Yes, we have.

11
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,730
Really?

12
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,230
Where? Take me to her.

Upstairs.

14
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,919
Great! Quickly, take me to her.

15

16
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,550

Alright.

Come on, hurry up, hurry!

Sir, please don't rush.

She's in the room.

21
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,910
Just follow me.

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay. Ah Shu!

23
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,840
Ah Shu, it's me, Yuan Mo!

24

Don't come any closer!

42
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,350
If you come any closer, I'll jump!

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,350
Go ahead and jump!

44
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,110
If you jump, you'll be half-crippled.

Then we'll throw you to the dogs in the back hills.

Answer me first.

63
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,560
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

64
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,670
You even drugged me before leaving.

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,340
Did you really intend to never let me find you again?

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,390
Yes.

67
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:54,970
Why?

68
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,490
Don't ask anymore.

69
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,760
The person they're looking for is you.

70
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:03,710
Right?

71
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,410
That day in the shoe shop,

72
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,070
I recognized two people.

73
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,880
They were from Yanle Embassy.

74
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,880
If I hadn't arrived in time,

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,280
they probably would have captured you

76
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,390
and checked if there was a mark on your foot.

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,350
This is a red Vanessa butterfly.

78
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,280
It's the totem of my mother's clan.

79
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,450
It's been tattooed on me since birth.

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,260
It's also because of this red Vanessa butterfly

81
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,670
that I'm being hunted

82
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,490
and forced to live on the run.

83
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,240
Even those close to me will be implicated.

85
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me go.

86
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,550
I don't want to drag you into this.

87
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,010
Alright.

88
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,950
If you leave,

89
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,400
I'll go with you.

90
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,250
Why would you come with me?

91
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,620
Once my identity is exposed,

92
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,630
I'll have to continue living a life of constant wandering.

93
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,870
I don't even know where I'll go

94
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,230
from one moment to the next.

95
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,909
Wherever you go, I'll go.

96
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,710
If you wander,

97
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll wander with you.

98
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,909
Why are you being so foolish?

99
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,170
You have a home and friends in Changle.

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
You have work too.

101
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,800
Why give up everything for me?

102
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,890
Because you are my everything.

103
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,930
From the moment I met you,

104
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,870
from the moment you moved into my home,

105
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,300

you know so much.

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
You even know how to start a fire.

129
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,940
From Yanle to Yong,

130
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
this is how I've managed all the way.

131
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,230
It's impressive.

132
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,040
It's dry now.

133
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,150
Now, can you talk about it?

134
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,870
Tell me about your past

135
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,030
and everything I don't know yet.

136
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,970
I only learned about what happened back then many years later.

137
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,710
When Long Tuqi staged the military coup,

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,470
I wasn't even a year old.

139
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,680
After Uncle Yuan took me out of the palace,

140
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,060
we were pursued by The Faceless.

141
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,810
To save me,

142
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,430
they gave me their only horse.

143
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,930
That horse carried me

144
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,550
and kept sprinting

145
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,390
until it finally reached its former owner's home.

146
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,030
Later, that uncle sent me to the countryside.

147
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
I grew up eating from many families.

148
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,270
He would secretly send people

149
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,000
to teach me self-defense and escape techniques.

150
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,910
When I was six years old,

151
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,120
I learned about my true identity.

152
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,360
You did it.

153
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,010
You escaped the desert

154
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,830
and reached Changle.

155
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,310
I owe all of this to Uncle Yuan.

156
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,620
Without him,

157
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,570
there wouldn't be the me of today.

158
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,990
My father would be pleased if he knew from the afterlife.

159
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,150
And that uncle who secretly raised you,

160
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,330
I really hope that one day,

161
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,360
I can meet him.

162
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,110
You will.

163
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,230
Actually, he's in Changle City.

164
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,820
It's just that right now,

165
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,910
I can't tell you his identity.

166
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,010

167

Let's hurry and go.

The Man in White has his eyes on you.

169
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,160
It's not safe anymore to stay at home.

170
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,220
I have to find you a safe place to stay.

174

Don't tell anyone else.

175
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,610
Should I also keep it a secret from

176
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,650
Wang and Yuchi?

177
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,280
The fewer people who know, the better.

178
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,820
If you tell them,

179
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,960

Isn't Princess Yanle already dead?

189
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,390
Princess who?

190
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,710
No body, no death, right?

191
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,910
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

192
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,950
Exactly.

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,320
Mr. Yu.

194
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,830
Go on.

195
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,630
Rumors say Princess Yanle is dead.

196
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,090
Now we're suddenly asked to find her.

197
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,590
Have we received some new information?

198
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,430
Not only that,

199
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,710
but according to reliable sources,

200
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,580
Princess Yanle is right here in Changle City.

201
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,670
What? Right here in Changle City?

202
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,630
Is that for real?

203
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,790
Alright,

204
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,790
everyone listen carefully.

205
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,310
Princess Yanle has a special mark on her foot.

206
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,380
All foreign women entering or leaving Changle City recently

207
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,640
must be checked quickly, one by one.

208
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
Because it's not just us,

209
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,830
the Yanle people and the Man in White are also looking for her.

210
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,150
If they find her first,

211
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,990
Long Tuqi could use the princess as a hostage

212
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,030
to oppress the people internally

213
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,510
and wage war externally.

214
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,550
The consequences would be unimaginable.

215
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,660
Therefore, we must

216
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,180
find her before they do

217
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,630
and place her under Yong's protection.

218
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,410
Do you understand?

219
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,380
Understood.

220
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,140
[Huaiyuan Hall]

221
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,150
What's wrong?

222
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,570
How did your attempt to investigate Ah Shu go the other day?

223
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,640
Don't even mention it.

224
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,070
While washing Ah Shu's feet, I took the opportunity

225
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,070
to take a look.

226
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,570
But there was nothing.

227
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,690
I even got splashed with water all over me.

228
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,610
I told you,

229
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,410
how could Ah Shu possibly be Princess Yanle?

230
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,440
Yuan Mo,

231
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,110
I saw you riding a horse through the streets in a panic yesterday.

232
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,310
Where were you going?

233
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,360
Nature calls, you know.

234
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,340
It's embarrassing, but I must confess.

235
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,520
I... I have a strange habit.

236
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,100
I must use the toilet at my own home.

237
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,110
Yesterday's situation was really urgent.

238
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,990
So I borrowed a horse by the roadside.

239
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,110
The more urgent I felt, the faster I rode.

240
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,910
And the horse bounced even more.

241
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,310
All the way...

242
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,310
Enough, enough.

243
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,830
You can stop now.

244
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,230
It's disgusting, you know?

245
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,160
Too disgusting.

246
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,730
What are you thinking?

247
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,260
I was talking about the sound of horse hooves.

248
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,230
Enough chatting with you guys.

249
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,030
I'm going to investigate leads on Princess Yanle.

250
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,960
It's all here now.

251
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,630
Didn't I say it was enough?

252
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,870
Why are you bringing so much more?

253
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,250
I'm worried you won't be comfortable.

254
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,760
Look.

255
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,510
Your tickle powder and knockout powder.

256
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,910
Ink, brushes, paper, inkstone, and chess manuals.

257
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,870
They're all here.

258
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,730
And over there.

259
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,780
The bowls and teacups you usually use.

260
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,870
The jars and bottles for making rouge.

261
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,870
And the fragrances are all here too.

262
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,230
-Tell me if we're missing anything.
-Are you stupid?

263
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,030
Did I forget something?

264
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,670
Why don't you just move the whole house here?

265
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,990
Sure, I'll go call a carriage now.

266
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,190
I was just kidding.

267
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,630
I know.

268
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,860
I'm just teasing you.

269
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,150
Oh, right.

270
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,980
I brought Poppet for you too.

271
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,290
It wants to protect you.

272
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,650
Poppet.

273
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,830
This is our new home.

274
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,080
Poppet.

275
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,090
Poppet, come out.

276
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,150
Ah Shu.

277
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,450
I'm sorry you have to go through this.

278
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,080
This is hardly a hardship.

279
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,530
This is much better than where I used to live.

280
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,940
Before I came to Changle,

281
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,550
I was drifting around, living under others' roofs.

282
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,210
I still made it here, didn't I?

283
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,170
Look.

284
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,660
It's so spacious here.

285
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,390
The sunlight is nice too.

286
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,150
There's even a bathtub for bathing.

287
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,480
It's really quite nice.

288
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
You don't need to worry about me.

289
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,240
You, on the other hand.

290
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,480
Now that the Man in White can't find me,

291
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,710
he might take it out on you.

292
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,950
How could that happen?

293
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,630
Who am I?

294
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,270
I can protect myself.

295
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,340
Come here.

296
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,240
Why don't you move in and live with me?

297
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,380
I don't want to be apart from you either.

298
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,310
But if I come here every day,

299
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,650
it's bound to arouse suspicion.

300
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,090
That would put you in danger instead.

301
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,020
Just bear with it a little longer.

302
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,910
I'll find a way to bring you back home as soon as possible.

303
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,510
Alright.

304
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,350
Then you must come to visit me often.

305
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,800
Otherwise,

306
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,640
I'll send Poppet back to your house

307
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,010
to crawl into your bed and bite you!

308
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,530
Bite you!

309
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,370
Poppet isn't like you.

310
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,190
I've never bitten like this before.

311
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,270
I'll bite you right now.

312
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,600
You're poking my lungs.

313
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,580
I'll talk to Wang Kunwu when I get back

314
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,870
and ask him to put me in charge of the temporary travel passes for this area.

315
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,510
You should go back now.

316
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,910
Don't let anyone see you.

317
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,310
I'm leaving then.

318
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,030
Sweet Spring Square?

319
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,320
Yes.

320
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,400
What's weirder

321
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,790
is that Ah Shu was dressed up as a refugee.

322
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,070
I almost didn't recognize her.

323
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,760
She didn't stay at home

324
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,210
but instead moved to a shabby house in Sweet Spring Square.

325
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,609
Could there be something shady going on?

326
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,380
Right after Mr. Yu gave the order to find Princess Yanle,

327
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,500
Yuan Mo hid Ah Shu in Sweet Spring Square.

328
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,270
This is definitely not a coincidence.

329
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,880
Could Ah Shu be the princess of Yanle?

330
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,900
Don't forget,

331
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,150
Ah Shu is from Yanle.

332
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,300
Why don't we just verify Ah Shu directly?

333
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,520
In the name of Sifang Pavilion,

334
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,410
we can ask Ah Shu to remove her shoes and socks for inspection.

335
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,940
We'll check if there are any marks on her feet.

336
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,830
If we can confirm this way

337
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,090
that Ah Shu is indeed Princess Yanle,

338
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,540
that would be a great merit for you.

339
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,150
That may be true,

340
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,510
but we at Sifang Pavilion have no authority to forcibly examine someone's body.

341
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,920
Moreover, she's a woman.

342
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,170
If word got out, it would be highly improper.

343
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,470
Well,

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,550
what if we do it discreetly?

345
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,820
Ah Shu!

346
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,500
Ah Shu!

347
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,750
Ah Shu!

348
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,340
Look what I've brought you.

349
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,070
Bailong Stew, roasted lamb leg,

350
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,410
and cherry yogurt.

351
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,110
These are all my favorites.

352
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,590
I went to several places

353
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,190
to get all these things.

354
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,910
This cherry yogurt is from

355
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,570
the stall Duomi recommended.

356
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,510
Eat up.

357
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,710
Wait.

358
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,770
What else is there?

359
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,990
It smells so good.

360
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,970
Your nose is too sharp.

361
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,870
I was planning to give it to you after you finished eating.

362
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,810
This is for you.

363
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,850
It's beautiful.

364
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,950
Do you like it?

365
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,910
I do like it,

366
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,520
I'd like it even more if it were poisonous.

367
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,500
Shen recommended buying it.

368
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,680
It wasn't my idea to buy it there.

369
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,810
I'll put it in a vase.

370
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,310
Try this cherry yogurt quickly.

371
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,630
How is it?

372
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,530
Delicious.

373
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,480
You try some.

374
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,610
Really?

375
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,280
Remember to lock the doors and windows.

376
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,470
No matter what sound you hear,

377
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,510
don't open the door.

378
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,150
Okay?

379
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,910
Alright, I'm leaving then.

380
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,830
When we check the official documents tomorrow,

381
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,290
I'll come to see you again.

382
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,910
Wait a moment.

383
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,470
This window seems broken, take a look.

384
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,030
The window is broken?

385
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,780
It's fixed.

386
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,330
Okay, I'm leaving now.

387
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,230
Wait a moment.

388
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,110
That bed is not stable either.

389
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,430
It's fixed.

390
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,830
It's broken.

391
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,910
It's so late and your home is so far away.

392
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,380
It might rain soon.

393
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,030
It's fine.

394
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,180
Look, there's an umbrella over there.

395
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,780
Then I'm leaving.

396
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,230
Wait a moment.

397
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,760
Is there anything else broken?

398
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,550
Look.

399
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,310
How can I take a bath when it's broken like that?

400
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,580
It'll be fixed soon.

401
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,510
You can take a bath once it's fixed.

402
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,390
Is it fixed?

403
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,990
Al-Almost done.

404
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,730
The water is a bit cold.

405
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,090
Add some hot water.

406
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,420
O-Okay.

407
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,650
Add... Add hot water.

408
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,490
Not enough, add some more.

409
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,920
Not enough, add more.

410
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,090
♫Love is simply♫

411
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,950
♫A spark that kindles desire♫

412
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,750
♫After braving the longest night♫

413
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,560
♫I've learned what is the hardest to let go of in life♫

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,110

♫Shed the armor that shields me♫

421
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,630

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:05,530
♫I'd tell my secrets♫

423
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200

Young Master.

432
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,670
Did you hear the sound of water?

433
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,870
The sound of water?

434
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,390
No.

435
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,150
He probably won't come out today.

436
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,150
Why don't we leave first?

437
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,880
Let's wait a bit longer.

438
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,550
I don't believe

439
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,350
Yuan Mo is going to sleep here tonight.

440
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,890
Right, Susu.

441
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,280
Do you think I'm childish?

442
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,510
Childish?

443
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,810
How could the retainer of the East Court be childish?

444
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,340
I'm not talking about work.

445
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,230
I mean...

446
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,270
if I'm childish when it comes to love.

447
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,590
When it comes to love...

448
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,430
Maybe you're blind

449
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,670
or stupid.

450
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,850
Anyway, you're not very smart.

451
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm... just kidding.

452
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,300
Don't take it to heart.

453
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,880
It's not funny.

454
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,200
Just one piece?

455
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,170
You eat it then.

456
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,390
Let's split it. You take the bigger half.

457
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,640
You're awake.

458
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,890
What time is it?

459
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,240
It's not even 5 a.m.

460
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,720
Alright, get up.

461
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,990
Eat something, and then you should go take your shift.

462
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,670
Whoever wants

463
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,490
to take this shift today can have it.

464
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,260
They can kick me out if they're capable.

465
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,120
Right?

466
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,450
Then lie here a bit longer.

467
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,010
Just lying here...

468
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,910
is so boring.

469
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,240
Yuan Mo came out.

470
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,550
Well, well, Yuan Mo.

471
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,830
You really spent the night here.

472
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,960
You made me wait all night for nothing.

473
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,350
Young Master.

474
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,260
You haven't slept all night.

475
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,020
Why don't we do this another day?

476
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,610
No.

477
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,270
This is a rare opportunity.

478
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,400
After Yuan Mo leaves, it'll be easier.

479
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,160
Let's go.

480
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,050
This...

481
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,150
It's fine.

482
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,090
Yuan Mo must be on his way to take his shift.

483
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,570
They'll part ways soon.

484
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,270
Come on, let's follow them.

485
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,800
Let's look at that shop.

486
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,510
Take a look at my hairpins.

487
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,710
Which one do you like?

488
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,770
How about this one? Is it pretty?

489
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,070
You look beautiful no matter what you wear.

490
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,870
How much is it?

491
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,190
What time is it now?

492
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,500
Why hasn't Yuan Mo gone for his shift?

493
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:20,920
Let's go.

494
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,120
Come again next time.

495
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,380
Let's go. Follow them.

496
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,710
Let's look at that shop.

497
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,460
Remember to keep this arm straight.

498
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,910
Pull.

499
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,650
Pull towards your face.

500
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,510
It's better now, but still soft and weak.

501
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,140
Young Master.

502
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,800
Let's shoot arrows later too.

503
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,960
-Great!
-Great!

504
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,830
Great!

505
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,770
Ah Shu, look!

506
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,480
A shooting star!

507
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,840
It's so beautiful.

508
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,890
Young Master.

509
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,550
I don't think they have any intention of parting ways.

510
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,680
Should we continue?

511
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,260
We'll find another opportunity.

512
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,110
Another one!

513
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,530
Where?

514
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,620
There's more here.

515
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,560
[Sifang Pavilion]

516
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,400
Yuan Mo.

517
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,150
Retainer An.

518
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,410
What's wrong with you two?

519
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,960
You didn't sleep well last night?

520
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,910
Both of you didn't sleep well?

521
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,710
Let me ask you.

522
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,160
Why didn't you come to take your shift yesterday?

523
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,630
How do you know I didn't come to take my shift yesterday?

524
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,430
Of course I...

525
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,940
Don't tell me you two couldn't sleep

526
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,750
because I didn't come.

527
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,920
Don't change the topic.

528
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,190
An official absent for no reason

529
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,800
should get the punishment of 20 lashes.

530
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,570
Retainer An,

531
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,170
you're in charge of the East Court.

532
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,770
You have no say in the affairs of the West Court.

533
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,610
Besides,

534
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,310
you said I was absent without reason,

535
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,040
but you're about to go out without reason.

536
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,550
Stop twisting things around.

537
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,600
Young Master is going out for work.

538
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
If you

539
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,510
say so.

540
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,970
He's a retainer. He can do anything he wants.

541
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,940
But let me remind you both.

542
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,450
You have

543
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,880
very, very dark circles.

544
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,590
Your ophryons don't look good either.

545
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,250
Take good care of yourselves.

546
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,350
I...

547
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,320
You're the best!

548
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,150
I'll sneak into the room and hide.

549
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,350
After she comes back and gets sleepy, I'll check her ankles.

550
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,460
You stay here to cooperate with me.

551
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,520
Yes, Young Master.

552
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,890
I'm so stupid.

553
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,890
I forgot to bring money.

554
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,060
Poppet,

555
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,150
are you alright?

556
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,460
Why are you so naughty?

557
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,270
Are you feeling very bored too?

558
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,040
I'll come back to play with you after I

559
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,500
buy something delicious.

560
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,450
Young Master.

561
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,050
Hang in there, Young Master!

562
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,300
I thought of every possibility,

563
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,450
but I never expected Poppet to come out.

564
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,540
Hang in there, Young Master.

565
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,010
We're almost at the hospital!

566
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,940
Just hang in there a little longer!

567
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,590
Can you not hiss?

568
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,310
I just got bitten by a snake. I don't want to hear that sound.

569
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,230
Yes, doctor.

570
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,310
Can you hurry up?

571
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,110
If the venom spreads, it'll be harder to treat him.

572
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,070
What kind of snake bit him?

573
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,190
Does it matter?

574
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,910
Of course.

575
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,550
Some snakes are venomous,

576
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,430
but some are not.

577
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,640
And there are many types of venomous snakes.

578
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,240
The toxicity of each type...

579
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,710
Doctor, can you speak faster?

580
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,590
Is different.

581
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,170
A white snake, about this long.

582
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:30,970
Thin.

583
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,640
Very smooth and cold.

584
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,870
Don't hiss.

585
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,630
Okay.

586
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,680
That's all.

587
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,960
Your description is not helpful at all.

588
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,000
Judging from his wound, there can't be any delay.

589
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,690
Yes.

590
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,570
How about this?

591
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,070
Let me try some medicine first.

592
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,670
Okay.

593
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,390
Doctor.

594
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,070
Do it now.

595
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,910
Young Master, please wait a moment.

596
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,990
It won't take long.

597
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,390
It'll be done in a second.

598
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,190
This is my family's heirloom remedy.

599
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,870
-I'm going to apply it on him.
-Okay.

600
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,670
Wait a moment.

601
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,310
Does it hurt?

602
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,060
It doesn't hurt. I'll apply it slowly.

603
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,030
That's good.

604
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,870
Didn't you say you'd apply it slowly?

605
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,909
Why did you do it so fast?

606
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,550
I applied it very slowly.

607
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,159
You call that very slowly?

608
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,570
I feel much better now.

609
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,830
It doesn't hurt that much now.

610
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,469
You're fine now?

611
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,389
It doesn't hurt that much now.

612
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,420
It's good that you're fine.

613
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,980
Really.

614
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,270
Thank you, doctor.

615
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,030
It's good that it's effective.

616
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,949
I have to say, it's very effective.

617
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,080
Fortunately, we...

618
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,909
Young Master.

619
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,850
Your mouth...

620
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,110
Your eyes...

621
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,080
Young Master.

622
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,550
I... I...

623
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,679
Young Master, what's... what's wrong with you?

624
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,460
Why... Why did I suddenly become like this?

625
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,260
Young Master.

626
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,400
It's okay, Young Master.

627
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,000
It's okay.

628
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,889
What are you looking at? Don't look at him!

629
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,080
Stop looking at him!

630
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,389
It's okay.

631
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,190
-It's okay, Young Master.
-Retainer An.

632
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,750
You...

633
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,949
Didn't I remind you yesterday

634
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,400
to take good care of yourself?

635
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,280
How come you're like this today?

636
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,230
You even came to report for duty?

637
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,950
Listen to my advice, Retainer An.

638
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,840
There's no end to making money.

639
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,230
Why do you have to do this?

640
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,230
Don't end up losing your life for it.

641
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,910
It's none of your business.

642
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,310
What?

643
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm here.

644
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,510
Get lost!

645
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,940
Such a poor guy.

646
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,260
Get well soon.

647
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,950
You're the best!

648
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,110
No!

649
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,330
Get out!

650
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,310
Manager,

651
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,800
I can do any kind of work.

652
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,150
I can do laundry, sweep floors, and cook.

653
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,990
I'm very hardworking.

654
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,190
I said no.

655
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,310
I'm not short-handed.

656
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,720
Can't you understand me?

657
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,430
[Refugee from Yanle: Ah Shilan]

658
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,470
Leave.

659
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,840
Take a look at my fabric samples again.

660
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,830
They're very good.

661
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,990
I wove them myself.

662
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,660
No matter how good they are, I don't want them.

663
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,750
Changle City is a very big place.

664
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,830
I'm sure we have weavers as good as you here.

665
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,590
Go away.

666
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,850
You...

667
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,120
Thank you.

668
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,300
Ah Shilan?

669
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:25,950
Ah Shu?

670
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,630
Is it really you, Ah Shilan?

671
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,430
Ah Shu!

672
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,330
Ah Shu.

673
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,160
I didn't expect to meet you here.

674
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,880
I miss you so much.

675
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,220
I miss you too.

676
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,440
What are you doing here?

677
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,790
It's a long story.

678
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,430
How about this? Let's go somewhere else to catch up.

679
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,840
Okay.

680
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,540
Follow me.

681
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,080
Do you remember this?

682
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,320
Only you and I refused to play in the mud.

683
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,560
I remember.

684
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,880
And Chubby fell into the mud pit.

685
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,420
He was covered in mud.

686
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,810
Ah Shu.

687
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,790
Yuan Mo.

688
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,070
You're here.

689
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,430
I brought you something delicious.

690
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,260
Let me introduce her to you.

691
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,550
This is Ah Shilan.

692
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,520
I ran into her on the street.

693
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,710
Ah Shu, come with me.

694
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,070
Come.

695
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,790
Excuse me.

696
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,360
What's wrong?

697
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,950
Who is she?

698
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,120
Didn't I tell you

699
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,830
not to let anyone know you live here

700
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,070
or bring anyone here

701
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,110
at this point?

702
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,570
Do you know how dangerous this is for you?

703
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,830
She's not just anyone.

704
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,670
She's my sister.

705
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,590
What sister?

706
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,410
Since when do you have a sister?

707
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,730
I forgot to tell you.

708
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,710
She's my childhood friend.

709
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,950
We grew up together.

710
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,470
Anyway, you can't let anyone come here.

711
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,950
Man in White is looking for you everywhere.

712
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,630
You can't trust anyone now.

713
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,300
Understand?

714
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,970
Yuan Mo, you worry too much.

715
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,140
Look. She came from Yanle.

716
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,790
She might have been tricked

717
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,470
into approaching you.

718
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,470
How can I not worry?

719
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,130
She's not that kind of person.

720
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,830
If you don't believe me, go test her

721
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,560
and see if she's here to harm me.

722
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,940
Okay, I'll go test her.

723
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,750
Ah Shu, this is...

724
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,240
His name is Yuan Mo.

725
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,590
He's my lover.

726
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,790
Yuan.

727
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,230
Sit.

728
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,430
Ah Shi...

729
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,110
Ah Shilan.

730
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,830
Ah Shilan.

731
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,390
Ms. Ah Shilan.

732
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,010
You're from Yanle?

733
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,930
Yanle is roughly 500 km from Changle,

734
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,080
with a desert between them.

735
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,880
How did you come here alone?

736
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,310
I didn't come alone.

737
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,370
Yong and Yanle talked about barter before.

738
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,230
So the price of cloth became more flexible.

739
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,310
I know how to weave.

740
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,470
So I came with a caravan trading twilight muslin

741
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,580
to Yong.

742
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,830
I want to earn some money with my skills.

743
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,490
This is a piece of cloth I wove.

744
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,380
Not bad.

745
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,560
So from now on,

746
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,910
you plan to stay and work in Changle?

747
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,430
Then you'll need a travel pass stamped by the Sifang Pavilion.

748
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,070
I have one.

749
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,790
July 10 of the 22nd year.

750
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,740
You're going too far, Yuan Mo.

751
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,220
Ah Shilan is just like me.

752
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,930
She came from Yanle to Yong just to make a living.

753
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,040
Why are you behaving like this?

754
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,390
Sorry, Ms. Ah Shilan.

755
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,350
It was my occupational habit.

756
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,880
I didn't mean to offend you.

757
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,180
It's alright.

758
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,690
Enough.

759
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,190
We still have a lot of catching up to do.

760
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,190
You go back first.

761
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:53,850
Well...

762
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,960
Isn't there anything broken at home today?

763
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,080
Just go.

764
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,060
I remember...

765
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,430
Hurry up and leave.

766
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,390
That bathtub...

767
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:03,870
Just go back.

768
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,590
That... That bathtub has a leak, I think.

769
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,430
It...

770
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,930
He's always like that. Just ignore him.

771
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,730
Ah Shu,

772
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm really happy to see you again.

773
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,170
But is it inconvenient

774
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,560
for me to be here?

775
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,860
Maybe I should leave.

776
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,540
I told you to ignore him.

777
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,070
Rest assured and stay here. It's really fine.

778
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,550
We haven't seen each other for so many years.

779
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,390
I really have so much to tell you.

780
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,350
Shilan, just stay.

781
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,890
Stay and keep me company.

782
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,190
Okay, I'll stay then.

783
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,630
I'll go find a job tomorrow to earn some money

784
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,190
to share the rent with you.

785
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,670
No need for that. Just stay here.

786
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,320
Try this.

787
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,170
It's delicious.

788
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,590
I noticed Yuan

789
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,420
was well-dressed.

790
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,840
Is he an official?

791
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,100
You were a refugee from Yanle.

792
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,520
How did you two meet?

793
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,070
How did you end up together?

794
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,270
Him?

795
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,590
He works in the Sifang Pavilion.

796
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,630
He checks travel passes.

797
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,490
We met when he was checking travel passes.

798
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,290
One thing led to another, and we ended up together.

799
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,400
You know what, Shilan?

800
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,110
Now, refugees from other states in Yong

801
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,360
will be protected by Yong

802
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,580
as long as they have a temporary travel pass.

803
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,270
Really?

804
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,870
Yong is a great place.

805
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,050
I'll show you around another day.
