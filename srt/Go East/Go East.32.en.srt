[Episode 32]

3
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,550
Ah Fu

4
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,200
does the cleaning at the Sifang Pavilion

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
and sometimes delivers things.

6
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,050
He's completely inconspicuous.

7
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,820
If he wants,

8
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,090
he can sneak into anywhere.

9
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,910
Look.

10
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,150
These are documents signed by Ji.

11
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,630
There are a few maps

12
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,090
of the parade route on the Lantern Festival.

13
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,510
Could Ah Fu

14
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,390
be the Man in White?

15
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,390
What's this?

16
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,590
It looks like dye from the dyehouse.

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,940
Did you get it on your fingers when you were washing

18
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,870
Qing's mother's clothes just now?

19
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,790
-Blue dye.
-Blue dye.

20
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,850
Let's go.

21
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,410
We're too late.

22
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,350
Qing did all this.

23
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,500
He's not Qing.

24
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,910
The real Qing

25
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,710
got lost in the desert long ago and can't return.

26
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,310
This Qing is the Man in White.

27
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,940
Now that we know what the Man in White looks like,

28
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,990
let's hurry back to the Jingzhao Prefecture

29
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,090
and order a city-wide manhunt.

30
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,650
Let's go.

31
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,280
Be careful.

32
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,310
It's an ambush.

33
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,780
What should we do? Are you wearing soft armor?

34
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,860
I never wear it.

35
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,610
I'm uncomfortable wearing it.

36
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,890
I'm not wearing soft armor either.

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,040
If we risk our lives fighting our way out,

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,630
what are our chances of survival?

39
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,250
That depends on how good your martial arts skills are.

40
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,450
Perhaps you'll be the one who gets shot.

41
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,950
That's true.

42
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,030
While I'm here,

43
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,500
I won't let you get shot.

44
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,450
Get ready.

45
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,060
Three, two, one.

46
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,730
What if we die?

47
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,700
We won't.

48
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,960
Come on. Get ready.

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,830
Three, two, one.

50
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,580
Little Xiu.

51
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,550
I've been listening to your conversation for a while.

52
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,740
You were so tardy.

53
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,350
Well...

54
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,720
Magistrate Lin,

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
why are you...

56
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,470
Retainer An reported to the Jingzhao Prefecture

57
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,910
that Qing, the servant at the Sifang Pavilion, is the Man in White.

58
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,720
We rushed here

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,550
and happened to see the ambush,

60
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,840
so we took them down.

61
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,330
Weren't you always suspicious of Ji?

62
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,090
How did you know Qing was the Man in White then?

63
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,820
Didn't you tell me to calm down?

64
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,440
After I calmed down,

65
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,090
I went through the records again.

66
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,470
To imitate Ji's handwriting,

67
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,150
Qing gradually changed the way he wrote his own name,

68
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,990
adding a clear start and end point to the strokes.

69
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,790
But when he was first recruited by the Sifang Pavilion,

70
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,720
he didn't write his name like that.

71
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,659
Later, I asked other clerks,

72
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,510
and they said that on the day of the Lantern Festival,

73
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,270
Qing had helped Ji sell the maps of the parade route.

74
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,200
So, Susu actually wanted to tell me

75
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,110
that Qing is the Man in White.

76
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,220
Ji can finally clear his name.

77
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,700
You were right.

78
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,000
Colleagues at the Sifang Pavilion

79
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,980
are like family.

80
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,750
Susu said the same thing when she was alive.

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,280
I shouldn't have suspected my family member.

82
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,850
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,710
The Man in White has escaped.

84
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,030
I need to return to the Sifang Pavilion now

85
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,390
and tell Mr. Yu about this.

86
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,320
Magistrate Lin,

87
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,080
there are two bodies inside the room.

88
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,390
Please dispose of them.

89
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,900
Okay.

90
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,560
Yes.

91
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,710
I'm going back to the Jingzhao Prefecture.

92
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,960
I need to put up the wanted posters

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,860
for Qing and that woman as soon as possible

94
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,590
and launch a city-wide manhunt.

95
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,830
Bring them back for interrogation.

96
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,630
Yes.

97
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,270
Go.

98
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,240
Get up. Go.

99
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,020
Quickly. Go.

100
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,210
Let's go, too.

101
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,909
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,480
What?

103
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,900
Little Hua.

104
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,190
What are you up to now?

105
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
This is the last time I call you that.

106
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,240
Retainer Wang is a good man.

107
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,320
He will cherish you.

108
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,430
I shouldn't call you by your nickname

109
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,670
so freely anymore.

110
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,950
It's alright.

111
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,710
I don't mind.

112
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,120
He doesn't mind either.

113
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,950
In the past,

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,330
I didn't understand anything.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't understand your feelings,

116
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,980
nor did I understand my own feelings for you.

117
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,070
I wasted a lot of time

118
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,280
and missed out on someone I should have cherished.

119
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,150
Now,

120
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,630
I only hope you can be happy.

121
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
I wish you two a happy life together.

122
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,120
Little Xiu.

123
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,770
Thank you.

[Inebriation Restaurant]

125
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,360
Can you finish all the dishes you ordered?

126
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,590
We found the blood letter.

127
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,710
Can't I celebrate?

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,270
Yes, you can. But slow down.

129
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,920
I won't take your food away.

130
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,470
Hurry up and eat.

131
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,870
The dishes are really delicious.

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,400
I don't have time to eat now.

133
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,480
Are you sure these are the names

134
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,310
of the loyal officials of Yanle?

135
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,270
I've never met

136
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,830
these co-signers

137
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,250
or heard their names.

138
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,130
But after all these years,

139
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,510
they're still hoping

140
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,230
that I can return to Yanle

141
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,090
and overthrow Long Tuqi one day.

142
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,560
This blood letter

143
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,130
must be keeping Long Tuqi up at night.

144
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,680
He's ruled over the people of Yanle brutally for over a decade,

145
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,880
yet he still hasn't made them obedient.

146
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,750
People ingratiate themselves with him on the surface,

147
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,670
but in their hearts, they've long hated him.

148
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,800
That's why the Man in White appeared at Lins' Depository.

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,570
He's looking for this blood letter, too.

150
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,100
If he gets the blood letter,

151
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,860
Long Tuqi can catch

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,190
all the officials loyal to your father in one fell swoop,

153
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,050
eliminating any future threats.

154
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,990
Now that we have the blood letter,

155
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,430
Ah Shu,

156
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,630
we must be extremely careful.

157
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,650
Got it.

158
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,250
Yuan Mo.

159
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,440
We've never had a drink together

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,530
since I became the princess.

161
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,910
That's true.

162
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,210
Here.

163
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,450
This is to wish you a life free of worries

164
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,890
and full of happiness.

165
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,270
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

166
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,650
We must keep it safe.

167
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,790
We can't let it fall into the hands of the Man in White.

168
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,050
Let me get you a bowl of fish soup.

169
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,380
You haven't eaten much.

170
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,260
The fish soup is delicious.

171
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,570
The fish is tender and smooth.

172
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,000
It's absolutely a delicacy.

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Try it. Hurry up.

174
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,990
How hungry are you?

175
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,140
We're not in a hurry.

176
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,580
Eat it.

177
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,350
Okay. I'll eat it.

178
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,680
You haven't eaten much.

179
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,760
Did you eat well

180
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,030
when I was away?

181
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,150
When I was by myself,

182
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,360
I'd just grab a bite.

183
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,870
That's not okay.

184
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,470
Nothing is more important than eating.

185
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,290
Eating is no small thing.

186
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,470
Alright.

187
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,510
I swear.

188
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,150
I will eat well.

189
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,050
I won't make Ah Shu worry.

190
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,910
Okay?

191
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,790
You're just saying that.

192
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,250
I mean it!

193
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,590
It's delicious.

194
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,430
And it's a new dish.

195
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,910
I noticed it.

196
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,160
That's more like it.

197
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,990
It's a pity

198
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,750
that Duomi left early.

199
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,880
He missed out on these delicious food.

200
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,570
It's delicious.

201
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,690
I'm full. How about you?

202
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,280
I'm full, too.

203
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,580
Let's go back then.

204
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,710
We need to meet them.

205
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,790
Let's go.

206
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,560
You're a princess now, yet you're still so forgetful.

207
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,280
Wait for me.

208
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,310
Oh.

209
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,910
I just remembered

210
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,470
I have a new formula to give to Manager Qiu.

211
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,550
Wait for me here.

212
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,330
No need to come with me. I'll be out soon.

213
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,260
That's not okay.

214
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,720
What if there's danger?

215
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,830
There won't be.

216
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,310
Don't worry.

217
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,120
Why hasn't the princess come out yet?

218
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,940
[Moonlight Hall]

219
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,830
Yuan.

220
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,770
Where's Ah Shu?

221
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,100
Princess Longshuang?

222
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,500
I haven't seen her today.

223
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,240
The princess...

224
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,500
Where's the princess?

225
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,590
Did The Faceless abduct the princess?

226
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,550
Here.

227
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,370
This is to wish you a life free of worries

228
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,010
and full of happiness.

229
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,010
Don't worry.

230
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,550
The list.

231
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,040
It's about the list.

232
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,660
The list?

233
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,620
The Man in White wants the list.

234
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,480
Ah Shu went to see the Man in White.

235
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,970
She wants to avenge Deputy Envoy Kang.

236
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,960
You're quite brave.

237
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,340
You actually came out alone.

238
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,970
Take me to see the Man in White.

239
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,390
You want to see my master?

240
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,990
I want to make a deal with him.

241
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,510
What kind of deal?

242
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,500
Isn't he looking for the blood letter?

243
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,510
I can give it to him

244
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,710
as long as he agrees to my condition.

245
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,870
Can we go now?

246
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,220
If we don't go now, we won't be able to go.

247
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,630
If the princess went to see

248
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,150
the Man in White alone, as you said,

249
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,950
she wouldn't want us to find her.

250
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
What should we do?

251
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,110
What are you doing?

252
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,070
I'm from Yong's Sifang Pavilion.

253
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,060
I'm requisitioning your dog.

254
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,620
Wait.

255
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,700
What are you doing?

256
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,590
Thank you. Thank you.

257
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,440
Where are you going, baby?

258
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,150
Baby!

259
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,510
Go.

260
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,340
Go in.

261
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,540
My Lord.

262
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,280
Qing?

263
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,320
You didn't know I was the Man in White until now?

264
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,850
Princess Longshuang.

265
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,910
Did you deliberately dress up as a refugee

266
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,050
so we'd save you when we were at Green Wave Villa?

267
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,190
I like to sit in the front row when enjoying a show.

268
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,920
Besides, if I hadn't done that,

269
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,390
I couldn't have gained your trust.

270
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,030
I heard

271
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,290
you have something I want,

272
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,319
and you want to make a deal with me.

273
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,290
Where's the blood letter?

274
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
As long as you agree to my condition,

275
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,710
I'll give you the blood letter.

276
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,640
What's your condition?

277
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,700
Cooperate with me.

278
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,290
Cooperate?

279
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,910
Long Tuqi

280
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,910
is just a usurper.

281
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
I, Longshuang Yueshu,

282
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,110
am the only living member of the Yanle royal family.

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,520
I am the rightful ruler of Yanle.

284
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,410
You're a smart person.

285
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,360
You should know who to cooperate with to gain more.

286
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,110
That makes sense.

287
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,880
That makes sense.

288
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,890
But I don't trust you.

289
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,170
I know you're here to avenge Kang Yunhai.

290
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,230
Thanks, baby.

291
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,620
Go, baby. Go.

292
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,380
Baby.

293
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,710
Baby!

294
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,620
Yes,

295
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,760
I did think about killing you.

296
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,510
But what will happen if I kill you?

297
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,670
Long Tuqi will still be the ruler of Yanle.

298
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,580
The people will still be suffering.

299
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,910
I want to restore peace and order in Yanle.

300
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,890
This is far more important than avenging one person.

301
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,380
I didn't expect

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,200
you to have such a great ambition right after becoming the princess.

303
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,530
This is not my ambition.

304
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,020
This is my conscience.

305
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,970
I've seen too many people become homeless

306
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,940
and forced to leave their hometowns.

307
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,110
I've seen my loved ones

308
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,550
die one by one.

309
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,910
All of this is because of Long Tuqi.

310
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,860
You're nothing

311
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,960
but his henchman.

312
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,830
The most ridiculous thing

313
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,030
is you're the only one

314
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,040
who can help me achieve my goal.

315
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,790
If you take me back to Yanle,

316
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,770
help me get rid of Long Tuqi,

317
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
and help me become the queen,

318
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,830
I'll give you the blood letter.

319
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,200
You can control

320
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
those officials loyal to my father.

321
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,630
We'll stay out of each other's way.

322
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,320
This is the deal I want to make with you.

323
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,700
As for Uncle Kang,

324
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,770
I will grant him a posthumous honor

325
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,920
and make sure he's highly esteemed

326
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,570
to repay him for raising me over the years.

327
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,370
Longshuang Yueshu,

328
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,120
you truly are a member of the Longshuang family.

329
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,550
Okay. I agree to your condition.

330
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,350
But you must first give me the blood letter

331
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,610
as a show of good faith.

332
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,090
It's inside my dagger.

333
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,040
Inside the handle.

334
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,150
My Lord!

335
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,070
My master began learning to use poisons when he was a child.

336
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,530
He's long become immune to all poisons.

337
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,460
I advise you not to play any tricks.

338
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,760
I can't believe I was fooled by you.

339
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,230
You bitch.

340
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,720
Let her go!

341
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,070
Yuan Mo.

342
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,950
It's you.

343
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,670
Greetings, Mr. Yuan...

344
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,930
Don't come any closer.

345
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,130
If you come any closer, I'll burn the blood letter.

346
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,110
Give me the blood letter.

347
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,030
I'll give it to you

348
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,160
after you let her go.

349
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,350
Give it to me.

350
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,480
Let her go first!

351
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,190
I'll say it again.

352
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,760
Let her go.

353
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Ah Shu, come here.

354
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,240
Give me the blood letter.

355
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,980
Take it.

356
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,670
San Niang!

357
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,110
Let's go.

358
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,870
Run!

359
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,360
Run!

360
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,480
Ah Shu.

361
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,630
Ah Shu.

362
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,280
Ah Shu, are you alright?

363
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,190
I'm fine.

364
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,680
The blood letter was burned.

366
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,470
It's okay.

367
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,180
I've already memorized the content.

368
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,590
Your Highness.

369
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,050
Your Highness.

370
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,100
There's only one female corpse inside.

371
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,550
Her face is unrecognizable.

372
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,910
Only one female corpse?

373
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,170
Where's the Man in White?

374
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,940
There's a secret passage in the room,

375
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,840
but it was destroyed by the explosion.

376
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,790
He escaped again.

377
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,880
Have you seen this person?

378
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,600
No.

379
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,950
Look carefully. Have you seen this person?

380
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,880
No.

381
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,790
Chief Secretary Yuchi.

382
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,150
We've put up notices and bolstered guard

383
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,070
in Anle District, Sweet Spring Square,

384
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,200
and the main street.

385
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,550
Tell our men to guard all the city gates

386
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,550
closely.

387
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,180
Yes.

388
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,570
Chief Secretary Yuchi.

389
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,670
There's news from Yuan Mo

390
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,270
that they've already destroyed The Faceless's hideout.

391
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,340
But only that female criminal was killed in the explosion.

392
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,640
The Man in White escaped.

393
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,040
The Man in White escaped?

394
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,160
Tell the men of the West Court

395
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,670
to assist the soldiers of the Jingzhao Prefecture

396
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,450
in searching all the foreign merchants' shops.

397
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,020
Yes.

398
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,800
Let's go.

399
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,800
The bounty for capturing the assassin is 30,000 taels.

400
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,920
Who is she? I've never seen her.

401
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,720
There's another one over there.

402
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,640
Another one?

403
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,130
The world is in turmoil.

404
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,340
They both wear white clothes.

405
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,190
Mr. Xiang, how much is the bounty for capturing that man?

406
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,990
I don't know.

407
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,700
That's the Man in White.

408
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,030
I haven't seen them before.

409
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,360
This man and this woman.

410
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,890
That's right.

411
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,330
They should be caught.

412
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,790
Twenty-four years old.

413
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,640
About 88 inches tall.

414
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,580
Fair-skinned, black hair.

415
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,510
Uncle Kang.

416
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,950
I received the co-signed blood letter you left me.

417
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,940
I've memorized

418
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,170
all the names on it.

419
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,530
Unfortunately,

420
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,850
I failed to kill the Man in White to avenge you.

421
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,440
Now that the Man in White and The Faceless have left Changle,

422
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,550
they won't be a threat to me anymore.

423
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,730
You can rest in peace now.

424
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,280
Send Uncle Kang on his way.

425
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,590
Uncle Kang.

426
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,140
I'm a lonely person.

427
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,980
You gave me my first home in my memory.

428
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,770
When I was little,

429
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,880
my happiest moments

430
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,870
were when you visited me in Huangsha Village.

431
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,220
Now I've grown up

432
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,670
and become the princess,

433
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,760
but we can never see each other again.

434
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
I swear

435
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,970
I will take you home.

436
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm tired.

437
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,870
I want to go to bed early.

438
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,900
You don't need to keep me company.

439
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,740
Your Highness.

440
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,830
Yuan Mo...

441
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,430
has been waiting for you.

442
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,550
When did you get here?

443
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,420
I've been here for a while.

444
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,120
Do you need to talk to me?

445
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,480
Can't I come to see you without a reason?

446
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,550
That's not what I mean.

447
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,910
You wouldn't

448
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,620
ask this in the past.

449
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,390
What's wrong?

450
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,020
Is there something on your mind?

451
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,340
Yes.

452
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,350
It's been three days, Ah Shu.

453
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,760
When are you going to tell me

454
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,700
why you went to see the Man in White alone?

455
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,450
I...

456
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,550
That day, you ordered lots of dishes.

457
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,650
You were wolfing them down.

458
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,960
Did you think it was your last meal?

459
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,320
When you said those words when we were drinking,

460
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,980
were you saying goodbye to me?

461
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,160
If I hadn't found your handkerchief,

462
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,870
you would be dead now.

463
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,120
Do you know what that means?

464
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,680
Why?

465
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,070
What do you take me for?

466
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,860
You weren't like this before.

467
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm sorry, Yuan Mo.

468
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,670
I had no choice.

469
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,560
My loved ones died in front of me one by one.

470
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,610
When I had a chance to take revenge,

471
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,890
I couldn't miss it.

472
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,670
But I didn't want to get you in trouble.

473
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,910
Nor did I want to drag Wang

474
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,140
and Yuchi into this.

475
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,800
I couldn't make them take the risk with me.

476
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,070
I couldn't bear

477
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,640
to lose any one of you.

478
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,310
So, you wanted us to bear

479
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,570
the pain of losing you?

480
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,000
Have you ever thought

481
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,380
about how sad we'd be

482
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,950
if something had happened to you?

483
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,710
What would I do?

484
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,950
How would I face a life without you?

485
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,260
Yuan Mo.

486
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,800
Ever since you became Princess Yanle,

487
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,140
you've been reassuring me

488
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,020
that nothing would change.

489
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,440
I tried hard to believe you.

490
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,520
I tried hard to deceive myself.

491
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,020
But what happened then?

492
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,960
Reality kept reminding me

493
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,870
that everything had changed.

494
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,730
You've changed, too.

495
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,290
You're no longer the Ah Shu I used to know.

496
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,630
You are Princess Yanle.

497
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,330
You care

498
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,860
about your Uncle Kang,

499
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,520
Ah Shilan,

500
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,250
and all of your subjects.

501
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,790
There's just no room in your heart

502
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,460
for me, who only wishes you

503
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,380
safety and happiness.

504
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,100
That's not true, Yuan Mo.

505
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,210
You've always been in my heart.

506
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,460
I admit

507
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,050
I failed to keep my promise to you.

508
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,170
I've changed.

509
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,900
I've become burdened with worries.

510
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,730
I've become stubborn and willful.

511
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,390
That's because I have too many responsibilities,

512
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,870
and too many people have lost their lives because of me.

513
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,260
I've often wondered

514
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,860
if the villagers of Huangsha Village could have survived

515
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,900
had I not run away.

516
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,889
Had I admitted that I am the princess earlier,

517
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,670
Ah Shilan might not have killed herself,

518
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,199
and Uncle Kang might still be alive.

519
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,070
After all that has happened,

520
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,300
how could I still live a carefree life in Changle

521
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,130
like before?

522
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,949
So, you've made up your mind?

523
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,170
You were serious when you said

524
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,760
you'd take Uncle Kang home?

525
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
I see, Your Highness.

526
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,420
[Changle]

527
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,110
Urgent news from Yanle!

528
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,630
Urgent news from Yanle!

529
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,600
Make way!

530
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,250
Urgent news from Yanle!

531
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,320
There's urgent news from Yanle

532
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,900
that the puppet ruler installed by Long Tuqi died of illness.

533
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,280
All Yanle people are in mourning to show their grief.

534
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,320
Isn't this what Long Tuqi has wanted all along?

535
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,730
Perhaps this puppet ruler

536
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,090
was poisoned by him.

537
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,700
That's possible.

538
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,770
But it's no longer important.

539
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,220
What's important is that during the mourning period,

540
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,550
Long Tuqi announced to the people of Yanle

541
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,010
that he will bring Princess Longshuang back

542
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,440
to rule the state with him

543
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,800
for the state's future.

544
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,790
The official document demanding the return of Princess Longshuang from Yong

545
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,020
is already on its way.

546
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,080
We should firmly reject Long Tuqi's request,

547
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,000
expose his crimes of rebellion and usurpation,

548
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,450
and condemn his intention of using the royal family to elevate himself.

549
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,880
Meanwhile, we should warn the people of Yanle and the other states in the desert

550
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,080
not to be deceived by Long Tuqi's words.

551
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,450
Yuan Mo, what do you think?

552
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,350
Although I don't think

553
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,880
Retainer An should always put interests first,

554
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,410
on this particular matter,

555
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,550
on a political level and on a personal level,

556
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,210
I hope Princess Longshuang can stay in Changle.

557
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,110
But...

558
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,870
But what?

559
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,660
But I believe

560
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
as a powerful and prosperous state,

561
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,650
Yong should convince a foreign desert state

562
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
with righteousness.

563
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,960
We're protecting Princess Longshuang

564
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,510
from Long Tuqi's persecution.

565
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,390
This is a righteous act.

566
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,630
It is for Yong.

567
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,830
But for Yanle,

568
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,350
I'm afraid it's debatable.

569
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,360
Why?

570
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,540
Although Princess Longshuang's title was given by Yong,

571
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,310
she is the princess of Yanle after all.

572
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,850
The blood of the Yanle royal family runs in her veins.

573
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,470
Every citizen of Yanle is her subject.

574
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,430
But now, under Long Tuqi's rule, the people of Yanle

575
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,550
are suffering.

576
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,230
The princess loves her people.

577
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
What is righteous

578
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,540
to her?

579
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,410
What should she do

580
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,220
to be considered righteous

581
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,790
by the Yanle people?

582
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,020
I'm not wise enough.

583
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,050
I humbly request guidance from you, my superiors.

584
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,790
That makes sense.

585
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,320
According to what you said,

586
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,550
Princess Longshuang should neither stay

587
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,510
nor leave.

588
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,830
Perhaps we should listen

589
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,560
to what the princess has to say.

590
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,890
Princess Longshuang is here.

591
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

592
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,060
Please rise.

593
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,090
Your Highness,

594
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,150
please have a seat.

595
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,540
No, thanks.

596
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,230
Your Highness, did you come here

597
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,430
to discuss something important with us?

598
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,030
I've heard that Long Tuqi wants me back

599
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,990
to Yanle.

600
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,910
Vice Minister An, I'm here to tell you

601
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,630
that I'm willing to return to Yanle.

602
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,570
Your Highness, please think twice.

603
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,120
Long Tuqi has evil intentions.

604
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,780
He doesn't want to rule Yanle together with you.

605
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,950
Mr. Yu, no more words, please.

606
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,730
I've made up my mind.

607
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,820
It's going to be a long journey,

608
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,950
and there will be no turning back.

609
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,900
That's right.

610
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,600
I am a member of the Yanle royal family.

611
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,900
How can I live like a coward

612
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,890
for my own selfish reasons?

613
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,910
I chose this path.

614
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,420
I will never regret it.

615
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,150
Milk ice cream.

616
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,190
Fresh milk ice cream.

617
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,870
Come and take a look.

618
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,250
Milk ice cream.

619
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,540
Young Master.

620
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,350
I'd like a bowl of milk ice cream.

621
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,350
It's just enough.

622
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,010
Take care.

623
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,890
Milk ice cream.

624
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,040
Milk ice cream for sale.

625
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,310
Madam, would you like some milk ice cream?

626
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,310
Your Highness.

627
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:03,870
Here.

628
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,470
Thank you, Your Highness.

629
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,320
Here, take this.

630
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,380
Thank you.

631
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,420
Here.

632
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,890
Here. Go put it on.

633
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,550
-Thank you.
-Your Highness, this is heavier.

634
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,280
-Here. Go put it on.
-Thank you.

635
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,860
Go get some more.

636
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,770
Your Highness,

637
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,750
there's nothing left.

638
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,790
How's that possible?

639
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,770
There are so many people who haven't received anything.

640
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,000
There was enough for everyone.

641
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,660
However, the number of refugees

642
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,520
has somehow been increasing over the past few days.

643
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,860
It seems something did go wrong in Yanle.

644
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,680
Si Niang,

645
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,470
go make more clothes and quilts.

646
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,600
Yes, Your Highness.

647
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,380
Your Highness,

648
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,950
is there nothing left for us?

649
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,250
Didn't they say we could live a good life

650
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,560
after coming to Yong?

651
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,080
Right.

652
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,870
How can we survive the cold?

653
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,430
Your Highness, please save us!

654
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,150
Your Highness, you can't turn your back on us!

655
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,570
Your Highness, please save us!

656
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,100
Everyone, please stand up.

657
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,270
Don't worry.

658
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,750
I promise everyone will get clothes.

659
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,710
Go warm yourselves by the fire and get a bowl of porridge first.

660
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,850
Make sure you don't catch a cold.

661
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,810
New winter clothes and quilts will arrive soon.

662
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,380
Go.

663
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

664
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,050
Madam.

665
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,820
Here.

666
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,920
Thank you, Your Highness!

667
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:27,990
Please get up.

668
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,630
Madam,

669
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,190
what exactly happened in Yanle?

670
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,810
Why are there suddenly so many refugees?

671
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,030
In order to get more people on his side, Long Tuqi allowed

672
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,070
nobles and officials to plunder the people's money and food.

673
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,670
We poor people

674
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,030
could barely survive!

675
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,940
Go have a bowl of porridge to warm yourself up first.

676
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,050
Come. I'll take you there.

677
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

678
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,070
Come, madam.

679
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,430
Thank you, Your Highness.

680
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,910
Thank you, Your Highness.

681
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

682
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,200
Here.

683
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,620
Thank you, Your Highness.
