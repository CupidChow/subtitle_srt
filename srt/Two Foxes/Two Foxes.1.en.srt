1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,080
It's been a long time since the founder of Minglan Group was established. It's been a long time since then. It's been a while.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
founder Du Lan,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
Mr. Xie Haiming.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,640
and my daughter, Xie Xinni.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,840
insists on charity every year

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,880
and helped tens of thousands of special children.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,400
Recently,

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,120
the daughter of Minglan, Xie Xinni,

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,600
and the eldest son of Jin Group

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
of Jin's Group.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
It also signifies that Minglan and Jin Group

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,320
between Ming Lan and Jin’s two big groups.

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,600
will begin.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,680
My dad, Xie Haiming,

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,680
stepmother, Aunt Du Lan.

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,720
step-sister, Xie Xinni.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,960
Thank you for your ignorance.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
It's been eight years.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Do you remember

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,520
and me?

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,400
Do you remember what happened eight years ago?

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Heen's death...

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,880
Now I'm back.

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,800
You lied to me.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Take mine!

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,040
and destroy mine.

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
I'll make you pay back one by one.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,360
and see what you deserve.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
the punishment you deserve.

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,680
I'll start with you.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
Shaking.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,680
Hello.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
Please show us the VIP invitation.

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
No VIP invitation.

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,360
No entry.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,880
I thought you were my friend.

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Please come in.

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Mr. Jin.

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,920
It’s OK.

41
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,720
Come in.

42
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,160
Miss Fox.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,400
asked someone to help her enter the inner field.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,400
Shouldn't you say thank you?

45
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,680
Thank you.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,079
Mr Fox.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Mr. Jin.

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,040
Do you

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,920
have a girlfriend tonight?

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,280
Then...

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
I have the honor.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,560
I'm late.

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
What is this?

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,200
Uncle.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
Block the talisman.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,000
Congratulations on your engagement.

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,760
Xinni.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,680
This red dress really suits you.

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,920
Congratulations on your engagement with Mr. Jin.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Thank you.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
Your dress is limited-edition, right?

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
Thank you.

63
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,560
So pretty.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,440
There are only two in the world.

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,040
Is that your fiancé, Mr. Jin?

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,480
When is the wedding?

67
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,600
Mr. Jin.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,280
Try this wine.

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,320
It's newly launched in our chateau.

70
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,360
Really?

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
The last batch was not bad.

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,200
Congratulations on your engagement.

73
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,079
Let me introduce.

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,079
This is

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,960
is my fiancee.

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,800
Shaking.

77
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,159
Sorry.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
I mistook you for someone else.

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,040
Lei,

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,440
Who is Mr. Jin’s fiancée?

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,159
Why are you wearing the same dress?

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,880
How can you wear the same dress?

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,560
He's wearing a shirt.

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
So awkward.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
Who do you think looks better?

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,120
We killed them.

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Where is the evidence?

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
A illegitimate child

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
to accept condolences

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
in the name of Xie family.

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,320
Heen.

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
What a joke.

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Minglan's daughter

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
is quite grumpy.

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
It seems that Minglan's daughter

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,200
is really angry.

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Miss Xie.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,320
Xinni.

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
This is a misunderstanding.

101
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,040
I got the wrong person.

102
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Shaking.

103
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,080
This is just the beginning.

104
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
Miss,

106
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
Your face...

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,600
I apologize to you for my fiancee.

108
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,360
If you really feel sorry,

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
give me a chance.

110
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
I was ambitious

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
to get close to you.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
Don’t get me wrong, Mr. Jin.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
I’m here to talk about cooperation with you.

114
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,080
My project

115
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,400
to Minglan.

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
I happen to be Zhao Sheng from Minglan Group's subsidiary.

117
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,320
However,

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
I’ll go to Jin’s Group tomorrow.

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,480
to talk about cooperation with you.

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Sorry.

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,320
This is my name card.

122
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
I don't know your name yet.

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,159
When we meet tomorrow,

124
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
when we meet tomorrow.

125
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,720
Heen.

126
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,200
Today is your death anniversary.

127
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm here to see you.

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,560
Sister

129
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,640
Catch me.

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Sister

131
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
Sister.

132
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm here.

133
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
Sister

134
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,960
Happy every day.

135
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,280
Heen.

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,480
Made baby Chu.

137
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,680
Why did you buy me a gift on your birthday?

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,000
They gave me a lot of pocket money.

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Use this computer first.

140
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,760
Sister.

141
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,640
graduate early.

142
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,760
The Xie family treats me well.

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Aunt Du even held a birthday party for me.

144
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,560
Okay.

145
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,840
Happy birthday.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,120
I have no money.

147
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,360
Wang Simyeon.

148
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
Your brother is dying.

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
Not many people came today.

150
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,600
Stop counting.

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,720
Why are you in such a hurry?

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,280
Why can't you wait for me?

153
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
and cremate Heen?

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,560
Can't you wait for a day?

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
Heen is a good swimmer.

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840
He can't be drowned.

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
There must be something wrong.

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,040
An illegitimate child?

159
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,200
Why are you here?

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,800
Who told you to hold a funeral?

161
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
It's a deal.

162
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
I'll take the money.

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,040
Why don't you keep your word?

164
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I have a bad memory.

165
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,080
I have a headache.

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,440
Mom.

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,120
My head hurts.

168
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,640
Did you kill Heen?

169
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:34,960
Smash it.

170
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,919
Don't smash it.

171
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Don't smash it.

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,679
Don't smash it.

173
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,320
Smash it!

174
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,799
You killed Heen.

175
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,960
Can't you just let him go quietly?

176
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,440
We killed him.

177
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360
Where is the evidence?

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Stop!

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,560
Stop it!

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
Your brother

181
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,960
is an illegitimate child.

182
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
People like you

183
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
deserve a funeral.

184
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,680
Got it?

185
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,240
Don't smash it.

186
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Stop!

187
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Xuan!

188
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,720
Heen.

189
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
He's an illegitimate child.

190
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,720
to receive condolences in the name of the Xie family?

191
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,280
What a joke.

192
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
Heen!

193
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,560
Heen!

194
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,640
Heen.

195
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,840
Xie Haiming.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,240
Du Lan.

197
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Shaking.

198
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,720
When a beam of light shines into the darkness,

199
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,520
this beam of light

200
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
is guilty.

201
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
This is...

202
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
Rescue ship.

203
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,560
Yes.

204
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,000
The boat is in this state.

205
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
You still have the mood to go to the party to find a rich woman?

206
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,920
Who?

207
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,400
You?

208
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,840
No.

209
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,640
How can you bring people back to the rescue ship?

210
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
It's not romantic at all.

211
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,480
Romantic?

212
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,320
Miss.

213
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,280
I went to the party

214
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,400
to talk business.

215
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,520
to get sponsorship.

216
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,080
Besides,

217
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,400
do you need romance?

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,080

219
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
a big fish

220
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
called Jin Yetlei?

221
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,000
What?

222
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,440
Did I get your big fish?

223
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,440
So this is what you like.

224
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Let me remind you.

225
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,520
Jin Ye Lei has a fiancee.

226
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
He keeps his promise.

227
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,680
He won't fall for

228
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,760
by you.

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,960
Give up.

230
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
Thank you for reminding me.

231
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,080
But even if Jin is your financial father,

232
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
you care too much.

233
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,880
I came to Mr. Jin

234
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,320
to talk about business.

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,640
Just a business?

236
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,760
Of course.

237
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,120
Better.

238
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,920
I'll give you one day.

239
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,240
I don't want to see

240
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
any news

241
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,720
that bitch bumped into me.

242
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,160
And...

243
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,920
Did you find that bitch?

244
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,000
Did you go back to Jinzhou?

245
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
Why didn't you come to me?

246
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,400
the future boss?

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,960
Excuse me.

248
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,680
Uncle.

249
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,280
I have something personal to do.

250
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,280
I'll call you after I'm done.

251
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,520
Thank you, Hae-myung.

252
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,320
